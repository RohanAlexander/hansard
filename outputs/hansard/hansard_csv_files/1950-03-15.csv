There are actually two governments, one being on the continent of Asia and the other, the Nationalist Government, being still in control on Formosa. Having regard to the confused position caused by the recognition of the Chinese Communist Govern-' ment by some governments, and the differing attitudes of the TJnited Kingdom Government and the TJnited States of America, has the Minister or the Australian Government reached any conclusion on policy or action relative to the recognition or the continued recognition of either or both of those governments? which may arise in the United Nations as the result of some governments recognizing the People's Government, so called, in China, and other governments withholding their recognition is due to the fact that each nation must determine its own attitude towards the present people in charge, de facto, of China. The Australian Government sees no reason at present to recognize Communist China, and that is all I need say at the moment about the matter. ous effect that the shortage of bricks is having on all building operations, can the Minister for Works and Housing inform",9,Setup

I shall obtain what information I can on tbe matter and pass it on to the honourable member. Health whether reports purporting to give the outlines of the proposed national health and medical scheme, which have been publisbed in the press in recent weeks, were correct. Has tbe British Medical Association agreed to accept the scheme as outlined in the newspapers, and, if so, has it agreed to the provision of penicillin and sulpha drugs to the general public under the scheme ? given in tbe press statements were completely incorrect. Therefore, there is no need for me to answer the other question, which obviously does not apply. COAL. the fact that a conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers agreed, on the 19th August, 1947, that Victoria should receive 14.2S per cent, of the coal output of New South ""Wales, whereas it received only 12.29 per cent, and 11.14 per cent, in 194S and 1949 respectively, and in view of the fact that the amount of unemployment relief paid in Victoria during the coal strike was negligible, partly because the Government of Victoria imported coal from overseas, will the Prime Minister give consideration to subsidizing that Government to the amount of the difference between the price of imported coal and the price of New South Wales coal iu respect of the deficiency of supplies from New South Wales that I have mentioned? The amount of coal involved would be approximately 500,000 tons. tioned by the honourable member, and also otber problems concerning local coal production and tbe importation of coal, have been receiving the very close attention of the Minister for Shipping and Fuel. I shall have a talk with him about the proposal that the honourable member has made. Labour and National Service say whether the Government proposes to import 500,000 tons of coal at a cost of approximately £5 15s. a ton, which is more than £2 a ton higher than the cost of locally I ask the Minister for produced coal, and is also inferior in quality? Is it a fact that the New South Wales coal-miners are capable of producing sufficient coal to meet the needs of Australia if modern methods of production were applied, and a proper understanding arrived at between the management and the men? Is it also a fact that, in the past, large stocks of coal have been accumulated only for the purpose of trying to undermine the conditions of the miners; and that this has aroused suspicion which is still in the minds of the miners, and is responsible for a great deal of discontent? Will the Minister call a conference of representatives of the miners, together with honourable members of this House who represent coal-miners and who have . a knowledge of the industry, with a view to bringing about a better understanding and to removing -the suspicion that at present exists, as well as to save the taxpayer's money that it is proposed to expend on the importation of inferior coal? statement made by the Prime Minister last night was that tbe Government had decided to import 1,000,000 tons of coal, not 500,000 tons a9 the honourable member said.

Tbe answer to the second question is that there was a committee, but I do not know the precise remuneration of the members of it. I shall have information prepared on that matter ttlso.

I shall give consideration to the request of the honourable member but I can hold out very little hope of being able to accede to his request. the Minister for Works and Housing is prompted by the fact that under the Commonwealth and State Housing Agreements, the majority of houses have been built in areas where light industries are operating, and that this has enabled those industries to compete unfairly for the labour force and has reduced the numbers of employees, available for the heavy industries. In addition to making prefabricated houses available to areas in which the heavy industries are located, will the right honourable gentleman discuss with the State authorities the importance of building a greater number of bouses near the heavy industry areas in order to ensure the stability of workers in those areas to give them the high living conditions that they like, and to attract them important national basic industries'? in general are fully .aware of the necessity for attracting workers towards the heavy industries, and to deflect a considerable proportion of their housing towards basic industries. Tbe Commonwealth and State Housing Agreements give to the Commonwealth a certain degree of say-so in the allocation of -housing as between rural and city areas. Tbe Commonwealth is fully aware of the problem, and the War Service Homes administration is very properly being used to construct houses in advance of demand in the vicinity of basic industry areas.

Has the Australian Agricultural Council yet made a recommendation to the Government on that matter? not aware of tbe correspondence that the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture oinay have had on the matter to which the honourable member has referred, and what is in his mind in regard to policy, but I shall convey the honourable gentleman's questions to him. I agree that the absence of my colleague is regrettable, but I am bound to say that he is absent more or less on my own instructions, because his health has been a little below par and I thought that he needed a few days away from his office. Supply and Development indicate at this stage whether tbe recently announced Clarence River dam scheme will in any way affect possible Commonwealth assistance for the Burdekin dam scheme in Queensland ? is under a slight misapprehension, possibly because the press has implied that the Clarence Eiver valley project has already been approved. That report is a little premature, because the matter is still under the consideration of the New South Wales Government. WhatI ventured to say was that if and when the Government of that State approached the Commonthe Treasurer follows one wbich I wealth in the matter, I was sure that tbe I express regret that project would receive the most sympathetic consideration. I do not believe that the two projects, if and when they are decided upon, and the Commonwealth plays its part in their implementation, will compete with each other, although it is possible that the production of cement in Australia may have to be enlarged in order to cope witb those two and other large projects of the same kind that will undoubtedly mature in the next few years. question to the Minister for Supply and Development. As consideration has been given to tbe subsidizing of various State developmental schemes, such as the Clarence Biver scheme in New South Wales and the Burdekin VaUey scheme in QueenslandI have no criticism to offer to those schemes, which, I hope, will reach fruition at the earliest possible moment:-wil l the Government consider the granting of similar subsidies to other States whicb are at present financing developmental schemes out of the meagre resources which they obtain from the Australian Government? that the word "" subsidy "" is scarcely the right word to use in this connotation. Great national developmental schemes which are devised in the various States are made the subject of discussions and negotiations and, in most instances, they eventually become the subject of agreements between the Commonwealth and the State concerned. Such"" agreements relate largely to the allocation of the cost as between tbe CommonAvealth and the State. I have no doubt that if the Government of Victoria, whicb, I believe, is the Government that the honourable member has in mind, made an approach to the Australian Government in respect of any great developmental public work which it has under consideration, the matter would receive consideration equal to that which has been given to similar public works that have been submitted to the Commonwealth by other States.",20,Government Publications

I regard it as one of the finest guards I have ever seen either here or overseas. I recall that a similar request was made to tihe former Minister for the Army, and if my memory serves rae aright, the Minister undertook to -accede to it. I s'hall -ascertain what has been done in regard to the matter, and see whether it is possible to accede to the honourable member's request. ter agree with the evidence given by Professor Wood, Professor of Commerce at the University of Melbourne who, in opposing in increase of the basic wage at the basic wage inquiry, said that he did so on ihe ground that such an increase would add further to the existing inflationary trend? If the right honourable gentleman believes in the accuracy of that statement, does he not agree also that increased profits would have the same effect? If he agrees with that contention, what action does the Government propose to take to halt the inflationary trend by limiting profits? argumentative question. I have not read the evidence given'by the witness to whom fhe honourable member has referred. If I had done so, I should consider .it no part of my function to comment from, my place in the Parliament upon evidence given before a court. Debate resumed from the 14th March exist in Australia to a degree never known (vide page 718), on motion by Mr in this country before, yet we hear conThat the following Address-in-Reply to the Speech of His -Excellency tlie Governor General money in tbe purse to-day than ever bn agreed to : M ATJT PLEASE Youu EXCEIXENCY : -We, 'the House -of Representatives of the to learn that our true, economic Btrength Commonwealth of Australia, i u Parliament cannot be measured by the amount of our assembled, desire to express our loyalty to our pay and savings and profits, nor by full Most Gracious Sovereign, and to thank Your employment, but by the volume and effiExcellency for 'the Speech -which you have been pleased to address to 'Parliament. In this advanced stage of the debate on the motion for the adoption of the Address-in-Beply there remains little or. no new ground for me 'to cover. However, I should like to say something on the subject of increased production because I believe it can play a most important part in tbe solution of the great problems facing this country to-day. If we can increase production we can overcome many of the ills t'hat beset -us. WhatI have to say will not be entirely news to honourable members. Indeed, 'the leaders of tbe 'Labour party in England have been saying it 'for the last four or five years. They have been telling the people of England 'for a considerable period of 'the urgent necessity for increased production. Posters and placards throughout the country side are exhorting -the English people to greater efforts. "" We must produce or perish "" is the slogan in England to-day. This country would be in a position similar to that .of England were it not for the fact that it is receiving a tremendous income from the sale overseas of some of its primary products. Eor our major exports we are receiving fantastic prices. The real crux of this problem is increased production. A country whose economy is based upon greatly increased income from the sale of the same amount of goods instead of from the production and sale of more goods is enjoying a very precarious prosperity. Such a.state of affairs places the economy .of this -country in a very dangerous position. The old concept of prosperity was that it was a condition in which there was Tittle or no .unemployment; in whicb pay envelopes were full:; in which savings were were high. These are all conditions -which stantly the complaint, particularly from housewives, that although there is more bef ore, it is becoming increasingly difficult to make it cover expenses.

75,Mr Timson (Higinbotham) [3.20],"On comparing pTesent Tates ;of production in our -main basic industries witb pre-war .production in 'those industries *we -may not -feel very proud. The honourable member .ior Bendigo( Mr Canada steel production has increased by Clarey) to whose impressive speech I listened with respect and interest, dweit at some length on the subject of increased production but I cannot help feeling that his figures would have given a very fallacious idea to many of the .people who heard them,, although he did give the limitations of the bases of the figures. .The test of prosperity is not w;hether there has been an increase in our overall production but whether there has been the increase tbere could and should have been, having in mind the fact that there are more people in Australia to employ and having in mind the tremendously increased demand both -at home and overseas. Many speakers during this debate have 'stressed the very urgent necessity to increase the output of coal. Coal mining is a fundamental and basic industry upon which the progress of our major industrial effort depends. If we are short of coal the whole economy of this country suffers acutely as a result. To produce the same amount as was produced last year or the year before or the year before that is not enough. Since 1946 our annual coal production has remained consistently at approximately 11,500,000 tons. Last year this figure fell to approximately 10,750,000 tons, due to the big strike on our coal-fields. Tbe Joint Coal Board estimated Australia's coal requirements for 1949 at about 14,750,000 tons so .production fell short of requirements by approximately 4,000,000 tons. The Joint 'Coal Board has estimated our requirements for this year as being in excess of 15,750,000 tons and in view of the fact that our coal industry has got away to a bad start this year, I feel that by the end of the year we shall be further from our goal than ever. It is not sufficient for production to show a small increase or to be satisfactorily maintained. Tbe steel industry was lagging in production immediately after the war, mainly due to the shortage of coal but in tbe past two years steel production has been about 12 per cent, greater than the pre-war production. Some of us may feel we could well be satisfied with that increase but when -we compare it with the efforts of other countries it falls into insignificance. In 120 per cent, on pre-war figures although, of course, Canada has employed a great deal more hydro-electric power and has relied to a great extent on the importation of tremendous quantities of coal. However, that does:not;alter the fact that it has achieved an increase of 120 per cent, above pre-war figures. In America, steel production has increased by S3 per cent, on pre-war figures. Many ""honourable members -who have spoken before me bave clearly pointed out that production 'in all our main primary industries, with the possible exception of .the wheat industry wbich is dependent upon seasonal conditions, has been lower than .or about the same as pre-iwar production. In many other industries production .has not shown the advancement it could or should have shown. ""We must increase production now, otherwise our costs will mount to a point where w.e shall be no longer able to compete on overseas markets. Prices in the TJnited Kingdom, the United States and Canada ha-ve .levelled out. They are becoming quite rstabilized, and, in many instances, have fallen. Only a sharp drop of overseas .prices will be required to make it quite impossible for us to compete in overseas markets. There should be no need for me to explain to this House how drastic the effect of that would be upon the economy of Australia. I cannot fail to reflect upon the wonderfully solid and sound economic position that Australia would occupy to-day if we had settled down immediately aftei' the war and had tackled the problem of increasing -production with the zeal that we-should have shown. In the years immediately after tlie war, Australia had the most desirable markets almost entirely .at its mercy, but unfortunately -we -did not take advantage of that opportunity and we are now excluded from tliose markets because other nations, which can most successfully compete with us, have stolen them from us. I could talk at great length about the reasons why we lost certain markets very close to our sbores which we should hold to-day. But, of course, that would be speaking of the past, and nothing could be gained by doing so. Our task is to increase production now so that we may take advantage of tbe wonderful conditions and opportunities that are fast slipping away from us. What is tbe solution of the problem of increasing production? In dealing with that question, I strongly support those bonorable members on both sides of the House who have advocated the establishment of a better relationship and understanding between employer and employee. AlsoI strongly deprecate the vitriolic statements that were made by some members of the Opposition, whicli, I consider, were calculated to strengthen the attitude of bitterness that many workers to-clay hold towards their employers. Such statements serve to perpetuate that most undesirable feeling of class hatred and are, I am sure, aimed at creating as wide a barrier as possible between the -worker and his employer. I am only too well aware that many faults and failings lie with a great number of employers. Prom my own personal experience in industry and commerce, I know that many employers managerial staffs are untrained in man management, to use an army expression. They are not suitable as leaders in industry. I know a great many who are completely inefficient in their executive positions. Minister( Mr Menzies) had that situation in mind when be referred in his policy of institutions such as the Institute of Industrial Management. Many employers to-day have no difficulty whatever in disand costs. By stabilizing prices, it would posing of the goods they produce, but are not disposed to increase production, as they could well do, because of certain taxation anomalies and other discouragements. It is true also that many workers believe, that the supply of goods may overover a long period of years, very often at take the demand if they devote more effort to their work, in which case they will have worked themselves out of their jobs. Tliey are also suspicious of incentive payment schemes. Many of them have had unpleasant experiences of incentive payments in the past. As production increased, the scale of incentives was whittled down by the employers and that, Mr Timson. in good round industrial language, is called sweating. However, in answer to that I point out that to-day, as never before, the worker is protected by a minimum basic wage and, of course, the 40hour week. * I am extremely confident that, if we really settle down to the task of increasing production, Australia will have a magnificent future. There should be no unemployment as far into the future as we can foresee. I am convinced that, with the getting together of the employer and the employee, a basis of incentive payments satisfactory to all could be devised, with very great advantage to most of our industries, or at any rate to a great many industries. I am not so much of an idealist as to be unable to realize the cold, hard facts that the employer is eager to produce his goods at the lowest possible price commensurate with maintaining competitive quality, and that the worker is anxious to sell his services at the highest possible price, while at. the same time assuring himself of continuity of employment; However, I am convinced that only by fostering mutual understanding and a much closer and and members of happier relationship, so that each party will appreciate the problems of tbe other and the difficulties that must be overcome, can we achieve anything approaching harmony in industry. Let us consider briefly what increased I am sure that the Prime production would help us to do. I have jotted down my thoughts on this subject as they have occurred to me. speech to the promotion Increased production would provide people with more homes in which to live. It would check the rising spiral of prices protect our savings, which have progressively become worth less and less in terms of purchasing power. On this subject, I have in mind the great number of Australians who bave accumulated savings the cost of personal hardship. Those savings have been made by means of savings bank deposits, through insurance, by contributions to staff provident funds and by other thrifty means. It is not very comforting for the thrifty people who bave made these savings to realize that their savings are now worth only about one-half of the value that they envisaged when they made their first contributions. Increased production also would enable us to compete with an increasing quantity of goods on overseas markets. It would contribute immeasurably to tbe overcoming of the serious inflation that bas been brought about by the fact that there :.=. in circulation more money than can be exhausted in the purchase of the inadequate supply of goods that is available. .Increased production would also create a truer aud more stable condition of prosperity than that which we know to-day. Indeed, it would be the greatest possible contribution towards putting value back into the f l . Real prosperity, which consists in a high standard, of living for tbe people, is completely dependent upon the willingness of the people to produce goods and services. This Government cannot produce goods and services, but it can lead, encourage and inspire the people to clo so, and I sincerely trust that it will fulfil that responsibility. [3.38J -On this important occasion I take the opportunity as a new member of the Parliament to congratulate Mr which is holding up the preliminary Speaker on behalf of the electors of the Northern Territory upon his elevation to liis high office. My constituents have reason to congratulate him because they remember the services that he rendered to the Northern Territory as tlieir unofficial representative in this House a few years ago. In discussing the Governor General's Speech, I shall confine my remarks to that portion of it which had a direct Insuring upon the affairs of the Northern Territory. I refer to the following paragraph in the Speech:A vigorous policy designed to develop the resources of the Northern Territory will bt put into operation. Particular attention will lie given to transport, pastoral development for increased meat production, mining' ancl possible agricultural settlement. Basic research into land, water, mineral, marina and timber resources will be continued. The Darwin town plan will be reviewed in the interests of greater efiiciency and economy. The terms used there are general, and as with other matters dealt with in His Excellency's .Speecli, there is no indication of how the desired state of affairs mentioned is to be brought about. I shall refer to each of those matters in order. I know that a programme of road construction was drawn up by the Ohifley Government, and in the absence of a statement to the contrary, I take it that this Government will continue along the lines laid down at that time. . Apart from two bitumen highways, which were built during the war for military purposes, there are no all-weather roads iu the Northern Territory. Without such roads no heavy transport can be used. Unless lieavy transport vehicles, which can operate the year round, are used, very little development of the Nortliern Territory is possible. In the absence of railways, roads will have to carry all current production including beef on the hoof. They will also be used for the movement of store cattle during unfavorable seasons and for the carriage of basic materials for present and future needs. I ask the Government, to speed up the road building in the Nortliern Territory. Thousands of square miles of the territory are suitable for pastoral purposes, but at the moment that land is not available for settlement. We are told that there is a scarcity of surveyors work for the opening up of such land. The reason for that scarcity is that .the Public Service .Board, or some such body, refuses to make conditions of employment sufficiently attractive to entice surveyors into the service. In the interests of the Northern Territory some of the big holdings should be cut up. This would allow suitable settlers, by whom I mean resident lessees, to get on with the job of putting the land to its best possible use. I therefore ask the Government to alter the tenure of land in the territory from a short-term tenure to perpetual lease. Banks will not advance money to-day against leasehold property in tbe territory for improvements or the purchase of stock. If the Government made the .tenure of land perpetual lease, I think that tlie banks would then advance money. Tbe Commonwealth Bank could well help to finance the development of the territory. Mining has never before in the history of the territory had such a bright future. The value of the gold produced at Tennant Creek this year may exceed",23,Otpekman
76,Mr Nelson (Northern Territory),"£50.0,000. Gold-fields such as that contribute greatly to the wealth of this country, and every encouragement should be given .to prospectors to search for new fields. It is still the prospector who finds supporting extensive settlements along new mines although mining' companies very often take over from him and reap the benefit of his work. Mica mining is potentially the most important industry in the territory. At present the mica mines of the Northern Territory supply 99 per cent, of tbe Australian domestic requirements, and possibilities exist for the extension of those mining activities so that markets may be opened up in the United States. As well as developing the Northern Territory the encouragement of such mining would earn valuable dollars for Australia. The mica field in the territory is recognized as being the largest in the world'. The difiiculties associated with its development are of a technical nature and if the Government put the best brains available to work solving its problems that mica field would contribute greatly to the wealth of Australia as well as to that of the territory. Basic research into land, water, ties. The people of that town are mineral, marine and timber resourcesis entitled to the ordinary amenities of life, also mentioned in His Excellency's of which a proper water supply is one. Speech. Where research is mentioned I hope that the Government has in mind an extension in the territory of tbe actisaid that the Government would review vities of the Commonwealth Scientific and the Darwin plan. When it does so, it Industrial Besearch Organization. It is should restore to the people of Darwin only through research that pastures can the area that was resumedsome time be improved and agricultural development ago by the naval authorities .

The area could be tions, but owing to' tbe lack of roadsand made one of the beauty spots of Darwin. services they are lying practically idle. I ask that a better shippping servioe With financial and technical assistance, be provided to Darwin. An improved and with the construction of roads, service from southern ports would have those areas can be made to produce a the effect of reducing the cost of living variety of valuable goods. Lack of water isa retarding influence provide better facilities to primary proon development, not only in the territory, ducers to send tlieir produce to the but also in the wbole of Australia. That southern, markets. is one of the first matters to whicb tbe Government should direct its attention. Very little further extension of the pasare of vital importance to the people of toral industry can take place in the the territory, but. it would be of little NorthernTerritory unless more water use to attempt asolution of the various Mr Nelson. is made available, from wellsj. bores, tanks and. dams. We have the Katherine, Daly, Victoria, and other rivers in. tlie territory which are all capable of their banks; but thought must be given to the development of our water resources to their greatest extent before such settlements will be possible. It may be that hydro schemes or straight out irrigation schemes are desirable. To illustratethe effeGt of the lack of water., I instance Tennant Creek. The population of Tennant Creek, is about S00, and all drinking water has to be carted a distance of 6 miles. The water costs l is . a. 100 gallons, and until, recently the price was double that amount. Honourable members can readily understand how such a state of affairs tends to retard the development of the town. Those are the conditions that, prevail in an area where it. is expected more than £50.0,000 worth of gold will be produced this year. I ask the Government, when it is considering the provision of water services in the Northern Territory, to place Tennant Creek high on the list of prioriI n his Speech, the Governor General and also the cost of building in Darwin, which are at present very high. It would The matters which I have mentioned problems until the administration is .brought up to date. It is impossible to -construct a sound building on faulty Sound a tions. The Government should appoint a Minister whose sole duty would be to administer the Northern Territory, and to initiate and carry through plans for its development. Let -us get away from the idea that the administration of the territory is a part-time joh for a Minister. I wish it to be understood that I have no wish to reflect upon the present Minister for the Interior ter, when I urge this reform. "" It is impossible for a Minister to devote to the affairs of the territory the time that they deserve if he also has to give his attention to otber important matters. Eecently, it was announced in the press that the Minister for tbe Interior would take over the duties of the Minister for Defence i(M.r. Eric .T. Harrison) while that gentleman was in London, and that the Department of the Interior would absorb the remnants of the Department of Information. Thus, at a time when tbe affairs of tbe territory should be receiving more attention from the Minister, they may well receive less. The Government should re-organize the Legislative Council for the Northern Territory to enable the people to play a. more effective part in the management of their affairs. The council was set up by the Chifley Government for that purpose and the people welcomed it. Although they recognized that it was too -limited in its scope, they were prepared to try it to see how it worked. The Legislative Council has now been functioning for two years, and during that period many weaknesses have been revealed. For instance, ift was found that the influence of the -Government nominated members of the council was so overwhelming, that -no measure introduced by the elected representatives had any hope of succeed-img 'Unless it was acceptable to tbem. -It w.as -further shown that the council had no power to force government departments to divulge information about their activities. Then, when reports of the proceedings of the council ceased to be no Jouger published, Dsbe. pwb'lic could not fo:lh>w vwhat -the (council was doing, and they began to lose interest. Therefone, I ask the Government to review tbe conditions under which the council is constituted so that it may operate more effectively in the interests of the territory. The Chifley Government recognized 'that the people of the Northern Territory had advanced a -long way towards the goal of self-government. The very fact that the Legislative Council was established was proof of that. If the -present Government is prepared to review the activities of the council, and to appoint a full-time Minister for the Northern Territory, it should logically go a :step further, and bring down legislation empowering the elected representative of the people of the Northern Territory to vote in this House on all matters that come before it. Surely the people of the territory have proved that they are entitled to have in the Parliament a representative empowered to take his place with other honourable members in the conduct of the affairs of the nation. In all sincerity, I ask that this reform be effected. If the Government will agree to the proposals I have made, it will show that it is prepared to do what is necessary to develop the Northern Territory and to give the people there a more effective say in the conduct of their own affairs. It will also show that it recognizes that the people of the Northern Territory are citizens of Australia, and are entitled to be treated as such. The development, of the Northern Territory must be treated as a national undertaking, and honourable members should realize now, if tbey have not realized it before, that the Northern Territory in its present condition is the outstanding weakness in the Australian defence structure. I warn honourable members to take heed of the unsettled conditions in countries to the north of Australia. I agree with the statement of the Minister for External Affairs( Mr Spender) to the effect that no nation can escape its geography. The urgency of the situation warrants special efforts. I wonder whether honourable members agree that a special Minister should be appointed to attend to tbe task of-developing the territory. Australia has already suffered aittack by an enemy.

77,"( Mr Mcbride.)., Or Upon Any Other Minis","Darwin by the Japanese? I suppose that comparatively few can recall that f a t e f ul date off-hand. It was the 19th .February, 1942, when, for the first time in Australian history, an aggressor made a direct attack on our mainland. Yet, eight years later, Australia has forgotten that dark day, when 250 men and women lost their lives, and 400 persons were injured. That was a disaster the nature and magnitude of which Australia had never suffered before ancl has not suffered since; yet, in a comparatively short period, the event has been almost forgotten. In conclusion, J suggest, in all sincerity, that the Government should set aside the 19th February as a national day of remcmberanee, to be a reminder to the people, and especially to public men, that such a disaster can happen here. If we do not populate our empty north, the next attack will fall not only on Darwin but also the cities of the southern States. tory) [4.3] -A t the beginning of my remarks, I should like to congratulate Mr Speaker on the high honour that this House, by unanimous vote, has conferred on him. He bas been a distinguished soldier who has served his country well. Also with endless resolution, lie has served the people of Australia as u Minister of the Crown. He spent eight stoic if restless years in Opposition, and on the 22nd February last, he was elected the Speaker of the House of Representatives. His many activities on behalf of this oountry, a.nd his associations with Ihis honourable House mark bim as tbe person fitted to occupy the Chair. I a.m also most gratified that Mr Speaker has seen f it to wear the robes of office. It is Government, through the good offices of most important that on such occasions as this, and in such days as these, when democracies are shrinking throughout the world, and, more particularly, when our own democracy is resting on a knife edge, we should be extremely loth to discard any legacy which has been handed down to us from the mother of parliament? as a symbol of dignity and order, and of the freedom that wo enjoy to express our opinions in this chamber. That freedom is also enjoyed by people in other parts of the British Commonwealth. I feel that my constituents would like mc to express to the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Chifley) their thanks for the manner in which he has closely associated himself with ancl the deep interest that he has shown in many organizations, cultural and otherwise, in the Australian Capital Territory. A t long last, the Australian Capital Territory has been given limited representation in the Parliament of the Commonwealth. The fight for that representation has been of long duration. I was a member of the Parliament at the time of the transfer of the seat of government from Melbourne to the Australian Capital Territory. Shortly after our arrival in Canberra,. I had the honour to present, to the Prime Minister of the day. Mr S. M . Bruce, now Lord Bruce, a petition signed by approximately 76 per cent, of the whole of the population of the Australian Capital Territory in which they prayed that they sliould be granted, representation in fche Parliament. Mr Bruce received the petition sympathetically, and speaking on it in this House, expressed the opinion that the case for representation was unanswerable. I also recall that, on that occasion, the present Ministerf o r the Army( Mr Francis) strongly supported the petition, ajid the then Leader of the Opposition, Mr Matthew Charlton, urged that the request should be granted. But time passed, ancl nothing was done.. Tn the intervening years I have submitted similar petitions and have led deputations to successive Prime Ministers in the bope that, eventually, the adult population of fche. Australian Capital Territory would bo granted at least limited representation in this House. It remained for the last the then Ministerf o r the Interior( Mr. Johnson), to grant us the franchise. Whilst we are gratified, we do not feel particularly gratefulfcoany one, for we have ouly been given citizen rights, of which we had been deprived for many years. However, we have gained the franchise, ancl we sincerely pray that, in the not distant future, the member for the Australian Capital Territory w ill bave the same voting rights in this House as all other honourable members excepting one have.",28,Otpekman
78,Dr. Nott (Australian Capital Terri,"It is somewhat extraordinary that the Australian Capital Territory is the smallest of all the electorates, yet it is the oldest in one sense and the newest, in another sense. Its boundaries were not laid down by any commission which had been set up by the Parliament. The framers of the federal Constitution, tbe giant intellectuals of the day, who, following a series of conventions, brought into being the federation as we now know it, decided that the Australian Capital Territory should be situated in New South Wales, and Canberra was later selected as the territory for the Seat of Government. Its geographical boundaries are also the electoral boundaries of the Australian Capital Territory constituency. The framers of the Constitution also decided that tbe Parliament of Australia should, at the appropriate time, grant the franchise to the residents of the territory for the Seat of Government, and years later the people here have exercised the franchise for the first time as residents of the Australian Capital Territory. I feel a deep sense of responsibility at the honour that has fallen to me to represent the new electorate in this House. I rejoice in the fact that the constituency known as the Australian Capital Territory was not created in a spirit of rancour and bitterness, or after hard political battles and the display of party passions, but has progressed to the stage that we know it to-day. The Australian Capital Territory is the nerve centre of Australia. It is the residence of His Majesty's representative, His Excellency the Governor General, the Seat of the Government of Australia, the official place of residence of the Prime Minister and of the President of tbe Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives. the seat of the Australian National University-a university which, I think, for the first time in history has been planned on scientific and detailed lines. It. is the cradle of the Australian military machine. I refer, of course, to the Royal Military College, at Duntroon. It is the home of nearly every Commonwealth department. It is also the seat of an archbishopric and a bishopric. Governmental decisions that are made in this small centre are flashed not only to all parts of Australia, but also to many places beyond tbe seas. Every honourable member should surely agree that in view of the importance of this constituency, the member for the Australian Capital Territory should have the same voting rights as other honourable members enjoy. It is astonishing to think that those of us who came here voluntarily or compulsorily in the past forfeited the privileges that we had enjoyed as citizens of the Commonwealth immediately we crossed the imaginary line that marks the boundaries of New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory. I hope that such a condition of affairs will not exist again. What would be the reaction of other honourable members if 15,000 or 21,000 persons in, say, municipalities in their electorates were deprived of the franchise? The whole idea is absurd. That is why I make bold to say that I have not the sole responsibility of representing tbe Australian Capital Territory. This electorate is the delegated will of the whole of the people of Australia, and not of an isolated or composite section, and every honourable member has the same responsibility as I have to ensure the progress of this territory, which is the symbol of the Australian destiny. BeforeI discuss some of the matters in the Governor General's Speech, I should like briefly to pay a tribute to the people who, 25 or 30 years ago, laid the foundation stones of many, if not all, of the permanent structures, apart from hostels and guest houses, in the Australian Capital Territory. Those buildings stand as monuments to the indefatigable efforts of people to build, at the seat of government, a city worthy of the Australian nation. The national capital, It is in its early days, was controlled by directors-general of works, and surveyorsgeneral. .Subsequently, it was administered by the Federal Capital Commission, which was replaced by a system of ministerial control. All of them have played a noteworthy part in the development of this young country and the extraordinary amount of time and lahour which they have devoted to their task should be properly recognized. It would not be out of place for me to pay a tribute to Mr later Sir John, Butters, who,, together with hia associate' commissioners, did. valuable work under great stress im order that the parliamentary buildiimg should be ready for the opening oS the' fiirst. Parliament to sit in Canberra im 1927-. Reviewing the past and looking forward to< the future; I believe that I 1 appeal to the sense of justice and fair1 nessi in every honourable member when I urge that: the representative of the Ausr tralian Capital Territory should now be given, a; full franchise, in. this House. The way to a legislative council clothed with honourable member for. the Northern Territory ( Mr Nelson), has, advanced, the claims of. the residents of that territory for ful representation in this Parliament. 1. point out that for. some time the residentso£ the Northern. Territory have been in a more fortunate position than have thei residents: of tbe Australian Capital Territory in that they have been blessed-the word "" blessed "" may not be the: proper word to usein this connotation-by the' appointment of a legislative counci-] in which theiiinterests can be represented. I believe that the growing importance of the: electorates of the Northern Territory and. the Australian Capital! Territory entitle their representatives' ta full franchise rights in this National Parliament. The importance of the electorateoftheAustralian Capital Territory has increased as the result of the establishment, in this national city of the high commissioners' offices for the United Kingdom, and' the Dominions, and of embassies of foreign^ countries, and consideration shouldi now be given to the granting' to. itsrepresentative of"" full franchiserights. It would not be too much to expect: thia Parliament to go a stepfurther and in the. generosity of its heart, and with, sagacity and wisdom, extend, to; the. residents of the Australian Capital Territory representation also in th& Senate: It ia true, that an advisory coimci! has-been in. existences in this Territurn to> matters relating to public health. tory for: mam.y years, but although that body ha-stfusnctionediwell witbin the limits of its: constitution, itr is purely an : advisory body and; has no* executive power: The council wasi constituted, merelyto proffer advice; to the Minister for the Interior of the day. I say witbout hesitation, amd the minutes'of the; proceedings of the council will bear out the truth ofi my contention, that had successive Dr. Nott. Ministers for the Interiorfollowed' tbe advice given on innumerabl'e occasions by the council-' during the las* twenty years, thiscity would be a much, better city than it is to-day, and many of the ill's fromwhich its residents' suffer, and the irritations which remind them continually tliat they are only partly enfranchised, would long ago. have disappeared. The time has come when the Ministershould 1 see that .the Advisory Council shall give sufficient power toinitiate, amend or veto ordinances that may be made by the government of the day in direct opposition to' the' wishesof the people of the Australian Capital Territory.. A l'egisla:fcive council' would not need to be clothed with, great executive power at this stage of our development, but itsestablishment would enaible the people to take an increasing shareof responsibility for the developmenfc of. thisNation-all Capital. A : consistent and, in> some directions; a well:supported move has been made for the establishment of a municipal council for this city. I do not' oppose theappointment of such a body. I merely say that , having had aldermanic experience, 1 know that to play with the two. proposals is to play with a two-edged sword'.. At thisi juncture I . supportthe proposal for the: establishment of a legislative council, and not. a council clothedwith municipal powers .. J£ hope that; my discussion of 1 these matters at some length, at this stage of our proceedings will not, be regarded as indicating that I have a. parochial 1 outlook. I have no embarrassment in mentioning them now because I realize that they concern every honourable; member of. this House. I propose now to deal briefly' with some 1 matters'that were mentioned' in the Speech of His ExceUency the Governor General. 1 Naturally, of course, my first thoughts BeforeI proceed' to deal with the Governments health plans' I propose to reply briefly' to. statementsthat have been made by honourable members opposite on Matters that are greatly exercisingthe minds of the people at the present time . 1 The honorable member for Reid( Mr .Morgan) leferred to pol-iomyelitisj which isi raging in all the States and also in the Australian Capital Territory. He seemed to be under the impression that this epidemic is of minor significance. The extraordinary feature of this disease is that in its present epidemic state, it has a shocking way of selecting too often the flowerof theflock. . Very often the victim of poliomyelitis becomes wholly uneconomic and has to besupported by the community for the rest of his life. The problem, of coping with poliomyelitis has given the medical profession, a great deali of concern. The honourable member, with, a cynicism that was unworthy of him, said: that at last a medical officer is of the community are thosewhose whole being sent abroad to become familiar with, the latestmethods in the control and treatment of this disease. Tbis is not by any means the first occasion on which the scourge of poliomyelitis has exercised the minds of every practising medical very distinguished medical graduate from Victoria, who is a world authority on the incidence of poliomyelitis, its treatment and control, has travelled abroad on several occasions and on her return has reported to the various Australian organizations that are concerned with the control of this virulent disease. The honourable member for Reid also referred at great lengtb to the activities of Sister Kenny. I have had the privilege of knowing Sister Kenny for 26 years.. She is a lady of outstanding ability and personality. I offer no criticism of her work except to say that whilst she has made the whole world conscious of the dread effect of poliomyelitis, she has obtained her best results in the treatment of sufferers only when she has closely approached the orthodox methods of treatment that are followed' by the medical profession. The honourable member for Watson( Mr Curtin) saw fit to indulge in a diatribe against the British Medical Association, an organization; association or union-cal l it what we may-whos e members have played an enormous part in making possible tbe widespread practice of medicine throughout this country. I shall deal more fully with his remarks at a later stage. I content myself now 1 by saying that in the ranks of the British Medical' Association are* to be found individuals with the highest idealswho, for yoars, have rendered courageous service to peopie in every walk of life. I should be recreant to my trust as a member of this Housei f I did not pay tribute to them for the services they have rendered. Tlie books of the British Medical Association are audited by a public auditor. The organdzationis controlled entirely by its members. Its members may differ at Dimes with politicians. Indeed, who would not doso when politicians attempted to i play about with the health of the community?-' Those who are best fitted to advise on matters relating to the health lives have been spent in the medical profession. I deplore from the bottom of my heart the fact that in the past tbe political partiesrepresented on both sides of this House bave sought to capi1 talizethe health of the community for political purposes. The sanctity of life and the sacredness of health should not be made the subject of party politics. A national health scheme should be completely above party politics. I have not yet seen the draft of the bill which is to be introduced by the Minister for Health (Sir Earle Page) to provide for a medical service. When it is introduced it may or may not please me.. If it d'oes not please me, I shall not hesitate to say what I think about it. Almost every day questions are fired across this chamber, and statements are published in the press, relatingto health matters which are based on m'ere conjecture. Questions hased on statements made by irresponsible people would be better left unasked because they merely increase rancourand bitterness in the minds of the people who have so often been misled. I d'o not know what provisions the bill will' contain. I only know that to-day it costs too much to be born, too much to live, too much to be sick, and too much to die. A health scheme must embrace the whole of the. community and every aspect of the health of the community. The subject of hos1 pitalization' may or may not comewithin the ambit of the bill. Every medical practitioner-realizes thai? the present posi1 tion of hospitalization is not pleasing to contemplate. I , myself, have seen no fewerthan five women being confined at oncein a) public hall and< in the corridors of tbe Canberra' Community Hospital, yet this city is' supposed to have a modern 1 and' up-tJo -date hospital; Congestion' has",29,Otpekman
79,"Man In Australia. Dr. Mcnamara, A","resulted from the rapid growth of the population of this city, mostly by the addithere for days without any one caring tion of people of an age .at which they can rear families. Every effort is now being made to overtake the shortage of hospital accommodation in Canberra, and I trust that I shall never again witness sucb an occurrence as that which I have described. I urge the Minister for Health to take into consideration the need for tbe standardization of hospitals throughout Australia. thousands of pounds have been wasted because of the lack of such standardiza> tion. Any health measure that may be adopted for the welfare of the people must take into consideration a better deal for the nursing profession. quarters nurses are looked upon purely as a means for increasing the income of medical practitioners. One of the most pathetic, things in life is to see nurses, after years of service, no longer able to be gainfully employed in their profession, having to seek otber sources of employment in order to eke out an existence. The position of the invalid and age pensioners in relation to any bill that may be brought down is a matter of great concern to me. I say with respect that the invalid pensioner who is receiving the lousy amount of £2 2s. 6d. a week is in an impossible position economically. He is almost at the same disadvantage as the head of a family who is stricken with tuberculosis wbich confronts him with a long and distressing illness and the prospect of being unfit to resume his occupation. Unless he has adequate means, he is bound to be a recurring case in the immediate future. Any bill that is introdticed must bring about an amelioration of the condition of those people. The basic wage to-day is approximately £6 14s. a week. Wages have risen, costs of commodities have sky-rocketed, yet the invalid and age pensioners are supposed to eke out an existence in a tumble-down shack on £2 2s. 6d. a week. That is asking an impossibility. people have passed through my hands in the 23 years during which I have practised in this community. It has been my sad lot, again and again, to be called out to settlements where they live to certify to the death of some old man who had passed peacefully away and who received under a death certificate the only luxury Dr. Nott. he ever know. Some men had lain what had happened to them. Any bill that is introduced should make such provision as will obviate happenings of that kind. We have tried for years to establish a Twilight Home for the aged. Quite recently, I was shown lovely blueprints of one, but you cannot cover a man with a blueprint or put him to bed on one. Nor will it buy him enough Hundreds of food to provide him with a bare existence at the lowest level. I do not yet know the details of the proposed bill, but it must make full provision, not only for the treatment of the person who is suffering from tuberculosis but also for the In some aftercare of tubercular patients. In most of the big cities in which tuberculosis is prevalent, sanatoriums have been set up, and an interest is taken in sufferers from tuberculosis. There are committees which see that these people obtain employment after their recovery because it is impossible for many of them, after a long and debilitating illness, to go back to theiv former gainful employment in which they were engaged when they were stricken with the disease. There is in progress a health campaign that is designed to eradicate tuberculosis. I heard a sneech that was made in 1948 in which it wa3 stated that in 25 years tbere would not be one case of tuberculosis in this country; it was to be obliterated for all time. About 23 years previously, I had heard a speech in the same terms when I was a delegate to a conference in the Australian Capital Territory at the opening of the Institute of Anatomy. The body conducting the campaign is in a position to deliver the goods, but it will not be able to do so unless the economic position as well as the medical condition of the tubercular patient is considered. Housing and the care of people suffering from tuberculosis and kindred Thousands of these diseases are inextricably interwoven matters and the one cannot be dealt with witbout considering the other. Whereas hundreds sought houses in the Australian Capital Territory five years ago, to-day there are thousands. We should not ask workmen to occupy many of the houses that have been constructed. One-half of the cases of Aafcinwrfl*' *!:«* *-z* htian the Children's Court, whicli I attend people who are on the lower scale of regularly, are brought about by tbe fact remuneration and cannot pay the rents that many of the houses are not large that are demanded for the better type of enough for their occupants. There are house. This is a national matter. It affects no recreational facilities and children are Canberra, perhaps, a little more than compelled to seek their pleasures in the other cities, because most of the people street and once they do that they immein this city are engaged in essential diately lose the benefit of parental conservices. They bave been brought here trol which would mean so much to them by the Government, therefore it is the in later life. It is not possible for me, bounden duty of the Government to see in the time at my disposal, to deal with that they are properly housed with some all these matters. The bousing position measure of comfort and dignity. has been bad in Canberra ever since this city was founded. From 1934 onwards, ( Mr Clarey) and the honourable member the Australian Capital Territory A d for Yarr a ( Mr Keon) dealt with the visory Council again and again has carsubject of peace in industry and with ried resolutions calling on the governmatters that are tendential to securing ment of the day-ever y government for peace in industry.

The of this country along the lines that only history of the unutterable failure of the a democracy should go. I have listened for housing scheme, which is now a national hours to the speeches of honourable memcalamity, can be read in the records bers on both sides of the House. Many of divorce courts, children's courts and of those contributions will have a lasting other courts throughout Australia. Tho effect. I was struck by the speech of right honourable gentleman who has the the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) last duty of providing housing for the comnight, in which he held out an olive munity, is sending a mission abroad to branch for co-operation with members inspect prefabricated houses. He should on the other side of the House, so that, be forced to realize that time is the in the interests of Australia as a whole, essence of the contract. He should send 3ome one abroad with authority to purchase houses, but they should not be purchased unless they provide proper facilities and conveniences. I do not think are marketable in other .parts of the any one who has not had hospital exworld. Thc greatest disintegrating factor perience and has not gone from house in this country to-day is the strike to house in Canberra can realize the weapon. Every one seems to admit that heart-breaks that are being suffered and to-day strikes are being organized by are leading to the desolation of many those who are communistically inspired families in tbe Australian Capital Terand who would, if they could, hitch their ritory.

The whole of our prosperity depends upon that. The lessening of our dollar shortage depends upon our ability to produce goods that It has tage to any one who lives in this country. the people of this country. Increased production and reduced costs depend on the continuous and steady employment of .all the people who are engaged in industry. High tension production cannot -achieve the degree of efficiency that is essential to mass production unless there is complete co-operation by every one .of those units that are engaged in industry. Lack of co-operation by various sections of industry lowers production, undermines employment, and reduces the wage earnings of those who are engaged in industry. Therefore, we have the present unsatisfactory .and unstable economic position domestically and nationally. How, I ask, can peace in industry be brought about and maintained.? I say, by a better spirit of-co-operation between the workers on the one hand and the owners and managers on the other hand. 5l7hat has been stated in this chamber time and time again. But the question is, how can this better spirit of co-operation between workers on the one hand and the owners and managers, or captains -of industry, on the other hand be brought ubout? Never in the history of the great'Commonwealth of Nations has the responsibility of industry been so great as it is to-day. That responsibility does uot rest entirely on the worker. It also rests on .those who are known as the leaders or the captains of industry, or tht owners or managers. There must be demonstrated a better effort to get together aad .a -lowering of the .continuous hostile tension that so often exists -between managers of industry and the workers in it. The old view that the worker is.a mere unemotional cog in the wheel of industry has ?gone for ever and should not be allowed to raise its head again. Likewise, the old view that the captain of industry, the employer, is a hard bargain driving person, has long since passed into oblivion, because to-day it is -supplemented by a modifying Arbitration courts have been set up which give to both sides the opportunity to state their case, so that a decision may hp .given which will not lead to disruption of the efficiency of industry. Those old ideas would be as dead .as the tnaohings of Karl Marx if politicians did »not 'continually revive them. They itr. yon. \ contribute .nothing towards .goodwill and the establishment -of the trust and cooperation that -must exist between workers and managers. The personal importance to industry of the worker must be .recognized, and employers must acknowledge the fact that .human dignity and personal values are 'just as important as profits. Industry will develop and expand prosperously only when those who employ labour realize that the best asset .that they can possibly have is a modern trade union organization, under perfect control, co-operating with them in every way. Gainful and continuous employment under the best conditions that industiy can afford is the greatest steadying factor in relation to production, and it offers the only means of combating Communist-inspired strikes. Security in industry can be bought, but tlie only acceptable price is that of good and continuous employment. In dustrial peace and stability will never be achieved by coercion or prison bars. That is my firm belief, formed after making a closely detailed study of the situation over a long period. Every large industry and every large trade union should appoint a key personnel committee for the purpose of ironing out those small problems and pinpricks which, if allowed to continue, become magnified beyond their proper proportions. Such a system would increase the efficiency of industry in every respect. The very fact of the employer and the employee meeting face to face, neither the one looking np nor the other looking down, would add greatly to the prospect of maintaining peace in the industrial sphere. The encouragement of trade unions by managements would be conducive to goodwill and the growth of confidence and trust. The investigation of individual complaints should be facilitated. Such activities would not ibe detrimental iu any way to the existing conciliation and psychology. arbitration system. In fact, they would contribute to the efficiency of-the system. Though we have differences of opinion, we are Australians and we share a common desire to see our nation progress towards the destiny tliat 'has been decreed for it. We have inherited from our forefathers a great legacy that should not be lightly thrown aside. If we fail to meet. adversity as our forefathers did and -overcome our industrial troubles in a spirit of mutual .goodwill we shall cheat our children,' and .their children after them, of the .legacy that should be handed down to them. We shall destroy hope and blast all prospects of developing a giieat and industrially peaceful nation. remind honourable members that the honourable member for Corio '( Mr slum Clearance, the 'prohibitive cost Opperman) initiated this debate. In other. days and iu other circumstances, -many .people lagged behind .the honourable gentleman to their intense discomfort. Tihose of us who enter the debate at this stage feel some sympathy for his .former opponents because we, .too, are lagging.far behind the honourable member with a certain amount of discomfort. Most of the important points of the Governor General's Speech have already heen covered, not only effectively, but also frequently by previous speakers. The principal subject that exercises my mind is the housing shortage. Several honourable members have already discussed it, and we have just heard an eloquent dissertation upon it by the honourable member for the Australian Capital Territory (Dr. Nott). However, despite all that has been said, much more remains to bo said. That will be so until every person in Australia has a home in which to live. Every young man .and woman facing the prospect 'df marriage and the raising of a family, .and every ex-serviceman has the right to a home. I fully appreciate that housing has become principally a matter for -the State governments; nevertheless, this Parliament influences and guides those governments in many obvious .ways. Eor that u-eaaon, I listened with -the greatest :satisfaction to the following passage in the Governor; Generars Speech.:My iGrovennment -will take all possible steps to acquire -spectacular dwellings. My to stimulate tbe .building of .homes. 1 realized that those' were not empty problem is one of need, not one of choice. words, 'because the 'Government already, Whenever the housing shortage is menin ""the brief period during which it had tioned, whether it be at 'a public gatherbeen in-office, 'had. begun to put its policy ing, at a council meeting or in this into effect. It made a very sympathetic National Parliament, somebody always approach to the housing problem by .reproduces <& spate of figures stating how ducing, or abolishing, tariff charges <upon many homes have 'been ibuilt under the iinported prefabricated-and pre-cut homes administration.of this'government or that and an imposing variety of building government, it submit that such statistics materials. Those acts proved the sincerity of its promises and .caused.a ray of hope to shine upon ithe homeless. It would be impossible for me to discuss the housing situation fully within the time at my disposal and within the limits of the patience of other honourable members. I could speak at length about the (shortage itself, housing in relation to fhe immigration programme, of building homes, the effect of the shortage upon the birth-rate, and dozens of other aspects. However, I propose to deal merely with the shortage. Every lionorable member must be aware of the tragedy of this 'shortage. The honourable comber for the Australian Capital Territory has -spoken movingly of .his experiences of .the .desperate personal problems that constantly arise. The seriousness of the situation is too apparent to need further emphasis. Any member of this Parliament who can return to his electorate witbout (being inundated with talcs of broken families, ffuined health and desperate hardship is -indeed a fortunate man. A member of the'Opposition asked recently whether honourable members on tliis side of the House had examined the Heme Bay housing settlement in New South Wales. I have not inspected it closely, but I have -seen it. I did not like what I saw. I have also inspected housing settlements in other States governed by Labour Administrations, and I did not -like ""what I saw there, either. It seems to me .that slums :are being -manufactured for the unfortunate people who have to live in -such settlements. My comments refer only to the shortage of ordinary homes for ordinary people. I bave no intention of wasting the time of the House by pleading-the cause of people who, in their -wisdom or otherwise, wish sole concern is for those people whose",32,Otpekman
80,Mr Townley (Denison) [4.50],"1are irrelevant. factor is the number of the homes that have not been built. Thousands of young men and women who are waiting to be married are suffering because of the housgreat deal of distinction. Goodness knows ing shortage. Every book that they read and every film that they see ends with the heroine and the hero marrying and settling down to live happily ever after. But such things are not to be for young Australians, and the purpose of their lives is being frustrated. The problem of the homes that have not been built is one that affects our ex-servicemen and imbues them with cynical self-condemnation because they went away to fight for their country and in doing so lost their chances of getting homes. This is the problem that filb Australia with hopelessness and misery. We search ""for reasons for the shortage, but too often we are satisfied with mere excuses. Many theories have been advanced to explain the inadequacy of our home building programmes. Some people say that the reason is to be found in the fact that we have lost, the small investor from our midst. They say that many ordinary homes were built in tbe past by people who invested their small savings in homes hut that the incidence of taxation and other factors crushed such investors out of existence. Another person will say that it is the working tradesmen who are at fault; that tbey will not work hard ancl will not work overtime, because high taxation makes it not worth their while to put forth their best efforts or to work extra hours. That argument requires a lot of justification. that master builders, because of taxation, regulations or the shortage of material, just will not bother to build homes. Many reasons are given, some true, some half true and some totally untrue. The Government must discover the real reasons, whatever they may be, and take all possible steps to encourage and stimulate tbe building of homes. Home building should bo a. priority project. Since the war, even although materials have been controlled, there is evidence that far too many discussed on the highest possible level in luxury buildings have been constructed in Australia. built, also luxury hotels the size of the Taj Mahal, where only a millionaire can buy a glass of beer iu the lounge. I could Jfr. Townley. The socially decisive show honourable members to-day in the electorate of Franklin, a home that has been built since the war ended, in which even His Excellency could live with a how many bathrooms and toilets it contains, yet otber people, including returned service men and their families, are living in one or two rotten rooms. That home was built by one of the most active and influential socialists in my city. The Oommonwealth authorities themselves are not guiltless of luxury building. In my electorate a palatial building was started last year for the Oom monwealth Bank. It is too late now to have anything done about that, but I say officially, by way of protest, that last year when a complaint was made by a group of people including myself, our intelligence was insulted by our being told that in spite of the fact that nearly £1,000,000 was to be spent on tbe building ancl between 200 and 300 workmen employed on it, the project itself would not affect home building. It is well known that big construction companies exist and that they employ a great number of -workers ancl have an imposing pay-roll. It is not their function to build cottages; they can be concerned only with large construction works. I do not deny the right of any person to build any sort of home he chooses. I do not suggest that the luxury hotel does not fulfil a purpose for those unfortunate people who want to take their relaxation the hard way! With every ounce of emphasis at my command I say that the building of homes should Other people say enjoy absolute priority over such buildings. The priority should be in the allocation of materials, and also in the matter of government sympathy. If homes are to be built, this country must first have a sympathetic government. The Government of to-day is sympathetic; that is indicated in His Excellency's Speech. The second essential is the co-operation of the Opposition. The matter of housing the homeless people of Australia should be above party politics. All matters concerning housing should be this House. SinceI arrived here as a Night clubs have been new member I have discovered that my personal estimation of the National Parliament needs adjustment.

I pay him a tribute and as a football club meeting, a cricket club extend my humble compliments to a union meeting, or a local council or union meetwbich can boast of such a record of ing, persons who indulged in such tactics service to the community. That record would be severely disciplined. I have illustrates the integrity of its members asked more experienced members whether as well as the wisdom, judgment and present-day behaviour is similar to that of courage of its leaders, particularly the past, and I have been assured that it during the last few years. is. I am told that bitter personal attacks president of a union with such a record is and abusive language are not unusual in something of which to be proud, and my this chamber. ""When I asked questions admiration for tbe honourable member I was told to take no notice of such things, for Blaxland and his union is deep that it was just showmanship and an act and sincere. The honourable member put on to impress or fool the electors. I said that his union did not stop work suggest that there must be better ways during the war years. I cannot give any tban that of impressing electors. If extra credit for that. Quite a lot of other those statements are true, then surely men worked during the war years. honourable members of this House are Sailors, soldiers, airmen and members of plumbing tbe depths of insincerity. Like most honourable members who have servicemen worked under conditions spoken in this debate have done, I must which were not good.

If we do who also worked during the war years. not solve that problem we sball face a Some of the servicemen did not come home tragedy. The tragedy will be not that at all. I remind honourable members we shall be finished, but that the solution of the translation from the Greek inscripof the problem of ""industrial peace and tion on the monument in the Burma co-operation could have been found so jungle close to the place where so many easily by simple and sane means, Australians lie. It iswhich had not been adopted. Surely if we are to find the key to industrial say for their to-morrows we gave to-day. peace an example must be shown. TheI respectfully suggest that the honourable best place to set the example is in this member for Blaxland, in his association chamber. To house the people adequately the new extended sphere of influence that he active support of everybody directly or now occupies, should continue to spread indirectly connected with the building the wisdom, and exhibit the courage, that industry is required. The men who win have given his own union such a magnificoal and who man the furnaces in the cent record. I believe it to be the function steelworks or the brickworks must coof a trade union and of a union leader, operate, as well as the architects, brickno less than of a government, to main1 ayers and other skilled tradesmen who tain and protect the rights and privileges »ect the homes. The honourable member of workers but I say, further, that it is Blaxland( Mr E. James Harrison) the function of a union and of a union Being some other unions also worked. The When you go home tell them of us, and with the great trade unions, and in the leadento: recognize frankly that it isimthing, the ability of those conducting possible to dissociate privileges, from duties and responsibilities to. the community. Inconsidering the housing needs of thc community as a whole, it is well to consider also the needs of various sections of the community. We should consider, perhaps first of all, the needs of the 3ick. The honorahle member for the Australian Capital Territory hasgone into thisi mattei"" much more fully than I can hope to do, hut I believe that it is a blot on thefair name of Australia that we should be at; this moment short of 18,000 hospital; beds, and. of the equipment and 1 accommodation that go-with them.. Many of us hawe come up against the problem of sickness in our own. families-. Those who: have not may find that their turn will come: The need for more hospital accommodation, is uugent.. I alsodraw attention to the housing needs of old people. Never let. usi usethe word "" problem "" in. respect of them in the-way that it is customarily used. The fact that ouii parents tend, to live many years longei; than used to be the case is surely not. a problem but something for which we'sliould be thankful. Tbe time has come when. we,, as a nation,, must, recognize, the expert examination. It would take time claims of this ever-growing section, and act accordingly.. Of the old people, there is afortunate section who can find accommodation with their There is a second section of elderly people who, through savings or investments, have acquired sufficient resources to enable tliem to engage domestic help to look after them in their declining years. However, tbere is an ever-growing number of old people who cannot, for various reasons, live with their child'r,en, and are unable to provide for themselves. For those in this big group only two cotirses are open. Thc first is to enter some government institution. such institutions do really meet a great need', I submit that they are not nearly good enough for our old people. Others may gain admittance to rest homes, some of which are privately run, but most of whicli' aTe run By some of the churches or other charitable organizations. Rest homes of this kindare much nearer to the ideal provisionfbr our old folk, but they are by no means perfect. Fbr one Jfr. homesto provide accommodation is always limited by lack ofi finance, and in that respect the Government might help by grantingsubsidies. I am not suggestingthat another government department should be set up to administer such an activity. An existing department could undertake to. examine the operations, of existing charitable organizations that administer homes for. old' people, and could arrange for the payment of subsidies to those, of which it approves. In this way,, the maximum amount of good could be achieved at the minimum cost. I believe, however; that it would still be necessary to provide some kind of community home for elderly people.. I do not. know' what the final: form, might be. Perhaps it might bedecided to provide flats, in which elderly couples, or individual persons, could be provided with a bedroom,, living room and bathroom, some accommodation they could call their own, and in which: they could preserve some measure of independence and privacy.. There might, perhaps,, be community dining, rooms,, a domestic staff, and a medical service.. I am sure that the suggestion merits consideration and to put such, a scheme into operation, but,, in tbe meantime, we should, do for the old people whatever we can as. quickly children. as we can. That something should be done for them is beyond all argument. The men and women concerned have lived useful lives. They have raised their families, and, presumably, paid their taxes. By living thek ordinary lives, tliey have done a great deal to develop the nation. The time has now comef or the nation to show its gratitude,, and discharge its obligation. When I consider the record of Australia during the war, Although when I recall that nearly 750,000 men and women were taken out of civil production for war purposes-, when I think of the ships we-built, of the Army and Air Force townships that sprangup all over Australia, of the aircraft hangars' that were constructed-, and of the aircraft and engines that were manufactured) embodying the most delicate precision instruments, I cannot believe tliat it is impossibleto provide in tliis couutry the homes Toionley. tliat aresourgently needed'.

I thank honouable. members for their -courteous; hearing. F was amused-to hear the honourable-memher for Denison( Mr Townley) say that he was disajipoi'nted at' the conduct of honourable members-. I» assure him that he has not seen anything yet. During tliis debate, frequent? referencehas been made to the industrial unrestthat is prevalent in Australia to-day. Undoubtedly, there is a: great deal of 'iudus trial' unrest; aind it is; to be regretted*. I listened closely to the speeches made by lionorable' memibens on this subject, but I listened in vain for anyhistorical survey of the situation, orforany. proposal that might solve the problem. I believe that the. prevailing; unrest has its., roots: in tbe fear of economicinsecurity,, and in. the treatment that has been meted out to the workers in the past. Before the 1914-18 war,, most of Australia's workerswere engaged in the primary industries.. ""When that war broke out, young Australians flocked tothecolours*.

I again ask the honourable inember to address the Chair, and to ignore interjections. ae other speakers have done, and the Chair did not intervene then. However, I shall ignore the interjections. The coal-miners have had sad and bitter experiences that they will not easily forget. When they accumulated coal at grass, they were dismissed. Honourable memhers opposite do ' not like to be reminded of that phase of the history of the coal-mining industry. As soon as there was a stack of coal at grass, the miners lost their jobs. Will honourable members opposite deny that fact? tions also were broken down. quickly learnt that a stack of coal at grass meant unemployment for them. They virtually starved when stocks of coal were accumulated. But nothing was said in those days about the plight of the coalminers, and the influence of the "" Coms "". During World WarI . , Australian servicemen were assured that, on their return to civil life, they would be granted improved working conditions, with higher pay. Yeti n 1931-32, Australia had more than 700,000 unemployed, of whom a big percentage were ex-9ervicemen. Those unfortunate people walked the streets in search of work. They lived on the dole. Does any honourable member opposite deny that? Scullin Government's term of office. private banks took control of the country. vernment seized every opportunity to ensure, by legislative enactment, that should the need arise, the Commonwealth would not he prevented from providingmoney for the relief of unemployment. When the Scullin Government was in office, it proposed to make available an amount of £18,000,000 to provide work for the 700,000 unemployed. Its political opponents, who controlled the Senate,, refused to approve that grant. Honourable members opposite cannot ""get away"" with the statement that the Scullin Government was responsible for the flood of unemployment in Australia. That Administration did all that it possibly could to provide funds for the relief of unemployment, thereby keeping Australia's promise to those who had fought in World WarL and bad thereby protected the lives of those who had to stay at home, yet every effort that it made was frustrated by a hostile Senate. Is it to be wondered at that the Labour party has since made every possible effort to prevent a repetition of .that occurrence ? After World WarI . , the miners, who had produced ample coal for the requirements of the country, were forgotten, and I believe that they bave become determined not to provide all the coal that is needed in Australia. The reason for that attitude is that they realize that an accumulation of coal at grass means unemployment for them. Honourable members opposite blame the Communists for the irritation that exists in the industrial sphere, and perhaps the "" Coms"" have aggravated the position, but that is not the whole story. This week, a vote was taken among Melbourne tramway employees, who are on strike, on a proposal for a return to work. Approximately 2,000 members of the union voted .against a resumption of work, and only twenty voted for it. The"" Coms"" cannot be blamed for that decision. Had a secret ballot of the members been taken, the result of the voting would not have been materially altered. I refer to that incident because I believe that the present industrial unrest is not wholly attributduring the able to the activity of the "" Corns "". living is the difliculty. that matter now.

118,Mr Wilson (Sturt) '[8.0],"Mrkave been made in this House concerning that. threat; which, is clearly on. the horizon. Throughout the world, we see a threat which is even, greater than the threat of war.. Tbat. threat is starvation. Recently, leading, economists throughout the world have come to the conclusion that. there is not enough food im the world adequately to feed more than one-half of ifs population. In view of the amazing-increasein world population, that presents a problem as great, as any the world has ever had to face. The population of the world, isincreasing at the rateof 2,000,000 people a month. There are 150,000,000-more people in the world to-day than there were when World War II . commenced. Europe, in spite of the most destructive war that the world has ever seen, has 12,000,000 more people than it had in 1939, when the war commenced. Japan,, in spite of tbe atomic bomb and the terrific destruction, that was caused during the war, has 8,000,000 more people than it had when it entered Ihe war. Every day of every week of every month of every year 60,000 more people are lining up for breakfast. The expectation of life in Australia is 63 years. That very high expectation results from tbe good food of this country and also from the marvellous advances that have been made, in medical science. The expectation of life in India is 27 years. More than half the babies born there never reach adult age. Medical science has now been taken to India, -with the result that the populationof India, will increase at a rate far greater tban ever before. To-day there is not enough food in the world to feed half the people, and every day there are thousands and thousands more mouthsto feed. Despite these facts, there is no world plan to provide additional food for these increases in population. Starving people do not die quietly. The starvation of people in other parts of the world presents a threat of the greatest magnitude to this and all other coimtries. Honourable members may say, "" This is all very interesting, but; after all, we have plentyof food, so how does it affect us? "" The previous Government, realizing the need' for extra food production, and realizing the need for extra? population, embarked upon a policy of immigration. This policy is being expanded by the presentGo.vernmenlJ,._and. it is. anticipated that in I960, only ten years hence,, our population will be 1O,5O0;OOO.. During the last ten years our food production, instead, of increasing per capita of population, has been declining. There has been an alarming drift from the country to the city, whicli has previously been mentioned in this debate. I tbink it was stated that there are 60,000 less people engaged in primary industry than there were at the commencement of the war. Using an index figure to illustrate the fall in production, comparing the year 1936-37 with the year 1946-47, we find that production decreased from 1,020 to 754;. we find that our pastoral production decreased from 1,065 to 939. The right honourable member for Barton (Dr. Evatt) very lightly glossed over this fact during his remarks to this House-. He pointed to the favorable position, of the primary producer's now compared with that of ten years ago. It is admitted that the incomes of primary producers areconsiderably higher now than they were before thewar. Their incomes are higher for the very reason that our primary products are becoming scarcer, and: whenever supply falls, obviously prices will increase because of the increased demand. Production, both agricultural and pastoral, has, for practical purposes, been static in the last ten years If it remains the same for the next ten years Australia will need to import almost every kind of footstuff and there will be no country willing to export primary products. The quantities of foodstuffs that we shall need to import m ten years time if our production remains the same will be substantial. Assumingthat the consumption per Bead' of population for 10,000;000 would be the same as it is to-day, we sbould need to import 91,000 tons of beef and veal, 21,000 tons of mutton and 1'amb, 22,000 tons of pig meat, 156,000 tons of potatoes, 1,000 tons of processed milk, 3,700 tons of citrus fruits, and 35,000 tons of fresh fruit, and we should have none of those commodities forexport. The only two foodstuffs of which we would, have enough for our own consumption would, be wheat and sugar, andi of those we should have very little to export. Our sheep population to-day is practically the same as it was ten years ago. Our sheep population for the last ten years has beenSheep V<Jiir. 1038 .. 1.13,000,000 1.939 .1940 1941 1942 1943 1944 .I23.00Q.000 1945 1940 1947 Those figures show an average for the five years, 1938 to 1942 of HS,000,000. For the next five years the average population was only :i08.000,000; and in 194S our sheep population dropped to 102,000,000. The position of Australia is not dissimilar to the position of other primary producing countries. Last year, the export of wool from the Argentine decreased by 61 per cent., from South Africa 19 per cent., and from New Zealand 25 per cent. The wool production of the United St a tes of America last year was the lowest since 1879. The amount produced was 216,000,000 bales whilst the normal consumption of the United States is 345,000,000 bales per annum. United States of America is not producing more than two-thirds of its own requirements of wool. In those circumstances, is it to be wondered at that thc price of wool has sky-rocketed? That phenomenal rise has occurred simply because not enough wool is being produced to supply the world's demands. Almost the whole of our reserves of wool have been used. The Joint Organization accumulated a reserve of 10,500,000 bales during the war, but stocks had fallen to less than 1.000,000 bales by last December, and it is expected that they will be entirely exhausted by the end of June thjs year. ""What a. wonderful opportunity this state of affairs offers to a country like Australia, which can increase its sheep production tremendously. All of our economic problems could be solved by increasing primary production. The dollar problem could be solved almost overnight. As I have said, the United States of America, must import one-third of its wool requirements, and we could ilr. Wilson. satisfy that demand. ""Whether America bought the wool direct from Australia or through Great Britain would be of no importance. The transactions would replenish the dollar pool of the sterling population. countries. Lord Boyd-Orr recently ex.. 111.000,000 pressed the very pessimistic opinion .. 119,000,000 that the world would destroy itself by .. 122,000,000 1975 because of its inability to feed .. 125,000,000 itself. I clo not share that view. Aus.. 1.24.000.000 tralia has proved that it can surmount .. 100,000,000 difficult obstacles and already our 9(i,000,000 graziers are able to raise six sheep where 90.000,000 only one sheep could be raised previously. Tbey can make poor land fertile and productive by planting pastures and adding phosphates and trace elements to the soil. There are millions of acres of unused land in Australia, and our primary production conld .he doubled, trebled or even quadrupled. Many other countries are not in the same favorable situation. The small countries of Europe liave not enough land to permit of any substantial increase of primary production. India is achieving good results by draining swamps ancl endeavouring to bring new land under cultivation, but the extra productivity that will be gained will represent only a drop in the ocean of India's requirements for its own population. Thus, Australia is one of the few The countries that has the opportunity to solve the great world problem of food shortages. But we must move quickly if we are to succeed. We must adopt a definite plan of expansion for our primary industries. It was gratifying to* note in the Governor General's Speech a statement of the Government's intention to deal with the problem of production as a. first priority. As I have said, our graziers can double and treble our production of wool and meat, but they must have supplies of wire, wire netting, tractors, cement and many other essentials of efficient primary production -before they can do so. That fact connects the primary industries with the secondary industries. Therefore I refer now to the expansion of our secondary industries. We must have new capital before we can proceed with their development, and new capital comes only from the savings of the people. Tbe Chifley Government went out of its way to advertise tke virtue of thrift. ance of saving and thereby accumulating new capital is obvious, but we ueed something more than a mere advertising campaign advising people to be thrifty. The Government must give .some genuine encouragement to thrifty people. Our laws at present penalize thrift in many ways. A man who bas put aside a few shillings each week in a savings bank account finds, when he receives a return from his savings, that he is taxed at a higher rate. A penalty rate of tax is imposed because the income from his saving, or deferred spending, is not regarded as income from personal exertion. Our social services legislation embodies an even more wicked form of discrimination against the thrifty person. A citizen who has squandered all of his money can obtain the age pension without any difficulty when be reaches the appropriate age. But a man who has acted in the national interests and set aside a pound or two each week in the savings bank, or who has taken out an insurance policy, or saved in some other way, finds that it is useless for bim to apply for a pension when he reaches tbe retiring age. He has been thrifty, and therefore he is not entitled to the age pension. Is it to be wondered at that people do not appreciate the merits of thrift when the laws discourage thrift? . I shall cite an actual case of injustice in order to demonstrate the iniquity of the means test that is applied under our social services legislation. I shall refer it to the Minister for Social Services (Senator Spooner), but I know that nothing can be done to rectify the wrong until the law is altered. The honourable member for Adelaide( Mr Chambers) also took up the case, but without avail. A man aged 78 years, who had lived and worked all his life at Broken Hill, which is not a very pleasant place at which to work, decided that, at his advanced age, he was entitled to enjoy a rest. He had paid taxes all his life, and he owned a house valued at £248 at Broken Hill. His daughter and her three children were living in the home. The old man decided to give the house to his daughter so that she and the children would still The importhave somewhere to live at Broken Hill, and he went to Adelaide and applied for the age pension. The pension was reduced by £2 19s. 3d. a fortnight, leaving him only a little over £1 on which to live, firstly because he had owned the house at BrokenH ill and had given it to his daughter; and, secondly, because he had apparently been wicked enough in the eyes of the law to subscribe to an insurance policy for £500 which, owing to his advanced age, had a surrender value of £416. If that man had saved nothing, he would have received the full pension. But because he had insured his life and had bought a house, which he had left for his daughter and grandchildren to live in, he was deprived of more than half of the age pension. I believe that the unjust means test strikes right at the root of our economy. It discourages thrift and thereby discourages production. Therefore, I was delighted to learn that this Government was prepared to tackle the problem.. I am not unmindful of the difficulties that are involved. Had the national insurance scheme been brought into operation during the war, the problem would not exist now, but unfortunately the Labour Administration did not carry the legislation into effect. That is why the means test remains a blot on the Australian economy. The sooner we deal with this problem the better it will be for the wbole community, even if we tackle it only in stages. It is scarcely necessary for me to remind honorahle members of the extraordinary situation of public servants in this community. They are compelled by law to contribute to a superannuation scheme and they are compelled by law to pay a social services contribution. Yet, when they reach the retiring age, they are not entitled to draw the age pension, for which they have paid the social services contribution, because they receive superannuation. Is there any fairness or justice about that? We must take early steps to abolish the means test. Australia can and must play a major part in solving the world's food problem. It has the initiative and the capacity to do so. I believe that employers and employees can and do work together in this country. Compared with the total volume of production in Australia the number of 'strikes .and disagreements in industry is (infinitesimal. Of course, it w.ould be very .much better for tbe country if ithere were no strikes at all, and -I am sure that .every effort is being .made by the -Government to .reduce industrial disruption to a minimum. The fact is that employers and employees do co-operate in 9.9 per cent, of our industries. Their differences are settled around conference tables and never .see the light of arbitrais then he is on the. way out. That .hastion. .Many honourable members have discussed incentive payments as if .such things were unknown in Australia. However, the incentive payment system is used, I suppose, in a majority .of our smaller industries and is giving complete satisfaction. The employees concerned would not agree in .any circumstances to the adoption of any .other system. Unfortunately for us, the .Communists do not want the workers to be prosperous. Therefore they oppose incentive payments and all forms of profit sharing. It iis unfortunate that many socialists echo bheir arguments. Eaced with the .great problems that exist to-day, we all should be prepared to co-operate and do everything in our power to bring peace to industry so that industry can produce the maximum quantity of goods and services. Only -by increasing production can we save the world from .starvation. hope that you will be -sufficiently indulgent, Mr Speaker, to accept another vote of thanks for what we expect that you will be able to do as our new presiding officer. I wish to congratulate you upon your election to your present high office. Whatever else we may think about you, Mr Speaker, we on this side of the House believe that you will dispense justice to both sides of the House. The capacity to do so is a very important qualification for your important oflice. I express my gratitude to the new members in this Parliament whose speeches have impressed those of us who have been here for two or more terms. They have impressed us by their sincerity, and I hope that they wil] never lose that quality in this Parliahonorable members of this -Parliament ment, where it is very easy to become cynical, hard-hailed and so party-minded tihat one .cannot see the good in the other fellow. I hope -that each new member will retain 'his own ipersonality and not try to assume ithat of somebody else. .In carrying on under those circumstances with .their .parliamentary careers, which I hope will be .successful, they will be appreciated by the people. The Australian people admire sincerity, .straightforwardness rand humbleness of mind in .'their parliamentary representatives. Immediately a man thinks he is better than hebeen proved .in all forms of human relationship in every field of life. A larger number of new members tban ever before in the history of the House .are young men. Although -we .shall do our best to remove them at the next'election, I hope that, whatever happens then, they will .bring credit to this Government and to tbe country while 'they are here. Honourable members opposite will also try to remove us when opportunity arises. Some of us have come from the hustings badly .mauled, but nevertheless 'we scraped through to the tape and got here. ""We shall face 'whatever comes to us with the best spirit that we can muster. Our .attitude towards 'the bills that will come before this Parliament will be to look at them squarely and sincerely.

I hope that Ministers will not forget it because so far we .have seen a display of arrogance hy certain members of .the Government of which we do not approve. J hope that the honourable gentlemen 1 liave in mind who have been guilty of this fault since they became Ministers of the Crown will have a due regard for fhe fact that they too are the servants of the people and not their masters. Arrogance is one of the worse faults that anybody can have. security, health and well-being of the people are the main concern of this Parliament. Honourable members are not in the Parliament for personal reasons or to enrich themselves. If new memhers work in their electorates as I have done in mine during the last tbree years, a fact that has do it. I accept our defeat, but we are enabled me to remain a member of this House for a second term, they will be much poorer men at the end of that time. I spent ovei' £800 in my electorate during that three years on organized tours, the broadcast advertising of tbem, and hire of halls, travelling expenses, donations and otber things of that type. If an honourable member is to be a true servant of the people he will be a much poorer man in three years' time. We are the mouthpiece of the people. We must try to express their will in our legislation. We must be guided by public opinion, and the moment we ignore it we shall run on the rocks. At one time a government could put it over the people, but the people are better informed to-day and governments cannot bamboozle tbem now-a t any rate not all of them. We speak not only for those who can speak for themselves but also for tbe dumb. Service to humanity is the greatest possible service, and a member of Parliament, I believe, can serve the community in the highest degree. Service, courtesy and a personal interest in the people of our electorates, together with an understanding of human needs and oroblems, will remove much of the criticism of Parliament and its members Mi at has been frequent in the past. Cynicism directed against members of Parliament has been too widespread. Certain indiscretions on-the part of members in the past may have had 'a cumulative effect on the minds of the people and they may now think that we all are here for what we can get out of the place. As the Nineteenth Parliament goes into action it becomes our duty to break down that cynicism. A feeling 'Of trust must ahvays exist between the electors and the elected. Government is from the bottom up and not from the top down. Government is from the people through us and not from an authority whicli has not been electedby the people but which has been set above them. That is democracy as The happiness, distinct from autocracy and fascism. WhatI intend to say now is not in any sense a moan, such as the Prime Minister charged the Opposition with last night. The Prime Minister's charge is merely a cheap way of breaking down 'a reasonable argument. We have a right to analyse the election result, aud I intend briefly to going to pull up our socks and try our best to win back into government; if not in three years' time then in six or nine years'' time. We shall be continually on the tail of the Government. The period of office of governments in Australia occurs in cvcles and no honourable member on the Government side need think that he is in office for all time. There has been a swing to the right in the last few years in all countries outside the Soviet TJnion. Just after the war there was a nronounced swing to the left in British countries because the people felt that the conservative rule of pre-war years had brought on the second world war. The swing was from that type of political thought towards the left. The feeling for the left existed for four or five years and then a new swing developed towards the right. That bas been apparent in New Zealand, Australia, Great Britain to a certain extent, and in Africa. The reason for it is that the people in the countries I mentioned have recovered to an extent from the tragedy of the war. Economic security and f u l l employment have existed in most of the British countries, apart from India and Pakistan, and during a period of security there is a psychological trend towards conservatism. Some one has said that a man is a radical until he ds 45 years of age and after that he becomes a conservative. That is only a generalization of course, but the swing to the right in the last few years has occurred because more economic stability now exists than existed when the war ended. The capitalistic framework of the economy of the world must inevitably cause war again. The seeds of war and depression ai'e inherent in the capitalist system. The conference at Amsterdam called by the World Council of Churches in 1948 proclaimed in its economic policy that neither capitalism nor communism was the ultimate answer to the world's economic troubles. That is the belief of the Labour party. The cycle of war and depression is aonarent throughout the last 100 years-depressio n and glut, boom and slump. The Government has a majority of 27, which sounds formidable until one remembers that twenty seats were won by less than 1,000 votes. The voting returns for the Commonwealth in the elections to the House of Representatives show that the Labour party polled 1,941,752 votes or 46.7 per cent, of the total voting strength; the Liberal party polled 1,659,405 votes or 39.9 per cent.; and the Australian Country party polled only 401,872 votes or 9.6 per cent, of the total votes. The Communist party polled only 36,083 votes throughout the whole of Australia, which is less than 1 per cent, of all the votes cast. The Labour party was linked with the Communist party by our political enemies, but I believe we did more to smash the Communist party economically than any other party has ever done. Other parties polled 119,083 votes, or 2.9 per cent, of the total. Thus, the Liberal party and tbe Australian between them polled 49.5 per cent, of the votes, and the Labour party 46.7 per cent. The difference between them was only 2.8 per cent., which is not a great figure. had no political background, and no According to the representation of the parties in this House, there appears to have been a big swing against Labour, but the swing was very small. Many of the seats were won by a. narrow margin, and that margin could be reversed at the next election. 1 look upon myself as one of the survivors of the Labour party wreck. In Tasmania, I was the only ilr. Duthie. survivor. However, when a ship laden with bullion and treasure goes down, strenuous efforts are made to raise it. The Labour ship was wrecked on the 10th December, but strenuous efforts will be made to refloat it. The methods used by the anti-Labour parties to win the election were utterly reprehensible. I do not say that honourable members opposite were individually responsible for what happened, but their propaganda machine was responsible. The parties that now support the Government won their way to power by the use of fear and finance, with a fair amount of falsehood intermingled .with them. Fear is a deadly weapon, whoever uses it. It is the most primitive instinct in the world. Never again shall I doubt that Hitler and Goebbels won over the German people by propaganda that played on their fears. For more than twelve months, the Labour party was battered by the propaganda, of the Liberal jiarty and the Australian Country party. Theirs was a perfectly organized campaign. The Labour party can, perhaps, learn something from them, but the campaign would never have been so successful without the help of money, and the Labour party would never be able to raise so much money in so short a time. We do not know where the money came from; we can only guess. However, the interests that opposed the Labour party so strongly during the last three years made sure that the opposing parties got the money they wanted. A tremendously powerful political machine went into action against the Labour party during the election campaign, and it swept our propaganda aside. By employing the vicious weapon of fear, our Country party opponents created panic among tbe people, distorted their vision and paralysed their thought. They played havoc with the susceptibilities of people who understanding of economics. Fear feeds on ignorance. Where tbere is no ignorance tbere is no fear. Once we have knowledge of a thing we do not fear it any more. The people who are ignorant of political factors were the victims of the propaganda directed against the Labour party. So devilish was that propaganda that it created in the minds of the people, not only hostility towards the Labour Government and its leader, but also something that was far worse-hatred . Perhaps honourable members opposite do not know that their propaganda went so far. They moved in their own circles, and did not have an opportunity to observe results; but we, who were getting the battering, knew what was happening. In southern Tasmania, one of our lady members, who was canvassing for the Labour party, said that never in her whole experience had she encountered such hatred of the Labour party as during the last election campaign. Even people who had previously supported the Labour party slammed the door in her face before she had an opportunity to say anything. Their action proved that the anti-Labour propaganda which they had heard over the air had aroused hatred of the Labour party in their minds. I encountered the same frame of mind among people whom I met during my own election campaign. It is bad that a political party should create such hatred in the minds of the people against its opponents. We do not object to criticism, but the creation of hatred amounts to hitting below the belt. The people were made to fear socialism and nationalization. The Labour party was defeated on those two issues. Petrol rationing was a side issue. The anti-Labour propaganda machine succeeded in creating in the minds of the people an unutterable fear of what the propagandists called socialism and nationalizadeliberately ignored the provisions of the tion. They dressed those two subjects up in hideous clothes, gave them terrible names, ancl said, "" This is socialism. It is a monstrous thing. Turn out the Chifley socialists"". It was not true socialism that the people voted against, but, a bogus socialism, a wicked invention of tbe Liberal party a bloodcurdling monster falsely called socialism. stitution, but the propagandists carefully Wbat is socialism? members opposite know that they are looking at examples of socialism all around them every day? Socialism is not a hideous thing, and it is not a new thing. It is part of the present economic system, even though that system is predominantly capitalist. The anti-Labour propagandists made it appear that socialism was something quite new in our experience. Well, what about the roads we drive over? What about the hospitals for our sick, the water services in our towns and cities, and the electric light and power services operated by governments, such as our hydroelectric system in Tasmania?What about the government research farms, the railways, tramways, irrigation systems, tbe post office, the departments of agriculture, and the various co-operative enterprises? What about Trans-Australia Airlines, the ships operated by the Commonwealth Shipping Board, the whaling industry, the aerodromes, and the Navy, Army and Air Force? Those are all examples of socialism in action, yet an -attempt was made during the election to induce the people to believe that socialism was some monstrous thing introduced by the Chifley Government. That is an example of the hypocritical propaganda with which the Labour party had to contend. Falsehoods were also told to the people about nationalization. Wicked statements were made to the effect that the Labour Government would take away the people's homes and farms and businesses, and even their money. This propaganda so frightened some people that they drew their money out of the banks, and buried it in their gardens. I refer more particularly to people who were too old to think, ancl who are not well versed in politics. Wild charges were made about what the Labour Goverament would do if it were returned to office. Those who made such charges Constitution, a document of 127 sections, which was finally adopted in 1901. The Constitution defines the powers of the Commonwealth Parliament, and no government can exceed those powers. Of all the terrible things the propagandistssaid that a Labour government would do, not one was permissible under the ConDo honourable refrained from pointing that out. They did not tell the people honestly what the Constitution provided. How far can an Australian government go ? We must not confuse socialism with nationalization. Socialism is government ownership of certain utilities on behalf of the 7>eople, so that any profits earned go back into those utilities for thebenefit of the people. Under-that"" systenn the utilities exist for the benefit: of the people, amd.not'for-the exploitation of the people.. ""Nationalization issomething different. Under nationalization, a' go1 vernment nothing -for. private enterprise. Socialism, on the. contrary; can exist side by side with, private enterprise. owned! instrumentalities alongside those that are privately owned. There is. nothing in the Constitution to prevent the Australian Government from operating its own coal mines, but it. has no power to. nationalize the coal industry. It. haspower to operate its own shipping services, hut it has no power to nationalize shipping:. It can.run its own airlines, but it has no power to nationalize tbe air services; It can: run its own railways, but it cannot take over all the railways in Australia.. The Government can enter the iron and. steel industry, but it has no power to nationalize the iron and steel industry. There are Commonwealth-controlled hospitals,, but the Government cannot nationalize the hospitals-. The Commonwealth can. employ its< own doctors, but it cannot nationalize medical services. It could, bave its ownchemical factories, like those of the Imperial Chemical Industries nationalize, the chemical, industry. can set up its own. research farm, but it hasno power to nationalize the land. It can. acquire land for soldier settlement, but it cannot nationalize farming. The Commonwealth may run its own banks, as, indeed, it does, but the High Court and the Privy Council have ruled that it has no power to nationalize banking, even though that power appears to be inherent in placitum 13 of section 51 of the Constitution, which provides that the Commonwealth has power tolegislate in respect of banking, other than State banking, and that it has power to legislate in respect even of State banking that extends beyond tbe boundaries of a particular State. The Commonwealth can set up its own textile mills, its own boot and shoe factories, butit has nopower to nationalize years ago. I haveobtained from the Comthe clothingindustry. It can establish itsown broadcasting stations, but it bas no power to* take over privately owned broadcastingstations. The anti-Labour propagandists; however, told the people itr. Duthie. that the Labour Government, if returned to power, would nationalize everything. They did so, knowing ful l well that what they said was not true. If socialism and nationalization are the: Frankenstein take3 everything, leaving monsters they are represented to be, why have not the anti-Labour governments of Western Australia, South Australia, and GovernmentVictoria handed over, to private entercan operate prise such government-controlled enterprises as railways, electric power services, 1 coal mines, &c. ? I challenge honourable gentlemen, opposite to answer that question-.. owned them. The non-Labour parties, to be consistent, should transfer those activities to private enterprise. While there is one private utility in any field of the Australian 1 economy, it cannot be said that that industry has been nationalized: The Postal Department is' the only truly nationalized service in the Commonwealth, and the power in that respect is derived from section 51 of the Constitution, which reads as follows:The Parliament shall . . have power to make laws for the peace, orderand good Limited, but it cannot government of the Commonwealtli w it h respect It to:(v) Postal, telegraphic,, telephonic, and other like services. Thosefacts show the lengths to. which theLiberal party and the Australian Coimtry party wenti n orderto defeat the Labour party a.t the last election. The people voted,, not against socialism, but against a bogus thing that honourable members opposite dressed up and called socialism.. Another falsehood that was voiced by honourable members opposite was that primary production had declined during the last deGade. The honourable member for Sturt( Mr Wilson) quoted some interesting figures; and I congratulate him on the way in which he presented them, but I do not agree with his statement that primary production is lower in volume to-day than it was ten monwealth Statisticianfigureswhich show substantial increases during the last ten years in the. production of wheat, oats, barley, blue and grey peas, cheese, condensed milk and like products, linseed, fresh",47,Otpekman

123,Mr Duthie,"That does not matter.fruits^ canned fruits, potatoes, onions, eggs, fresh fish and even peanuts. The Liberal party and the Australian Country party also declared during the last election campaign that the Labour party wanted to regiment the people. That statement was a wicked untruth, because a Commonwealth government has no power to regiment or conscript man-power in peace-time. Honourable members opposite also informed the electors that the Labour Government's free medicine scheme would regiment the. people, and even the British Medical Association. Of course, that statement was incorrect, but many people were deceived by it with the result that age and invalid pensioners have been deprived of the free medicine to which they are entitled. The military power of fascism, naziism and Japanese imperialism is broken, and the physical battle has ended, but a more subtle battle continues. I call it the battle of ideologies, a war of the mind, a war between way8 of life, ideas, concepts and beliefs-political , economic and social. A nation's military power may be broken, but its ideologies may survive. The fact that Christians and Jews still practise their faiths, although they were persecuted for many years, is proof that an ideology will not be destroyed by force, persecution and even torture. We should not lull ourselves into believing that, with the death of Mussolini, Hitler, the Japanese war-lords and millions of Germans and Japanese, and with the destruction of their armed might, the signing of peace treaties and the proclamation of a new constitution in Japan, the creeds and ideologies of those tyrannous regimes have been destroyed. The poison is still in the world's blood-stream. We can replace a bad ideology, bad idea or bad way of life only with a better idea or a better way of life. We must tackle the problem in that manner if our democracy is to survive. Our schools, colleges, universities, youth clubs, churches, discussion groups, libraries, films, theatres and homes must become recruiting agencies in the war of the mind and the battle of ideas in order to develop a race which knows the real meaning of democracy. By our own example we should endeavour to attain that objective. [27] ' MT. TURNBULL (Mallee) [9.5] I have always considered that the foundation on which Australia and the British Empire have been built is our basic legislation. I do not believe that legislation which is passed in this Parliament is worth the paper on which it is printed unless its foundation is right, and that is why I think that we in this House must always show our loyalty to His Majesty the ETing and to the British Oommonwealth of Nations, and must not consider it old fashioned to say that we must put our trust in God. Unfortunately, we do not hear that expression very often in this Parliament. I am convinced that the people of Anstralia desire the Government .to take the steps that it has promised to take to secure closer unity and co-operation in trade with other countries of the Empire. We require a reaffirmation and extension of Empire reciprocal trade. The Chifley Labour Government, which went out of office last December, lost sight of that urgent need as a means of strengthening the ties of Empire. If honourable members require any proof of that statement, they should examine the International Trade Organization Act which was sponsored hy the Chifley Government in 1948, and which had the approval of every member of the Labour party. That legislation provides that no new trade preference shall be granted to our kinsfolk, and that negotiations must be commenced for the reduction of existing Empire trade preferences with a view to their eventual elimination. Under that act, the United Kingdom and the Dominions are regarded as separate entities which shall not grant to one another better trade treatment than they give to foreign countries. The Chifley Government did not try to strengthen cooperation among the members of the British Commonwealth of Nations. The International Trade Organization Act gives to a conglomeration of governments and their representatives the right to determine the course of our trade. The Chifley Government gave away Australia's right in that matter. In my opinion, we can do better by running our own affairs, negotiating bi-lateral trade agreements, and encouraging trade within the Empire. A previous Labour speaker invited us to examine tbe history of the achievements of previous governments. I was tempted to do so, and I made some interesting discoveries. Erom federation until the 7th October, 1941, non-Labour governments had occupied the treasury bench in the Parliament of the Commonwealth for 32 years. Labour governments had been in office for eight years made up of various periods, and the Scullin Labour Government was in office at the beginning of the financial and early 1930's. the Labour party did not have any voice iu the administration of Australia. Let us visualize what happened in the century before Australia attained to the status of a nation. Let us think of all the trees that it is now. Cattle would fatten just as were felled, the rivers that were bridged, the railways that were built, the roads that were constructed, the houses and public buildings that were erected, the flocks and herds that were established, the extension of agricultural and pastoral pursuits, the increasing production of wheat and other cereals, the rapid progress of the dairying industry and the freedom from industrial-disputes. That will show the progress that brought Australia, to nationhood with its first 150 years. Whenever an Australian politician, regardless of the party to which he belonged, returned to Australia before 1940 from a visit abroad, he almost invariably said, "" Tbis is the greatest country in the world "". All that progress had been made under the administration of non-Labour governments, because the Labour party had been in office for only a few brief periods totalling eight years. We must not confuse with progress. Australia is now experiencing a period of great prosperity, but the country has not progressed during the last few years. The great Roman Empire and otber empires reached a high degree of prosperity, but they fell into the dust and did not rise again. tbe nations have made most progress when they have been in the most difficult straits. It is during a period of prosperity such as we are now experiencing that we must be particularly watchful, ilr. Turnbull. lest we lose all the advantage that may be gained from that prosperity, and even ictrogress. Deposits in the banks are at unprecedentedly high levels, ibut the foundation of our present prosperity was laid not by the Chifley Government, but by non-Labour governments. Australia has enjoyed, a succession of bountiful seasons for which God, and not the Labour party, is responsible. Some honourable members of the Labour party laugh at that statement, but they cannot deny its truth. My point is that a farm economic depression in the would grow as much in 1939 as it will Prior to federation, to-day, provided the seasons in the two years were approximately the same. Sheep would grow as much wool in 1939 as they grow to-day, and the sheep population of Australia was greater then than quickly in 1939 as they will to-day, and the cattle population was larger in that year than it is now. A succession of bountiful seasons and the ready market for our primary products in the waTracked countries of the world at prices that would have seemed extraordinary even in our wildest dreams of years ago, are the factors responsible for our present prosperity. The Labour Government took advantage of the prosperous conditions and taxed the primary producers very heavily, but it did not take one progressive step to assist the primary industries. It contemplated the Snowy Mountains hydroelectric scheme, and the first sod in connection with that work was turned by the latest methods at an impressive ceremony a few months ago, but that was only a preliminary move. I have often wondered where all the timber, cement and other materials required for that prosperity construction would have ibeen obtained if the Labour Government had remained in office. The honourable member for Fremantle ( Mr Beazley) tried to gloss over the position by saying that vast quantities of goods are available for consumers. In order to make his point he instanced the large turnover and profits It is a strange thing that of city emporiums. One needs only to visit the big city shops to see that only luxury lines are in plentiful supply but the people get little, if any, value from them. Most of the every-duy requirements of the people are scarce. It has been said in this House on many occasions that every one of us deplores the drift of population to the cities. ""We all greatly regret that more and more people should be attracted to the metropolitan areas. A new member sitting on the Opposition side of the House has claimed that the last Labour Government did more than any other government to bring about decentralization. I do not agree with him. In no period of eight years in the history of this Commonwealth have so many people drifted to the cities a3 were attracted to them during the regime of the last Labour Government. Many country people went to the cities to engage in the production of war materials and, having established themselves in city homes, were reluctant to return to the country centres after the war had ended. Indeed, the Labour Government encouraged them to stay in the cities. They were caught inextricably by the lure of the cities, just as if they had been placed ciliation commissioners determined that in concentration camps. knows that in present circumstances there is little or no hope that they will return to the land. Decentralization and the provision of housing in country areas should go hand in hand. I am pleased to note that the Government proposes to undertake vast developmental schemes. As a sufficient number of bouses cannot be provided from our own resources, tbe Government proposes to import houses from abroad. Though we are pleased with that decision, we want to know where the imported houses will be erected after they arrive here. The political pull of the cities has greatly increased as the result of the increase of the number of honourable members representing metropolitan constituencies. Of the thirteen new seats in Victoria, eight are in the metropolitan area and five in country centres. A similar allotment of new seats has been made in all States. Where the number of members is largest the greatest political pressure is exerted. We must fight against any attempts to prevent the erection of imported houses in country areas. If , as a start, 1,000 homes were erected in the Murray valley an additional 1,000 families would be attracted to that area. Instead of erecting imported houses in tbe metropolitan areas, where our great manufacturing plants have been established, the Government should erect them in country centres and assist in the building of factories to employ the population so housed. If the housing shortage in the cities is overcome we shall never tempt former country people or others to abandon the attraction of city lights. Houses erected in country centres will act as a magnet and attract people from the cities. A new member in his maiden speech saidThe average worker is prepared to do a fair day's work for a fair day's pay, and must not be judged by any loafer who does not pull his weight. I agree with those sentiments, but it is difficult to decide what are a fair day's work and a fair day's pay. TJnder the law of this land such matters are decided by conciliation and arbitration, but groups of workers are continually taking direct action against the law of the land. The Labour Government wbich was responsible for the appointment of conEverybody no appeal should lie against their decisions. Apparently that Government regarded its appointees to those posts -as omniscient. I know that the average Australian worker is a decent Australian citizen, yet, strangely, wage earners in every walk of life obey the laws of the land with the exception of our industrial laws. The average worker frequently flouts industrial laws because he is encouraged to rebel by Communist trade union leaders. Many workers who believe that the law should be obeyed are intimidated by their union bosses and prevented from expressing their opinions. This Government, which stands for the maintenance of law and order, has determined to defeat the aims of industrial agitators who seek to disrupt production at every opportunity. Speaking of Communists the honourable member for Port Adelaide( Mr Thompson) saidThey stand for a principle that would bring us under foreign domination. Speaking from an adjoining seat in this Parliament during the same week, the honourable member for Hunter( Mr James) saidIf the Communist party is banned we shall get away from the principles of democracy. Another member of the Opposition has said that the only way in which the menace of communism may be overcome is for tbe unionists to throw off their apathy and attend union meetings with the object of sweeping Communists from executive positions in their organizations. Our future apparently is to depend on whether or not rank and file unionists are prepared to leave the comfort of the fireside during the cold winter evenings in order to .attend the meetings of their organisations. Apparently the interests of this country are to count for nothing. In the eyes of Labour supporters, if the workers are apathetic and refuse to attend their union meetings, nothing can be done about the matter. Most Labour spokesmen have paid that if we ban communism we shall merely drive the Oommunist movement underground. I remember that when the former Prime Minister, the present Leader of the Opposition ( Mr the productive life-blood of a nation and Chifley), used those words, the right honourable member for Bradfield ( Mr maintenance of the rights of the private Hughes) saidWhere does the right honourable gentleman law.

By no stretch of the imagination can any Opposition members claim that, thc Communists, who owe allegiance to a foreign power, constitute ""the people"" of this country.

The pamphlet also saysEarly in the present election campaign there appeared a Liberal-Country party advertisement promising unrationed petrol in the event of a Liberal-Country party Government being formed. Since then the promise has been mentioned but the theme hag been played down. Why? The answer to that question is that once the Liberal party and the Australian Country party give a promise they do not need to play it up all the time. The people know that they will keep it. Honourable members interjecting, interjections. If all the interjections of one of my friends on the front Opposition bench who has not debated the motion were collected they would make a long speech. That applies also to another Opposition member. bers have asked why the Government did not raise age pensions last year when they were raised by the New Zealand Government. That was quite a valid question. I point out, however, that on the 14th June, 1949, I asked the then Treasurer ( Mr Chifley) whether his Government intended to increase the rate of invalid and age pensions and, if so, whether the increase would be between 3s. and 5s. a week, as had been suggested in the press, or whether the Government would ensure that the new rate would have some practical relation to the cost of living. The right honourable gentleman, in his reply, saidThe law provided at one time that pension rates must be related to the cost of living and bushel. A consumer subsidy takes the must rise or fall according to variations of the cost-of-living index figures. However, when C series index figures fell about three years ago, there was a great protest against any reduction of pensions. As a result, the provision that related pensions to the cost of living was removed from the law. Therefore, the pension rates aTe not now affected by the cost of living. tion of the House. Why an honourable member should ask this Government why pension rates were not raised so long ago I cannot understand. I now read from a Digest of Decisions and Announcements and Important Speeches by the Prime Mmister (The Bight Honourable J. B. Chifley), which was printed by the authority of the Government PrinterTHE GOVERNMENT. On 7th December, 1949, the Prime Minister( Mr Chifley) broadcast over the national network. Mr Chifley said* * * * * In deciding how you shall record your vote, 1 know that you w ill give regard to the sort of Australia in which you want your children to live. It will be noted that the right honourable gentleman did not say, "" I hope you will give"" or "" I think you w ill "" but "" I know you will give regard to the sort of Australia in which you want your children to live "". The people gave due regard to that. He was absolutely right in every detail. The honourable member for Fremantle said that inflation was caused largely by the amount of money that was being received by tbe primary producers. How many people on a decent wage in this country would have taken the place of wheat-growers in my electorate a few years ago during the drought, when thc dust storms wrought havoc and they had nothing to live on? We have now had three good years and some money has come in. The honourable memher for Fremantle said that the wheat-growers are getting to-day from 16s. to 19s. a bushel for their wheat. That is just as true as the statement that the wage-earner is receiving from £16 to £19 a week. It is only a half truth. The wheat-growers are to-day subsidizing the people of Australia. The wheat that is sold to the Australian people costs them 6s. 8d. a price up to 7s. l d . gross, which is the cost",55,Otpekman

127,Mr Turnbull,"Honorabl e memof production. The return to the grower from all sales at the peak of world prices averaged in the vicinity of 10s. per bushel. Yet an honourable member without practical knowledge tells the Australian people that the wheat-grower is getting from 16s. to 19s. a bushel. That, false propaganda should be corrected immediately. The wheat-growers are entitled to what they get because of the bad years that they have had and which must recur. Any honourable member who objected would show a lack of practical knowledge and a. lack of experience to anticipate what will happen in the future. The honourable member for Wilmot has said that we cannot do this or'that because the Constitution will not permit it to be done. It is a great thing for responsible persons to say, "" The people are safe with us because we are like lions in a cage, and cannot get out, but if we do get a ?ha.nce to get away from thc Constitution we shall bring certain things into effect, just as the lion would eat the keeper who looked after him "". On the subject of compulsory military training, I believe that it is every man's duty to protect his country in time of war, and every government's duty to see that its defenders shall be properly trained and equipped. Some people who seek world, peace say that, we must lead the way by bringing about disarmament. We want peace, but until those people cau convince countries sucb as Bussia that they must give some practical indication of other than war-like intentions, I cannot see any reason for this country ceasing to prepare to protect itself. I thank honourable members for having listened with such attention, and I hope to be with them again in later debates. Mr Speaker, I tender to. you my congratulations on your election to the Speakership of this House. I believe that a display of courage and dignity by the Chair is even more necessary to-day than it, has been in the long history of parliasignificant as one might believe, because, mentary institutions, because to-day this parliamentary institution is under heavier fire than it has been for a century or more. I congratulate, also, those honourable members on the opposite side of the House who bave delivered their maiden speeches in this House. I was particularly impressed by the opening remarks of the honourable member for Wilmot( Mr Duthie), who stated that the function of the Opposition was to examine the legislation fairly, squarely and critically and that it would carry out that function. It was very interesting to note that the honourable member for Wilmot, having developed that constructive, reasonable, and dignified approach, then drifted on to a theme that has run like a pattern through almost every speech from the Opposition benches. Almost every Opposition speaker has devoted a considerable portion of his time to demonstrating why he and his colleagues arc sitting in Opposition and not in the seat of government. It was suggested fairly early in the debate, I think, that that was due to a not unnatural dislike of being evicted from the government benches and could be likened somewhat to crying over spilt milk. I do not believe that. The honourable inember for Wilmot credited the Liberal party and the Australian Country party with a superb organization. I think that that credit was merited, but, at tbe same time, it does seem to me that the reason why elmost every member of the Labour party has advanced a number of reasons for the defeat of that party is to be found in the figures cited by the honourable member for Wilmot, which show that the Labour party received 46.7 per cent, of the total number of votes recorded, wbich was considerably less than the percentage that it received in 1946. If one can pay any attention to gallup poll findings-and recent history bas proved they cannot be disregarded-on e recently taken makes it evident that the drift away from the extreme left continues, because it revealed a further swing of 4 per cent, away from the Labour socialist party. Consequently, the statement of the honourable member for Wilmot that the Liberal and Australian Country parties won twenty seats by less than 1,000 votes is not so if another election were held, we should get a further 4 per cent., and would hold 32 seats, 25 of which, on those figures, must have majorities exceeding froin 1,250 to 1,500.' Wby this disastrous",57,Prime Minister S Election Final Appeal
128,Mr Davis (Deakin) [9.40],"First,election result from the Labour party's point of view? There is one reason for it, and that is the plan which holds together thc hard core of the Labour movement. The only possible explanation is that the Labour party has relinquished all hope of capturing the swinging middle-class vote. The honourable member for Wilmot indicated the pattern of Labour policy when he said that the Opposition would keep attacking tbe Government parties in tbe bope that it would regain the favour of the electors within three years, six years, or nine years. That is the reason for the outcry about finance and falsehoods. Those honourable members who have made such charges know perfectly well that they are not valid. The defeat of the Labour Government at the general election arose from three factors. The first of these was the faith in the hearts and minds of hundreds of thousands of people who worked for the success of the Liberal party and the Australian Country party. The second was the desertion by the Chifley Government of the people who had elected it to power. During the last few years, it has become a truism that the middle class is a "" vanishing race"". That was the second factor that helped to bring about the defeat of the Labour party. Members of tbe Opposition have frequently suggested that there is a r if t between the parties that form this Government, but the third and most significant factor that led to the Labour party's defeat was a greater split in its ranks than has ever occurred or eould occur in the ranks of the united Government parties, whose broad principles are identical. Those facts explain why members of the Opposition are whistling for tbe wind. Tho honourable member for Adelaide( Mr Chambers) adopted an extraordinary course when he invited the House to consider the historical background of the Labour party. He claimed that a fear of insecurity had grown in the minds of the workers as tbe result of their treatment over the years. Any fear that haunts the minds of the workers to-day has been implanted by members of the Labour party. Anybody who has listened attentively to the speeches made by honourable members of the Opposition during this debate must realize that that is nothing less than the absolute truth. Mr Davis. Then the honourable member for Adelaide followed the well-worn track of Labour party speakers back over the years to the depression. He dealt with that subject in the suave manner that is characteristic of members of the Opposition. Members of the Labour party had no monopoly of sorrow and suffering during the depression. I suffered poverty and hunger then, and I am here to-day, on this side of the House, because of those experiences. There can be no hope of a prosperous future for Australia if we allow the natural development of the nation to be fettered and restrained by the actions of incompetent socialist theorists. The honourable member for'Adelaide also dealt with the familiar theme of putting value back into the £1. Like some of his well-meaning but misguided colleagues, he was under the impression that it would be possible to stop the rot of eight years in eight weeks. His knowledge of economics obviously is not so great as that of the honourable member for Eremantle ( Mr Beazley) and the honourable member for Yarra( Mr Keon). From what the honourable member for Fremantle said earlier in the debate, I am sure that he would agree with me if he were here now. One of the important passages in the Governor General's Speech was as follows:In all developmental plans my advisers will pay attention to the importance of achieving a well-balanced -pattern of decentralization. The right honourable member for Barton (Dr. Evatt) spoke fluently and with force last night about the considerable development that had taken place in Australia under eight years of Labour rule. I would not disagree with the right honourable gentleman. His statements on this subject were true up to a point, but, unfortunately they were not complete. I should not have the temerity to charge him with lack of knowledge, but apparently he overlooked one aspect of development that is of vital importance. Perhaps some protective growth develops over the eyes of all ardent and enthusiastic socialists and blinds them to such facts. The right honourable gentleman discussed the imposing degree of industrial development that had occurred as the result of war-time necessity, good seasons, and the .post-war expansion of overseas markets for secondary products. He did not tell the House that, as that pyramid of industrial development arose, so primary production decreased in proportion. He did not point out that, although the number of workers in industry increased by 500,000 between 1939 and 1949, the number of rural workers decreased by 60,000 over the same period. Neither did he mention the fact disclosed by the census figures that, although city and provincial populations increased by approximately 1,000,000 over tbe fourteen years from 1933 to 1947, rural population decreased by about 27,000 over the same period. In order to provide concrete support for those almost fantastic figures, I refer to another indication of the drift away from primary production that may be more readily appreciated by members of the Opposition. In one small outer metropolitan area in the electorate that I represent there were 22 small farms in 1942 devoted to dairying, mixed farming, market gardening and so forth. Only two of those farms are left to-day. The remainder of the area has been devoted to grazing. That illustrates the effectof the drift, which the right honourable gentleman acknowledged but which he claimed to be desirable. Tbe scarcity of labour and the shortages of wire, machinery and other items essential to successful primary production that were mentioned by the honourable member for Sturt( Mr with some eloquence and authority to the Wilson) are making conditions for small primary producers almost insupportable. Many honourable members talk about number of man-hours involved in erecting inflation to-day as though it were some a home had increased, on the average, abstract problem. The honourable member by 30 per cent, during the last ten years. for Fremantle devoted a considerable Expressed in terms of inflation, that portion of his speech to a reasoned and fact means that 130 man-hours are used constructive analysis of certain economic for 100 hours' worth of production. facts; but, like hiscolleagues, he had Thus, the inflationary spiral is shaking to toe the party line.

He discussed the the opportunity to own its own home. various factors that had brought about Surely the present state of affairs does inflation in Australia, and mentioned not indicate any eagerness on the part particularly the accumulation of overseas of the trade unions or the Labour party balances that had been a major cause to help people to become home-owners. of inflation. In simple terms, tbe degree Our economy has become unbalanced durof the inflationary spiral depends basically ing the last ten years. We have full emupon the ratio of goods available to the ployment but we lack full production. We money available. If the amount of money have money, but we lack the goods that in the hands of the people increases and could be bought with the money. That the volume of goods available is reduced, no economic measures can check the inflationary spiral. That is what has happened in Australia. The situation has also been affected by a number of factors that honourable members opposite have not mentioned. Perhaps it is not their function to mention such things. An increase of production is not the only solution of the problem, important though it may be. The factors that affect production are many and varied. One of these is the number of workers engaged in industrial disputes because, while the men are idle, they are consuming but are not producing and therefore are increasing the inflationary tendency. According to the latest figures that I have been able to obtain, the proportion of workers involved in disputes in Australia in 1948 was 13 per cent. By contrast, the figure in the TJnited States was a little less than 4 per cent, and in Great Britain it was a little less than %\ per cent. In other words, the proportion of workers engaged in disputes in that year was four times as high in Australia as it was in the TJnited States of America and Great Britain. Recent surveys have confirmed those general figures. The honourable member for Denison( Mr Townley) referred earlier to-day subject of housing. Recent investigations have confirmed the opinion that was expressed a few months ago that the may be an over-generalization. Collectively we have the money and collectively we have some kinds of goods. But the important fact, which cannot be overemphasized, is that those goods are not essential to the balanced development of the country. There is a disproportionate production of luxury goods which helps little towards the development of this eountry. That is indicated in the figures cited by the right honourable member for Barton (Dr. Evfitt). Al l sorts of minor luxury industries have been established at the expense of the primary industries. His Excellency referred to the matter of rural development. I have indicated the great need for some policy on that matter. ""When considering a policy in detail, I hope that the Government may be able to give much thought to the needs of primary producers in relation to roads, which are essential for the transport of their goods und the development of their farms. Boads are particularly needed in those areas outback in the hills which are difficult enough of access at any time, but which were made much more difficult by the action of the Chifley Government in shutting its eyes cruelly and cynically to the needs of the people in those places. T hope that the matter of roads for country people will be given favorable consideration. The building of roads to-day does not involve man-power as much as it involves machinery. The next point with which I shall deal i.s the sweeping statement by many honourable members opposite that the Communists should not be banned. The honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr Clyde Cameron) leaned across his desk in his very impressive manner and said that the unions would fight, and if the Government wanted to take that as a threat it could do so. Tbat was an illustration of the general approach to the matter by honourable members opposite. Tbe honourable member for Yarra( Mr Keon) is one of the few meu who has fought against the Communists at some risk to himself. He said that communism was not confined to industry, but that there were Communists in the universities, in the professions, and amongst the school teachers. He also said that some were even in the churches. It is easy to say that the causes that produce Mr Davis. communism should be removed. The inference is that those causes are purely economic. However, on the evidence put forward on the recognized authority of the bonorable member for Yarra the causes are not all economic. Honourable members opposite who have addressed themselves with fire and vigour to the matter of banning the Communists have said that they should be fought in the unions.. Some unions have been successful in fighting Communists, but others have not. The whole strength of the Labonr party and of the non-Communist union officials has not been sufficient to put the Communists out of the unions, .in view of the possibility of danger that faces this country, the Government cannot afford to leave the fight against communism in such shaky hands. Some honourable members, by their own words, bring into being the forces that are the cause of ooni'munism, even while they are suggesting that they should be removed. Many honourable members opposite who addressed themselves to i this matter indulged in a stirring up of bitter class hatred. They put into the minds and the hearts of the men who listened to them, and who follow them, bitterness, not only against the boss, but. also against society as we know it. Thcy bave transformed thc minds of those people into fertile fields for fructifying the seed of communism. They have done it, I believe, in all honesty, because they are stone-age men in an atomic age. ""Forty years ago I knew many of the men who built tbe Laboui1 party, and they were men of a differentcalibre from many of those whom I have listened to in this House. Honourable members opposite have not changed their technique over the Jast 40 years and any one who cares to read Hansard will find tbe proof of that. They are using the same technique that was found successful in the early days, when conditions were very different from what they are now. That technique has been used to maintain in power men who have heen unable to evolve modern techniques to meet the Communist menace. They are fighting the atomic bomb with the bow and arrow. It is reasonable and proper for the Government to put forward the views contained in His Excellency's Speech. It is said that the Government will give to the rank and file of the unionists an opportunity to conduct their own affairs freely and in secrecy. The Government will meet arid fight the Communist menace. I suggest that it would be failing in its duty and its responsibility to the people if it did not take just that attitude. If I could be assured that the Communists could be fought by the Labour party with a modern techniqueand I know how sincerely some of my friends in the Labour party fight-then I should be one of many on this side of the House who would back it, and the trade unions, in that fight. But we all know that however much they try, they cannot win such a fight. Communists can be put out of unions here and there but not generally throughout industry. This House knows that somebody must defend the country against this new form of aggression. In conclusion, I submit that the Government parties were put into this House because the people overwhelmingly supported the policy presented to them by the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies). This Government has a mandate to carry out that policy. That mandate and the policy have been expressed in the Speech of His Excellency, and if the Opposition will confine itself to the admirable course of action outlined by the honourable member for Wilmot of criticizing and analysing in a constructive fashion, and co-operating with the Government in the measures that are directed not against Labour, but against the Communist menace, then it will make as great a contribution to Australia's welfare than the great men who first formed the Labour party. . adjourned. HOUR OF MEETING. Minister) [10.13] I move That the House, at its rising, adjourn to obtain. The Prime Minister and the to-morrow, at 2.30 p.m. I submit this motion because half-past ten in the morning is the usual meeting time of the House on Thursdays. This afternoon a meeting of the Standing Orders Committee was held and managed to arrive at a great deal of agreement. Two or three outstanding matters still have to be discussed. It is very desirable that the House should have presented to it a set of Standing Orders that represents the agreed opinion of the Standing Orders Committee, if that be possible. I think that it is possible. But if we are to exhaust that possibility we should meet to-morrow morning. Therefore, it is desirable that the House should not meet until tomorrow afternoon. For that reason I have moved to that effect. To honourable members opposite I say that I have conferred with the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Chifley), who is agreeable to this motion. Question resolved in the aflirmative. That the House do now adjourn. -Being a comparatively innocent and unsophisticated new member, it has occurred to me that the time may be appropriate to put a query to the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies), but I deliberately exclude him and the Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Holt) from any implied reproof that my question may contain. Is it fair that we new members on this side of the House, having an insatiable thirst for knowledge, should, when we ask questions of Ministers in an endeavour to satisfy that thirst, meet sometimes with a downright rebuff, and sometimes with a scowl or a sneer? I am aware that the Standing Orders define in general terms what may be done by the Minister who is questioned, and by the honourable member who asks the question. However, I , in common with some other honourable members, am an Oliver Twist in my search for knowledge. When we ask questions we want information. I know that the information is sometimes difficult to obtain. At times it may be impossible to Minister for Labour and National Service have always frankly and readily given in answers to questions such information as was at their disposal, provided it was of a nature that could be divulged, and did not bear upon matters of policy.

132,Mr Mullens (Gellibrand) [10.15j.,"demeanour of the Minister for Health( Sir Earle Page). When I asked him a question recently, he approached the table with a look of ineffable scorn on bis face. He seemed to be immediately on the defensive, and his attitude suggested that he was saying to himself, "" What is this bounder aiming at ?"" Then he scornfully told me, in effect, that my question did not matter one iota. bers opposite say, ""Hear, hear!"" But note the difference when a question is asked by a Government supporter. When a question was addressed to the Minister for Transport ( Mr Beale) by one of the solid phalanx of Government supporters, he answered in a friendly voice that every avenue would be explored to obtain the information, which would be supplied to the honourable member in due course. The suggestion was that the honourable member's question was the quintessence of wisdom. Another Minister, when asked a question, approaches the table like a prancing peacock. have said like a dancing dervish. dervish, either. I know what that is, too. the remark. I trust that the Prime Minister will see that new members shall be given the information that is their due. The questions directed to him and his Ministers are not asked in a frivolous spirit. The constituents of Gellibrand desire to know the answers to the questions that I ask, and I , to. the limit of my ability, will try to ensure that they shall get the information. Minister) [10.19] -in replyI am, indeed, profoundly moved by the remarks of the honourable member for Gellibrand ( Mr Mullens).
