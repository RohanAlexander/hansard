The official report of the speech of the honourable member for Nepean will be handed to the Justice of the H i gh Court who will act as Commissioner. He will be asked to investigate the charges made in that speech, and to report concerning it to the Governor General. Minister of Defence inquire into the rumour that eight union barbers who have been sent to a training camp in Victoria are charging more than the award rates for haircutting and shaving, and if so, will he take steps to prevent the soldiers from being exploited ? into the matter. ments of Professor Sentoul and others, which suggest that Australia is not doing her duty in contributing to the defence of the Empire, will the Prime Minister make a statement as to the number of Australian soldiers at the front , and the number who are doing their' duty locally, and furnish the same information regarding the other parts of the Empire? so, though I doubt the wisdom of making this information public. I merely p u t in a word for the Commonwealth, and apparently it is resented. Minister of Defence promised to obtain for me information regarding the conditions under which business concessions in the trading camps are granted. Is he in a position to make a statement on the subject ? to inquire concerning the method of selling goods in the training camps, and the conditions under which these sales were permitted, and I am now supplied with the following information: The method governing sale of goods at Liverpool Camp is as follows:The Regimental Institute at Liverpool Camp is conducted by Messrs. Doran and Tressider under the following conditions:All goods sold at Sydney prices, plus the cost of freight to Liverpool; contractors to contribute f 150 per month to regimental funds for every 1,000 men in camp. Price-lists of goods being approved by the District Commandant, and placed in the canteen for the informatiou I have not consulted of the purchasers. At Broadmeadows and Seymour Camps, troops are supplied by the Regimental Institute, which is governed by trustees, the Camp Commandant, and Honourable R. G. Wilson, appointed by special authority of the Minister. Tea, scones,"" &c, are allowed to be sold by the Young Men's Christian Association and other religious bodies. Certain hawkers and hairdressers are allowed to trade by special authority of the Minister. At Enoggera Camp it is believed that similar conditions obtain. Inquiries are, however, being made by telegram. MrJ . H . CATTS -I u the event of the Government of New South Wales finding it necessary to import butter to make good an ascertained shortage in the State, will the Commonwealth Government remit the duty on the butter so i m I shall make inquiries ported so that the price of this article may not be unduly increased to the In view of the statepeople of New South Wales? be given to questions like this.

Honourable members know that after it has been indicated that a loan is to be raised, the least said about the matter the better, u n t i l the time is ripe for referring to it again. I think that that is a recosnised principle.'

Prime Minister whether a decision has yet been arrived at in regard to the appointment of another responsible Defence Ministeri n this House? to ask Parliament to sanction the creation of an additional Minister, who may be termed the Ministerf o r the Navy, or the Minister of Marine. This w ill free the Minister of Defencef r o m a considerable amount of work.

A more definite arrangement can be made later.

May I also say that the Government consider present circumstances in dicate that we have arrived at a time when we ought to do something more. I think that the Government should in troduce and pass through this Parliament a B ill to enable us to make a register of 'all males between such ages as fit them to help the country. I also think we should ascertain from the people of the Commonwealth their condition as regards wealth, and as to all their possessions. It is reasonable, having regard to the present circumstances, that we should be in possession of all these facts, so that we may be able, organized and equipped, to face any situation, and be ready for ister's statement as regards the collection the people refer to females as well as males? time ago that I thought that if we were to mobilize at all we should include the wealth of all our citizens. a question to the Prime Minister, Mr. Speaker, I should like to be permitted to make a brief statement relative to the announcement just made by the right honourable gentleman. I wish to say that the Opposition have heard of the decision of the Government with the greatest possible pleasure. It seems that at last we are really bending our backs to the very serious trouble that confronts us, and I want the right honourable gentleman to understand that anything the Opposition can do to help h'im to bear the tremendous responsibilities he has to carry w ill be cheerfully done. The Prime Minister can count on our f u l l support in putting through any of the propositions to which he has referred, so f a r as we understand them. I do not quite understand his reference to the mobilizaA s the questions tion of the wealth of the country, b u t as to his other proposals-the numbering of the men of the community, the creation of an additional portfolio, and any other matter necessary to the prosecution of the war-h e need not anticipate any serious criticism from this side of the House.

I now ask the Prime Minister whether he and his party have considered this point ? gentleman refer to the Tariff? in particular, but also to any other contentious business. party matter on this side of the House. side. feeling in the country that while the Tariff may not be a party matter on either side; the discussion of it may create the citizen's parentage and the place of an atmosphere that would have as bad an effect as bitter party strife. Furtherthat any honest citizen would care to give more, there are circumstances which would make a postponement of the discussion of the Tariff a most valuable consideration. I shall not attempt to dogmatize on the question of shutting up Parliament. At this time of crisis Parliament must be prepared to meet at any time. when it need not sit, and I hope that there will be one such period very soon, but financial and other considerations demand that it must meet from time to time, even if it be only for the purapart from Ministers and the gentlemen who propose to assist them, an opportunity to give expression to the views they may hold. An arrangement may be made on the lines I have indicated, hai when we meet next week we should be in a better position to deal with that aspect of the matter. pardoned for saying that honourable members heard with the utmost gratification the statement which the Prime Minister made a few minutes ago, indicating that hisGovernment propose to bring in -steps for the compulsory statistical registration of the forces of the community in money and men, in order to prosecute the war. I wish to ask him whether the information to be supplied on the registration form will state whether the citizen is married or single, the number of children each man has, and each person's occupation; also whether if the citizen is no longer of an age rendering him capable of taking part at the front, he -is willing to devote himself to work in any capacity in which he may be called upon to serve, in order to further the cause we all have at heart? that information, and probably more. While we possibly could proceed under the powers given in the War Precautions Act, we"" should have, I think, a separate Bill which would prescribe the exact information that we require each citizen to supply. By adopting this proceeding nothing will be uncertain, and the power will not be exercised beyond the direct authority of Parliament. ' The information to be supplied should include birth'of his parents, also every particular to the counsels of the Nations at such a time as this. The information we shall require as to wealth possessed will not be more than can be obtained confidentially at any time, and will not be used for political purposes. Above all, this census will not be used for the purposes There may be periods of conscription. That will not be its aim.

The following paper was presented: Northern Territory -Ordinanc e of 1915, No. 4-District Council. ister of Home Affairs) [3.36] I move That this Bill be now read a second time. I do nob think there is any necessity to say very much in support of this motion. The measure is a very amall one, and w ill , I think, receive the support of honourable members on both sides of the House. Ib has already received the approval of the Senate, and is drafted in conformity with the legislation passed by the Parliament Three hundred and thirty-three inof New South Wales. The subject-matter of the B ill is familiar to honourable members who have been in this Parliament for a number of years, and to all persons who take a keen interest in public affairs. It is not surprising that, shortly after the creation of this Federal Parliament, there was a feeling amongst members, and amongst the community at large, that a Capital City should be created in Federal Territory, to be gradually buil t up by votes of Parliament from time to time. This is in no sense a party quest i o n ; the establishment of the Federal Capital is the accepted policy of the King's Government in Australia, and one The answers to Cabinet after another has dealt with the project. Contemporaneous with the discussion of the creation of a Federal Territory and a Capital City the opinion was expressed that the National Capital should be served by a national port. Obviously in carrying out the duties that were intrusted to us under the. Federal Constitution it was necessary that we should look at the proposed site of the Federal Capital from the point of view of the future possibilities' of a port. As honourable members will understand, owing to the position of the Capital Territory itself, attention had to be turned in another direction, and after somewhat extended ' negotiations the Federal port of Jervis Bay was created. An Act which was assented to on the 20th February, 1915, was passed by the New South Wales Parliament, providing for the surrender to the Commonwealth of the Territory at Jervis Bay. It was provided that the agreement respecting the surrender of the land would not be binding u n t i l parliamentary action had been taken by both State and Commonwealth. TheB ill which is now before this House provides in a corresponding way for the acceptance of the Territory referred to in the New South Wales Act. May I point out to honourable members New South Wales Parliament may be made immediately operative by proclamation ? WhatI am now asking the House to do is to pass this B ill giving the Federal Government power to accept this Territory from the Government of New South Wales uDon the proclamation being issued.

The Royal Australian Naval College is situated within the area referred to in this B ill , and in due course other buildings, such as dockyards, & c , will be constructed within the Territory, which will come under the provisions of the Commonwealth laws, such as the Commonwealth Arbitration A ct and other measures. acceptance of this'Territory will operate will be fixed by proclamation, which w ill be made at the earliest possible moment. In the concluding section of the B ill will be found a provision under the Lands Acquisition Act designed to prevent private individuals from obtaining any advantage in the way of unearned in crement. much more to be said on the subject. I have brought down a map showing the disposition of the Territory, and I may explain that on this map the area over which the State has agreed to grant to the Commonwealth sovereign rights is shown by pink border; the area transferred under the Seat of Government Acceptance Act 1909 is coloured blue; the area purchased from tlie State-abou t 5,000 acres -is coloured p in k ; land acquired from private owners-Gazett e No. 34, 1st May, 1915-is coloured green; land excised from Mr Beale's inferior lease is coloured purple; and land' held by Mr Octavius Charles Bealej under inferior land lease No. 155, is coloured brown. The total area of the Territory involved is about 15,000 acres. I would like to explain by way of anticipating any criticism that may come in this direction that, though I have seen references suggesting that Mr Beale was a man engaged in speculation, and that he had obtained land at Jervis Bayi n the hope of getting some benefit out of it , because Jervis Bay was likely to become Federal Territory, the fact is that this land was acquired by Mr Beale long before the Commonwealth had any idea of acquiring land at Jervis Bay. there. holding is not very great, but I think it is only fair that I sliould anticipate any criticism in thisdirection by stating what is a well-known fact, so far as the Department is concerned, regarding Mr Beale's holding. of the Territory you intend to take overt there are employed building the Naval College. As far as I know there is nobody else. there ? The date upon which the that there are any original settlers there. There may be; but when I visited the Territory I did not come across any. Practically the whole population is engaged on work in connection with the Naval College, and upon the other works that are being carried on there. I do not know that it is necessary for me to make any further reI do not know tliat there is marks on the matter. TheB ill is not one upon which honourable members can go very far wrong. It Tefeis to purely a business deal. The Government and Parliament of New South Wales, after some negotiations, agreed to transfer this Territory to the Commonwealth, and the Territory may be transferred as soon as the Government of New South Wales issue the necessary proclamation. All we have to do is to pass this B ill enabling the Territory to be accepted. I have no doubt that the B ill will receive that cordial support that any measure of this character deserves. hope the House will pass this measure without delay. It would have been submitted to Parliament by the late Government but for the fact that the Legislative Council of New South Wales defeated a similar proposition put before it by the New South Wales Government at that time. The Parliament of New South Wales is now united upon the subject of the transfer which it is essentially in our interests to accept. I hope thab the Minister, now that he has the question before him, will not overlook the possibility of providing railway connection between Nowra and the Naval College. considering that question now. about 15 miles. than that.

In the first place, we have to consider the enormous cost of defending such a place, because a dockyard is a very vital point, which must be defended with both fortifications, and a garrison to prevent 'any landing expedition. W it h the Citizen Forces such as we have, and the isolated situat i o n of this Territory, the maintenance of ""a permanent garrison at Jervis Bay would entail an expense out of all proportion to the advantage likely to be gained by the erection of a dockyard there. Therefore, at the present time we are not in the position to bind ourselves as to what we shall do in regard to the naval development of the port. But, in the interests of the College, we should endeavour to obtain railway connection, and I think that it might be got by the Commonwealth consenting to pay the ordinary running charges on the line, with reasonable deductions for the improvement of the value of the State land through which it would pass.

78,Mr Joseph Cook (Parramatta),"from whom we can hear directly what is being done. I make that suggestion to the Prime Minister, but I do not know what is in his mind. In my judgment, we need, above all things, to have just now a Minister to keep an oversight on what is going on in all the States, and no Minister can do that unless he travels to the States. to be appointed do something in that respect ? that it will. We want a Minister who will see that the camps are kept up to a proper standard of efficiency. We need to have a Minister who will take care that instructions in regard to the military camps are carried out. In order to be able to do that, he must see for himself that things are done. We may appeal in vain, I think, to officials, who are already overworked and overburdened in the training of troops, and in regard to all war preparations, for that detailed inspection that is so necessary just now. The Minister should have at his elbow responsible officers to see to this. I , therefore, put it that in some way or other the discharge of these functions should be associated with the portfolio which the Prime Minister proposes to create. I can only hop© that the proposal will be attended with all that is good. ister and Treasurer) [4.45] I think I can make a statement on the subject which will be of assistance to the Leader of the Opposition and to honourable members generally. An Acting or Assistant Minister is under disadvantages in some respects, because he does not wish to speak for the Minister unless he does so directly with tlie Minister's knowledge. therefore, proposed to create another Minister of Defence. For the sake of convenience we may call him the Minister of Marine or the Minister of the Navy. called the Minister of War. That title would be more appropriate to the duties thab he would be given to do. he is called so long as he does the work? Minister of Munitions. Ministers in the Defence Department working most amicably hand in hand, but a new portfolio is to be created now, and Mr Jensen will be the new Minister has been the greatest harmony between him, as Assistant Minister, and the Minister of Defence, but he has felt-and it is to his credit to say it-that he did not care to usurp the functions of the Minister, who, heaven knows, has had difficulties enough with which to contend. In the circumstances, he, rightly, I think, has erred, in so far as he has erred at all, on the side of reserve. In future, both Ministers will work together. other will know. change. Minister of Defence will come into this chamber at times? interchange in their Departments, especially in these times of crisis, so that one will be entirely conversant with the actions of the other. That must be the case, because their business will interlock. No matter how much Defence may be divided, even if divided among four or five Ministers, it will still remain one unit; and though each Minister will be responsible for his own. branch, the two must work together, otherwise the appointment of another Minister would be useless HOW ? by appointing another Minister? Will they work together any better? It is, and at the same time do justice to oneself, is a very difficult matter.

96,Mr Fisher,"Henceforth , I canfrom my own knowledge, I have the assurance of the Minister of Defence that this new appointment will be of great help to him, and will free both Ministers to a much greater extent than is possible under the present circumstances. In regard to the proposed Committee, I see no reason why it should not be constituted as soon as the Opposition can appoint its representatives. There will be eight members'from the House of Eepresentatives and four from the Senate, there, being two members from each State of the Commonwealth; and there will be an equal number from both political parties. There will thus be fair representation. Each State of the Commonwealth and each political party will be equally represented. We could have nothing better than that, and when we have tried this experiment, we shall discover very soon whether we have, or have not, arrived at something beneficial to the interests of the Commonwealth. Mr J. H . CATTS (Cook) [4.51] I welcome the proposal for the creation of another Department. I am opposed to the system of having Honorary Ministers, because I believe that if there is work to be done by a Government it should be divided up in such a way as to give a Department to each Minister, «who should be held responsible for it. We cannot get efficiency unless we make a man responsible for the work of those under his control. The Minister who is to control this new Department has, as far as we have come into touch with it, done his work well, and I hope our expectations of him will be fully realized. In dealing with questions he must have felt it his duty, in Really, there are four divisions of order that he and Senator Pearce might work together amicably, to try to anticipate the mind of the latter, instead of giving the results of his own independent judgment. For a long time it has been ap-. parent that the work of the Defence Department is too much for one man, and the Government have been made aware of my views on this matter. To any careful observer, it has been quite evident that Senator Pearce. who is extremely painstaking in regard to details, has had too much to do. TEe work has been beyond him. What is needed in the Defence Department to-day is organization of work, and, as far as possible, the dis[172] tribution of responsibility. The work of the Department could, if necessary, be segregated into different Departments. First, the work of raising an army to send to the front, of maintaining it there, of raising reinforcements to keep it to its original strength, and, if possible, of securing recruits, in order to make up a much larger force, Second, in regard to munitions and equipment, it has been apparent for a long time that much more could be done than has been done in respect of obtaining munitions and equipment. Third, the administration of the Navy is a big undertaking. Though our Navy is not operating round the coast of Australia, our vessels have to return to the base at Sydney constantly. We see no reportsi in the newspapers as to their having to do this; but I seldom go to Sydney at the weekend without seeing one of these vessels in the harbour close to Garden Island or Cockatoo Island. The question of the administration of the great naval establishments is a very important one. If Cockatoo Island has been able to assemble war vessels, it may be, and I hope it will be, that this great establishment will be able to build war vessels. There is also important work at Garden Island, and there are other works in different parts of the Commonwealth. A ll these matters will provide ample scope for the business acumen and ability of the Minister who is to take charge of the Navy. Fourth, the administration of our Citizen Forces under our compulsory training Statute also entails a tremendous amount of detailed work. Defence, which, if necessity arose, could be separated. I do«not say that necessity has arisen for the creation of four Ministers of Defence, but it is certainly not because of any difficulty in the matter of segregation that we have not had another Minister of'Defence before. A few days ago the Leader of the Opposition stated that he thought we should have a Minister to go round the training camps as a sort of travelling inspector. The Leader of the Opposition certainly misapprehends the functions of a Minister. A Minister sliould be an organizer, the man who sets forces in motion. Such a man could not be wandering all over the country dealing, with hosts, of details could give one of the Honorary Ministers and minor, complaints. It would be a the opportunity to show what hecan do. simple matter for a Minister to secure a Whilst we are told that Ministers are competent man for that work, and if it \ overworked; we find that Senator Gardiner desired that it should not be undertaken is without' any Department to administer. by, a military officer-if some one other tlmn, a military officer undertook these work. ii,i6p,ec.la,on§,. some one not under the authority of, military o;ffiicials or depenbusy. dent upon them for advancement, it wpjild be a good thing:-it should be poshas charge of the Electoral ^Departsible to get half-ardozen business men capment.

The same disability as now obtains will continue. I should like the new Minister to be able to speak with authority on military matters, such as the organization of the camps of training, the despatch of troops, and all tlie other conditions relating to our Forces, without being obliged to consult the Minister of Defence on every point. If the new Minister be merely Minister for the Navy, and questions are put to him upon military subjects, he will very likely reply that he will bring the matters before the Minister. Miuister so arrange the portfolios that the Minister for the Navy may speak with authority on all defence matters without being obliged to wait for advice from the Minister of Defence? I concurred in the creation of this additional portfolio. We are all anxious to assist the Government in every way possible; but I am afraid that, even when this portfolio is created, we shall be at the same disadvantage as at present in regard to t h e obtaining of military information. Could, we not merely create an additional portfolio and leave the distribution of the Departments to the Government ? of the Minister by anything we may do in the House.

To my mind, the proper title to be given to the new Minister for the time being would be Minister of War. That title could be altered at a subsequent date when other duties were allocated to him. title of the Minister of Defence? Minister of Defence all the duties he discharges in normal times. They are quite sufficient for one man to undertake, but 1 would allocate to the Minister of War the duties of supervising the camps of training, the organization of equipment and munitions, and the transport of troops to the seat of war. If those duties were placed upon the new Minister, we should know definitely whom we'should hold responsible. The Ministry of Defence has always been a busy portfolio, and the duties attached to it would be quite sufficient for one man to attend to, even if he were relieved of all war work such as I have referred to. Some honourable members may have the idea that the appointment of a Minister of War would derogate from the responsibility of the Minister of Defence. at the present time, you subordinate the Minister of Defencei n public opinion to the Minister of War. could make it perfectly clear that there is no desire on the part of this House to in any way reduce the status of the Minister of Defence. sede the Minister of Defence? to so separate the duties . of the two Ministers that we should get effective responsibility from each individual in his own Department. I say, in all seriousness, that I do not think the scheme will work if two Ministers are made jointly responsible for the same duties. While the Minister of Defence and the Minister of War could, and no doubt would, consult together in the interests of the Government and the country, it would be unwise to have dual responsibility for defence matters and war matters. The easiest solution of the difficulty is to give to the new Minister those responsibilities which will naturally fall into a particular groove. man all the work? be correct, what does the present M in ister of Defence do in times of peace to earn his salary? ment there are 8,000 men on land, working at the Naval Base and Cockatoo Island, and engaged in transport work. did not hear my opening remarks when I pointed out that, whilst it might be advisable in futur e to entitle his office Minister of Marine, it was advisable at the present juncture to create a Minister of War, who would relieve the Minister of Defence of much of the added responsibility which the war has placed upon his shoulders. the duties which you would take from the Minister of Defence. that, in making the appointment of a new Minister, we should give him the duties of a Minister of War.

For instance, at the Naval Base at Westernport, one section of men are working under the direction of the Home Affairs Department, and another section under the Military, doing precisely the same class of work. In the construction of the wharf that is now going on excavations were necessary. That excavation could have been done very effectively by a steam navvy plant. I question whether it would be advisable for the Defence Department to incur the expenditure that the provision of an enormous plant of this description would necessitate, simply because the Department migfit not have sufficient work to keep it employed. If we had one Works Department doing all that class of work, it would be possible to organize a great body of men, and so keen the plant in continuous use. The Minister of Defence or the Minister of the Navy ought not to be called upon to do this work at a l l . It might be suggested by them, and draughtsmen connected with their Departments could indicate to the Works Department what wa's required, but after that the Works Department would take charge, and with the eminent engineers that the bigger scope of work a rearrangement of this character would permit them to engage, be able to carry out the work more cheaply and more effectively than it is being carried out under the present system. When I was connected with the Government railways we never constructed a railway. Works Branch did this, and handed the railways over to the Traffic Department as a going concern. I am of the Opinion that it would be a very great advantage indeed to the Defence Department if they palrticuTar class of work, that 'must be carried on throughout Australia, tb Another matter that I would like to bring before the notice of honourable members is the very remarkable work t h a t has been done by the Defence 'Department-and particularly, I understand, by the honourable member for Bass*-in thetransport of troops. All the troops that have-left Australia have had to be carried over a very great distance, and I have yet to learn that a single ship put into Western Australia, the last port of call, not. f u l l y equipped for the long journey it had to take. A paragraph which appeared in to-day's paper showed the great responsibility that has rested upon the Ministeri n this respect. Reading between the lines of the paragraph to which I refer we can see the deplorable state of affairs that has occurred in Europe owing to the fact that certain transports were not properly prepared for their journey. As a matter of fact, <they could not reach their destination. our transports. I am quoting this to illustrate the great responsibility that has rested on the Minister of Defence and the Assistant Minister in regard to this work. I am informed that eighty Ships have left these shores with troops and 'equipment,, and I think all Australia should know what has been done by the gentlemen, who h'ave so ably carried out the arduous duties that have fallen upon them. I am delighted to have the opportunity of saying these few words, and I hope, whet* anything is done, that the present Assistant Minister of Defence will still be able to Show to the people of Australia that we have lef t the responsibility for the defence of the Commonwealth in thoroughly competent hands. I do nob think any honourable member of this House, or any person of any political thought at all, could have anything but the utmost confidence in the M i nisters of Defence for the manner in which they have carried out the organization that has enabled Australia The to do all thab has been done. When we started' oUr Defence system some years ago, Senator Pearce was chosen to fill a position for which he seems naturally suited. As Minister of Defence, he at once undertook the organization of bhe could hand over all this Department, which has been so successful, and which I have studied in detail, because I felt it my duty to acquaint mya separate Work's Department. self with what had been done in the past,, and with what is being done now inr",19,Honobable Members Hear Hear

Apparently the Government see the necessity of creating a, Minister to give special attention to the new conditions that have been brought about by the war-to matters such as the provision of munitions and the charge of recruiting. They are providing a channel whereby they may be brought into immediate touch with the Government of tlie States, and with private individuals, who wish to offer their services and tlieir plants for the manufacture of munitions. As to the* title of the new Ministerial office, I h.ape that one will be chosen which will properly indicate tlie duties of that office. The Defence Department has at all time an immen.se amount of work to do, and we cannot expect military officers to suddenly adapt themselves to the new conditions that have been brought about by the war. Many of theproblems which have arisen are such as have to be faced almost wholly from a business aspect rather than from a military one, and the creation of the new portfolio will enable this to be done more advantageously. It will allow the Government to give the people a lead as they could not do before, and I trust that we shall soon see the good results of the changes that are to be made.. sire, to add my congratulations to tlie many that the new Minister has received.

I am sure that the appointment of the honourable member for Bass to the oflice that is about to be created wil] give satisfaction to the public at large. The responsibilities devolving on the Minister of Defence have been altogether too great. The people feel that he is hardly able to discharge the many duties imposed on him, and give the satisfaction which is needed. I am not in favour of appointing Assistant or Honorary Ministers. If new Ministers are needed, I think that new Departments should be created.

Many honourable members opposite have declared that the Minister of Defence should be a member of this House, but I hope that nothing that is said will influence the Government to remove the present occupant from his office. It would be difficult to find a man who would give greater satisfaction to Parliament and to the people than the present Minister is giving. not doubtful. The Minister of Defence possesses the confidence of the whole Commonwealth, and his administrative capacity and ability have given entire satisfaction. The presence of the Minister of Defencei n this Chamber is desired, only because honourable members wish to have their questions answered more quickly. But if questions are put on the notice-paper, replies can be obtained from the Minister very speedily. No doubt the new Minister of Marine will give every satisfaction. I am in accord with what the Government propose, and I feel that it w ill be endorsed by the people of Australia. congratulate the Government on their proposal to appoint a new DefenceM in ister and a Committee, chosen from both parties, for tlie consideration of war matters and to advise the Cabinet. I also congratulate the honourable. member for Bass on the appointment that he is about to receive. He has always shown himself willing to give information to honourable members, and his devotion to. the work of the Defence Department while acting as Assistant Minister has been very marked. I hope that the Prime Minister will take into consideration the suggestion of the honourable member for Henty regarding. the definition of the duties of the new Minister. When a great DeI hope that Ministers partment which has hitherto been managed by one Minister is to be managed in future by two Ministers working in conjunction, there should be a definition of the duties and responsibilities of those Ministers. I understand that as Assistant Minister of Defence the honourable member for Bass has had a great deal to do with transport work, and that in f u t u re he is to be at the bead of tlie Naval branch of the Defence Department. Although our war vesselsare now absent from Australia, his new position will be a very important one. The Naval Branch of the Defence Department has a great deal to do in relation to organization, administration, and construction . question of supplies for the Navy. tion that matter. Superimposed upon the duties I have mentionel, the Naval Branch of the service has to deal witb the question of transport, which is of the highest importance. We are glad to know that our transport work, so far, has been successfully carried out. The transport of men to the f r o n t should carry with it the duty of equipping the troops and supplying the necessary munitions. All this work should be part of the functions allotted to the new M in ister. The Government propose now to create a Committee representing both parties in this Parliament, who w ill be called upon to investigate and to report upon all questions relating to the war that may be submitted to it . One of its most important duties, I take it , will be to organize the commercial and industrial forces of Australia, so far as is necessary, to enable us to concentrate our efforts upon the manufacture of munitions, and to secure supplies of clothing and general equipment.for the troops that we are sending abroad. That Committee, I presume, will be presided over by the newly-appointed Minister. It would have been well if the Prime Minister could have seen his way to accept the office of President of the Committee. fuse it .

Naval Branch of the Department is overloaded at the present time by the volume of constructional work which it has to undertake. transferred to the control of the Department of Home Affairs. with our various Naval Bases, according to Admiral Henderson's scheme, there will be an expenditure of some millions of pounds, and I think that such work could be carried out by the Department of Home Affairs more expeditiously and economically than by the Department of Defence. That is one respect in which the Minister of Defence might be divorced from the duty of attending to many matters relating to tlie Naval Branch of the service. In this way, he would be given a good deal of relief, and would have more time to devote to other very i m portant matters connected with his Department. the Prime Minister will inform the Committee as to what will be the allocation of duties as between the Minister of Defence and the Minister of Marine, in order to insure the proper administration [173] prosecution of the war. desire to add my congratulations to those which have already been tendered to the honourable member for Bass on his appointment to the responsible position of Minister of Marine. From the very in ception of the war I have recognised the great and responsible duties that have to be discharged by the Minister of Defence and the Assistant Minister, ana have considered that I could best assist them in the discharge of those duties by refraining from asking in this House questions such as are often put to them, and which I think' might well have been left unasked. A great deal has been said from time to time regarding the military camps, and The Minister of Marine sliould their proper administration. I believe that if a census were taken it would be found that of those who have enlisted more have come 'from in aud around my That would leave electorate' than from any other part of Victoria, or, indeed, Australia.

The honourable member will have an opportunity later on to discuss the particular question to which he has referred. that the control of transports will come directly under the new Minister. If it does, I hope that he will give this matter his sympathetic consideration. wish to congratulate the honourable member for Bass upon the higb position to which he is to be appointed. In doing so, I would point out that the only object we had in view, in urging the appointment of an additional Minister, was to enable that Minister, when appointed, to concentrate his attention upon the war and our defence preparations in connection with it . Up to the present the Minister of Defence and the Assistant Minister have been jointly controlling the whole of our ordinary defence organization, including the Navy and all the extra work which the war has involved; but it has seemed to me that an enormous amount of this additional work is due to the arrangement which has obtained to the present, because the honourable gentleman who represents the Minister of Defence in this Chamber has not been in a position to speak authoritatively except on very few of the subjects brought up from time to time until he referred to the Minister. It is this dual control that has placed on the two Ministers a great deal of additional work; their duties were always overlapping, and the objection that I see in the proposal now put forward-to make the Minister in this House the Minister of the Navy, and leave the rest of the work of the Defence Department entirely to the Minister of Defence-is that it will not do away with this overlapping. Undoubtedly, at the present moment our principal concern is the war, all our interests centre in tlie war, and in these circumstances I think that it would be far better not to make any appointment of a permanent character. I quite agree that there should be an addition to the number of Ministers; but it would be infinitely better to leave the whole of the Defence routine, which is colossal work for any one man to undertake, to the Minister of Defence, and concentrate the administration in regard to all war matters in the new Minister that is being appointed. From what I say I wish to: divorce any idea that I am desirous of saying anything derogatory of the present Minister of Defence: that is not in my mind. WhatI feel is that if we carry out what has been suggested, we shall not take from the gentlemen who now control the Defence Department one scintilla of the work they are now doing; whereas by dividing the work in the way I have suggested a great deal of the overlappin? that now exists would be avoided, and Ministers would be relieved of a considerable amount of' work and responsibility. One Minister would be responsible for the one part, and the other would be responsible for the other part. I do not think that the control of the Navy by itself represents a great deal of work. Island, and the Naval Bases, and the transport work? a considerable amount of work involved in managing the various industrial enterprises on which the Naval branch has embarked; but, as the honourable member for Wimmera has said, much of the work of the Naval Department can be got rid of by placing the construction of our Naval Bases and similar work in the hands of the Department of Home Affairs. That step would relieve the work of the Minister of Defence considerably. I hope that later onI do not suggest that it should be done now-w e shall go further, and appoint another Minister as Minister of Works, creating a separate Department for the purpose of the construction of works now undertaken by the Department of Home Affairs. I believe that this will have to be done after the war, as at present we would uot be justified in going to the",23,Chairman Order The Of The Department And The Successful

I do believe that we should be doing the right thing if the whole of .the administration in connection with the war were taken bodily out of the Defence Department and put under a new .Minister or given to Senator Pearce, the ordinary administration of the Defence Department being left to a Minister in this Chamber. have the War Minister here, because this is the House whioh, in a democratic way, more fully represents the people of Australia than does ,the Senate. In fact, I should like to see both Defence portfolios in this Chamber, and I believe that this will come about; but in the meantime it would be infinitely better for the Ministry to divide the work of the Defence Department in the way I have suggested, and at .the same time relieve the Minister of Defence by placing the work of the construction of Naval Basesi n the hands of the Department of Home Affairs. We should give to the Minister in this Chamber the absolute control of all war matters. The arrangement that I have suggested would be much more satisfactory than that outlined by the Government, and would relieve both Ministers of Defence of a great deal of the work they are now doing in trotting backwards and forwards and iconsuiting one another, and the tension and anxiety that exist in the country in regard to the general administration of war matters in Australia would also be relieved. I have only a few words to isay on this matter. First of all, I congratulate the honourable member for Bass on his appointment. Tlie point touched on by the honourable member for Richmond is the only other question upon which I wish to speak. The honourable member has suggested that the new Minister should be called the Minister of War, and that he should deal only with all war matters. I do not think that I am very far wrong in saying that the Expeditionary Forces are now being trained by the Instructional Staff created for training our Citizen Forces, and I cannot see how we can set aside the organization of the Defence Department that is utilized in this way, and create a fresh organization entirely for oversea Forces. This fact is a vital flaw in the proposal put forward by the honourable member for Richmond. I know [173]2 that honourable members are endeavouring to arrive at what is the best course to follow, and I am as .anxious as any honourable member that this House should have every opportunity of dealing with war matters; but I do not think that the difficulty can be overcome in the way the honourable member for Richmond has suggested. The original idea was to relieve I would rather the Minister of Defence of his overburden of work. Every man in Australia must admit that the Minister of Defence is overworked. I do not speak of the Minister in a personal wayI have a high' regard for him-bu t any man occupying the. position would be overworked. My suggestion is that we should take away from bhe Minister of Defence the control of all Naval matters and Naval Bases, and add to those duties the control of the transportation services, which, according to the recruiting that is now going on, will be much greater in the future, seeing that a large number of men will have to be sent away within the next few months; also, the work of generally supervising our Saddlery, Clothing, and Small Arms Factories, and matters of that kind. All these matters will provide sumcient work for the new Minister, and relieve the present Minister of a great deal of responsibility, while at the same time enabling him to devote his attention primarily to the war; and, in 'the second place, to the ordinary organization of the Defence Department, on which the superstructure of the Expeditionary Forces is being built up. I believe that the action the Government propose to take is in the best interests of the Defence Department and of the country; and I believe that it will meet the wishes of individual members of bhis House. We will still need to submit our questions on notice in regard to the Defence Department, and members in another place, who are equally entitled to have tlieir views considered, will need to .submit questions on notice in regard, bo matters affecting the Navy, Naval Bases, transportation, and, if my personal view is accepted, Factories, and matters of that kind. gratulate the honourable member for Fremantle on the suggestion he has made, and I hope that it will be accepted. I also take the opportunity of congratulating the new Minister on his appointment.

As a matter of fact, that responsibility rests with the Executive, and, while it is well to express our mind to the Ministry as to what we expect to be done, there need be no idea that we are binding ourselves hand and foot by any action that may be taken now. The Ministry can always revise tlie duties of each Minister by Executive action. Therefore, I apprehend no trouble in that respect. An intimation has been given that the Assistant Minister of Defence is to succeed to thisportfolio. I offer him my congratulation on his promotion.

Question resolved in the affirmative. That the House do now adjourn. [6.37] I rise for the purpose of further interrogating the Prime Minister. His statements this afternoon regarding the further transaction of business this session were rather nebulous in character, whether purposely or not ' I do not know. gentleman said a number of things as to the advantages of postponement in the present circumstances, with which I thoroughly agree. sionis that the Tariff schedule should wait ""until after the war is over, because it may then be necessary to readjust the Tariff, in order to meet a set of circumstances of which we now have no knowledge at all. But I should liketo know just what the right honourable gentleman meant. DoI understand, for instance, that the party have agreed topostpone this matter for the time being, along w i th other important subjects of Committee: legislation? I should like to be clear about it . I desire to address myself for a few It moments to the subject referred to in theArgus of this morning as affecting myself and the honourable member for Balaclava. I have observed that the honourable member for Balaclava has not taken his place in this House during this week. He was* here for a moment or two to-day, and I intimated to h i m that I should have* something to say regarding h i m at the adjournment of the House. He promised to be present. I express no surprise that the 'honourable member has not put in an appearance. Before dealing with that matter, however, I desire to. (Wide Bay-Prime again refer to misrepresentations of myself and my views as the outcome of theSunday last. Referring to the persona? explanation tliat I made in this Houseyesterday, the Argus this morning saysHe does not challenge the accuracy of the report on which our remarks were founded, Ibut complains only that it was all that was reported out of a speech which occupied an hour and a half in delivery. It is very clearly stated there that I did! not complain of the accuracy of the re-, ports. WhatI said in this Ho.use yesterday wasThis report was of a speech tliat occupied), an hour and a half in delivery, and I have only, to say that, as a report, it is neither adequatenor accurate. On that statement the newspaper has published another violently offensive article! against myself. I would have preferred to think that that statement was madethrough clumsy inadvertence, but I cannot believe, in the face of language soFor instance, the right honourable clear-whic h the writer of the .article must have read-that it was innocently or honestly made. . It is perfectly clear,, therefore, that the statement that I d i d My -own impresnot challenge the accuracy of the report: was a deliberate falsehood, ;and upon that: deliberate falsehood they have written a long article v i l if y i ng me again, as: they did yesterday.

Ho referred to me also in other terms of opprobrium -and contempt, and generally indulged in the oratorical flights of mere abuse which -are characteristic of the honorahle member. I see in this morning's paper that the honorahle memher has told us what his intentions are in regard to going to 'the f r o n t as a soldier. His abuse of myself resulted f r om the fact that I had said I was not a fighting man. This honourable gentleman now tells us, and he tells us under the heading, "" Mr ""Watt may fight""-may-what -quote from the newspaper report of the honourable member's speech"" I am Boinctimns asked at meetings why I do not go myself,"" he continued.

I fully -expect, at the right time,, and before this war is over, to go with the men of my age and cir-cumstances. Is this the man who-has been asking every the race to which I belong.

"" When the time is ripe, when circumstances permit, when we have taken every widow's son who will go to the front, then I , too, may fight."" I challenge these men, if they want to fight, to fight now. This is the accepted time. The poster at the TownH a l l says, "" Enlist to-day.""

If they are ready and willing to go, and to do what they have urged me and others to do, I shall be ready to accompany them. I have nothing more to say. I .have given my answer. I have put this matter to the test in the only way possible. It is not a question of words; it is a question of deeds. If I am a pigeon-livered man, I am prepared to risk my liver and my heart, such as it is, along with this man with the bellowing voice of a bully and the heart of a protoplasm, on the hills of Gallipoli or elsewhere, with Australian comrades-. In conclusion, I ask him to cease bellowing about loyalty from the safe sanctuary of the skirts of the Australian Women's National League; to cease praying widows' sons to go to the front to defend him. I ask him to do something himself, and to show what sort of a heart he has concealed under that skin of his. ister and Treasurer) [6.49] -Afte r the challenges that have been issued, I am beginning to think the hills of Gallipoli a safer place than this Chamber.
