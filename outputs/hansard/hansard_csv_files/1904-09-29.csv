Debate Resumed From 28th September Son","That -the present Administration does not pos sess the confidence of this House. the list of honourable members who claim that they have been misrepresented, but in view of the statements made by the honourable member for Hume yesterday, I tfh'ink that honourable .members will see that I have some substantial reason for giving a personal explanation to this House. There are two matters to which I wish to refer, and I shall do so as briefly as possible. One is the statement of the honourable member as to the manner of keeping accounts in New South Wales while I was Premier of that State, and the other is the honourable member's imputation of bribery. I shall deal with the accounts first. I thought, after the correspondence which was put before honourable members, signed by every member of the Committee appointed by the honourable member for Hume, that we should hear no more of these imputations, but instead of that being so, the honourable member has repeated them.. He also made some reference to a visit of one of the three accountants appointed at my instigation to my private residence, as if some sinister underhand proceeding was involved in that occurrence. The fact is that I am not like the honourable member) I am a busy man. I am .a man who has some private affairs to attend 'to when I am not in office. One of tbe leading accountants in Sydneyone of the three who were appointed in the way I am about to mention to the HouseVisited me under the! following circumstances:-When the honourable member for. Hume appointed his Committee, I protested against the .appointment of one of its three members on the ground that a -few months before he had been a candidate for .

3,Mr Reid,"I am' sorry tp have to add toof 1898 in opposition to me, and had accepted the views of the honourable member for Hume in regard to my financial administration as Treasurer of the State. East night you held, Mr Speaker, that I could not make a personal explanation about anything which had not been stated in regard to myself. If the right honourable gentleman is allowed 'to go into these details, and: practically makes another speech in connection with this matter, I hope that I may be allowed to reply to him. tion of gagging. I wish only for fair play in connection with this matter. the honourable member uttered. one is fair for another. I told the truth, and I wish to know now whether the right honourable gentleman can go into full details in regard to all the matters referred to the other day, and dealt with by me yesterday, without my having an opportunity to reply to him? orable member for Hume can rely upon having fair play. I ask the Prime Minister to confine himself strictly, as I believe he inquiry was to be, so that they might be will, to a personal explanation; but if , when he has finished, the honourable member for Hume also desires to make a statement, I am sure that the House will be willing to hear it. that one of the gentlemen who was appointed by the honourable member for Hume to judge me, had already, as a hostile candidate at the elections, prejudged me. submitted his utterances, as reported in the newspaper published in the district, to the honourable member for Hume, and I protested against being judged by a man who had condemned me before entering upon the investigation, and who was a political opponent. tleman said the same thing about Mr the accounts of the Treasurer and the Dibbs. and learned member will keep quiet. If he has not a shred of care for reputation himself he might have some respect for the reputation of others. Under these circumstances, I ' refused to put myself in the hands of the Committee appointed by the honourable member for Hurne, But what was the next step that I took? I asked the two institutions of accountants in Sydney to select two of their best men, without reference to me at all, and the two thus chosen were to select a third. One institution of accountants nominated Mr Bowes, a leading accountant in Sydney, and a London chartered accountant ; and the other institution nominated Mr Davis, another leading accountant in Sydney. Those two accountants nominated Mr Richard Teece., whose name is known throughout the length and breadth of Australia as the general manager of the Australian Mutual Provident Society, the largest financial institution in the Commonwealth. Mr Teece began his work with the other gentlemen whom I have named, when his directors withdrew him from the position, on the ground that it was a political matter, and they thought that their general manager should not be entangled in it. Then the other two accountants, who had been selected in the manner I have described, selected, as a third, Mr Vane, of the well-known firm of Miles and Vane, accountants in Sydney. All three were selected absolutely without the exercise of a choice by me in any shape or form. But, as the matter was one outside the ordinary run of accountants' work, Mr Davis waited on me to ascertain what the scope of the able to form some idea as to the length of time for which they were to be taken away from their ordinary business. That was the private interview to which the honourable member for Hume has referred. protectionist, too. the Protectionist Party. Honourable memI bers must know that I paid these accountants myself. As I would not go before the tribunal appointed by the honourable member for Hume, I fe'lt that I owed it to the public to have an independent inquiry, and at my personal expense I appointed the gentlemen whom I have named, who were selected entirely by others. My written instructions to them were to take Auditor-General, and, when there was a I hope that the honourable difference between the Treasurer's accounts and those of the Auditor-General to follow the Auditor-General's accounts, and not my accounts. member did not formulate a set of questions, as the honourable member for Hume did.",12,Confidence

15,Mr Joseph Cook,"The right honorableable member for Hume, when' he was formulating his questions to his own Committee, to allow me to put some questions to them, but he would not do so. I then asked the honourable member, when the reoort of the three accountants nominated at any instance, was presented to me, to allow it to go into the journals of the Parown party, was going to the mother country liament of New South Wales, as the report of his own Committee had done, but he refused that, too. some chance now of having my side of the case placed on the records of the New South Wales Parliament. go further.

The honourable member put some other statement on the table of the House, which the accountant to the Treasury would not sign. sonal explanations, it is not permissible to introduce new matter, and I ask the right honourable gentleman not to do it. ter, and come to the more serious statement of the honourable gentleman, which imputed corruption to me in the administration of the office of Premier of New South Wales. I suppose we have not come to a state of things in this House when such charges may be made against a man without some seriousness being attached to the imputation under which he is made to lie. I suppose that on this matter, considering the I asked the honornature of the statement which has gone on the permanent records of Parliament, I can claim , the generous indulgence of every: 1 member of the House. I would like, with reference to it, to say this: Senator Neild, who was at the time a member of the Legislative Assembly of New South Wales, and had been for years a member of my on other business, and asked me to authorize him to make inquiries on behalf of the Fortunately I have Government of New South Wales as to the old-age pensions system, in connection with which he had been prominent from the first. But I wish to I gave him the commission, but like a prudent Minister, I stated in it that he was to do the work entirely without remuneration. Those were the terms on which I appointed him. I expected to receive a report such as any one of us might give Each of them conafter a visit to the mother countrya document containing forty or fifty pages. I did not dream of the length to which That my statehis report would go. The honourable gentleman came back, and was ill for a long time. Finally, he set to work, and presented to me a report containing 515 pages. on the subject in the world. information culled from the literature of various nations. I did not get it until it had been printed at the Government Printing Office, but the moment I saw it I said, The honourable "" This must have cost you a good deal. We must put some amount on the Estimates for the trouble you have taken in this matter "" ; and I promised to do so. As honourable members know, to put money on the Estimates is not to guarantee that it will be voted. I am now .giving merely the preliminary history of the matter. evidence of the Committee. the Additional Estimates for the year 1899, but as we had no Additional Estimates that year, the matter was allowed to stand over until the following session. We prorogued in December, and the payment was made to Senator Neild at a time when Parliament was not sitting, and would not sit for six months. Not a penny was paid to him when Parliament was sitting, and I had no intention of paying him anything until Parliament had voted the money. But the honourable gentleman had suffered a number of misfortunes; his health, for instance, had broken down, and he came to me. and asked me to pay the actual expenses which",13,Confidence

24,Mr Reid,"I intended to put a sum onhe had been out of pocket for a considerable time, in anticipation of the grant of Parliament. The amount which I paid to him did not comprise one penny for his personal labour in this gigantic work. It was merely a reimbursement of the money he had actually spent in producing it. I paid it in the full belief that Parliament would recompense him for his gigantic labours in a national cause. It was not a matter of helping rich corporations, but of providing old-age pensions for the poor of Australia, and Senator Neild's work had a great deal to do with the ease with which that system was established in New South Wales. I now come to a more serious matter than that. The honourable gentleman spoke as if there had been a Committee sitting upon my conduct in connection with that matter. that. ' gather from the honourable member's speech. That Committee did not sit to inquire into my conduct at all. ber's statement. The Committee was appointed to inquire into the question whether Senator Neild had' entered into any contract, and whether by receiving payment from the Government he had forfeited his seat as a member of the Legislature, and it did not report upon my conduct in any shape or form. I admit that it is constitutionally dangerous to make payments to members of Parliament, and no one grants more freely than I do that since Parliament did not approve of my conduct it had a perfect right to censure me for believing that it would approve, and for thus falling into an error. I have never grumbled about that. Will honourable members believe that the honourable gentleman who made this imputation against me, and his whole party, when I challenged them in the face of the House and the country as to whether their Statements amounted to an imputation upon my personal integrity gave me an assurance that they did not? the kind. cords of Parliament in justification of as what I have said. When the motion of censure was tabled, the member for Hastings-Macleay, Sir Edmund Barton, made NowI will read a little further. I had a use of observations in a daily newspaper prophetic sense of the extreme's to ' which interview which seemed to me to suggest political malignity can go in some quarters, some imputation of improper conduct on my part. I immediately challenged him. I came before the House upon a question of privilege, and took up this position: "" If this is a mere censure upon me for making a mistake as a Minister, I am satisfied to abide by the decision of the House; but 'if it is an imputation upon my personal character, if it is a charge of corruption against me, I claim the right to have a judicial investigation. I do not want my character to be the sport of a party censure vote."" Honourable members will see the difference between the two things. If any of my honourable friends had his personal character impugned, would he be content to have it dragged into the mire of a censure debate? Would he not claim the right which belongs to the meanest criminal in the land to have a fair and impartial trial? say I knew what use might be made of such statements. I shall read from the New South Wales Hansard. On the 5th of September, 1899, page 1136, I called attention to Mr Barton's words, and said thisI rise to say that my ideas of parliamentary fair play and honour are so different from those of the honourable member, that if this charge embodied in the amendment of the honourable member for Wickham That was Mr Fegan, who pointed the honourable member's general motion, with some words I will read. There was no charge of corruption embodied in Mr Fegan's amendment, which was couched in these wordsThat the question be amended by inserting after the word "" House"" the words "" and deserves censure for having made payments of public money to Mr J. C. Neild, member for Paddington, without asking Parliament, and contrary to the assurance given by the right honourable the Premier."" That was .a perfectly legitimate ground for censuring any Government, and I did not object to anything of that kind, but when the honourable member for Hastings-Mac leay said something which seemed to me to amount to a charge affecting my personal reputation, I got up in the House and made If this charge embodied in the amendment of a deliberate charge of personal corruption against me, affecting my personal integrity",14,Confidence

My only desire is this : That after this debate is over, whatever the result is, I do not want it to be said that I was tried on a question affecting my personal honesty, and was found guilty by this House. That is what is said now. Buti f there is any understanding that there is a charge of corruption levelled against me, there is not a man in the House who would not do me the justice of having the matter thrashed out, before the House dealt with it , because in our party fights we do not want to mix up matters affecting our personal characters.

51,Sir William Lyne,"I hope that thestated that information was obtained by me that a conference had taken place between the right honourable gentleman and Mr Neild, with the result that something had happened of which I did not know at that time, although I had a suspicion regarding it. Mr Neild withdrew his opposition to the Government, and although he did not vote for them, spoke in their support. The Government won by a majority of four. I am not quite sure, but I believe that at that time Mr Barton was leading the Opposition. not. was leading the Opposition, and moved the vote of censure. Barton was the leader of the Opposition at that time. At any rate, he had led it previously, if he was not actually in that position upon the occasion referred to. I have stated plainly what happened in the case, and the right honourable gentleman has not quoted one word from me in refutation of what I stated. My impression stands good to-day as it stood then. The right honourable gentleman has omitted to refer to the question that was asked of him by the Chairman of the Committee, recorded at page 1044 of Hansard. I do not know what Committee that was, but I believe it was connected with the question of old-age pensions. I know that Mr Neild was connected with it. At that particular time, when the question was asked, it was! intendeH to move a vote of censure against the Premier if he said he was going to pay Mr Neild. When the Government accounts came' out I could not discover how the payment had been made, although I had heard whispers regarding it, and I had to go to the Auditor General, in order to find out under what heading it had been made. Parliament was not sitting, and, unquestionably, such a payment should not have been made. Not one word has been said by the right honourable gentleman to cause me to vary my original statement. wrong I should have been perfectly ready to withdraw what I said. But I know what happened, and I know that I am right. The right honourable gentleman has stated that I appointed all the members of the Committee of Public Accounts. Technically I . did so. but two of the members were selected at the instigation of the right honport, which stands, and always will stand, orable gentleman, who mentioned their names across the table in the Legislative Assembly, of New South Wales, when he was replying to my financial statement. He wanted to name the third member, but I stopped Mm, and said that I thought I was entitled to make that selection. I did not know Mr Yarwood befoie I asked him to accept a seat on the Committee, and I did not know that he had ever contested an election. honourable member's notice. had been appointed-h e was appointed immediately. I did not know that that gentleman had stood for election, and, as a matter of fact, he, as a free-trader, did not object generally to the policy of. the right honourable gentleman, but only to his land legisquestion of the accounts. aware of it. That was the way in which the Committee was appointed. I had nothing further to do with the matter, and, as I stated last night, Mr Davis was one of the three whom the right honourable member appointed privately and paid. Mr Davis wished to be placed on the Committee which I was appointing, but I did not know him, and I am not sure that I know him now. At any rate, I never knew before that he was a protectionist; and had I known of it that fact might have been supposed to influence me in his favour. I did not, however, appoint him. I know that he went to the right honourable gentleman's houseI have this in writing-and discussed the matter with him before the question of the report was raised. say that there is. I obtained, I believe, the three very best men. for the work in New South Wales, and no one can point a finger at them now. But from the moment I made the appointment, the right honourable gentleman hurled his invectives at both Mr Dibbs and MrI f I had been proved to be Yarwood, though it is difficult to .see why, considering that he nominated one of. them himself. I do not. think there is any ne : cessity to saj more. I should not have dealt with this matter had it not been brought up by the right honourable gentleman himself with a view, if possible, to destroy the effect of the Committee's, reas a record against his financial administration.

Sir JOHN QUICK (Bendigo) -It is to be deeply regretted that certain honourable members will continuously and persistently endeavour to introduce into this House ancient squabbles in a State Parliament. I believe, however, that every reasonable man here deprecates any efforts of that kind, and I rejoice to notice that, at any rate, the Labour Opposition, to their credit, are no party to those disgraceful attempts. suming the thread of my address, which was interrupted l'as]t night, I desire to draw attention to a remark made by the honourable West Sydney in the course of his speech. member complained that, the Labour Party had been "" butchered ""-ha d not received fair play.

I was not aware of any underhanded attempt to displace the Government ; on the contrary, it was generally thought that a little Ministerial innings would do them good-that no harm would result. It was thought that whilst in office the Labour Party were practically "" on the chain""-that they had given securities for good behaviour, and that they would emerge from office better and abler men, probably more appreciative of a Minister's difficulties and responsibilities. There was a general consensus of opinion, so far as my knowledge goes, that they should have a fair trial, which, I believe, they got. The Government went on with their measures, and challenged the verdict of the House upon a certain clause in the Arbitration B ill , with the result that they were fairly and honorably beaten. taken out of the hands of the Government. for surprise that many friends of the Bill, plaint I heard made last night. But surely for Ballarat, who brought it in, and others, the House is not to be so impotent and so when this light was gradually being, thrown recreant to its trust that, if a Ministry upon its provisions, thought it time to objects to the introduction of a clause into a Bill, it is to surrender its powers and prerogatives. In this case the House viewed the Bill with generous fairness, and with a desire to see it passed into law. There was no wish whatever to emasculate the measure; on the contrary, there was a desire to have workable legislation, and I believe that as a result of our deliberations the Bill is one which we can recommend to the electors of Australia. under the Bill. Rethat later on. During the exhaustive debates on the Bill a flood of light, of which we previously had not the advantage, was cast upon its provisions; the debate, indeed, and learned member for amounted to a revelation to many of us. I admit that, with reference to the clause That honourable and learned enabling the Court to give preference to unionists, I , for one , like the honourable and 1 learned member for Ballarat, when the Bill was first introduced, acquiesced in it without a murmur. We thought that the power thus As to the treatment given would only be used on rare occasions, such as when a strike or dispute occurred regarding the employment of unionists or non-unionists. We regarded the clause' as an incident in the Bill, and not as one involving its very spirit and essence. But as the debate went on, our eyes were opened, and it dawned on the House that this apparently harmless provision, intended to be a mere incident, was being utilized in New South Wales, and would be utilized under the Bill, as a great transforming agentthat the clause would convert a judicial tribunal, for the bond fide settlement of industrial disputes, into a great electioneering agency. I am sure that that was not the intention of the original framers of the Bill when they inserted this harmless provision.

As a matter of personal opinion, I do not think that it was necessary that the late Ministry should have resigned on account of the result of that division, especially in view of the statement made by the late Prime Minister himself, that this preference provision was only intended to be brought into action where the majority in any trade or industry required it, and that it was merely giving legal effect and expression to the practice of the New South Wales Court. If that be so, it merely expressed in writing, in the form of an Act of Parliament, what the late Prime Minister himself desired, and intended should be done. If that be so-and I accept the honourable gentleman's honest assurances at the table that it was so then why all the uproar ? Why all this fuss because of the insertion of an amendment which was merely intended to give' effect to the desires and intentions of the framers of the Bill? The amendment was merely intended to give effect to the desire that the principle of preference should be applied only where the majority of those engaged in any trade or industry desired it. It should not be forgotten that the clause after all was not introduced for the protection of minorities. It was introduced for the protection of majorities.

The Government asked the House to reverse its decision. Honourable members wbo had voted for it were invited, forsooth, to reverse their previous votes on a clause which was suddenly regarded as one of immense vitality and importance. So far as I am concerned, having thoroughly understood and considered it, and having spoken on it, I could not plead ignorance of its effect. The honourable member for Riverina has complained that he was taken by surprise, and desired time for further consideration; but I could offer no such plea as that. I do not think that the honourable member for Bourke pleaded ignorance. planation yet. altered his vote. He has not had a chance to alter it. member announced his intention to alter it. honourable member's pardon, because I understood that he had done so. While some honourable members may justifiably plead ignorance, or misapprehension, or inadvertence, as a reason for reversing their vote, those who understood what they were doing had no reason for reversing it. The members of the Watson Administration voluntarily staked their existence upon the.chance of procuring a reversal of that vote. I believe that they thought that the vote would be reversed, but they miscalculated the material upon which they were operating. They thought that if they could not obtain a reversal of the vote, they would be granted -a dissolution, and that the resignation of office would not be necessary. The Governor General upset their calculations on that point. But, having resigned office upon that vital question, why is it that they are so anxious to get back again? Because the same situation will be reproduced, the same vote will have to be taken, and the same or a similar crisis will eventuate, if they again take office. In my opinion, they were practically outgeneralled. If they had shown better generalship, they would have allowed the decision of the Committee to stand, and left the development of the matter to the ordinary course of debate in the other Chamber, and afterwards of messages between the two Houses. Instead of doing so, they asked us to rescind our votes, and to give up a provision which a large number of us were determined to fight for in this House, and, if necessary, in the country. have already pointed out that it was not to kill the Bill. In the Victorian factory legislation there is no such thing as compulsory preference to unionists, and the absence of such a provision has not killed that legislation. The honourable member for Yarra is a powerful advocate of the settlement of industrial disputes in Victoria by means of the Wages Board system. He knows what an immense amount of good has been done by those boards without the granting of preference to unionists. That fact, coupled with the arguments which I have already given, is sufficient to show that the qualification of a provision giving preference to unionists would not kill the Arbitration Bill. But such a qualification may do this: It may. prevent organizations registered for the settlement of industrial disputes from being converted into political organizations. Indeed, the only object of preference was to bring that about. It was desired that the unions should be clothed with a certain amount of power and patronage in connection with industrial disputes, so that they might be used as the outposts of the Labour Party. I think that I have now said enough on the subject of preference to unionists, though, as it was the main issue which caused the crisis, I think it is as well to accentuate the fact.

They have elected to join this alliance, not as a mere temporary combination for a special purpose, but, I believe, for a period extending over two Parliaments. They are tied hand and foot to the Labour Party; and what do they get in return? Will they get protection to native industries? They cannot get that during this Parliament, according to the declaration of the leader of the Opposition. Will they get preferential trade? They cannot get that, unless the leader of the Opposition, breaks his pledges and understanding with the party to which he belongs.

No political changes ought to be encouraged by any party in the House which may lead to the defeat or loss of that Bill, about which there has been so much contention and fighting.

The Labour Party, who desire , to have this Bill placed-on the statute-book, ought to subordinate any resentment which they feel through their defeat, and exercise a certain amount of self-restraint and self-abnegation in order to assist the House in making this Bill law.

That meagreness is the inevitable result of the present circumstances.

We want practical legislation-legis lative proposals in the direction of industrial peace and prosperity in Australia. I am sure the Prime Minister will not hesitate, as far as may be reasonable and necessary, to bring into play the power, authority, and force of the Commonwealth Government and Parliament for the promotion of trade, commerce, and industry. In the July number of the Independent Review there is an interesting article by Mr Sidney Webb, the well-known Socialist; and I desire to quote a passage, which expresses the views of myself, and, I believe, a number of other honourable members as to the differentiation between what may be regarded as the functions of individualism and the functions of the State!. The passage is as follows: Whilst the community may leave the conduct of industrial operations to personal initiative, it for preference to unionists, is capable of cannot, for its own sake, allow the conditions of employment to fall below a qertain standard deemed indispensable to social health. This involves nothing more revolutionary than an extension, though a big one, of our Factory ActThat is the English Factory Actin the direction in which New Zealand and Victoria have shown the way. There is a marked differentiation between the functions of the State and the functions of the individual. Mr Webb says that we should leave the conduct of industrial operations to personal initiative generally; but, at the same time it is the true right and true function of the State to so regulate the conditions of labour and employment that they do not lead to injustice or oppression. House will acquiesce in that view; and this should form a rallying point around which we can all venture to fight. ing cheers on that side of the House for those sentiments? that view. this dictum of Mr Webb, who is a well known writer, affords us a true definition of the distinction between the collective regulation and the socialization of industries. The collective regulation of industries is something we can all justify, sa far as it may be necessary, for the protection of the weak against the strong-for the protection of those who cannot alter their surroundings or environment. the other hand, where the individual can exercise his powers, resources, and faculties without intervention, we ought, of course, to allow him to do so. approve of the New Zealand Arbitration Act? recommends is an extension of the Factories Act of England in the direction of the legislation in New Zealand and Victoria. unionists in the New ZealandAct. speaking of the Victorian Factories Acts, as well as of the New Zealand Arbitration Act. It is well known -that when Mr Sidney Webb was in Australia he studied well the provisions of the Victorian Factories Act, of which he spoke highly. Here he recommends the adoption in England of an Act which, while it makes no provision preventing oppression and sweating in various forms and phases. under the Victorian Factories Act. preference to unionists. land. not only to the New Zealand Act, but to the Victorian Factories Act, as models at which the democracy of the mother country should aim. I did not wish to take up any more time on that branch of the question. But, to sum up my position; in the present state of public affairs, I consider that I and my I am sure every Liberal in the friend's around me here, who belong to the Liberal-Protectionist Party, are not only justified in our present attitude, but are bound to judge this Ministry not merely by its name, or its personnel, but by its measures, as they are severally submitted. I believe that at the present juncture of affairs, there is no probability of any more workable combination being called into existence, and that it is our duty, as far as we possibly can, to avoid any further violent and revolutionary changes. I consider that, in view of the way in which the Commonwealth has been drifting of late, with so many changes, we are undoubtedly in a position of imminent danger, and that there is a risk of the people losing faith and confidence in and respect foi our Federal institutions, if things, go on On much longer as they are doing.

There were no circulars issued by any honourable member sitting on this side of the House to any honourable member sitting on this or the other side. The only intimation given to honourable members was one which was conveyed in the press, and it was made, not as a result of any secret negotiation or anything of that kind, but by the general concurrence in the first place of all those Liberal-Protectionists who are now sitting on this side.

Let me remind the honourable and learned member and others that the Government was defeated on the 12th August, that the composition of the new Ministry was not known on the 16th August, but that it was known on the evening of the 17th August. There was no meeting called for or held on the 16th August. No intimation, either oral or otherwise, was given to any honourable member of a meeting on the 16th August. But an oral intimation to some honourable members who could be seen was given of a meeting on the 17th August, and a press intimation was given to everybody for the same date. able member informed his leader? 17th August it appeared. afternoon of that day a meeting was held. leader ? whip to the whole party prior to the break up, but when it was suggested to me to send out a written circular, I felt that I had no warrant for taking that course; and after consultation with those who had voted as I had, it was decided that my attitude was right, and _ that only a press intimation should be given. of the 17th August, when he was sitting just where the honourable member for Fremantle is now sitting, I went to the honourable and learned member for Ballarat and said, "" You will observe by this morning's press that an intimation is made that circulars have been issued for a meeting this afternoon. There is no truth in that statement; no circulars have been issued. No one in particular has been invited to that meeting.

It has been a source of great trouble and pain to me that I should be dissociated from him. I am sincerely sorry that the separation has taken place. Nothing would give me greater pleasure than to think that I was still sitportion of the honourable and learned memting on the same side with him. compelling circumstances, political and otherwise, as I shall prove later on, which prevented me from going to that side of the House. The honourable and learned member for Bendigo, I think, must admit that the statements he has made have been based upon wrong information. The facts, as I have given them, should be sufficient to warrant the honourable and learned member in withdrawing his statements. When the negotiations had been going on for some time, and were almost quite completed, the honourable and learned member for Bendigo did not take up the attitude which he now assumes, because he said, ""How is it that in your negotiations you have employers and others have taken advantage left no open door for other members of the Liberal-Protectionist Party to join you if they wish."" I said, "" When the terms of agreement are published, you will find that there is a special clause which will permit any member of the Liberal-Protectionist Party, no matter on which side of the House he sits, to join the alliance if he pleases."" the Labour Party as well as of the LiberalPiotectionists. of both parties. get the Labour Party's consent to be liberal. immediately became, to use their own How kind. that after the vote which had been taken that was a fair condition to impose on honourable members on the opposite side. No honourable member in sympathy with the alliance programme and proposals could find any bar in the conditions named to his entering the alliance if he so desired. conditions prohibited the honourable member for Barker and myself from joining. of the programme' provides that the integrity of both parties shall be maintained, and the honourable and learned member could surely agree to that? An Honorable MEMBER -The honourable member for Barker has joined the alliance. was altered to suit him. ber's address. May I be permitted now to refer to another matter about which he said a great deal, and on which other honourable members have also spoken. I refer to the famous "" McCay amendment,"" and preference to unionists. The honourable and learned member for Bendigo has been endeavouring very skilfully to draw an analogy between the Victorian Factories Act and the Wages Boards under that Act, and fhe proposals of the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill. There is no real analogy between them. When the honourable and learned member says that preference to unionists means the dismissal of non-unionists, he ought to know that under the Victorian Factories Act the very reverse has been the case, and that as a matter of fact,\ of the Wages Boards to dismiss unionists. In the district which I represent, there is a very large number of persons connected with the brick, tile, and pottery industry. In order to secure the advantages of the Factories Act, they found it necessary to form a union. Is the honourable and learned member for Bendigo aware that it is impossible for employees to secure the advantages of the Victorian Factories Act, unless they form organizations ? That is a condition necessary under the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill, and it is also a condition necessary under the Victorian Factories Act. When they formed their union, some of the men who had been active in its formation term, "" spotted men."" I know that one man who had taken an active part in the formation of the union, was immediately dismissed from his employment, and he has never since been able to secure employment in any one of the yards. In another instance an employer conducting one of the yards dismissed every man in his employ who had joined the union. There is not a member of the union in his yard to-day, and he will not allow members of the union to be employed there. These facts are indisputable. The honourable and learned member for Bendigo cannot deny tbem, because they car: be proved up to the",33,Honourable Membeb Tha T Is A Relying Upon What He Read In Thepress

Had it not been for the man to whom I have referred, and those associated with him, the brick, pottery, and tile-makers of Brunswick and other districts would not to-day be enjoying the advantages of shorter hours and better pay, than they previously received. The mert who took action in forming the unions have been penalized by being dismissed from their employment, whilst those who did not join the unions are now reaping the advantages of the Act. Is that fair? Surely those who take all the risks in getting advantages for the men are entitled to get some o)f the advantages for themselves which others, without risk or effort, enjoy. also wish to say, in connection with this matter, that the honourable and learned member for Bendigo was most unfair when he said that it would be the endeavour of the Labour Party and those associated with them to turn the unions of Australia into active political agents. Nosuch thing could happen under the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill as it left lhe hands of the late Administration, and the honourable and learned member knows it.

It could not be done, and it was never intended that it should be done.

346,The Honourable Member For Bland Mr Hume Cook,"We have now a Gogovernment. A coalition is the very negation of responsible government. It means, in the words of the honourable and learned member for Bendigo, that the Government is necessarily limited by its composite character, l t is a sort of limited liability government. When the two opposing elements in the Government desire to do any one thing-apart , from the programme put before us. which is entirely non-contentious -as a.matter of course they have difficulties in coming to any agreement, and the result is a certain amount of stagnation and delay. Roval Commission? good at proposing Royal Commissions before they became a Government. If honourable members will look at the policy put before us. they will see that what I. have just said is proved conclusively. Every item included in it is purely non-contentious. All matters of real importance to the country are carefully set aside. Why? BecauseI suppose the Government have not yet been able to agree upon them. Take such matters, for instance, as the great question of preferential trade. discussed at an earlv date. vernment proposing to do? They do not even propose to discuss it at an early date. pledged against preferential trade. going to do with respect to the iron bonus? Nothing whatever. They, talk of the restoration of public confidence, and the institution of majority rule, but what are they going to do on this matter, which would in one sense help to restore public confidence.

Therefore, to talk about responsible government under a coalition is the very height of absurditv. Minister declare against the iron bonus? Minister will be able to answer the honourable member for himself when he replies to the debate. The Government have three principal planks in their programme. They propose to oppose Socialism. That is plank No. 1. They propose to fight unionism and the Labour Party-that is plank No. 2. And plank No. 3, and the most important of them all, is their proposal ""to get into recess. If they mean to oppose Socialism, do they intend to repeal some of the measures which honourable members who now hold the fate of the Ministry in their hands, helped to put upon the statute-book ? Do they propose to repeal"" some of those socialistic measures which were placed on the statute-book by honourable members like The honourable and learned member for Bendigo, and which the members of the free-trade section of the coalition opposite have in past speeches condemned everywhere in Australia? I think' not. .Are they in their offices only to prevent legislation? Are they there to sit still and do nothing? Is that what is meant by responsible government ; or are they going at some time to agree upon a policy and let us know what it is by putting it before the public? I take it that the people of this country will not be satisfied with a mere stand-still or sit-still Ministry. They will not be satisfied with the mere statement of opposition to Socialism or the prevention of' legislation.

360,Mr Hume Cook,"The honorableCabinet to one-third of the total number of members supporting the Government. That was done, not so much because the right honourable gentleman desired to institute majority rule, but because he wished to give a sop to the protectionist elernent in Australia, in order to make the protectionists believe that by giving half the representation of his Cabinet to that party, protection in Australia would be safe. If majority rule is to be instituted, the protectionists should alone be represented in the Cabinet. They number two-thirds of the members of this House, and they are in a greater majority in the country. What nonsense it is for honourable members to speak about majority rule, when the fate of the Ministry really lies in the hands of any one honourable member sitting behind it. That has been openly boasted by the honourable and learned member for Bendigo to-day, and by other honourable members repeatedly during the time the Ministry has been in existence. Let me turn now to another matter about which something has been said, and that is the restoration of public confidence. What did the Prime Minister sav about this business ? He is reported in the Argus of 5th September, under the heading, "" The real democracy,"" to have s a i d Lack of confidence spells lack of employment, able members think that the proper and no greater curse than that can f a l l upon the way to restore public confidence is to refamilies of working men. My efforts, and those peal, as the Prime Minister has threatened of all my colleagues, will be devoted to the reto do as soon as he gets a majority, the storation of public confidence, not by reactionary provisions of the Immigration Restriction methods, but by keeping on the broad track of and the Post and Telegraph Acts, which Australian liberalism. That is a fine, grandiloquent phrase, which contract labour into this country? If the in the light of his present proposals means provision which prohibits the importation very little. He is going to restore public of persons under contract is repealed, such confidence by declaring fiscal peace, while persons will be brought here at reduced industries are being strangled wholesale, wages, and the conditions of our working and men are out of employment and are classes will be even worse than they are leaving these shores ! The way to restore at present. The Prime Minister, however, public confidence would be to find employsays that he is in favour of repealing that ment for our people, and to retain our provision. He is also opposed to the propopulation. Victoria has lost during the last visions which we passed for the maintentwo years, because of the improper nature ance of a White Australia, and says that of the Commonwealth Tariff, 30,000 perhe will repeal them whenever he gets the sons, of whom 24,000 were adults. If the opportunity. I do not think that such dePrime Minister and his Government wish to clarations are likely to restore public conrestore public confidence, they must bring fidence ; but, no doubt, when the democracy back these persons, and others besides, and of this country speaks on the subject, it they can do so only by declaring the fiscal will pronounce its verdict in no uncertain truce off, and by giving adequate protection tones. to the industries concerned. know these facts during the last elections, orable member was drawing a tape meawhen he was advocating fiscal peace? known them, I should not have advocatedI advocated a number of things in order to fiscal peace. Since then, however, the Government Statist has given us the figures which I have quoted. Those who have left Victoria were men connected with industries which could, and should be protected-agri 1 cultural implement makers, engineers, boilermakers, and others of kindred trades. Will public confidence be restored if the fiscal truce is allowed to continue, and if we fail to grant bonuses for the production of iron ? I do not wish to anticipate any debate which may take place on the latter subject, but the development of our great natural deposits of iron ore would give work to a large number of people, and would supply a great quantity of raw product to those engaged in engineering and other works. The subject is therefore one which should have the attention of any Government, and more particularly of a Government which claims to be desirous of restoring public confidence. of an iron bonus in the programme of the Labour Party? gramme of the alliance, and will be one of the first measures dealt with if we get into power.

Mr Hume Cook. They ought to have sympathy with the toiling and high-minded people.

It was a sore spot on our social system, and ought to be I have already made some reremedied. (Applause.) In a new country like this, to obtain a remedy.

The honourable member for. 1 Let me say here tion in our mail contracts of clauses to proSocialism, it is surely interesting to When democrat,' and the friend of the toiling masses, he relies on the fact that he was responsible for . the imposition of a tax upon the unimproved value of land in New South Wales. But when he wishes to frighten the electors of Australia, he says that the proposal to institute a Commonwealth tax on land values to provide for a Commonwealth old-age pensions system is Socialism, and something which must be fought to the vety death. Then the Minister of Trade and Customs-the other head of the Ministry-wh o says that the one danger to Australia is Socialism, was, when in office in Victoria, most active in the furtherance of socialistic schemes. It is to the honourable member for Gippsland that we owe the institution in Victoria of workmen's homes. It was he who established the first village settlement in Victoria. That is the best kind of Socialism that could obtain anywhere. And yet he now tells us that those who are in favour of that policy are a menace and a danger to the' State, and ought not to be countenanced for a moment. To him also we have to give the credit of having placed under the Victorian Factories Act more trades and occupations than have all the other Premiers put together. It was he who said, in effect, "" These people are labouring under an injustice; I will see that that injustice is removed."" And he removed it by inducing the Victorian Parliament to pass resolutions which had the effect of placing a great number of industries under the Victorian. Factories Act. Yet he now says that Socialism, as advocated by honourable members pn this side of the House, should be combated. the Treasurer, who, although he has not said anything, no doubt endorses the sentiments of the Minister of Trade and Customs, did a very fine thing for Victoria, and caused his name to be blessed in many homes wfien He instituted the Cr6dit Fonder system. The proposals of the leader of the Opposition to interfere with the banks has been very seriously condemned, and yet the Treasurer amalgamated the Savings Bank and the Post Office Savings Bank, and placed their funds at the disposal of our farmers. But for his action many a man who is on the land to-day would have been a ruined outcast, and many farms which now remain in the hands of small proprietors might have passed into the hands of wealthy capitalists. When Ministers talk against Socialism they should recollect what has been done by themselves in times past. Then the Postmaster8 N General, who is a most active opponent of Socialism, made a novel socialistic experiment when he imported a number of prize bulls into New South Wales in order to assist the farmers of that State. The only complaint [ have heard in that connection has been caused by the fact that the bulls have not produced any stock. This prating of the dangers of Socialism is so much rubbish. All honourable members know that the Socialism of Australia is not the Socialism of Europe. Turning to one or two personal matters, I wish to say that it is very improper for a responsible Minister to impute motives to honourable members. The Prime Minister is wont to refer to some honourable members on this side of the Chamber as having entered into an alliance .with the Labour Party with the object of securing some personal gain. That is a most improper remark to make. Speaking in Sydney, he saidThe Labour Party's methods were simply those of delegates of the Political Labour Leagues. They could not even appear on the hustings without the permission of the leagues, not even to oppose men who had supplanted them. I shall leave the members of the Labour Party to answer that. He continuedSo the attempt of the Parliamentary Labour Party to take the place of their masters had failed. For example, Mr Hume Cook was run close on a heavy poll by Mr Hannah, a prominent labourleader. If Mr Cook could get a guarantee from the Labour Party that he would not be effaced, he would take over Mr Hannah's support, and"" Mr Hannah'would be coolly thrown over. Thus* would the Labour Party dispose of Mr Hannah. Mr Cook and Mr Isaacs, ancl others like them,, Then were in a position which did not reflect infinite credit upon their well known cleverness. I desire to say that before entering into this alliance 1 knew well that I should probably not be able to secureI did not seek any such thing-immunit y from opposition on the part of the Political Labour Council in the district I represent. As a matter of fact, I have had to fight labour candidates on three occasions, and each time. I have been returned by an increasing majority. I knew before I entered the alliance that the same kind of opposition would probably have to be fought again, and I was solely influenced by my own political views and my desire to represent the opinions of my constituents. Therefore, when the Prime Minister seeks to make honourable members believe that I was actuated by some paltry considerations of personal gain, he is speaking without the slightest justification. Before entering the existing alliance, I wrote to all the members of my committee-som e hundreds of ladies and gentlemen-and invited them to attend a public meeting at Brunswick. placed' before them the coalition proposals as agreed to by the honourable and learned member for Ballarat.and the Prime Minister, and I also submitted to them the proposals for an alliance made about the same time by the leader of the Labour Party. I told them that I did not think it right to accept the proposals of the right honourable member for East Sydney and the honourable and learned member for Ballarat. I added that I desired to obtain an expression of their opinion with regard to both the proposals. scarcely anything else. There was a long 'discussion, and eventually the following resolutions were carried.:That this meeting of Mr Hume Cook's combined committees thank him for his explanation of the facts concerning the proposed coalition with the free-traders, and of the alliance with the Labour Party; and that, in the opinion of this meeting, the coalition with Mr Reid's party should not be accepted on any terms whatever. I had, therefore, some warrant for joining the alliance quite apart from my own.inThe meeting was to be held on Wednesday, dividual feelings. As to the second pron t h November, some time prior to the posal, all the meeting had to say was day of the election, and certain speakers thisThat this meeting expresses its continued confias having been very active in opposdence in Mr Hume Cook as the representative of Bourke electorate.

ThenI views, I felt that I was free to act in any gave the best definition I could, quoting way I deemed best in the interests of the Webster, according to whom anarchy means Commonwealth, and my constituents. The"" absence of civil government.""

He stated that I was swept away, men and women would reported to have saidTo have the Labour Party in power would be as and the results would be such that bad as letting loose the animals in the Zoological we scarcely Gardens. It was so stated in the Argus, and I do I am not supported by any anarchists. not blame the honourable member for having If we have' anarchy in this country,"" been misled. any reference to the matter but for the fact letting loose some of the wild beasts that an inaccurate report has been placed from the Zoological Gardens.""

Among other things I had to answer statements I contained in pamphlets', such as one I have here, entitled, "" Hume Cook's double shuffle on the White Australia Question."" In that pamphlet my opponent, sought to show that I was a black Australian. Among those who assisted my opponent were some persons connectedwith the Trades Hall Council, ""and certain events occurred which seemed, to afford me a chance, of getting back at my opponents. The Trades Hall had been asked by Mr Fleming for the use of some portion of their building, for"" the -purpose of 'hording a meeting to comI said memorate the death of some anarchists. The Trades Hall Council, in perfect friendliness, but hardly knowing what they were doing, granted the use of the hall, and as a result a small bill was issued, which read as follows: IN MEMORIAM. . Of the Government Assassination of Chicago Anarchist Martyrs. were announced, including one of the gentlemen to whom I have referreding me. When I obtained possession of that bill I . called a meeting, I read the be free to .follow their own sweet will, dare contemplate them. I am not an anarchist,"" I said, "" and I should not have made. I added, "" it would be worse than Honourable sence of civil government, it means that are a number of men and women, though probably more men than women, who, if they could give free rein to their passions, would be worse than wild beasts."" I spoke only of anarchists. I made no reference whatever to the Labour Party in this connection. The proof of my statement lies in the particular pamphlet to which I have referred, and in another circumstance. The Trades Hall Council, and its associated political party, at a later stage gave the greatest justification to my remarks,, and by their action did themselves honour. As soon as the pamphlet was issued, the Trades Hall Council saw that a mistake had been' made. A special meeting was held on the 4th April, when a report was presented on the subject, and, in order to justify their position before the world, the council expelled from their ranks the man who was an anarchist and the cause of the meeting. The honourable and learned member for Wannon, the honourable member for Perth, and others who have misquoted me, will in future be able to state the facts. those remarks; all I quoted were the words of the honourable member about the twenty or thirty wire-pullers who "" wanted his billet."" nation, as I trust the honourable and learned member accepts my explanation in regard to the words about "" letting .loose the wild beasts."" that I used some very hard words during the contest-al l candidates so indulgebut I certainly never made use of the re marks which have been attributed to me. I should now like to refer to the question of preferential trade. I have said that with a coalition, or divided Ministry in power, great questions like that of preferential trade cannot possibly be dealt with; and here I desire to quote what the Prime Minister said before he became a member of the Ministry. Speaking at the Town Hall, Sydney, on the 29th November, the right honourable gentleman is reported in the Melbourne Argus as follows: Now, ladies and gentlemen, I denounce the Governmentthat was the Deakin Governmentfirst for their breach of faith in not submitting some preference to the mother country free from any sort of condition. If we can reduce the Tariff to a sound revenue tariff all the objection of the mother land will disappear. 8 N2 That is what the Prime Minister said prior to the elections. He was not then in favour of waiting for the mother country, and he had not then "" given the office'' to Lord Rosebery that Australia was not prepared to do anything in the way of. preferential trade. The attitude and speeches of the right honourable member since that meeting in the Sydney Town Hall justify Lord Rosebery, the leader of the Liberal Party in England, in saying that Australia is not ready to give preference to the mother country. I ask the Prime Minister and his -supporters why they do not now endeavour to reduce the Tariff, as they said they would if ever they got the chance? member desire the Tariff to be reduced ? tell the honourable member what I am prepared to do in order to get preferential trade. The Prime Minister now says that it is a question for the future; that we are not going to make trouble now, but must assume that Great Britain will make the first move. that. Town Hall, the right honourable gentleman said that we must make the first move. member is wrong. quoted the right honourable' gentleman's words, and I could quote a great many more if necessary. If I mistake not, the Prime Minister, on the floor of this House, said that we ought to give a preference to : the mother country by reducing the Tariff. sense. Minister poses as the friend of the farmer, the vigneron, the orchardist, and other producers. What sort of friend is he who refuses now to give that preferential trade which is to be the salvation of the producers ? not give thempreferential trade. could, and that he would do so if he got the opportunity. But the right honourable gentleman wants to make out that we oil this side are the opponents of the farmers and others on the land-that it is to him and his followers they must look for commercial prosperity.",37,Honourable Membeb Tha T Is A Relying Upon What He Read In Thepress

396,Mr Hume Cook,"There is a vastParty some time ago. The difference between a peace and a truce is so great as to justify some consideration. ""Peace"" means an entire cessation of hostilities, whereas a truce means a temporary cessation only, to permit of the burial of the dead, a consideration of the position, or something of that kind. of weapons, and the other means their destruction. the putting away of the weapons. you might need to use them again if war were declared. mean the cessation of war until you were ready. What did the Prime Minister say about the terms of the agreement for an -alliance? The most interesting and most important statement contained in that proposal is to this effectThe Tariff not to be altered in any respect durto sweep the polls as far as our party was ing the present Parliament without the consent of both parties in the Ministry. If the consent of both parties in ""the Ministry were obtained, of course there could be an alteration of the Tariff. But that is not the main point I intend to make. The fiscal issue not to be raised by the Ministry or any Ministerial candidate at any ""general election held prior to the next ordinary general election, and the policy of the Ministry on all fiscal questions intended to be submitted at such election to be made public before the ist May, 1906. Speaking on this point last night the honourable and learned member for Bendigo said that he had' not asked for an extended truce on the fiscal issue. who pointed out the weakness of this proposal. He said that if the truce were not extended over the next general election the members of the Liberal-Protectionist Party could be made use of by the free-traders until some time prior to the next general election, and then dropped. And when the honourable and .learned member for Ballarat was asked for an explanation of this matter he said, "" That is quite true. This proposal as to submission before the ist May, 1906, means that we are to get six months' notice of any proposed abolition of the truce, so that we, too, can prepare our weapons of warfare, and carry on the fight in a proper manner."" what I said. the Free-trade Party asked us for a truce, which meant making use of the Liberal-Protectionists during a certain period, giving us six months' notice of the revival of the free-trade issue, and then fighting us after they had crippled us. Labour Party has done with that corner. honourable member how it was proposed to cripple us, and how the protectionists who have joined the free-traders on the other side are under worse conditions than were offered to us. The free-traders propose to cripple us by organizing during the whole period oi the truce. Although we had been asked to agree to a truce, which in any case was to last until the ist Mays, 1.906, the free-traders in Sydney and elsewhere were not respecting the truce, but were organizing, doing their level best to get literature circulated, branches formed, and candidates in evidence, and intending to try concerned. That has not been denied, because the leaders of this movement were the present Postmaster-General and the honourable member for Lang. more than once. prove that, although it may have been denied, it is still being done.

443,Mr Hume Cook,"It is quite true that in any case, in May of 1906. I now wish to show that there are other reasons which compel us to speak of this matter, and I have a case in point. The free-trade importers of this country have, on many occasions, acted unfairly in their endeavour to destroy our manufacturing industries. I have in my hand a letter written to a firm of tanners in New South Wales, by the Fred. Alderson Company, Limited, of Bulletin-lane, Macquarie Place, Sydney. It is so remarkable a letter, that I think it deserves to be placed on the records It reads as followsDear Sirs, We have much pleasure in informing you that we have received instructions from the Vaughan Machine Company, of Peabody, Mass., USA., for whom we are the Australasian agents, to quote Beamhouse Fleshing Machines and Putting-out Machines at a, reduction of 20 per cent, for the present, and until further notice from the Vaughan Machine Company, and we earnestly urge you to consider the advisability of ordering at these conservative aspect, but we can point to a long and reduced prices, which, we might state, are only brilliant record of democratic service as a complete for a time, which has been done at our request, in answer to that. order to meet any competition that is in evidence at the present time in regard to such machinery.

When the present Ministry was formed, the Here is some proof of the necessity for raising this issue, when' a firm declares, practically in print, that they are reducing the price of their goods-for a time onlyin order to stamp out local competition. And they think the matter so urgent that the goods ought to be cabled for in order to break up the opposition of the local manufacturing firms. I have said before, and I now repeat, that that kind of competition had the effect of reducing the number of men employed in making this particular class of machinery by 50 per cent. There will be no one left in the industry if these tactics are to be resorted to, and more men will be le'aving the country, in addition to the 30,000 who, it is said, have already left it.

Because it means not merely the stamping out of local industries, but a further loss of population, smaller markets for those who remain, and higher taxation for those who have to bear the heat and burden of the day. these machines are in use in Australiaa dozen ? wish to say a word or two now concerning the alleged democratic followers of the right honourable member for East Sydney.

Labour Party, as now constituted, came into existence, and I have held a seat in Parliament for over ten years. WheneverI have been opposed by Labour candidates, I have beaten them by constantly increasing majorities; but, as a matter of fact, I have not yet nominated against a Labour candidate. The men who supported me at the last election were the Liberal-Protectionists of Bourke, while those member was glad to have the support of who supported the Labour candidates were those who believed in fhe platform of the Labour Party. The man who was supported by the Employers' Federation and the Reform League was Mr Grundy, him by over 4,000 votesIn these circumstances, we are quite justified in the Government, first, because they have declared a truce hi which we not support, because it will do injury to the interests of Australia. We do not believe in them, because their boast, that they will restore public confidence, is a phrase which means nothing, especially in view of the fact that at the time when the Tariff is operating in such a way that trade is being taken from our industries, and they cannot give employment. Victoria for the last fifteen years. there have been losses of population from Victoria for a long period. They were due, in the first instance, to the great banking crisis. At that time 75 per cent, of the banking institutions of Australia closed their doors; but we are carrying on to-day without any repudiation, which is a grand thing to be able to say. Probably no other There was never a bigcountry would have done what Australia has done in this matter. The second reason why population left Victoria was that the bank smashes were followed by a succession of bad seasons. Had it not been for the development of the Western Australian gold-fields, this country would no doubt have lost even more heavily than it has done. But whereas in the two years prior to the imposition of the Federal The honourable Tariff, Victoria Tost only 9,000 persons, in the two succeeding years she lost 30,000 persons; and while the Commonwealth as a .whole gained in population in the first period, it has lost about 6,000 I entered' Parliament before the persons, of whom 4,000 were adults, in the second period. The operation of the Tariff is responsible for this loss of population.

Then we are opposed to the Government because; while they profess to be the friends of the farmers, the artizans, and the producers generally, they are content to leave untouched such questions as the granting of bonuses for the production of iron and preferential trade. I cannot and will not support a combination which does that. I am opposed to the Government also because it is supported, both in this House and outside, not by a brilliant democratic following, but by an unscrupulous conservative following. I do not use my own terms and phrases in so describing it. The character of its backers outside is to. me the"" best of reasons for not supporting the Government. In the next place, the man whom I honour above all others in the political life in this country, and whose lead I should be content to follow if he were a free man, is not a member of the coalition, but is giving such support to it as leaves him free to act against it whenever he thinks fit to do so. When he chooses to again lead the party with which I am associated-and it must be remembered that the Labour Party were willing to accept him as their leader-h e will be in the position in which' all' the Liberal-Protectionists and democrats^ wish to see him. In the meantime, his position and attitude give the keynote to my position and attitude. If he cannot join Jche Ministry, I cannot support it. Lastly, I feel that, the protectionists who have agreed to follow the right honourable member for East Sydney have been so betrayed and trapped that they will never be able to join our party again. As the result, we have! been compelled to enter into an alliance with the Labour Party, and have, in the full light of day, put forward a programme which we believe represents the democratic thought and feeling of this continent. For that programme we will fight, and by it we will stand or fall. member for Bourke, in the course of his remarks, indicated that he anticipated that I would make things warm for him. I have no such intention. The honourable member, during the last fortnight, has been so depressed, and has looked so miserable, probably as the result of the prickings of a guilty conscience, that I do not find it in my heart to lay the lash very heavily upon him. He said that he had abandoned the Turner Government because it had written off Â£2,500,000 from the liabilities of the water trusts. What was actually written off was Â£700,000 from the irrigation trusts, Â£180,000 from vari : ous town waterworks, and Â£160,000 odd from local government bodies, making' a total of something over Â£1,000,000 of capital, together with arrears of interest, amounting to a little over Â£500,000. Thus the remissions aggregated only about Â£1,500,000, instead of Â£2,500,000 mentioned by the honourable member.

481,Mr Mccoll,"To my mind that prorealized. It is a snare, because it represents some of the bird-lime which, as the Premier of Western Australia has said, has been used by the Labour Party in order to catch supporters, and to further their cause. The theory of the Arbitration Bill is splendid, and if a measure could be framed upon sound and impartial lines, it would no doubt accomplish a great deal of good. The experience gained in New South Wales and New Zealand is not, however, at all conclusive that such a measure as that which has been recently before us would operate in the best interests of the community. has been criticised by impartial persons, including Dr, Clarke, who was sent out specially from America to inquire into its working, and who wrote an adverse report upon it. In New Zealand extreme doubt is entertained whether the measure will prove beneficial. The Melbourne Age recently published an article, in which the following passage occurred :New Zealand, for the next few years, will be an object-lesson to political economists. She is making experiments for the whole world, but, in the main, I am convinced she is doing it in a blind way. The enormous increase of the export trade, which has nothing to do with arbitration awards, has given her prosperity, and, therefore, the ability to bear the burden of social experiments. Industrial arbitration has affected every class, every phase of life. An award in one trade increases the cost of living in all the others. There is a perpetual enhancement of values. A dragon has been let loose in the land, because it was thought to be harmless, but he is gaining strength, and will devour the people unless they manage to chafn him. Who is going to chain him? Not Mr that miserable whining and crying when they Seddon, who thinks it is right that he should roam at large and for ever. It was not foreseen that an artificial value placed on labour would result in artificial values being placed on everything else. In a further article the following statement was made: . Amend the Act, as the Government may, however, industrial arbitration is being more boldly criticised. Carried to its logical issue as it has been, it has bred trusts in all directions. But for the fact that these trusts are the direct outcome of the fixing of payment for labour by law, the trade unionists would to-day be carrying on a vehement agitation against them. They dare not raise an outcry, because they know that investigation might suggest remedies of which they could not approve. The artificially enhanced prices for food are paid by nearly 800,000 people. The artificially enhanced wages are received by 27,640 male and female trades unionists. The last census gave a total of 234,346 male and female wage earners. The 27,000 unionists claim preference under the awards, and, at the same time, their awards result in the whole population paying higher prices. We hear a good deal about protection and the new protection. No doubt both are very good, but, like all good things, they can be carried to extremes. In all likelihood, a third kind of protection will spring into existence. This will contemplate, first of all, protection to the manufacturing interests; secondly, protection to the employees ; and, thirdly, protection to the consumers.

It was stated that the Labour .Government did not desire office. I have never been able to accept that statement without reservation. the fact. stances show that the party deliberately pursued a course which could have no other result than the ejectment of the then Government; and for them to say that they did not want office is much the same as a highwayman, who holds a pistol to your head, saying that he does not want your purse. If it were not correct that the Labour Party wanted office, why were there those paeans of exultation throughout Australia, and in other parts of the world? Why was there were defeated-suc h whining and crying as I have never seen in this Chamber during -my twenty years of parliamentary life? If the Labour Party were so keen about the success of the Arbitration Bill-if the measure was so immediately necessary-wh y did they not take action when last year the Government laid the Bill aside rather than accept the clause proposed? It was because the foundations were not completed; there was important work yet to be done, and they waited, cuckoo-like, until the nest was ready. I do not blame the Labour Party for taking office. I have nothing to say against them as a party, and if the people desire Labour rule, I shall cheerfully acquiesce and help such a Government all I can. But I detest the hypocritical affectation of indifference which they assume when they declare that they did not want office.

But when we were battling here for these duties, and trying to get 5 or 7 per cent, more of protection on vari1 ous items, did the Trades Hall give us any assistance? Not the least. We secured the duties which are in force now, simply because of the magnificent fighting done by the right honourable members for Adelaide and Balaclava. lot of assistance.

If the Trades Hall Council desire protection, why do they not engage that gentleman to use his great powers of eloquence in preaching the doctrine of .protection, not in this State, but in the other States. Why do not protectionists, instead of making speeches he're about the virtues of-protection, start a crusade in the other States, and try to convert the people of those States to the doctrine , as the present 1 Prime Minister tried to convert the people of Victoria to free-trade? We went before the electors with a demand for fiscal peace. I have here the Preferential Trade Gazette, issued by the Trade Protectionist Association, and signed by Sir William Lyne, Mr Chamber. The other night the honourable Poulter, Mr Sparks, and Mr Samuel Mauger, in which it is saidThe free-trader seeks lo destroy the present moderate Tariff. The protectionist desires to defend it. The free-trader threatens a new fiscal war. The protectionist asks for a period of fiscal peace. during the last nine months to account for this sudden upheaval, demanding an alteration of the Tariff, and an increase in the duties ? ber say that industries are not languishing? honourable member help them? are much worse to-day than they were nine months ago, and that they would suffer to some extent was expected when we entered Federation. Every member of the Protectionist Party advocated the policy of fiscal peace, and not one word was heard against it. and yet in less than nine months all this difference is to be made. The Age newspaper, on 23rd October last year, saidIn the nature of things this was unavoidable. The Tariff, as it finally emerged, was at least a protectionist one of its kind, and what it lost in effectiveness as the builder up of national industries, the Federation was compensated in giving a wider market to manufacturers. It was a great and arduous work, done, conscientiously in the main; and the business of the electors in the coming election will be to see that, for a course of at least three years, it is not interfered with. This cannot be too vigorously insisted upon. Mr ^.MAUGER -Will the honourable member read what tbe Age says now? able member for Melbourne Ports is the humble servant of the Age; but I am not. was very glad to get the Age to help him, and he will be glad to do so again. Age said thisThe Prime Minister spoke words that should command attention in all the ranks of the party, when he said, "" It is, above all things, desirable that the electors should realise what is the root and centre of the position. The root and centre is the maintenance of the Tariff as we have it . "" We want fiscal peace, the maintenance of the prosperity we have, and the enjoyment of preferential trade. The honourable and learned member for Indi, I am sorry to see, has just left the and learned member interjected, "" When did I promise to support fiscal peace?"" If that is the attitude the honourable and learned member is taking, it is a mean attitude. It is the attitude of the soldier who is told to carry out a certain line of campaign, but who has another one in his pocket, which, when he is away from his leader, he intends to pursue on his own account. This very question was raised by the Prime Minister of the day in Tasmania. I quote from the Age of. Decembern t h , 1903I t has previously been remarked that the free trade party is putting forward a different policy in every separate State. Mr Deakin put this telling point to the meeting, "" Men in Tasmania, who claim to be Opposition followers, he remarked, are adopting doctrines which are rejected by Opposition candidates in Victoria and New South Wales. You are entitled to judge each side by its own policy. You must look to the leader of a side, and take its pronouncement as his pronouncement alone; to that which he pledges himself he pledges his party. In this Tariff issue the Opposition leader pledges his party to fiscal war-to re-open the fiscal Tariff, to tear up the present Tariff, to strike off all protection whatever, and reintroduce commercial anxiety and unrest. That is the policy of the Opposition, and of. those who say they will support it. Every elector who objects to it must vote for the Ministerial candidate. Yet the honourable and learned member for Indi asks, ""When did I promise to support fiscal peace?""

The honourable member for Southern Melbourne saidThe Tariff is by no means settled, but it is not desirable to re-open it t ill we are forced by the book-keeping clauses to do so. Senator Best condemned the proposal to rip up the Tariff, which, he said, had been eminently successful, and which, according_ to the Age of the previous day, had caused an extension of trade representing Â£1,500,000. member for Balaclava said that they were not justified in tinkering with the Tariff, and that for these three years it ought to be left alone. The honourable member for Bourke said, on the hustingsHe would support the Government as regards the maintenance of the present fiscal protection and fiscal peace. compare what honourable members said then with what they are saying now. The honourable and learned' member for Northern Melbourne saidThere was no doubt the progress of Australia was retarded' by the constant tinkering with the Tariff. Western Australia nominally sent free traders to Parliament; but he found that the people there were very strongly opposed to further interference with the duties, recognising that unsettlement was worse even than a bad Tariff. The Hon. J. L. Dow, who was a candidate for the Senate, said the same thing, and the hqnorable member for Melbourne Ports saidHe had no intention of reopening the Tariff question. More was to be gained at present by fiscal rest, than by resurrecting the Tariff. The honourable member followed with some hard remarks on the Trades Hall, which I shall not read. Mr Wise, who stood' for the Senate, also took the same view, and Mr Barbour, who is now writing to the press, to say how badly off local manufacturers are as against those of other countries, and who stood for Kooyong, saidA l l parties are in favour of giving the Tariff a trial. Again, on 21st November, he saidThe first item in the programme was fiscal peace. Alteration at present would be calamitous. Protectionists called for fiscal peace to give the Tariff a fair trial. They courted the test which time alone could give it. The Tariff must not be disturbed till the expiration of the Braddon clause. what the present leader of the Opposition said when he went before his constituents. This is the honourable member who is going now to get people higher duties, in order to protect their manufactures. He is reported in the Age of 13th November last year, to have saidHe would not, in any circumstances, be a party to disturbing the fiscal peace now reached. The' Labour Party had been able to knock out a few of the taxes which pressed heavily on the people, and in this way had reduced the revenue by a large amount. The proof of the prudence of their cutting down the Tariff as proposed was found in the fact that, on examination, the Tariff, as The right honourable adopted, would now appear tÂ«Â» average about 15 per cent, all round. As it stood, it was a reasonable Tariff, and should be allowed to stand undisturbed. He took credit to the Labour Party for having reduced duties, and for the fact that, although the duty on tobacco and spirits was 200 or 300 per cent., the average rate throughout the Tariff was only 15 per cent. Will the honourable member now eat I think it just as well to his words, and vote for duties high enough to satisfy those who desire the re-opening of the Tariff? Even the right honourable member for Adelaide, when he went to Geelong to support the candidature of the honourable and learned meSmber for Corio, said that the Tariff should not be re-opened during the book-keeping period for any reason whatever. He said that it had been 1 a hard battle, and I am afraid that we shall not have a champion like him again. God help protection if those who are now trying to increase duties have to fight its battles. It is to the Labour Party that we owe the loss of many duties. I admit that several of them voted with the protectionists, and that without their assistance we could not have carried some of the duties in the Tariff. We did not expect the free traders to vote with us, but we looked to those who claim to represent labour of every -kind to help us in saving industries which had been established under protection, in order to prevent the men employed in them from being turned out into the streets, and their wives and children from being brought to want. It was a great disappointment when members of the Labour Party turned against us. The industries which are now crying out are chiefly the agricultural implement manufacturers, the makers of mining machinery, and those connected with",57,George Fairbairn

I know that we shall get a Tariff Commission from the present Government. Australia has adopted the policy of protection, and if it can be shown that any industry is languishing for want of an extra duty of 5, 7 J, or even 10 per cent., I believe that even the free-traders will be prepared to listen to fair representations on the subject, and will at least give as much as we should get from honourable members opposite. for protection? to say about the honorable and learned member by-and-by. When the Prime Minister was Premier of New South Wales, and altered the Tariff there, it was urged that certain industiies would be ruined if he took off all the duties, and therefore he consented to give them a certain amount of protection. To show that he is not so bad as he has been painted, let me quote the following passage from a speech delivered by him in the Legislative Assembly of New South Walesi n 1892, o r , 1 8 9 3 : It would now be impossible to carry out a free trade policy in Victoria. The vested interests were so great, and the number of human beings dependent upon them were so numerous, that any man with humane feelings would have the greatest difficulty in altering the system. I believe that if on inquiry it is shown that a reduction of duties would prove disasI need not go trous to any industry, or that a moderate increase of duties would have the. reverse effect, we shall get as much from the right honourable gentleman as from the honourable member for Bland, who boasted to his constituents that the Labour Party had reduced fhe Tariff to an all-round rate of 15 per cent. The Tariff will be saved by a period of fiscal peace, and not by re-opening it at the present time. Those who live in the metropolis, and come always into contact with the same people, hear only one side I anticipated of the case. I have travelled throughout the country, and I know that the feeling generally is that fhe Tariff should not be re-opened. I am convinced that if we appeal to the country now for increased duties, we shall not have a I am chance of getting them. We must give time for the operation of the Tariff to be seen. What we in Victoria consider low duties are considered high duties in' New South Wales, and while here we have a clamour for an increase in tbe duties, the Mr Lormer is a liberal of the protectionists in New South Wales are asking for fiscal peace, and are supporting the coalition. They say, ""Let time develop things. Let us get our factories started, our money invested, and our men employed, and, when vested interests have been created, make an effort to secure higher duties, if necessary. To act now is to act prematurely, and will jeopardize what we have gained."" As was anticipated by the Age, the loss of trade in some directions, owing to the operation of the Tariff, has been compensated by the increase of pur trade with the other States. The imports into Victoria from the other States of Australian goods-produc e and manufactures of all descriptions-were valued at Â£7,380,000 in 1899, and ""fell to",58,George Fairbairn

Tariff operated in the other States? with Victoria, and I am showing that the demand for a re-opening of the Tariff is somewhat unreasonable at the present time. The other States are in the same position in regard to protection as Victoria was in twenty or twenty-five years ago. Protection had to develop here, and it must be allowed to develop there; but its leaven will work from month to month, as industries are started, and. by-and-by we shall obtain more reasonable duties if we do not interfere with the Tariff at the present time. I do not know what protectionists will gain from this alliance with the Labour Party. The Minister of Trade and Customs plainly stated the case the other night, and I need not amplify his remarks. Every man is perfectly f ree under the alliance, and it is not likely that men like the honourable member for Maranoa, and the honourable member for Kennedy, will turn their backs upon their pledges, and upon the votes they have given in the past. What will the members of the alliance gain personally? Some of them joined it from an instinct of self-preservation ; but they will very soon find the ground cut from under their feet. Some of the strong members of the seceding Liberal Party, like the honourable member for Indi, who considers that he is impregnable, may be left untouched. But wherever the Labour Party can gain a seat it will be seized upon, and the honourable member who now represents that constituency will be torn down as if bywolves. up the honourable member. had better be prepared for the shaking up that he will receive. In order to indicate the. amount of reliance that is to be placed upon labour'alliances, I desire to direct attention to what is now passing in Queensland. I may say that if I were to take up; the same position as that adopted by honourable members who have allied themselves 1 with the Labour Party, I should sign the pledge straight away, and become a good honest labour man. I rshould not be a Laodicean, neither hot nor cold.

I think, at this late hour, it is our duty to frankly acknowledge the justice of their claim to recognition, and, in this connection, I would direct the attention of the Ministry to the thousands of cattle and sheep now passing over the border, in anticipation of the imposition of an increased stock tax. On the 6th October of the same year, in reply to a remark of the then Minister of ] He (the Minister of Lands) told us the farmers were well protected. Unfortunately for myself, I have not the good fortune of agreeing with the honourable gentleman. We are told that the farmer has his reaper and his binder free. So he has. Is his plough free? Is his harrow free? Is his chaffcutter free? Is the very twine with which he ties up his produce free? Certainly not. This shows that 1 the farmer has much to gain, and that there is much that he ought to gain, before he is placed on a level with his more fortunate brother in the town. And the miner, how is he on a level with the worker in the town ? He has a weight around his neck. We are told that the miners patriotically stood by protection in the past.

His candidature was not endorsed by the Government, who put forward the brother of the honourable member for Darling Downs, MrH . Groom, and endorsed his candidature. One would have thought that under , the alliance with the Labour Party, the leader of the Government would have 1 had the right to select his own nominee.

As a matter of fact, the members under the leadership of the honourable and learned member for Ballarat exercise a controlling influence now, because the free-traders have given way to a 'far greater extent than we have. Whilst those honourable members who have entered into an alliance with the Labour Party had a perfect right to do as they liked, there was no reason why they should rush at once into an attack upon members who chose to take their seats on this side of the Chamber. Instead of acknowledging that there might have been a legitimate difference of opinion, they took the first opportunity to blackguard honourable members on this side, to characterize them as traitors, and to charge them with having surrendered their principles, and having cast protection to the winds. honourable and learned member for Indi said, "" However, the door is open if you choose to return.""

I have been a parliamentary representative for my district for twenty years, and have never suffered a defeat; and it is to my constituents, and not to any association in town, or any newspaper that I am responsible. I desire to enter my strongest protest in a matter, which, however, may not quite concern the question we are now discussing.

Never in the history of Victoria have I known a Member of Parliament to hold a party political meeting on the Sabbath. Time and again efforts have been made to commence Sunday newspapers in Victoria; but such enterprises have never been permitted by the State Government. Those who will suffer in the long run from the introduction of secular business on the Sabbath, will be the working classes.

One of the greatest drawbacks to the success of Federation has been the unfederal spirit shown between New South Wales and Victoria. That spirit we all deplore; and I believe that the continuance in office of this Government for a time will have a good effect in molliwith a determination to get out of the fying, and perhaps removing, that feeling. To bring about a proper understanding between those two great States, which represent the great majority of the people of Australia, I would give up a good deal. Now that we have the chance to get those States into line we may settle the question of differential rates, and also the question of the utilization of the Murray waters. If we can only get those two States to act in harmony we shall place Federation on a stronger and firmer basis than we can otherwise expect. four small States! protected in the Senate. Is it wise at the present time to force on this motion, which will probably result in a dissolution? As the honourable member for Maranoa said the other night, frankly and honestly, if there were a secret ballot taken there would be no dissolution. I should riot care if a dissolution would settle matters, and return a majority on either side. I should not mind which. Labour Government, who, I am sure, would not act unwisely. If the Labour Party have a majority, let them take office, 1 but I am afraid that a dissolution will only mean that, after an appeal to the country, we shall come back practically as we are at the present time, and shall go drifting in the same fashion, with no good result to Australia. The!re is another matter we ought to consider. The last election took place in the middle of the harvest, and if there be a dissolution, that experience will be repeated. It is not just to country constituents, who are engaged on the soil, that they should be compelled to leave their work when every moment is precious. This may not matter to honourable members who know nothing of country needs or the precariousness of the returns from the soil; but it is not fair to country people to force a dissolution at this juncture. I was surprised at honourable members representing country districts-suc h as the honourable and learned member for Corio, and the honourable and learned member for Indi-pursu ing a course which they know must be detrimental to the great majority of their constituents. I hope that the motion will not be carried, but that we shall dispose of the remaining business, and get into recess. That would be good for all parties, and for the country generally. We could then meet and sit for six or seven months, and, slough, bend all our energies to business, and in an endeavour to realize the aspirations of four or five years ago, make the Commonwealth what it ought to be. ' words by way of personal explanation. I must apologize to the Housei f it is thought for a moment that anything I say may give the honourable member for Echuca more prominence than he otherwise would have. But the honourable member referred to two matters. One was the action I took publicly some years ago. I can only say that I happened-it was an accident, T suppose-to be a colleague of the honourable member in a certain Government. I found it my duty to take a certain course, and to put the ordinary law in motion in a very influential direction. The honourable member resisted that action. In the end I had to sever my connection with the Government. I placed myself in the hands of my constituents, and was returned unopposed, and at the first available opportunity the honourable member and his colI have no objection to a leagues were swept out of office. Immediately after that I had the honour to receive a portfolio in the next Government, formed by the present right honourable member for Balaclava; and I held office then for some years. On another occasion I took part in a general election, which* swept fhe honourable member for Echuca and his colleagues once more from office, and I again joined a Government, headed by the pre sent right honourable member for Balaclava, retaining my position until I resigned to come to this Parliament. The best credential I can have is the double endorsement of the people of Victoria. I am not afraid to pit my public character against that of the honourable member.

627,Mr Isaacs,"The House may judge howshortly. The honourable member stated that I . had practically supported free-trade in a speech delivered in 1892. That is going a long way back to dig up matters, even if his statement were correct. little Victorian "" digging ?"" shall not occupy any length of time. The honourable member for Echuca appears to me to have deliberately stopped short of the very point that would have given the exact truth to the House. The speech he referred to is reported in the Victorian Hansard, 'vol. 70, and commences at page 2071. The Victorian Parliament was then discussing the Budget of Sir Graham Berry, and the opinion I expressed in the speech was that a prohibitive Tariff was being intro' duced. I took care time after time in that speech to point out that it was not a battle between protection and free-trade, but that, in my opinion, it was' an advance to prohibition. I did not say that once or twice, but several times, and the honourable member must have seen the report. On page 2071, I saidIt is not a battle between protection and free trade. Neither do I think that it is a question between protection and prohibition, but I do think it is a question between prohibition of all foreign trade and any foreign trade at all. Further on, I saidWe are marching steadily on to absolute prohibition. Therefore, I think it is a question, not of free-trade or protection, because no one has attempted to storm the fortress in this citadel of protection in the southern hemisphere. No one has approached the question from that point of view, but it has been raised by those who wish to advance to prohibition; and, looking at the question fairly and squarely in the face, it is not a question in which free-trade is involved at all. and learned member for Ballarat said just the same thing. which the honourable member quoted. AfterI had spoken of the farmer and the miner, came the words which I asked the honourable member to quote, but which he said he had not with him. They are as follows: Is this a fair and equitable Budget that does all these things? That showed that I was speaking of the I think that the Administration does not particular Budget; and then I saidI desire to intimate to the Government now, or the Commonwealth, but I do not probecause I think it will Save time .hereafter, as pose to move an amendment, because that far as I am concerned, in explaining the position that I purpose taking up, that I intend to fight to question will have to be referred to the the very utmost against what I conceive to be the people probably within the next few inequalities of this Budget. Later on I used words, which explain the position I . have always taken up on the fiscal question. Can it be denied that"" when we have prohibition we create a monopoly? I object to the foreign trader having a monopoly here. One of the chief reasons for introducing protection was that it wculd prevent such a monopoly; that it would protect the people of this country against the foreign trader, who can ask what price he likes. Buti f we shut out the foreign trader absolutely, do we not create a monopoly at home ? Are we to oppress the great bulk of the people, the great body of consumers in the country-the farmers, and the miners, and the general population-by placing on their necks a monopoly ? There is not the slightest doubt that prohibition is another way of spelling monopoly. I think, that any one who intended fairly to represent me could not have mistaken , the views I expressed in that speech. I merely use these quotations in order to show whether now, or in the future, any reliance can be placed on the word of the honourable member for Echuca. matter mentioned, I merely wish to say that it came twice before the Victorian Parliament, and Parliament endorsed the action of the Government, and not the action of the honourable and learned member for Indi.

The debate, so far as I have followed it, appears to have been nothing but a mass of apologies from the protectionists on the Government side, and I do not know how they can explain their action in placing themselves under a free-trade leadership. We are told that the Minister of Trade and Customs is the equal in all things with the Prime Minister, but looking at the former, and also at the right honourable member for Balaclava, and others who have been associated with the Protectionist movement, we may see that they are not very comfortable.

I shall support this motion, because I do not think that the Administration is calculated to advance the interests of the Commonwealth.

For fighting for a White Australia. No part of the Commonwealth has fought harder for the policy than has Queensland. But when a deputation waited upon the. Minister of Trade and Customs about the Chinamen, he said, ""Send them to Queensland; but of course you will have to ask the permission of Queensland."" member that there was no truth in the report, and he said he was glad to hear that there was not' but that he had prepared his speech, and 'must deliver it. told the Minister that I was going to mention this matter. deputation that the consent of the Queensland Government would have to be obtained, still it could be seen that his leaning was to get rid of the Chinamen in Little Bourkestreefr and Adelaide by sending them up to Queensland. Now, that State will not reI do' not intend to inceive any Chinamen. We intend to have a White Australia. That is one reason why I think that the Administration doe's not possess the confidence of the House and of the Commonwealth. If there is one idea which is permeating the minds of Austra1 lians to-day, it is that we should have a White Australia. In the administration .of the Immigration Restriction Act, apart from what I have said, there is I think very great danger. When the subject was being considered here, I sat on the other side of the House. I did not go as far as some of my honourable friends on this side would have like'd me to go. They wished to draw the 1 colour line, but that, I thought, was going a little too far. I voted for the application of an educational test, and the exclusion of those who might come here under, the contract system. But what do we find now ? We find that all sorts of loopholes are being made, so that black, yellow, brown, tan, or any other colour can enter if they come in with a passport. Who is going to sign the document, or who knows anything about it ? Those who have lived in Queensland, and seen Japanese, instead of nurse girls, wheeling perambulators through the streets, as I have in Townsville, will know what this change means. From time to time in Little Bourke-street a. Chinese riot takes place, and the desire is to shunt them into Queensland. We do not want them there at all.

I was elected as a follower of the honourable and learned member for Ballarat, and I was proud to'follow him. It has' been said in this debate that the Labour Party was anxious for office. What are the facts of the case?

Did he advise His Excellency to dissolve the House? No. Did he advise His ExAlthough he told the cellency to send for the right honourable member for East Sydney?

What sort of fair play did he receive here? other side of the House we see free-traders and protectionists combined-for what purpose?-no t to forward the fiscal issue, not to develop theindustries of the Commonwealth, but simply to "" down "" the Labour Party. The result of ""this combination is to drive men into the arms of the Labour Party. The Government are not deserving of our confidence, because they are leaving what, I think, is a most important question in the hands of a private member. What do they intend to do with the Manufactures Encouragement Bill? do anything? and Customs is, I know, in sympathy with the development of Australian industries, but he is in ba'd company now. The honourable member for Hume, or another private member, is to be allowed to take charge of this measure; and the Government shelter themselves behind the fact that the question of State ownership was referred to the States Governments some time ago. The States Governments of six, or eight, or twelve months ago are not the States Governments of to-day. States there has been a big change. New South Wales there has been a change. but still there has been a change.. In Queensland we have had a change for the better, and I am not sure now whether, if an inquiry were addressed to the Government, the Premier would not say, ""Yesi, we shall take the matter in hand."" Slate there is plenty of ore, flux, and coal; it contains all the requisites for carrying on authorities of the principal cities of Europe, the iron industry. In Tasmania and Western Australia there has also been a change of Government. Let the question be again referred to the States Governments of to-day, and let us ascertain what they think. If they do not wish to take up the industry, let it be carried on by private enterprise ; but let us have the industry established at any cost. If the States will not take it up, let us give the bonus to private persons. It is too big a thing to allow to go without some .effort. :Much as I should like to see the industry nationalized or municipalized, I desire first to see it established, whether under private enterprise or State control. With regard to the Agent-General, I should like to say that I think there has been a good deal ot sense in what has been said about the present Government pandering rather too much to On the the States Governments. I had thought that this being the Australian Parliament, instead of our having to go to the States, the States would come to usWhen in common with many honourable members of this House, and many perhaps more able men who are not members of the House, 1 advocated the Federation of the Australian It has had that effect upon me. States, I told the people that it would mean the abolition of fhe Agents-General oi the whole of the States, and that there would be one Australian representative for the whole Commonwealth. Why has not this proposal been carried out ? The present GoDo they propose to vernment say, "" We must ask the States The Minister for Trade first."" Sir Horace Tozer, Mr Taverner, and others must be asked before we can appoint our Agent-General, or General Agent, which is the name by which I would prefer to call the officer. I think there has been too much of the frills of ambassadorship, tbe wearing of the cut-away at evening entertainments, rather than loking after the disposal of Australian produce in the European markets. What we require instead of the Agents-General, is one General Agent, who will really represent Australia in LonIn nearly all the don, and who will seek to place Australian In products not only on British markets, but on the markets of Europe. We require a really gpod commercial agent, and such a man and his staff could be secured for about one-third of ' what ' the States are now paying for their six Agents General. What are"" those officials doing ? They are merely attending Mansion House banquets, and banquets at the Hotel Cecil. In that What we want is a General Agent who will place himself in communication with the and let them know what products Australia has to sell them. The sooner we get a Commonwealth High Commissioner or Agent and abolish the present States' Agents General, the better it will be for Australia. We can get from America an illustration of what mav be done in this direction. If honourable members go into any of the leading capitals in Australia, they will find samples of the leading prQducts of the United States.

I believe that the Labour Party exhibited great indiscretion in turning out the Deakin Ministry. Our honourable friends opposite talk about protection, and suggest that the present Tariff is ruining the industries of the conutry. If they think that, why did they not assist to keep the Deakin Government in power? to raise the question of protection now, and for whose benefit? the artisans in Melbourne and the great cities of Australia.

Our friends who have joined the alliance wish to re-open the Tariff, and one of the duties which they wish to increase is that on agricultural' machinery. To increase, that duty would not assist the farmers. We have heard a great deal of talk about putting men on the land. I wish that some of those who are so fond of using the phrase, had to make their living off the land. They would then know, as I know, with what difficulties and troubles the farmers have to contend. The only way in which Parliament can help the farmers is by enabling them to raise and transport their produce as cheaply as possible to the Home markets. To speak of helping them by imposing a land tax, or by increasing the duties on agricultural machinery, is abFor the benefit of surd. Those proposals are made only for the benefit of the artisans in the towns. I am afraid that when I go before my electors-whic h will not be very long, I suppose.

We are not doing our duty to our constituents in allowing such conduct in this Assembly. It was most undignified and unfair for the honourable and learned member for West Sydney to act as he did. He endeavoured to put upon the Prime Minister acts for which he himself was respon. sible, in order to lower him in the eyes of the community. I wish now to say a few words to show why I cannot support the Socialist or Labour Party. sible for any member representing a country constituency to do so. from country constituencies ourselves ! are pleased, with the representation which they have obtained. If I supported the legislation which the Labour Party have proposed, and are proposing, I could not hope for thesupport of my constituents. I told my electors that I was opposed to such legislation as the provision of the Post and Telegraph Act which prohibits the employment of lascars on mail steamers, the result of which has been that, up to the present time, our English mail contracts have not been renewed. It may be asked, how does that affect the farmers ? Every one knows that the farmers depend largely on the mail steamers for the conveyance of perishable producer to the old country; but the Labour Party, out of mere sentiment-becaus e the lascars do not interfere in any way with the state of the labour market here, and their removal from the mail steamers would not benefit a single working man in the Commonwealth-sup ported legislation which seriously interferes with the shipping companies which have developed the carrying trade for perishable produce to the old country. The way to assist the farmers is to provide for the carriage of their produce to the Home markets at as cheap rates as possible. Another reason why I cannot support the Labour Party is that they propose to bring all farm servants under the operation of the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill. Speaking as a farmer, and knowing what I am talking about, I say that if that proposal were carried into effect the dairy farmers and others in the country who now employ labour would be unable to continue to make a living, and the country would be used merely for grazing. hot. propose to fix eight hours as a day's work for agricultural employees. We would leave it to the Court to say what is a fair day's work. want an army of inspectors travelling round their farms to see how long the men are being worked, anjd what wages are being paid to them. that the wages paid in any industry are It is imposgoverned by the profits made in that industry. a little less. Yarra knows perfectly well that the coal strike at Outtrim failed because the men demanded higher wages than the compam could afford to pay. was the cause. wages raised over and over again, but the directors had to make a stand when the miners asked for higher wages than they could afford to pay, and consequently shut them out, so that .the strike was an. utter failure. Similarly the farmers cannot pay higher wages than the profits of their industry will allow. If honourable members can show me that the price of farm produce can be raised sufficiently to allow us to give our employees eight hours a day, and to pay double wages, I shall be very glad. The honourable member for Bourke has had a great deal to say about the emigration of young farmers from the country. That has happened because the remuneration to be obtained from farmingpursuits is not sufficient to induce them to stay in the country. cannot get land to settle on? available everywhere; but the State, by fixing minimum rates of wage for employments in the city, is responsible for the drifting of many young men from the country to Melbourne.

It must be remembered that the farmer Gas to compete in outside markets against the competition of the world, and it is the prices reigning in those markets which govern his operations. When I was before my constituents, I advocated preferential trade, but the Age ingored that fact altogether, and classed me as a rabid free-trader and a crusted conservative. I was never a conservative in my life, and the fact that honourable members seem to regard me in that light shows that they are guided by the Age.

719,Mr Henry Willis,"The Labour Partyan extract from a speech"" of the right honourable gentleman, in order to show what he said of the Labour Party in those days. This speech was delivered after the Labour 'Party had supported him as Premier for twelve months, and when he knew all about our caucus system and methods generally. He knew that we were then controlled by outside organizations, just as we are' today. Mr Reid saidI want to say this. There are some constituencies in this country which are called labour constituencies; where labour predominates, and labour elects its men. In such cases-and you will find a good many-wher e the labour man has stood loyally to the Government-min d you, they knew what it meant; they knew that in sticking to us it meant a dissolution soon. If they had given in to the blandishments, and they were many, of Sir Henry Parkes, and gone against us, the position, of this Government to-day would not be so strong as it is. It is only common fairness and justice to make this announcement to the country, and I say that, in labour electorates, where there is a protectionist against a labour man who stood loyally to us, let.the. free-traders of those electorates show their recognition of his loyalty by voting for fhe labour candidate. then supporting free-trade. just as we are to-day. Then the right honourable gentleman thought it better for the electors to support a labour man than.to support a protectionist, but to-day he is on the Treasury bench to fight us because we area danger to the country. As I said just now, if he is sincere in his distrust of the policy we advocate, and if he regards us as more dangerous than protection, it is fair that he should be in a coalition of the kind we now see. right honourable gentleman on the occasion referred to went on to sayThere are some very prudent men, who might whisper in mv ear, "" Oh, don't say anything about lnbonr candidates, because the people might get frightene.d."" But when men act fairly and squarely by you, as they did by me, not making a whisper of a bargain, or coming to me with a whisper for terms, or standing away from us, but loyallv and honestlv standing by us, I would not be worthy of out of sympathy with labour. The labour repremy position as the head of the free-trade party 1 sentatives had stood by him in his hour of greatest if I did them an ill turn. take the same course to-day Mr Reid will say'the same thing. if the Prime Minister does not really believe that our programme and methods are worse than protection, he is on the Treasury benches simply through gluttony of office. In the election to which he referred in that speech, whilst there was no. particular agreement, it was understood that;., as far as possible, no free-trader should stand against a labour candidate, and vice vefsd, and that was carried out, I believe. "" Mr Reid was speaking at a free-trade meeting, where a labour candidate was opposed to Mr Anderson, the right honourable, gentleman's own nominee. The speech was as follows:' The free-traders naturally wanted to get their own man in, it was a splendid fight between Alderman. Banner's friends and their friends, and whichever man got in he would fight the same fight. Therefore, he said to the people of Waterloo, "" If you cannot fight for Mr Anderson fight for the iabour man."" He asked the electors to vote for a labour man who was controlled by a caucus and outside organizationsa man whom he has since declared not to be free to go into the House as a representative, but simply as the nominee of a machine. were supporting his Government. I am trying to point' out. When it meant the Premiership of New South'Wales, the right honourable gentleman supported the nominee of the machine. free speech, which must be preserved in : this Chamber, no matter what the opinions of the honourable member who is speaking ; may be, honourable members are bound to listen. If any other honourable member . holds different opinions, it is for him to ' express them when he has an opportunity , to speak, and not to force other views on. The, the honourable member addressing the Chair, i I hope honourable members will refrain' from interjections, which seem to have no other purpose than to force on the honourable member addressing the House, views which he does not wish to adopt. !Reid spoke as follows:No Free-trade and Liberal Party should be trial. -Did the right honourable gentleman stand by us in our "" hour of greatest trial ""? The right honourable gentleman, in returning thanks after the election saidThere are some who think I have gone too far, -in what they call pandering to the lower classes. ^Gentlemen, these political Pharisees, if they had lived at the time of our Saviour, would have called thim by the same names, because the only offence I have committed is one which the Great Author",72,George Fairbairn

800,,"D i d the honourable member Mr CARPENTER -The honourable mema uniiicationist. 1 believe that the present Prime Minister has acted wisely in picking out the best men of his party to form his Cabinet rather than selecting men from the different States. Other leaders of Federal Governments have selected men from the different States to form their Cabinets. That may have been very necessary in the beginning of Federation. But I think it is a good thing to break it down as soon as possible, because 1 am still in favour of party government, and in favour of placing on the Treasury bench the best men of the party, irrespective of the constituencies or localities from which they come. I take it that that is what the present Prime Minister has done. member for Wilmot? much about the honourable member for Wilmot as about my dear old friend the right honourable member for Swan. I think that the Prime Minister has been wise, and I congratulate the right honourable gentleman upon picking his best men. We used to think a good deal of the right honourable member for Swan. We used to have an idea that the right honourable gentleman was a great organizer and administrator, and that he was a power. But I suppose that the least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he, and looking at' the honourable member for Macquarie we are forced to the conclusion that, the Prime Minister having picked his best men, the honourable member for Macquarie is a more able administrator and a better man in every possible way than the right honourable member for Swan. not imagine that the right honourable member for Swan is as hungry for office as are some honourable members on the other side. Minister has acted on a good principle, and 1 am here to defend it. In forming his Cabinet a Prime Minister should not pick men merely because they come from particular States. The best men of the party should be taken into the Ministry. I congratulate the Prime Minister upon having adopted that course. never have a show if that is going to be the a stranger in these parts."" rule. Were the best men of the Labour Party picked for the late Ministry? Some of them did not think so. gratulate the present Prime Minister upon excluding the right honourable member for Swan from his Cabinet, and putting in his valet, the honourable member for Macquarie. I am not voting against this Government because they have too much or too little policy. Without being greatly troubled' as to what their policy is, I am against the Ministry. The right honourable member for East Sydney has himself laid down that line of reasoning. From the time the Labour Party came into power the -right honourable gentleman said that it was not so much the policy of the Government to which he objected, but what they were likely to do in the future if allowed to remain in office. The honourable member for Gippsland has stated practically the same thing. That honourable gentleman is not troubled so much about the milk-and-water policy of the Labour Party, as by the fear that they might become tigers if they remained in office. The same reasoning may be applied to the present Ministry, and whether they have or have not disclosed their policy I am against them. opposite squealed terribly when that reasoning was applied to their own party. word about it. The only policy on which the present Government are solid is the Trade' Marks Bill. Some time ago the Prime Minister addressed a meeting in the Protestant Hall, in Sydney. Just after the honourable and learned member for Ballarat had been made Prime Minister, .the right honourable gentleman used words about him to this effect: "" Mr Deakin is a most amiable gentleman; he is an orator who can string words together fairly fluently, though there is not much in them after they have been strung together. Still, what has he done that he should be made Prime Minister?"" mark in my life. I have always admitted that the honourable and learned member was absolutely qualified for the office. . honourable gentleman's disclaimer; but the statement appeared in the newspaper, and it was added that some one interjected, "" Well, Georgie, what have you ever done?"" to which the reply was, ""You are",77,George Fairbairn
