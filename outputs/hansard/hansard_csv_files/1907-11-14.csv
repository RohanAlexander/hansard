Also in another paragraph in the same issue, it is stated-"" On Monday afternoon, a telegram was lodged, in Melbourne for despatch to the proprietor of this paper. We received the wire at 7.35 on Tuesday night, after it had been sent in error to PeakH ill , Western Australia, or 26 hours after the message was lodged.

NEW Postmaster-General, upon notice-With reference to questions relating to prohibitions recently issued by the New Zealand Postal authorities, against the transmission of mail matter to and from certain firms or persons trading in the CommonweaUh, is it a fact that certain of these firms or persons were previously prohibited by his Department; and, if so, why were such prohibitions withdrawn 01 allowed to be inoperative? honourable member's question is as followsYes. The delivery of correspondence to one firm or institute was prohibited in January, 1906; but the prohibition was removed in the following April, on the advice of the Crown Law Officers, upon the principal of the firm or institute ih question giving a written undertaking that he would not again infringe the provisions of the Post and Telegraph Act 1901. .

In 1902, a Bill providing for the payment of a bonus upon fhe production of iron was introduced by the right honourable member for Adelaide, after the matter had been inquired into by a Royal Commission. As is well known, the measure did. not become law. A majority of honourable members in that Parliament were averse to the granting of bounties. honourable members moving about the chamber and holding private conversations, that, it is almost impossible for the Treasurer to proceed. I must ask honourable members to obey the ordinary rules of debate. was introduced by the right honourable member for Adelaide did not become law, because at that time a majority of honourable members were opposed to the granting of bonuses for the purpose of fostering the iron industry. Upon 22nd March, 1.904, I brought forward another measure having a similar object in view. That did not meet with the favorable reception which I had anticipated, and consequently it was not passed into law. Again, in 1905, a Bill of a similar character wassubmitted, with a like result. I am now proposing the second reading of a measure which, though not identical with its predecessors, contains very similar provisions to those which were embodied in them. I have brought it forward because the Tariff has been so arranged that if it does not receive the approval of honourable members we shall then be in a position to deal with the question of iron and steel in another way. I am very strongly in favour of fostering the iron industry by means of bounties, because I hold that. if a duty' be imposed upon iron-and that is the only alternative presented to us-if will be, to some extent,, a tax upon the raw material used in many of our manufactures. In Division VIA ; of the Tariff, we propose to grant to manufacturers an increased' protection of 2 or 3 per cent, in consequence 1 of the imposition of duties upon pig iron, and a variety of other products to which I shall presently refer. Treasurer to refer in detail to matters connected with the work of the Committee of Ways and Means. I must ask him to make only an incidental reference to the Tariff schedule. inextricably interwoven with the Tariff proposals that I hope a little latitude will be extended to me. posals.

I do not wish to infringe the rules of debate, but it would be almost impossible for me to explain fhe provisions of this Bill without referring to the Tariff proposals of the Government. to have taken place in Committee.

I am merely administering the Standing Orders, which preclude reference being made, in a debate upon one measure, to a debate upon another measure. If the Treasurer intends to refer in detail to the Tariff proposals, I cannot possibly allow him to do that. But I would point out that he will be able to accomplish his' object by emphasizing the advantage of adopting the bounty method of encouraging the iron industry without discussing the exact rates of duty set out in the Tariff schedule. tion, sir, is a practicable one, and I shall gladly adopt it.

In every country in the world, where the iron and steel industry has become prominent-suc h as Canada and the United States, and, in earlier days, Great Britain a bounty has been the first step towards development. I am merely proposing what Has been proposed three times before, namely, a bounty without a duty in the first instance, but with a provision that, when there is sufficient production, not only from one mill, but, perhaps, from a dozen, to prevent any great rise in prices, we may be relieved from the necessity of paying a bounty, and may impose a duty -Mixed Metalware ' That is the whole theory of the proposal now laid before honourable members. should like to' refer to the great imports of not only pig iron and bar iron, but iron manufactures as a whole.

Sir WILLIAM LYNE say that part of this B ill was originally and that, as it left his hands, it contained a provision somewhat approaching what is now known as the new protection. ' That provision, however, was not in itself complete, as compared with the new protection proposals which we now have under consideration. I , therefore, eliminated it, determining that if the Bill were carried the one general policy of the new protection should apply., to the industries to which it relates as well as to others. I thought it desirable to make* a passing reference to that matter-, in order that honourable members should know what are the intentions of the Government in regard to the wages and conditions of labour of the men engaged in the industry. I consulted the Prime Minister about the matter, and I thought it was better to bring this industry under the general policy of the new protection rather than to insert in the Bill provisions relating specially to it. If we sought in this B ill to deal with the wages of employees and conditions of labour in the industry, we should thus create two different classes of cases to be adjudicated upon.

I think that the Minister ought to reconsider this item. Sir WILLIAM LYNE I made the alteration in consequence of the recommendation of the protectionist section of the TariffI n Commission, and should like to hear what the Chairman of the Commission has to say on the subject. Mr W. H . IRVINE -There should be an ad valorem duty, with a fixed minimum. have a minimumrate fixed. Personally I should prefer ad valorem duties such as the old rates of 10 per cent, and 15 per cent. The proposed change in the rates will not seriously affect the revenue, but it is rather unjust that cheap guns should be called upon to bear as high a duty as are the most expensive varieties. The present scheme of duties was first suggested in South Australia by an experienced gunsmith and merchant. His proposal was afterwards supported in Victoria by expert gunsmiths, who gave very satisfactory and clear evidence. and perhaps wished to get dear guns admitted at a low rate. interested in local manufacture. facture of guns. interested in repairs. Further, they wished to import gun stocks for the purpose of putting guns together in the Commonwealth. The old rates of duty were very low. Ten per cent, was imposed upon guns, revolvers were dutiable at 15 per cent., and military and match rifles were admitted free. The object of levying these fixed duties is to limit the importation of cheap rubbish-chea p guns, rifles, and revolvers which have been proved by bitter and disastrous experience to be dangerous to life, and not at all calculated to develop good rifle, gun, or revolver practice. Both these witnesses affirmed that the commonest rubbish in the world was imported into the Commonwealth under the operation of the moderate duty of 10 per pressly designed to discourage the use of low class guns, rifles, and revolvers that will exclude this rubbish. A 10 per cent, rate will be absolutely ineffective, and a 20 per cent, duty might not be sufficient to keep out revolvers which are worth only 4s. or 5s. These weapons very frequently find their way into the hands of boys, and their use often results in the loss of life or limb.",23,Thomson Bu T There My Efforts To Encourage The Industry I N

I do not object to the imposition of a duty upon this class ofimports, but I do object to charging the same rate upon a fowling-piece worth £ 6 0 as is levied upon a gun which is worth only £ 5 .

I admit that there is a cheaper class of gun-principall y of German or Belgian make-whic h is sold in Australia for about 50s.

But I do not wish to propose an ad valorem rate in conjunction with a specific duty without first hearing more about the matter. my opinion it is most unfair that a common gun should be called upon to bear the same duty as is a valuable weapon. It iswell known that one cannot purchase a, first class Purdey gun under about eighty guineas landed here. I do not agree with the honourable member for South Sydney that the use of an expensive gun is prompted by mere fancy. The very best value that can be offered to a man is to be found in a good gun.. Less than three years ago I saw a gun sold for about / [ 6 . It was so badly put together that the shot from the right barrel crossed the shot from the left. That defect is easily accounted for in the manufacture of a gun. Some persons imagine that the barrels of a gun are straight. But, as a matter of fact, in a double-barrelled weapon they are crooked. I suggest that a fixed duty should be imposed upon pea rifles, reFor that reason I am volvers, &c. In mv judgment, pea rifles are the most dangerous weapons in use in Australia to-day. They carry much further than one would think, and almost daily we read of accidents occurring through their use. they are in the hands of inexperienced persons. much more dangerous. shoot with flannelette.

For such purposes a gun at 27s. 6d. or .30s. is quite sufficient; and my own opinion is that there ought to be a duty of 15 and 10 per cent., which would tax the man who prefers to use a weapon at £ 4 2 . We have heard much about bad guns and accidents which occur; but most accidents arise from the fact that the people who use the weapons do not understand them, or do not exercise sufficient care I may say that only a few weeks ago I was lent a gun, the cost of which was 27s. 6d., and I shot with it as well as I have ever shot with much more expensive weapons. move That after the figures "" us.,"" paragraph A, the words "" and on and after 15th November, 1907 (General Tariff), ad. val., 15 per cent.,"" be inserted. have listened with great interest to the debate; and I now understand how it is that I have never been really successful as a shot. The explanation of the honor-, able member for Fremantle shows how it is that I have never been able to hit anything alive. I once shot a bird 100 yards off on the top of a tree, but when it came down it proved to have been dead for years. On another occasion I nearly shot myself, and on a third occasion I nearlyshot my friend. My eye and my aim were right, but I must have had one of those guns to which the honourable member refers; and I am glad to . have the matter cleared up. I think that the proposal of the honourable member for Bass is The simplest way out of the difficulty. As that honourable member, and also the honourable member for South Sydney, said, a matter of 2s. or 3s. cannot make any difference; and we have no object in imposing a duty of us., which would be a heavy impost in the case of a cheap gun. As the honourable member for Bass has said, the people who use these cheap guns are those whom we do not desire to tax to any extent. the suggestion for a small fixed duty, and an ad valorem duty similar to that imposed -on bicycles, pianos, and other articles. I hold the further bpinion that there ought to be some establishment where fire-arms can be tested. I have here a price list of imported sporting guns, and in that I. read the following description of a gunHlack steel or imitation Damascus barrels, left choke, top lever, extension rib, single bolt, rebounding locks, case-hardened frame, chequered snap fore end, walnut stock with chequered straight or pistol grip, steel heel plate, £1. These prices are subject to a trade discount of 10 per cent., and of 2 per cent, for prompt cash. I have also here two samples of gun barrels given to me by a gun repairer, who is interested neither as an importer nor as a maker. One sample is a portion of an imitation Damascus barrel, and is painted to look like ordinary steel; and the other sample is a portion of a real Damascus barrel. I repeat that if all fhe cheap guns could be tested at the Customs House many deaths would be prevented, I and the additional cost would not be by any means serious. The gun repairer to whom I have referred gave evidence before the Tariff Commission,and he showed that the imitation barrel is practically an iron pipe painted, and must be 1 a source of danger. This is not a fiscal question; and I think it ought to be treated just as we treated the question of the importation of opium, when dealing with the last Tariff, merely regarding it from the point of view of the safety of the public. We ought to impose a duty which will restrict, as far as possible, the importation of dangerous guns. My own opinion is that it would be better to admit the guns absolutely free, and to have them tested, than to impose a duty without requiring any guarantee. There haye been accidents in the case of guns used by rifle clubs;. and we know that the average Australian boy runs great danger when he buys a gun for jQi and goes out for a holiday. certain standard of gun. to be an examination to insure that the standard is observed. The fact of a barrel being called a "" Damascus"" has very little to do with the matter, because some of the highest class barrels are steel. I have been shooting with steel-barrelled guns for seventeen or eighteen years without any danger to myself ; and that proves that we must not take too much notice of the samples which have been produced. The portion of the barrel submitted by the honourable member for Yarra as Damascus steel of the highest quality shows evidence of being a portion of a gun that has burst, whereas the other barrel, which is supposed to be rubbish, has not burst.

I can assure honourable members that nine-tenths of the men who go out shooting have no idea of what is a proper charge. If I were shooting with a common gun to-morrow, I would not use the same charge that I would in the case of a high-class gun; and there is very little danger in any gun if it be properly used. I should like to see a fixed duty upon pea rifles, revolvers, and similar weapons, with an ad valorem duty on ordinary guns. I prefer the old duty, but, on consideration, [ shall support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Bass. Sir WILLIA M LYNE (Hume-Trea surer) [4.45] I think that the rates proposed are rather low. An average value for a gun is £ 3 , on which an ad valorem duty of 10 per cent, would come to only 6s. It is very much by chance that one gets a good gun at a low figure; I know that from experience. Some of the cheap guns are really dangerousI t would be a good thing if , as suggested by the honourable member for Yarra, all guns could be tested; but that is impossible. from the Continent. Sir WILLIA M LYNE I am not sure that that is so. Some very poor guns come from Great Britain. all imported guns be marked in a way which would guarantee their soundness? so. While an ad valorem duty of 10 per cent, comes to a great deal on a forty guinea gun, it would amount to nothing at all on a £ 1 gun. sound guns can be bought for £ 2 ' each. chance that one gets a good gun at that price.

In view of the assurance of the Postmaster-General, I do not wish to press my amendment. The protectionist wing of the Tariff Commission recommended an all-round duty of 15 per cent.; and, therefore, the present duty means an increase of 75 per cent, on that recommendation.

We should endeavour to cheapen these stoves as much as possible, and that being so I am prepared to support the amendment foreshadowed by the honourable member for Corangamite. [6.13] -A t one time about ten firms were engaged in the gas stove industry in Melbourne, and were doing well. The Metropolitan Gas Company, however, has for some time been supplying mostof the stoves used in the metropolis, and within the last twelve months or two years has imported over 2,000 stoves of a cheap class. The result is that they have practically ruined the gas stove industry in 'Victoria. I have seen stoves imported by them which are inferior to those of local manufacture. That being so, I hope that the Committee will agree to the duty proposed by the Government so that the industry may again be placed in a flourishing condition. We are able to make a first class stove at a reasonable price, but the local production has been run off the market by the importation of cheap stoves. When I previously addressed the Committee, I was under the impression that if the Treasurer succeeded in eliminating the words ""electrical stoves"" from this item, they woulcl f a l l automatically either under paragraph A or paragraph B. Sir WILLIAM LYNE included in a new paragraph, under which extend a preference to Great Britain. they will be subject to the same rates of duty. X would support the Government proposal, posed duty is only 20 per cent, upon the I believed that I was supporting a duty of manufactures of the Mother Country. The 25 per cent, under the General Tariff, and Government will adhere to their proposal. of 15 per cent, under the Tariff for the United Kingdom. From my own experiI trust that the Government will stand ence, I can say that if there is one necessity by their proposal. The gas companies are to which we might extend special consideramonopolies tion this is it. By doing so we shall give to the housewives of Australia cheaper apthe small ones? pliances 'for cooking purposes, and this will be of great advantage in the monopolies, and they ought to be suffihotter portions of the Continent.

Sir JOHN QUICK (Bendigo) [6.19] I wish to explain the reasons which prompted the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission in recommending 20 per cent, duties upon these articles. A Melbourne brassworker stated that electric radiators were dutiable at 1 2 per cent, as electrical ap1 pliances, while hot water radiators were dutiable at 20 per cent, as manufactures of metals. In his opinion both articles were used for heating purposes, and should be subject to the same impost. It was upon that ground that we recommended a duty of 20 per cent. There was no suggestion that a 30 per cent, rate should be levied against the foreigner. Mr Danks suggested that a uniform duty should be levied upon this class of manufactures. No preference was recommended, and, therefore, I do not feel justified in voting for the Government proposal. Sir WILLIAM LYNE (Hume-Trea surer) [6.20] I should like to know whether the honourable member for Bendigo intended to convey that he would support a duty of 20 per cent, under the General Tariff, and of 15 per cent, under the Tariff for Great Britain? of a 20 per cent, duty all round.

Under the operation of the duty proposed even those companies would not be at any disadvantage compared with the wealthy companies, Committee will support the Treasurer. [6,24] I think that the Treasurer might agree to accept a. duty of 25 per cent, under the General Tariff, and of 20 per cent, under the Tariff for the United Kingdom. These rates, I think, would be sufficient for all purposes. Sir WILLIAM LYNE (Hume-Trea surer) [6.25] I understand that the honourable member for Bendigo is prepared to vote for a duty of 20 per cent, all round. nexion with items of this kind, we have already granted a preference to the goods of the United Kingdom. In this instance we propose to extend them a preference of 10 per cent. If we reduce the rate under the General Tariff to 20 per cent, we shall be denying the Old Country a preference. Sir JOHN QUICK (Bendigo) [6.26] The members of the Tariff Commission were not instructed to frame a Tariff containing provision for the extension of preferential treatment to Great Britain. Consequently, we recommended a Tariff which in our opinion would be an effective one against the world. How can I be expected to vote for an increase in the duty above the standard which was recommended by my colleagues and myself? How can I be expected to vote for an increase of 5 per cent, upon the rate that we recommended, much less an. increase of 10 per cent. ? takes up that position, he will deny himself the right to vote for a preference at all. Sir JOHN QUICK -withou t committing any breach of faith with my colleagues on the Commission-i o strain a point, I should be prepared to grant a preference to Great Britain in certain cases. not think that the rate under the General Tariff should exceed 25 per cent. I think that a duty of 20 per cent, upon these articles would be an adequate one, and the Treasurer would do well to agree to that rate. Amendment agreed to.

It is absurd to suppose that the manufacturers themselves are going to pay this duty; I do not think that the most rabid and unreasoning protectionist could believe that that is likely to be the result. If the duty be increased, there will be practically a monopoly given to the local trade. And who are the people who principally use these stoves, and who will have to pay the increased prices? They are the housewives of the middle and poorer classes, especially in the country districts, where there is not the advantage of gas and electric lighting. ' Instead of increasing the burdens of these people, we ought to relieve them, if possible, in the way of reduced prices. It was my original intention to move a reduction of the duties to 12\ ancl 10 per cent. would be increased. able member is perfectly consistent, as a protectionist, in taking up that attitude.

290,Mr Johnson,"If that be so, it fornot see their way clear to recommend a higher duty than 20 per cent., which, in itself, is a substantial increase. Yet in face of this recommendation the Government proposes a further increase of 10 per cent., thus more than doublingthe old duty. I do not think that the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission consisted of protectionists any less ardent than protectionists in this chamber; and we must remember that the former had the advantage of being able to sift all the details of the industry with the assistance of sworn testimony. We may depend that they fully informed themselves before making any recommendation; and I think that protectionists might rely on their decision as fair and reasonable. loss of trade suffered by local manufacturers is evidence enough for me. must surely be due to defects in management, or the absence of proper appliances. Tbe honourable, member has just said that certain Australian firms produced stoves better than those imported; and, in face of that fact, it is difficult to understand how there can be a greater demand for an inferior article. cheaper. cannot be much cheaper when we consider insurance, freight, and other charges, which constitute a very considerable natural protection. In addition, the local manufacturers have hitherto had the advantage of duties of 12 J and 15 per cent. did not operate. able member is mistaken. He may be Lyne, right so far as one or two isolated cases are concerned, but, speaking generally, I do not think it can be denied that there is a large and profitable trade done locally. If the industry has already been thoroughly established under the old duty, I do not see what more can be expected under an increased duty, beyond a monopoly which, as invariably happens, must result in obsolete methods, lack of enterprise in the direction of improvement, and failure to keep pace with progress in manufacture in other parts of the world which produce under the stimulus of freer competition. manufacturers to form a monopoly. !x;r may be right, but the bigger ones who form combines can buy them out or crush them. I know there would be no hope of carrying an amendment to reduce the duties to 12^ and 10 per cent., and I do not desire to divide the Committee unnecessarily. The next best course for me is to support the reduction which has been moved by the honourable member for Corangamite.

If the local manufacture desires a duty of £ 2 10s., let him have it ; the whole matter involved in the duties is not worth consideration. the building laws in South Australia, all bathrooms must have lead floors; and, notwithstanding the local production, lead for that purpose is now dearer by 50s. than it wasbefore the imposition of fhe Tariff. -No argument has yet been advancedwhy this duty should be imposed.

The comma after the word "" lead "" is a mistake. to be an industry which involves any great outlay of capital or much brains; and I .think the duty ought to be considerably reduced.

This form of lead is used ber said then that he understood this lead most extensively in building; and the duty to be sold to local buyers at a little less will mean increasing the cost to those than the price for which it 'could be obworking men, amongst others, who desire tained from elsewhere. If that be a correct statement, it means, I suppose, that lead is sold to local buyers at, perhaps, a shilling less than the price at which it could be imported from London.

Recently[ had occasion to obtain estimates for the building of a house, and was just about to sign a contract, when the architect informed me that the price of lead, amongst other items, had increased in consequence of the Tariff. As a matter of fact, I found that, under the new conditions, the building would cost me nearly £10 0 more. Eveiy man who has only his daily wage -to depend on tries to acquire a little home of his own; and this Tariff will mean an additional handicap in his struggle to get free. The Treasurer has not shown a single reason why the proposed duty should be imposed. He did tell us that it was recommended by the Tariff Commission; but he omitted to say that the recommendation was only that of the protectionist section. When we look at the evidence on which that recommendation was made, we find that not a single person interested asked for anything like the proposed duty. In the report of the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission we. readA Victorian witness who represented several other manufacturers, suffested that a duty of to per cent, should be placed on imports from the United Kingdom, and a duty of 15 per cent, on imports from other countries (Coop, Q.70711 ; Mcllwraith, Q.70796). An alternative duty was proposed, viz., 25s. per ton on products from the United Kingdom and 30s. per ton against other countries-(Mcllwraith , Q'.70797-98). The New Soutli Wales manufacturers suggested that the duty on British products sliould be is. per cwt., and that on manufactures from other countries is. 6d. per cwt -(Crane, Q.81421). It will be seen that the highest duty asked for was 30s.; and when we return to the report of the free-trade section of the Commission we are toldThe rate of 25s., it was stated, would entirely prevent the introduction of manufactures of lead into Australia. The extra rate suggested over the protection against Great Britain was, one witness admitted, ""merely a sort of ornamental demonstration of the Empire's unanimity."" I should like the Treasurer to show me where there is a scintilla of evidence to justify the duty now proposed. Sir WILLIA M LYNE (Hume-Trea surer) [9.0] I shall not feel very sore if this duty is reduced. Perhaps it would be well to impose ad valorem rates of 15 or 10 per cent. 10 per cent, on lead would be equivalent to £ 2 a ton. a ton. a fair one. meaning of the item clearer, I move That the words "" Lead, Sheet and Piping"" be left out, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the words "" Sheet Lead and Lead Piping."" Amendment agreed to. posedThat the words "" and on and after 15th November, 1907, free,"" be added. In my opinion, if we impose a duty the effect will be to induce the Broken Hill Proprietary Company, the largest, and, practically, the only producers of lead in Australia, to take advantage of it by manufacturing their lead into sheet lead and lead piping. If they did so, they would soon get rid of all competitors, because the present manufacturers would have to import their raw material. Therefore, if the Committee wishes to do a good turn to those engaged in the making of sheet lead and. lead piping, it will allow these ma; terials to be admitted .duty free. Mr .CARR (Macquarie) [9.5] I endorse the view of the honourable member for Boothby. The position of the company to which he has referred is an instance of the manner in which monopolies grow up as the result of exclusive control of natural opportunity, and are not necessarily the creation of either protection or free-trade. It seems to me that the manufacturers of sheet lead and lead piping have a sufficient natural protection in the cost of importation. We need not fear over-importation, because there is not an over-production of lead. that fhe Committee will not be influenced by the suggestion that the wealthy companv to which reference has been made will, if the duty be agreed to, commence to manufacture its lead into sheet lead and lead piping, and destroy the business of those who are now manufacturing these articles. The same argument might have been used when we were discussing the duties on woollen piece, goods.

Since we have recently agreed to a bounty to encourage the production of cotton in Australia, I fail to see why cotton gins should be dutiable. The same remark will apply to fibre scutching machines. Handworked rakes and ploughs combined, hay tedders, horse-rakes, lucerne bunchers, maize harvesters, and maize binders' open up a delightful vista of farm life. Milking machines are absolutely essential to the of those used throughout Australia are of dairyman. Potato raisers or diggers are made, to some extent, in Australia, a patent having been secured in respect of them. would point out that they are essential to the development of the arid districts of Australia, which cannot be properly farmed unless on the American principle of subsurface packing. Senator McColl, when a member of this House, made a most interesting speech with regard to the use of these implements. They are not made here, and I think that the Minister might well give way in regard to this duty. For the most part, these implements and machines are imported from foreign countries. The chief reason advanced by the Treasurer for proposing this duty of 10 per cent, was the exceedingly lame one that the Government desired to give a preference to British imports. This, after all, is simply a revenue duty. During the consideration of the TariffI have supported the Government in regard to all revenue producing duties that were fair in their incidence. In this case, however, the duty will fall solely upon the farming community, and there is no excuse for it. We undoubtedly hope to make the farmer one of the pillars of our national prosperity. We look to him to build up a sturdy yeomanry, which will be the backbone of the country, and this is a tax for which the least possible excuse can be offered. The farmer has a big fight against climatic difficulties, and has appear to take exception to a portion of this to labour under many other disabilities. The preference proposed to be given to Great Britain in this case cannot be of any effect, for the simple reason that most of the machines covered by the item are patented and of foreign manufacture. Mr W. H . IRVINE -The last things in respect of which we ought to give a preference. that many of these machines are patented in other countries is in .itself sufficient to demolish the argument of the Minister that the duty will enable us to give a preference of any value to the Old Country, and I hope that the Committee will vigorously oppose the item. There seems to be no justification for the imposition of this duty. Taking the first machine mentioned in the item, cream separators, every one knows that the bulk foreign origin. The same remark applies to a very large proportion of the other implements in the item. This duty can As to sub-surface packers, I be imposed only as a revenue tax; it must fall upon those who are engaged, in primary industries, and for that reason I shall oppose it. By the time that it reaches the consumer, I dare say that, at the very least, it will.be equal to an impost of 15 per cent., and that in respect of a machine foi which a man has to pay £3°> £ 4 0 , ot £ $ o , is a serious item.

The principle which gives the city artisan and manufacturer tools of trade free ought to extend to the tools employed in the farming industry. In the case of apparel alone, there are some thirty free lines, and this is art industry which enioys protection to the extent of 45 per cent. Then, again, in the case of the boot and shoe industry, there are about fifty free lines, in spite of the enormous protection which is accorded to that industry. I hope the Committee, in dealing with agricultural implements and machinery, will apply the principle of making tools of trade free, always remembering that the farming community get very little substantial benefit out of the Tariff.

414,Mr Groom (Darling Downs,"Attor(d) are, on an application made for the purpose to the President of the Commonwealth Courtof Conciliation and Arbitration, declared to be fair and reasonable by him or by a Judge of the Supreme Court of a State or any person or persons who compose a State Industrial Authority to whom he may refer the matter. The Bill deals wholly with matters of procedure, and does not interfere in the least with the fundamental principles of the Act of 1906. When Mr Justice Higgins came to adjudicate under the principal Act, he pointed out that it was doubtful whether he possessed the powers of a Judge sitting as President of the Arbitration Court, and the Bill has been introduced to declare, exactly what his powers shall be in regard to matters of procedure and evidence. Mr W. H . IRVINE -Does the measure deal only with matters of evidence ? Mx. GROOM -Only with matters of procedure and evidence. A t the present time His Honor is. sitting and adjudicating in accordance with the principles of the Excise Tariff Act of 1-906. When Mr solicitor. Justice O'Connor came to administer the Act,. he found it necessary to lay down a certain practice and procedure, which was printed and circulated, and has been f o l lowed by the Court in dealing with the different matters which have come before it . But a question has arisen as to the power of thePresident to .call in assessors to assist him, and to issue subpoenas requiring persons to give evidence. Mr W. initiative ? been thought of when the original Act was being drafted. that the President would be able to exercise t.he powers of the President of the Court of Conciliation and Arbitration: but as a doubt has arisen it is desirable to settle it by clearly defining his powers. TheB ill adopts almost in their entirety the principles regarding procedure and evidence of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. It declares that the Presidentin the hearing and determination of 'any application . . . . shall act according to equity, good conscience and the substantial merits of the case, without regard to technicalities or legal forms. He is left free to inform his mind from provision was inserted . by the Senate. the best sources available to him, without Power is given to the President to issue being bound by the technical rules of evian order to any person to take evidence on dence. He may, at any stage of an applihis behalf. That provision is made with [""5] cation, appoint two assessors to advise him, one of whom is to be nominated by the applicant and the other nominated in the interest of the employees; and, in default of nomination by cither party, he may.appoint an assessor or assessors without nomination. Arbitration Act provides that either party may insist on the appointment of assessors. MT. GROOM -There we provide for litigation between two parties, but in this instance the Fresident is simply asked to declare whether certain conditions are fair and reasonable. It may be desirable, even if employees do not appear, for him to appoint some one to represent their interests, or to afford him assistance in dealing with their case, and he is, therefore, empowered to appoint an assessor or assessors at any time, even at the last moment, to assist him in framing his award. Clause5 provides that, except by the consent of all parties, and by leave of the President, no partu shall be represented by counsel or cluded ? . parties to be represented by some one. If there were 1.50 employees concerned in an application, they could not all be expected to appear in person, and very often employers will hnd it convenient to be represented by their managers or other agents. tors who have been struck off the roll be able to appear as agents? control of his own Court. The intention of the clause is to reduce the cost of . l it i gation. ' admission against the legal profession ? Boards .proceedings it has been found desirable to obtain the assistance of members of the legal profession, and in many other instances the attempt to do without them has. increased expenditure. Mr W, H . IRVINE It is likely to do so in this instance. is left to the parties themselves, who will have to bear the. expense. The'",47,Exciseprocedure Bill Second Reading

425,Mr Groom,"Perhaps so. The mattera view to securing elasticity of administration, because it may be desirable to take evidence at some place remote from where -the Court"" is sitting. inquiries may often be confidential, no person taking evidence will be allowed to disclose, except to the President, such evidence relating to any trade secret, or to the profits or financial position of any witness or party. The President can prohibit the publication of evidence if he thinks fit. cedure ! these inquiries confidential information which the President is entitled to have will be put before him; but it may not be in the public interest that it should be published. What we aim at is the obtaining of fair and righteous decisions. The powers of the President will be the same as those of the President of the Conciliation and Arbitration Court. He may refer technical matters, or matters of account, to experts, whose reports he can accept as evidence, and he will have power to summon witnesses, to take evidence on oath, and generally to give such directions as he may. deem fit or necessary. Clause8 is a copy ot a similar provision in the Comrnonwea.lth Conciliation and Arbitration Act, and deals with contempt, while clause 9 provides for the same penalties' for contempt by witnesses as are .provided for in that Act. Any one who disobeys a summons to appear, or refuses to be sworn as a witness, or to answer any question which he is required by the President to answer, or to produce any books or documents which he is so required to produce, will be liable to a penalty; but' no person is to be compelled to give evidence, except to the President, or'to the person ordered by him to take evidence on his behalf, relating to any trade secret, or to the profits or financial position of any witness or party.' Such evidence is not to be. disclosed or published without the consent of the person entitled to the trade secret or non-disclosure. Section 10 provides ' for the protection of witnesses, making it an offence to use, cause, inflict, or procure under violence, punishment, damage, loss, or disadvantage to any one for having appeared as a witness. No employer may dismiss an employee because he has appeared' as a witness, and. no empl'ov-6 shall' cease to work in the service of an employer because of evidence given by him; In clause 13 penalties are provided for the. intimidation of witnesses, and under clause 15, where an application is referred by the President to a Judge of Seeing that these the Supreme Court of a State, or to a State industrial authority, the Judge or authority' shall have all the powers and privileges vested, in or imposed on the President. Clause 16 empowers the Presir dent to make regulations prescribing practice and procedure on applications; but these are to be subject to the approval of chamber prothe Governor General. The Bill deals wholly with procedure, the principles followed being those of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. The President is given just, the amount of power necessary to enable him to make the proper investigations required by the Excise Tariff Act. It has been found necessary in the administration of that Act to confer these powers on the Court. Debate fori motion by Mr W. H .
