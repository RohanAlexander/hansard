0,"3$Ouse Of Ifcepresentatibes. Thursday, 8 September, 1904. And Read Prayers. Desire, With The Indulgence Of The House, To Make A Personal Explanation. I Have Not Troubled Honourable Members In This Way Be","fore, because I think that as a rule such explanations are a mistake; but, in his speech yesterday, the Prime Minister made a. statement regarding myself, which, coming from one in the high official position which he occupies, I do not feel free to ignore. His statement was to the effect that, during my term of office in the late Administration, I was most of the time absent from the House, and took little concern in its business. As my late colleagues know well, nothing could be further from the facts. every parliamentary day, and when not actually within this chamber, listening to exQueensland sugar fields would be a desircellent arguments excellently repeated, I was in the room behind, doing work for the Government and for the country in connection with my Department. I also rendered such assistance as was required of me in shaping amendments, and in dealing with clauses. The work of the Arbitration Bill being left to very competent hands ^-the late Prime Minister and the late Minister of External Affairs-and the work of the Seat of Government Bill also being left to competent hands-the Prime Minister and the Minister of Home AffairsI remembered that too many cooks may spoil the: broth, and I felt that I should be doing no good by interfering in the course of debates which were already too prolonged. I have to thank the right honourable gentleman for having fathered the statement, because, although I have noticed it before as coming from anonymous sources, yesterday was the first time that it was actually and boldly put forth, and his remarks have given me an opportunity to publicly deny it. I felt the accusation very deeply, and particularly because I regarded it as a reflection upon my good faith in the circumstances u'ider which I assumed office. learned member's own newspaper, the Bulletin, was the first to repeat it. chance I have had to refute it, and I hope that I shall not have to trouble the House with my personal affairs again. Mr RE ID (East Sydney-Minister of External Affairs) My remark was a random one, I admit, and was based upon proceedings in the chamber; but I most cordially accept the statement of the honourable and learned member. I see that I have quite unintentionally done' him an injustice. Minister here to see if the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne was or was not present? 1 good deal.

10,Mr Mclean,"I am sorry that myunder the following circumstances :-The representatives of the newspapers came to me at the end of the day, as they generally do, to see if there were any items of news to be obtained, and among other things they asked me if there was any truth in the reports that Chinese were largely replacing Kanakas on the Queensland sugar plantations. I told them that we had no knowledge of any such thing having occurred, that only one application for a bounty had been made by Chinese prior to my taking office, and that on that occasion the applicant showed that he had employed nothing but white labour. One of the reporters asked, "" Do you not think it would be a good thing rather than otherwise, if the Chinese, who are competing with white persons in other industries, would take to sugar planting on their own account?"" and' my reply was, as nearly as I can remember, to this effect, "" No doubt it would be a good' thing for the States who got rid of their competition, but the people of Queensland, who are primarily interested, are those who should be consulted in the matter."" I may remind my honourable friend that the migration of Chinese from' one State to another is not a matter in which my Department has any concern, and I believe that the opinion which I expressed is that which he would have expressed under similar circumstances. the following passage, which appeared in the Argus of the 30th August, is a correct report of the Prime Minister's remarks:IfI had tabled a direct motion of censure, every one of the gentlemen who voted against the Ministry on that occasion would have voted against them just the same later on. newspapers have reported my utterances with absolute accuracy.

What is the opinion of the Government in regard to the annual increases of civil servants who, under State Acts, were, prior to the Constitution Act, entitled as of course to annual increases until they reached the top of their repective classes? a.

If the Government are of opinion that such servants arc not so entitled to such increases, will they obtain the opinion of the law officers on. the matter and inform the House what such opinion swers to the honourable member's questions are as follow :1 and 2. Officers who arc entitled to automatic increases under State laws at the date of transfer to the Commonwealth are entitled to be paid such increases up to the date of the Order in Council confirming the classification, of the Service, when, in accordance with the advice of tbe law officers of the Commonwealth, the State increases become superseded by the classification effected under the provisions of the Commonwealth Public Service Act 1902. 3.

MrM c CAY In answer to the honourable member, I wish to say that, in the first place, I am not aware that such a rumour is in circulation. The only thing I know is that I expressed' the opinion, which I still hold, that, owing to various causes, in the I regret that this question, early future there may be a shortage of officers of higher rank to fill various positions in the Commonwealth Defence Service, and that it will be necessary for the Department of Defence to take the requisite steps to prevent that shortage occurring or continuing. The inference was founded upon that statement of mine that I had made up my mind to ask for the services of officers of the ImperialA r m y ; but that was subsequently contradicted in the newspaper in which it was made. I have formed no such intention. As I think honourable members know, my desire has always been to officer the Australian Forces, so far as that can be done, with Australians, and it is still my feeling that that should be done. I do not say absolutely that we should not ask for officers from home, but I would certainly The agents have made no do so only if there were a shortage which I would could not otherwise be made up. In reply to questions 2 and 3, if any such officer were obtained, it would neither be owing to a belief that the European officer, as the honourable member calls him, is rank for rank superior to the Australian, nor to the idea that the Australian is incompetent.

25,Mr Reid (East Sydney,"Minister ofbusiness on the notice-paper for this afternoon, and with the concurrence; of the House, I move That general business be postponed until after the consideration of Government business, Order of the Day No. i . Question resolved in the affirmative. Debate resumed from 7th September, That the despatch from the Secretary of State, with reference to the metric system, be printed. there is one feature of the speech of the Prime Minister yesterday upon which we can congratulate him, it is its extraordinary brevity. As to any other aspects of it, I hardly think that they would form the subject of much congratulation on the part of his supporters. In fact, to my mind, a certain proportion of honourable members sitting on the Government benches must have been filled with disappointment, both on account of the fewness of the matters referred to, and of the proposals in detail which the Prime Minister put forward. The right honourable gentleman dealt first with the crisis that has existed in this Parliament for some little time past, and stated that the late Government chose its own battleground in connection with the Conciliation and Arbitration B ill . ment of mine which was made to representatives of the press in Sydney, as to the attitude that the then Government would take up if this House failed to reconsider its position in regard to the amendment adopted at the instance of the Minister of Defence. The honourable member for Grey took exception to the statement put forward by the Prime Minister, so far as its first presentation was concerned. H is statement as it was first put forward would lead the public to believe that the Government had chosen the particular motion upon which they were afterwards defeated as their battle-ground, but that was very different from what was stated by myself. I stated to the representatives of the Sydney newspapers that if the House failed to reconsider the amendment adopted at the instance of the Minister of Defence, we should take their action as an intimation that our services were no longer required. That, however, was a very different thing from the proposal of some honourable members of this House to take the whole conduct of business out of the hands of the Government by refusing to go into Committee. No Government would have been worth its salt if it had submitted to an insult of that kind lying down, and therefore when the right honourable gentleman stated that we chose our own battle-ground he was some distance from the truth, so far as the particular motion which was carried against the Government was concerned. containing the amendment to which the late Government took exception. clause. Owing to the machinations of the right honourable gentleman and those honourable members who assisted him, we had not an opportunity of reaching the clause. The right honourable gentleman and some of his supporters stated that the effect would be the same, whether we reached the clause or not. No doubt the effect was the same for their purpose, which was to dislodge the then Government by a side wind. But so far as it affected the supporters of the Arbitration B ill , the effect was very different, because if those gentlemen who supported the right honourable member in ousting the Government had honestly desired to have that B ill passed in the shape that the majority of Parliament were anxious to see it assume, they would have gone into Committee, and tried every expedient to obtain the decision of the House, and the f u l l He quoted a statesense of its desires in regard to that important measure. My complaint is, however, that the right honourable gentleman and his supporters showed no desire to pass the B ill in such a shape that it would prove effective. Their sole anxiety was to take advantage of the declaration of some honourable members that they would not change their vote upon clause 48, in order to eject the Government from office . So far as I 1 am concerned, I entertain no great regret at being thrown out of office. I never whined for office, nor have I whined at being thrown out of it, I made no improper attempt to get there, and I never went to one man with the idea of inducing him to alter his opinion, so that the Government might be retained in office'. Therefore, I have no regret at being ejected from office. As one, however, who has supported the principle of conciliation and"" arbitration for years past, and as one who believes that if an effective measure were passed it would save the Commonwealth millions of pounds, and that it would be in the best interests of the country, I do regret that some honourable members",14,Order Of Business

We certainly objected, and still object, to the proposal embodied in the B ill ; but I think I may be wrong-that much greater regard would have been shown for the principle which the majority of honourable members on the other side of the House have always professed to support in regard to the B ill , and a more seemly spirit of sweet reasonableness, if they had consented to go into Committee, and to there! confer as to the best means of expressing the desires of the majority. There was one feature of the Prime Minister's speech yesterday that I thought was regrettable. In speaking of the recent crisis, the right honourable gentleman was good enough to refer to myself as having tendered certain advice to H is Excellency the Governor General. Of course, the fact that the House is still in existence is sufficient evidence that that advice was not accepted. I do not wish for one moment to canvass the right of H is Excellency as the representative of H is Majesty the King to take whatevejr cousse he thought proper in the interests of the people of Australia. I have not the slightest doubt that the action he took was ""dictated by no other consideration than what he conceived to be the best interests of the community. But I say that it comes most"" improperly from the right honourable gentleman, who must have assured H is Excellency that he could carry on the Government of this country, and that the time had not arrived for a dissolution-wh o must have given his assurance in explicit terms in the face of the fact that there was only a majority of two in support of the Government-to come down, and, in so many words, threaten this House with a dissolution if what?-if the Opposition did not combine with their strength the quality of mercy, if the Opposition did not extend consideration to the Government fat and awav -greater than that extended by the right honourable gentleman and his supporters to the late Government.

As a matter of fact, there was no necessity for the late Ministry to go before the caucus, for the simple reason that the policy on which the members of the Labour Party had been elected to this Parliament was well known to all. So long as no attempt was made to depart from that policy, there was no occasion to consult members of the caucus or of the party individually in regard to it. The members of the Party had sufficient confidence in the late Ministry-and would have had sufficient confidence in any other Ministry formed from its ranks-to believe that they would stand by the policy to which its members had pledged themselves when before the country. In these circumstances, there was no necessity for the late Government to do more than tell their supporters : what particular portion of their policy they hoped to carry out in the immediate future, and how much of it would necessarily have to be left in abeyance until the time arrived to take action. structed the late Government, even in regard t0 that matter. treated with a generosity which certainly was never excelled by the supporters of any Prime Minister of the Commonwealth, or of the Premier of any of the States. No member of the Party ever approached me in regard to the personnel ot the Ministry which I was about to form, or in reference to the programme which we should insist on carrying out. This, perhaps, is not a matter of public importance, but it is only right that the facts should be stated. The Prime Minister attempted to make some capital out of the alleged power exercised over members of the Labour Party by the Labour Leagues, and the honourable and learned member for Ballarat traversed the same ground in a speech which he delivered some little time ago. For public men who have been acquainted to a greater or lesser extent with the Labour Party and its organizations for a number of years-and certainly the Prime Minister has been very closely identified on some occasions with the Labour Party their hand."" honourable gentleman confessed that he was at one time in that position. It is strange that such gentlemen should exhibit so much ignorance as to what are the relations between the Labour Leagues and members of the Labour Party. something worse. sertion. sume that these honourable gentlemen would be guilty of deliberate misrepresentation; but the statement having been reiterated yesterday, it is proper that I should in a few words state exactly what the facts are. In the first place, the programme of proposed legislation which the Labour Party will support is agreed to by a conference at which' every supporter of the party, whether a unionist or non-unionist, may be represented. I am glad to say that the vast bulk of the support of the Labour Party comes from the ranks of the non-unionist's -fro m men who, while not actively opposed to unionism, are certainly not at present included within its ranks. Every person who supports the programme of the Labour Party has an opportunity to be represented, either through the agency of a labour league or by a union, at the conference to which I have referred.",17,Ministerial Statement

When the programme is agreed toj it is, of course, laid down that every person desiring to stand as a labour candidate must first subscribe to that programme -it would not be of much use for a man to appear as a labour candidate if he did not-and , secondly, he must pledge himself, if not selected by the organization, to stand down in favour of the selected candidate. two platforms--a fighting programme and a propaganda. one programme for immediate action, while the other is a declaration of principle; but it makes no difference to the position of the candidate.

The members of the Labour Party share the liability to rejection equally with every other member of this House. The right honourable gentleman finds it convenient to talk about machine politics as applied to The . Labour Party have the Labour Party, but he seeks to gloss over the operations of equally objectionable machine politics among the ranks of his old-time supporters. Let us recall We have to mind the case to which he referred yesterday-the case of a member of the State Parliament of New South Wales, who was one of the most faithful ' supporters of the party which the right honourable gentleman led so ably and so long, and who, in regard He takes the lot. to both loyalty and service, deserved well T h a t is so.

I at once say that I have been opposed to the granting of bonuses to private individuals, just as a number of the members of the Ministry, and a number of those who are supporting the Ministry, have been opposed to it. But I have never been unprepared to take the opinion of the House in regard to that question as in regard to other questions. In my view it is one in regard to which a difference of opinion may legitimately exist. I give way to none in my anxiety to see the iron industry successfully established in Australia; but I differ from those who think that the best way to establish it is to pay large bonuses out of the public Treasury to private individuals. ever, prepared to bow to the decision of the House on the question, both before I took office and while I was a Minister. policy of the last Administration in regard to that measure was not parallel with the course proposed to be followed by the present Government. The Prime Minister, in common with, and almost in company with, the honourable member for Ballarat, has for months past been impressing upon the electors of Australia that what is needed in this country is to restore responsible government and majority rule; that that is the one thing necessary, and the great end to which all energies should be bent. Judging by the appearance of the benches in this chamber, both yesterday and to-day, it does not look as The honourable memthough majority rule has been achieved, He should not and certainly one cannot say that it was responsible government which the right honourable member emphasized yesterday.

Perhaps we have an explanation in their attitude towards this question of the disinclination of the Government to meet its followers in caucus.

The right honourable gentleman said, by way of apology for the small programme that he was putting forward, that if there was anything else for which time could be found, and which the House desired, the Government would afford opportunities for its discussion. That is responsible government with a vengeance. The Prime Minister said, in effect, "" Gentlemen, we present a programme to you; if it does not suit it can be altered, or extended, or anything else done, so long as we remain in office."" I must say that that struck me as a rather peculiar way of reintroducing responsible government. man ih Australia than I am. flections upon that head, but I cannot quite harmonize the statement that room will be found for anything ih the Ministerial waggon so long as the House gives some reasonable indication of its desires, with the claim that responsible government will be O u r contempt of rerestored.

I succeeded in settling up several matters which had been in abeyance for some years, and which I wished to have disposed of upon equitable terms, so far as both Governments were concerned. Therefore, while it is true, as the honourable member for Lang has indicated, that Mr Bent may have made some random remarks about the Commonwealth Government spending money they were not entitled to, so far as the actual relations between the two GovernI do not make any rements are concerned, they were of the most cordial character. misreported. but in any case I do not know of any real complaint.

On the occasion of the last election, we heard from the right honourable gentleman some statements about the administration of the legislation of the then Government. When he made the opening speech of the campaign at the Protestant H a l l , Sydney, on 13th October, 1903, he stated that the contract labour provisions of the Immigration Restriction Act, and the prohibition of coloured labour on steamships, constituted blots upon the prospects of Australia. We were told by inference, if not explicitly, that this was the reason that immigration had fallen off, why people ba.rred Australia when they desired to settle in a new country and make homes for themselves. The right honourable gentleman said he would not rest until these blots upon our statute book were removed, that no effort of his would be spared to alter both the legislation and the administration in these regards. Now, we have a most significant silence in regard to these important matters-importan t in our eyes, as they were held to be important by the right honourable gentleman a short while ago. We hold them to be important, because we believe that the best interests of Australia are bound up in their retention, whereas the right honourable gentleman regards it as important that they should be abolished. 1 ask why there is no mention in this programme of any proposal to deal with either of these important matters? member for Ballarat will not permit it. which the right honourable gentleman laid four months ago upon administration, is to find expression in the action of himself and his colleagues in the Departments? Are they content to rely on administration for effecting their purposes, instead of coming down to Parliament fairly and openly T h a t is what makes it so inand asking for the reversal of the previous decisions ? I say that the circumstances are The right honourable such as to arouse suspicion. When the Prime Minister sought the suffrages of the electors, and asked for their support, he put these matters in the very fore-front of his programme, and emphasized their importance; but now he is significantly silent upon t'he subject. This must arouse the suspicion that, either he is dropping these questions, upon which he assumed an attitude which he claimed to be just and right, or that he is going to effect his object in an This programme is sigunderhand way, by means of his administration, instead of asking Parliament reasonably and fairly to arrive at an opposite decision. I think that we are entitled to a statement upon t)he matter. In coalitions it is, no doubt, necessary that some sacrifices of opinion should be made, temporarily, if not permanently; but I say that on important matters regarding which so much controversy has been raised in Aus. tralia-becaus e it was sought to make the last election turn, to some extent, upon the question of the six hatters-it is surely reasonable to ask that a fair and candid statement should be made to Parliament on an occasion of this kind. I should like to congratulate the Prime Minister upon, his new-found anxiety to promote friendly feelings between the States of New South Wales and Victoria.

Owing to the stringency of the financial clauses of the Constitution it was impossible to have either protection or free trade. Whatever party was in power, the only possible Tariff must be very similar to that now in force; and until the expiration of the Braddon clauses, it was vain for either party to dream of radical alterations. Those were the views of almost the whole of the members of the party with which my honourable friend was associated at that time.

MrM c LEAN Government from office was a matter for which they alone were responsible, since the situation was one of their own creation. Honourable members who voted against them did so in accordance with their previously expressed convictions. The leader of the Opposition referred in a sneeringtone this afternoon to the remark of the Prime Minister, that in one respect there is a strong resemblance between the members of the Opposition and the supporters of the Government, in thai both are democrats and liberals; and he proceedeld to ridicule the assertion by referring to tAvo or. three honourable members whom he regarded as conservatives. It is well known that I have never had any sympathy with conservatism, and that I have supported advanced liberalism throughout the whole of my political career. But in the matterof exclusiveness, there is a very strong resemblance between the ultra-conservat'ive and the labour member. They are equally exclusive. Your ultra-conservative is in favour of class rule, and your labour member is also in favour of class rule. The only difference between them is this: Your ultra-conservative believes in entrusting political power to that class which, having acquired a stake in the country, has shown some capacity to manage its own affairs. members do that? MrM c LEAN Honourable members must remember that I do not sympathize with the conservatives, and have never sympathized with them.

MrM c LEAN the true Scotch fashion by asking another question.

He said that the Government had framed their own programme in absolute independence of the party.

Surely these monopolies can be prevented by legislation from doing any harm to the public. The present Government are just as much opposed as are my honourable friends opposite to any monopoly that imposes disabilities upon the general public.

MrM c LEAN a day or two, and the other portion of the term during which the late Government held office was fruitless. The leader of the Opposition also took exception to the proposal of the present Government to postpone the appointment of the H i g h Commissioner. He said that we ought to make the appointment at once, and trust to public opinion to compel the States Governments to come into line. to approach independent States Governments, who have just as clear rights as we have under the Constitution? We believe that it would be much more conducive to the best interests of the people whom we both represent if we met the States Governments in friendly conference, and came to some amicable agreement. We know that the members of the States Governments are as anxious as we are to promote t'he greatest good for the people at the least possible cost, and we believe that economy can best be served by entering into' friendly conierence with them. I would point out that the High Commissioner will have very important functions to discharge, and that, if he does his duty ably and conscientiously, he can accomplish a great deal. He will be in a position to promote the interests of our producers, by advertising our products, and resources in the old world, by opening up markets, by, making the best possible 1 freight arrangements for the cheap transport of our exports to those markets, and by the collection and dissemination of useful information. connection, perhaps, I may be permitted to digress a little from the speech of the leader of the Opposition, by saying that the Government are looking forward to accomplishing very useful work, in conjunction with the States Governments, during the recess. In the first place, the States have public debts, amounting to ,£2 22^000,000. . One of the strongest arguments -in favour W h a t was the honorof the Federal Union was that increased facilities* would be given for borrowing money for public purposes on favourable terms, because the credit of the Commonwealth would stand very much higher thai* The late Government that of individual States; I think that that was a fair and reasonable view to"" take. If the credit of the Commonwealth stand's higher than that of individual States to the T h a t was something extent of even a half per cent -and I think that is a very modest assumption-w e might by taking over the States' debts, effect a saving upon bur annual interest bill of ,£1,110,000. That would surely be an T h a t B ill was passed in advantage web' worth gaining. MrM c LEAN The r e will be no delay in dealing with the matter, unless honourable members opposite unduly prolong the session. If we can go into recess within a reasonable time, we shall be able to deal with the matter promptly. If we do not succeed in reaching recess, the honourable Is that the proper way member will not find us whining for office. We can leave office in as good a spirit as we came into it. Reverting to the subject of the appointment of a H i g h Commissioner, I would point out that there are many directions in which that official may render great service. I would remind my honourable friends that the Federal Parliament has a l ready devoted more than a year to the consideration of one question, the fiscal issue, and it seems to me, that by the time that the Conciliation and Arbitration B ill has been finally dealt with, we shall have devoted something like a similar period to the consideration of that measure. Surely it is fair that the great producing interests of Australia should receive some attention. The Federal Constitution has left the control of those interests in a somewhat divided state. The Governments of the States have charge of the various Departments of Agriculture; but the Government of the Commonwealth have the sole power to give direct encouragement to production or export. It is absolutely necessary, if we are to evolve a wise and intelligent policy in this direcIn this tion, that we shall do so in conference with the States Governments, and that is a matter to which the Government intend to devote special attention. I believe that the Parliament and the Government of the Commonwealth may do more good for Australia by developing and expanding her natural resources than they can in any other direction.

356,Mr Fisher,"The position in which thewas a member of the Government who, in New South Wales, took the action to which I have referred. I am proposing to show what kind of a Government we have now in the Federal Parliament, and to show that the present Prime Minister is not a man who should be intrusted with the welfare of the Commonwealth. When he carried direct taxation in New South Wales, the right honourable gentleman was a believer in absolute free-trade, but when he entered Federal politics, he became from the very start associated with those who in Victoria have been recognised as the most conservative body in the! politics of the State. The honourable and learned member for Ballarat is aware that the revenue tariffists of Victoria, the men who used to be called the ""Flinders-lane crowd,"" were dead opposed to land value taxation, or any other form of direct taxation. member for East Sydney, who did such noble and creditable work in New South Wales, has become associated in Federal politics with those who have been notoriously the class of men who have formed the Legislative. Council of Victoria, and who have consistently blocked every democraticm measure that came before them. South Wales, the men with whom the right honourable gentleman was associated, were real free-traders, men of the Single Tax League, and of the school to which the honourable member for Lang belongs, and I recognise that there are democrats amongst them. I am aware, from the active part I have taken in political life, that the class of men with whom the right honourable gentleman has been associated in Federal politics are amongst the most ultra-conservative politicians to be found in Victoria. He has been associated with them in connection with the fiscal faith he set up as the only policy upon which the country should be run. From my point of view, it is but natural that the .bad company which he has kept should have led him away from the progressive and liberal faith disclosed by his political action in his State. gentleman is on a missionary tour. from quotations from the public prints what his missionary tour is. I wish to show the peculiar combination which is now ranged behind the right honourable gentleman. In speaking in Sydney he prefaced one of his addresses by some remarks applied to the honourable and learned member for BalT h e honourable member larat, which I think would be more appropriate if applied to himself. He is reported by the Daily Telegraph to have saidMr Deakin, who was all things one time or another, and nothing very long, except an eloquent and courteous gentleman, had given them a few ingenious catch-cries with which it would be interesting to deal. Minister. That shows the kind of friendly feeling there was between the two honourable gentlemen. The reference to being all things at one time and another is, in my opinion, much more applicable to the Prime Minister than to the honourable and learned member for Ballarat.

In New that the report appeared in the Sydney Daily Telegraph, but I never vouch for the accuracy of anything that is published in the press. I shall not deal very lengthily with the changes of opinion, and the various arguments which have been expressed in regard to fiscal peace, but I think that it is important to know what sort of Government we have in power. Before we support the Government, we should be satisfied that we can place faith in them. Now, the Sydney Daily Telegraph reports the right honourable member for East Sydney as saying, prior to the electionsRegarding the question of fiscal peace and free-trade, the protectionists had all the fight taken out of them. He had challenged Mr Deakin and his colleagues to fight the battle of free-trade and protection to .a finish, and, alT h e right honourable though they had accepted his challenge, they now came along 'with the flag of fiscal peace. Well, they would get no fiscal peace from him I shall be able to show until he pulled them out: Can honourable members recollect any occasion when the right honourable gentleman tested the question in this chamber, and tried to find out how many others held his views?

365,Mr Spence,"I vouch for the factand learned member for Ballarat, speaking of the present Prime Minister, was reported to have saidHe has played round the question of contract labour and employment of white seamen upon mail boats, but has formulated no distinct policy in these regards. Of course, foreign traders fight for foreign ships as well as the goods they bring. The Government prefers a preference to British ships. Foreign traders would leave our coasting trade open to all commerce without conditions. The Government aim at protection of Australian seamen; but on none of these points does the Opposition challenge us. The Sydney, in every spe'ech on the subject that I remember to have read, has raised great objection to the provisions of our laws which prohibit the immigration of labour under contract and the employment of coloured labour on mail boats, as well as to fiscal peace and preferential trade unless it meant a lowering of the fiscal barriers in; favour of England, even if they were left up against the foreigner; but his keynote has always been the treatment meted out to the six hatters. I am therefore astonished that, now that he has had an opportunity to present a policy to this Parliament, he has not asserted his intention to alter the law which affected them. If the matter was so important as to warrant the fighting of an election upon it, surely it might be expected to appear in the Government programme. The right honourable member, however, said not a"" word » about it. ThenI should like to know how the .honourable member for Eden-Monaro squares his present position with the following statement to the electors of SurrevH i l ls :When they talked about free-trade, -and the so called glorious change that would be wrought by putting Mr Reid into power, they must have tions.

Both the origiother half. nal parties-that led by the right honourable member for East Sydney, and that lead by the honourable and learned member for Ballarat-were holding secret meetings and attending caucuses day after day. Then we saw some proposals put into black and white. Very nice complimentary letters passed from one party to another, and we were given to understand that the party led by the honourable and learned member for Ballarat declined to join a coalition unless their leader was made leader of the coalition. The moment this Parliament met, right honourable member for East the honourable and learned member for Ballarat stated that one of his aims was to bring about a union of parties, so -that there would be only: two parties in the House. To carry that out, the secret meetings to which I have referred, were held. I do not know that they took place in the vaults. I have been told that they were held in one of the suburbs.

I should like to see how the following paragraph from the election speech of the honourable and learned member for Ballarat fits in with the present position :A White-Australia goes further than the preadmission of Chinese. servation of the complexion of the people whose homes are here. It means the multiplying of those homes, so that we shall be strong enough to use and defend the whole of this Commonwealth. It means the maintenance of conditions of life fit for a white man and a white woman. equal laws and equal opportunities for all, and protection against the under-paid labour of other lands. It means social justice, so far as we can establish it, and the payment of fair wages. A White Australia means a civilization whose foundations are built in healthy lives, lived in honest toil, under circumstances that do not imply degradation. A White Australia means protection. We protect ourselves from armed aggression. Why not protect ourselves from aggression by commercial means? (Cheers.) We protect ourselves against undesirable aliens; why not protect ourselves against the productions of the undesirable aliens' labour? (Loud cheers.) Unless a White Australia is to have more than a surface complexion,it must represent a policy which goes down to the roots of the national life from which the whole of our social system and political organization must spring. We know how strongly the honourable and learned member, and his predecessor Sn the office of Prime Minister, were in favour of a white Australia, and we know, further, that the first Parliament' of the Commonwealth was almost unanimous on the subject. We have had from the honourable and learned member for Ballarat a definition of the meaning of a White Australia policy, and now we find that honourable and learned member allying himself with the Prime Minister, who has denounced the White Australia policy, and the measure passed into law to give effect to it. We may now pertinently ask whether the Prime Minister will remain true to his election pledges, and endeavour by means of his administration to defeat the object of the Immigration Restriction Act. Is contract labour to be admitted? be in accordance with the law. know very well that the question of adhering to the law is very much a matter of opinion. When the Immigration Restriction Bill was before us, it was pointed out that the question whether it would prove effective or. otherwise would very They largely depend.upon the administration, beoffice rather than cause so much reliance would have to be placed in the discretion of the Minister and the officers under him.

I have no faith' in the present Government as administrators of such a law. The Prime Minister has turned somersaults upon nearly every subject upon which he has declared himself, and he may perform a similar acrobatic feat in this matter. I complain, however, that he has not sufEdiently taken fhe House into his confidence as to his intentions with regard to the administration of the Immigration Restriction Act. He has given us practically no information, but has contented himself with abusing and misrepresenting the Labour Party, and I think that I am fully justified in entertaining suspicions as to his intentions.

Since the last election, the Prime Minister has been very active. He was never noted for his constant attendance at Parliament; but he has been prompted to give very close attention to public business by his ambition to secure the position of Prime Minister of the Commonwealth. He has been active outside the House, as well as here, and has apparently been paving the way for the situation which he has at last succeeded in bringing about. When he addressed a meeting of farmers at Kyneton recently, he said-If they asked him what was the thing upon which the Labour Party was to be most heartily congratulated, he would say, it was that the members of that party, though they came from every State in the Commonwealth, found some bond of union strong enough to enable them to sink all their State and provincial jealousies and hatred, and to work together upon a broad basis of Australian brotherhood. It would appear from this that the Labour Party was one which the right honourable gentleman might very well support, unless there was something very wrong with their policy. He said furtherHe had never denounced the labour leagues. He cherished esteem for members of any organization which endeavoured to advance the intellectual and political welfare of the country in which they lived. The great labour agitation had its root in a sound cause. It aimed at bringing about a political ideal in which the manhood and womanhood of the land would have} equal power; but.the time had come when it devolved upon him to stand right across the path of the which will dominate the politics of the immeLabour Party. At a later stage he also saidThe Labour Party was a selfish, formidable in order to secure the distinctions of office. It organization, which strove to terrorize the workers is notorious , .that Mr Deakin's one anxiety of Australia into their ranks or drive them into throughout the present crisis has been to avoid the gutter. In the first part of his speech the right honus credit for having in our minds some higher orable gentleman made the most kindly repurpose. ferences to the Labour Party, but he ended live has been outraged by this new form of by denouncing them. He stated what was caucus Cabinet and caucus Executive. Then we absolutely untrue with regard to the aims and objects of the party. He advanced no arguments in support of his assertions, and has said nothing whatever to justify his statements that the party was a "" selfish, formidable organization which strove to terrorize the workers of Australia into their ranks, or drive them into the gutter."" No greater slander could have been uttered. The statement has no foundation in fact. If the Labour Party had any such aim as that which he has indicated, it should not have been spoken of in the terms used by the right honourable member at an earlier stage of his address. I do not propose to deal with the methods adopted to bring about the defeat of the Watson Government. I entertain very strong feelings with regard, not to the defeat of the Government, but to the way in which a measure of vast importance, involving very large interests, including those of the most valuable industry in the Commonwealth, has been sacrificed in order to gratify the ambition of those who wanted office. History tells us that the great Napoleon, as he was called, in order to gratify his ambition, sacrificed the lives of 2,000,000 persons who had no interest in his quarrels. So in the present case the interests of a very large and important section of the community were sacrificed in order to gratify the ambition of the Prime Minister. If the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill had first been launched on its way I should not have had any grave cause for complaint; but the course adopted by the right honourable gentleman and his supporters was such as to indicate that they had no regard whatever for the interests of the masses. They were actuated to a far greater extent by consideration for the classes who are behind them. After the defeat of the late Government some statements were made by different party leaders, and I desire to call special attention to some remarks which fell from the Prime Minister. He saidI think this division marks a line of cleavage diate future. The crisis which brought into line men like Mr Deakin and myself points to some great national emergency.

383,Mr Spence,"I know nothing of anyhave the network which surrounds the present Government in relation to despotic outside bodies, which are Ihe masters of the Ministries, and all the time hold their political destinies in the hollow of their hands. All this has come to an end. Then, again, the honourable member for Gippsland, speaking in reference to the caucus machine, saidThey were told that all parties had caucus meetings. He well knew that all parties went into caucus for the election of a Speaker or Chairman of Committees, butthey never heard of other parties going into caucus to compel a minority to change their views and support the views of the majority. That process, in his opinion, was destructive of the wholesome principle of government by majority. The Labour Party numbered twenty-five in the House of Representatives. Suppose on an important question, thirteen held one view and twelve another view. They went into caucus; the twelve men might fight hard for their views and try to induce their comrades to accept them. If they were finally outvoted, they would have to come out of the caucus meeting a solid vote, and be prepared to vote against their own convictions. Twelve votes taken from one side and put on the other meant twenty-four votes in the House of Representatives, out of a total of seventy-five. That statement was cheered. that the Minister of Trade and Customs would wilfully make an incorrect statement in regard to the Labour Party, and the fact that, unlike the Prime Minister, he has not been in close touch with the party and its methods, is some excuse for the mistake that he made in the speech which I have just quoted. that to which he referred. We do not compel members of the party to change their views in caucus. are discussed by the caucus are those dealt with in our platform, and even those are discussed only in relation to any B ill that is introduced, the desire being to see whether that B ill is designed to give effect to the principles which we favour.

Trade and Customs probably did not know better same statements after he bad been put right in this House. plies to that section of the press which is opposed to the Labour Party. If I mistake not, the copy of the pledge from which the Minister of Trade and Customs quoted, was taken from the Argus. That newspaper, in setting the pledge before the people, deliberately caused an alteration to be made in regard to one word, so that it would appear that we met in caucus to deal with every question. The position is entirely different. Our platform for the last election provided for the maintenance of a White Australia, compulsory arbitration, old-age pensions, the nationalization of monopolies, a citizen defence force, the restriction of public borrowing, and navigation laws. The caucus can deal only with those questions, and I repeat that the Argus deliberately misled its readers. The Minister of Trade and Customs was probably misled in this way, and he will find that the caucus deals only with questions relating to the platform of the party. pledge which I read. honourable gentleman justify the statement which he made? We have constantly to I do not say fight against misrepresentation of this kind from quarters whence it ought not to come Whatever difference of opinion there may be between honourable members, that difference should be honestly based on facts, and when a distinct statement is made, and is just as distinctly denied, it should not be repeated. If the Minister No such practice is adopted as of Trade and Customs knew that the labour pledge was that which I have mentioned, he certainly misled the public by The only questions that inferring that the Labour Party was bound, in regard to all matters, by the caucus. As a matter of fact, we meet every week and transact business. It is because we are an active, militant party that other sections view us with a jealous eye. We transact a great deal of business, but a reference to records of divisions taken in this House will show that on questions of detail the memB u t the Labour Party can bers of the party are frequently at variance. Our opponents do not seek to enlighten themselves by reference to such facts; they wish to continue to misrepresent our The Minister of position. I can find no excuse for the misrepresentation of which the Prime Minister has been guilty, for he had the support of repeated the the State Labour Party of New South Wales for a period of five years: If after so intimate an acquaintance with the methods of the party as that support must have afforded him, he does not know what are the true facts in regard to the caucus, he certainly is not fit to hold office as Prime",44,Ministerial Statement

397,Mr Spence,"I have already said that a House of seventy-five, should have absolute power? It is that, although their avocations are humble, yet they all learned one or two lessons well. The first is organization. The organization of the Labour Party would do credit to the most intelligent body of political wire-pullers that ever existed in any country. If you would break that down, you must show yourself loyal and unselfish too. They do this in the labour ranks, can't we do it too? I had five years experience of the Labour Party in the New South Wales Parliament. During most of the time. I was practically in the hollow of their hands. They will tell you that the result was I got my free-trade tariff passed with the help of protectionist labour men. They can always call on me in a deal of that sort. "" I may not admire the principles of your caucus,"" I say to them, "" but the direction of your vote meets with my entire approval."" To those who say I have just discovered the wrong position which the labour leagues occupy, I will say, "" Look at the Sydney newspapers of 1894 and you will find as strong a denunciation of the principle of the labour caucus as if I spoke for twenty years."" It is no new thing with me. They gave me what I wanted, and then I was too slow for them, so they cried to Sir William Lyne, and they got more out of him in twelve months than they would have got out of me in 200 years. Then he went on to speak of their tyranny, but I need not quote his references to that. I Wish to show that the right honourable gentleman has been doing something outside of Parliament which he has given us no account of in this chamber. He has been attending the meetings of the various bodies which are not labour organizations, and what I ""have quoted is an instance of the kind of thing he tells them. I invite honourable members to consider the extraordinary logic of the right honourable gentleman. It'was quite right for the Labour Party to support him. He said that they had him in the hollow of their hands. That was all right, so long as he got their votes, but it suddenly becomes a wonderfully wicked thing that they should support some body else. If their support was bad, why did the right honourable gentleman put up with it for five years, in order that he might 'hold office? If it was the wicked thing which he is now inviting the country to believe, what honourable man would have availed himself of its support, and would have thus shared in the wickedness? gentleman contends that the power of the Labour Party is a wicked thing in Federal politics, because we do not now hold the balance of power in his favour, as we did in the State Parliament of New South Wales. It is true that we got more out of the honourable member for Hume than we should have got out of t'he right honourable gentleman in 200 years. What did we get history from the honourable member for Hume? We got measures abolishing sweating and giving the employees in the work shops some chance of a life worth living, by securing for them reasonable hours of labour. votes of Reid supporters. tration Act and Female Suffrage. We are now told at this late stage, because the right honourable gentleman desires to please the Federated Employers' Union, that we should not have got' these things from him in 200 years. That is an extraordinary confession for a right honourable gentleman to make, who has posed as a democrat, who talks democracy, and who calls himself a liberal. I am astonished that the honourable member for Dalley, who is a democrat, should sit for an hour behind a -leader who has so evidently surrendered all his democratic principles. The right honourable gentleman hit the right nail on the head when he said that we got more from the honourable member, for Hume than we should have got from him in 200 years. He admits now that we should never have had the four or five important measures, including Female Suffrage, to which I have referred if he had remained in power. The right honourable gentleman has by his own confession shown that the Labour Party in New South Wales did the right thing when they exercised their votes to turn him out of office, and I say that they will be even more decidedly right if they now turn him ouf of office in the Federal Parliament, because he is adopting principles which he did not profess to hold then. A number of meetings of the Farmers, PropertyOwners, and Producers Association, arid the Victorian Reform League have recently been held. I suppose that the Victorian Reform League can hardly be called a democratic body. We have never looked upon it in that'light. I have not heard that its special interest is to look after the masses who most need protection. At the meetings of these bodies the chairThe right honourable men and all the speakers have joined in denouncing Socialism. It would appear that their whole object now is anti-socialistic. These meetings have been addressed not only by the Prime Minister, but also by Senator Drake, the Vice-President of the Executive Council, who said at one meetingThe new Government, for the first time in the of the Commonwealth, was supported by",47,Ministerial Statement

It is very suggestive to say that the majority would be carefully looked after. I have understood that honourable members now occupying the Government benches are so unanimous in their desire for majority rule, and in getting a coalition to secure responsible Government, that they would not need to be carefully looked after, as though they were a number of sheep who might stray away. It appears that the Vice-President of. the Executive Council is satisfied that they require to be carefully looked after. tinuedWhat they wanted was unity. It was a feature of the opposing force that they were always in their places in Parliament. A Mr Felstead interjected ""They have-nothing else to do,"" and the report announces that there was laughter at the suggestion. To these people to whom the Government are looking for support, it would appear to be some sort of offence that members of Parliament should attend to their duties. It is a somewhat new feature, I admit. The old political idea was that politics were something to which a man might give the fag end of his brains, after he had attended to his private business. People who have so much to say about private enterprise, are astonished that members of Parliament should stick to their work. One of the best characteristics of the Labour Party is, that its members have always done that. I take it as a high compliment to them, and I believe that the electors generally look at the matter in the same light. One reason why the Party is gaining ground at . every State and every Federal' election is, that the electors have found that the members of the party consider the welfare of the country, and devote themselves to carrying out the duties they are elected to perform. Farmers, Property Owners, and Producers Association held a convention quite recently, and over the report of the proceedings, there are a number of cross headings, "" Fighting the TradesH a l l , "" "" Proposed National Organization,"" and so on.

This body, and representatives of the Reform League subsequently met together. organizations under another name. Mr Sfence. not free-trade organizations. I wish now to read a portion of a newspaper report of a meeting of the Farmers', Property Owners', and Producers' Association. The first paragraph will make the honourable member for Gippsland feel comfortableThe secretary read a report in which it was stated that, although the association had only been in existence a few months, it had already made it impossible for a socialistic labour candfdate to be elected for a Gippsland constituency. After debate, it was resolved"" That it is advisable to take steps to confer with the Chamber of Agriculture, with a view to settling a modus vivendi, whereby the sympathy and coHe conoperation of the chamber may be secured without any sinking of our individuality, or alteration of our constitution."" The following motion was then moved by a delegate:That, in the opinion of this meeting of delegates, it is desirable that each and all now assembled do unite with the Farmers', Property Owners', and Producers' Association, thus forming a strong organization to oppose to the utmost all socialistic or aggressive legislation affecting country interests, and to uphold the rights of property owners and producers of all kinds. He said that theConvention should take a leaf out of the book of the Labour Party and fight them with their own weapons. (Applause.) MrJ . WILLIS (Geelong), in seconding the motion, read the pledge of labour candidates for Parliament, and said that a man who allowed such a chain to be put around his neck should have something else put round his neck, and be strung up to the yardarm of a ship. I suppose that loud cheers would have followed that proposition if there had been any chance of carrying it into effect. I shall now quote again from the newspaper which so strongly supports the movement-the Sydney Daily Telegraph. This is a portion of a report, which shows how the work is going on in New South WalesThe TO BE HELD AWIDE BASIS OF Something has been done in New South Wales with a view to the ranging of forces into line against a menacing Socialism, but it has not been of a very definite character. Mr Deakin's now famous speech helped to stir people up to the necessity for some action, and now Mr Reid's speech to the Farmers' League of Victoria will give a further stimulus to the movement. The initiative has been taken by the Employers' Federation, and at a meeting of the council of that body yesterday it was decided to take definite steps to organize a conference, or large public'meeting, representative of the stable interests of. the country generally, to consider a are only free-trade plan of organization.

But it cannot be denied that this Government represents a particular section of the community, which it is assisting to organize. share the desire for a reasonable recess; but, in my opinion,*the real object of the long recess which has been advocated, on a plea of peace, is, not to bring about harmony, because no other Federation has been established with so little friction between the federating States and the Federal Government, but to organize forces. The object of the organization which the Government support is declared and open. I lind no fault with that, because it is of advantage to us. We have always looked upon Mr Federal or State Parliaments affecting the assoWalpole as a helper, since his statements have been so candid at times that people have been prevented by them from joining his organizations. It is impossible for those who have heard him speak to be foolish enough to imagine that the class amongst whom sweaters have been found, and whose members do not consider it their business to pav decent wages if they can get employees to work for less, is to be regarded as representative of the workers, or as likely to advance the interests of labour. and chief plank in the platform of the Farmers', Property Owners', and Producers' Association is thisThat at all elections, whether Federal or State, where a socialistic candidate nominates for a constituency, the members of this association sink all political differences and go solidly in support of a candidate to be selected by the didate. We have heard the Prime Minister denounce the labour method of selecting candidates ; but he is assisting in the creation of an association whose first plank is to follow labour methods. He has, indeed, advised them to follow the methods of the labour leagues. The first plank of their platform is to sink all political differences. The Government, too, have done that. Nothing is vital to them, but to continue in office, to Active work is now going get into recess, and then to vigorously organize. shop at all hazards. The Gofor Parramatta knows what hard work is.

It is a new thing to find one of whose conduct I have not previously had cause to complain, associating with a movement which is so distinctly opposed to his past history. I have no fault to find with those who have always belonged to the class of whom I am speaking; but those whose associations and professions have been different should open their eyes to what this movement means. Plank3 of the Association isTo watch over all measures proposed by the ciation, and guarding the interests of the same. I have nothing to say against that plank; but I find that those who are opposed to anything socialistic, who believe in the individual fighting his own battle and would put no restriction upon private enterprise, are asking for a good many things from the State. Here are a few of their requests: They want the State Government to give them water conservation, land on deferred payments, a Manure Protection Bill, reduced grain freights, wire netting on deferred The first payments, a bonus on foxes' scalps, help in",49,Representation

The organization to which I have referred is one for political purposes which have been openly declared, and I have indicated how its members propose to protect their interests. I am not condemning their proposals as such. The Labour Party have supported many of them, and are still in favour of granting certain concessions to farmers. I desire, however, to direct attention to the political hypocrisy of these people who, whilst stating that they are opposed to Socialism, declare themselves by their policy to be equally as socialistic in their ideas as any section in the community. They say that they are opposed to State interference, and yet they want the State to do. more for them than has ever been asked for by the wage-earning class. We have heard a great deal about minority rule, and I wish to show the direction in which the Government is now trending.

I contend that we represent others as well. majority of the electors, whereas the Prime Minister, and those who are organizing the employers, would represent a minority. It is idle for honourable members to prate about the representation of minorities when they are actively organizing for political purposes a section which constitutes a very small minority, and are hoping for a long recess in order that they may bring together in one association the most conservative classes in the community. These people are the best able to assist themselves, and I should be ashamed to assist in organizing them. I should give them fair play, and fair play only. Notwithstanding all that has been said with regard to the organization of the Labour Party, we can come here only through the same door as that which is available to other honourable members. We, like them, are dependent upon the will of the electors. Many labour members in the States Parliaments, and more than one in the Federal Parliament, have been elected by constituencies in which there has been no labour league, or other organization of that kind. Why should our organizations be objected to because they insist upon shunting out of political life those who fail to adhere to their principles? Does the Prime Minister defend traitors? pledges, is he to be lauded to the skies? When a mam dishonorably breaks his pledges, is he entitled to be trusted again? Our organizations have been denounced because who have been recreant to their trust. The labour movement has not been built up by 'traitors, but by those who have worked zealously and unselfishly, in order to forward the cause of labour, men who have not gone to the Government to ask for any favour, but who have always been prepared to work for their living under reasonable conditions. Customs has stated that members of the Labour Party are under the necessity of passing through the ordeal of selection by the Labour leagues. so far as New South Wales is concerned. I was not asked to submit myself for selection at the last election. right, according to our rules, to offer myself for re-election, unless I had misconducted myself by breakingmy pledges. I am assuming for the If there was any charge of that kind to be brought against me, I should have to be notified three months beforehand. In the absence ot any such call, I was entitled We should still represent a to re-submit myself as a representative of the Labour Party for the constituency for which I was formerly returned. The labour organizations are not the only"", ones which discard their representatives. Mr Hawthorne, who formerly represented Leichardt in the New South Wales Assembly, was "" bumped out "" by his party after hav> ing worked very hard for its leaders, including the present Prime Minister. No consideration was shown to him, and it does not lie in the mouths of those who were parties to the treatment accorded to Mr Hawthorne to find fault with the methods adopted by the labour organizations. Honourable members talk about our representing a minority, but I would ask them how we could get here unless we could successfully appeal to the electors? How can that statement be made in the face of the experience of the last twelve years? The Labour Party has gained ground in every State, not because of its organization, but because of the proposals which it has put forward. We have submitted humanitarian and other proposals of importance to the community generally. None of our planks refer merely to the interests of the wage-earners. How is it that many of the country districts return labour representatives ? There are not a If a man breaks his sufficient number of wage-earners in the district which I represent to return me without the assistance of others. I represent a district in which the pastoral and mining industries are very largely carried on, they have discarded men whereas the honourable member for Bland represents a purely farming district. If we are such enemies to the employers and to the land-owning class, how is it that we find such favour in their eyes ? Is it because we carry out our platform, and because we do not, as the Prime Minister has done, surrender our policy for considerations of expediency ? He fought for free-trade, and The Minister of Trade and the honourable and learned member for Ballarat opposed him. In the old days in Victoria many of us fought with the late Sir Graham Berry against the very forces which That is not correct, are now being brought into prominence by the Prime Minister.

We had to accept some things which we did not like, because we knew that the alternative was worse. We supported the right honourable gentleman in fighting for free-trade-for an absolutely free port. That was something very different from free trade as it is understood in Federal politics. Will the representatives of the large landholders who sit in the Government corner support a tax on land values? honourable (member for Corangamfte and the honourable and learned member for Wannon support a tax on land values similar to that for which the right honourable member fought? bers of the protectionist party gave him free-trade, but he overlooked the fact that they regarded a tax on land values and other forms of direct taxation as being of the utmost importance, and considered that even if a prohibitive Tariff were imposed it would still be necessary to resort to direct taxation. would go fast enough to suit us, and we therefore put another honourable gentleman into office. That honourable gentleman gave us great measures, which conduced to the well-being of society. learn that the right honourable gentleman, who is now at the head of the Government, has said that he would not have given us these measures. shows that we were right in turning him out of office. that the Prime Minister is out of touch with the great mass of public in the Commonwealth, that he is out of touch with democracy in any form, and that he is in league with all the reactionary forces that are now so militant. the last general election he received the support of the Employers' Union, which devotes its attention to the interests of employers, as employers only, and does not do or pretend to do anything for labour generally. others of the same kind were behind the Prime Minister and his party. Mr Spence. Mr G. B . EDWARDS The honourable member is wrong; they were behind the protectionist party. the protectionists as a party. The Reform League and the Employers' Federation of The Prime Minister New South Wales have united 'to denounce what they term "" Socialism."" They do not understand the true meaning of the word, Why did he submit to and they know that many people are ready Because his platform and that of to adopt their definition of it. In the same way they are making use of the word "" reform,"" and thus a party has been brought together to support what is distinctly a class movement. It has been created to protect the interests of a class that is strong enough to look after itself, and it is surprising to me that such a democratic assembly as the Federal Parliament is generally admitted to be, should be expected to allow a small minority to control the majority. I wish Will the to show that the Government are opposed to democracy. I 3b riot know how far the remarks which I am about to make will apply to the second leader of the Ministry, and to that section of the Government He said that the memsupporters which follow him.

In social reform we find that the watch-word is ""co-operation,"" while in economics it is ""character."" In the.old days, a man was merely considered to be a money-making animal, but to-day we have regard to his all-round capacity. We consider the well-being of individuals as such; we regard man not as a mere commodity to be bought and sold in the market, as is held by many in that economic school with which the Prime Minister has been associated. We consider man from the stand-point of everything that makes for his well-being. The reason why I quoted the very excellent remarks made recently by the honourable and learned member for Ballarat was because they showed a recognition of modern economic thought. civilization asThe humanizing, the bringing into one harmonious and truly humane life the whole body of society. Actions to-day are regarded as moral only when they contribute to the well-being of our fellow-men. The unionist movement and everything else that has an influence in developing human character, and in improving the race is of the right kind. Legislation with that object in view maybe an interference with the liberty of the individual, but it is not the fact of interference, but the effect of interference, that we have to consider. Mazzini said long ago that every political question is becoming a social question, and every social question is rapidly becoming a religious question. That is the problem of to-day, which is responsible for the activity of the Labour Party. I may perhaps be pardoned for quoting Arnold Toynbee, who puts the exact position in the following words:Two conceptions are woven into every argument of the ""wealth of nations""-the belief interference in any way with freedom of in the supremacy of individual liberty, and the action, who are opposedi to any form of conviction that man's self love is God's Provirestriction, and would allow every man to dence, so that the individual in pursuit of his own transact his business as he pleased.

But that is not the position today. At the present time production, distribution, and the good of man, all receive consideration. I believe, with Ruskin, thatWealth means well living. L if e is more than meat. Man should own property, not property own man. I should like to quote a very clear and comprehensive statement made by Dr. Findlay, a barrister-at-law, who was formerly in partnership with Sir Robert Stout. In commenting recently on the New Zealand Conciliation and Arbitration Bill, Dr. Findlay saidMatthew Arnold defined The tendency of the age is to make that compulsory which is desirable; to discredit free contract, to foster fair contract, between employer and employ^; to fix the status of all workmen by regulation as far as possible, and to assess the worker's share at the lowest resort on his needs rather than on the employer's greeds It is all nonsense to talk of liberty and freedom of conscience in this connection. As a matter of fact, social man has no natural inalienable and irrevocable .rights. He only owns those things with which society is content to clothe him, and no more. That is the economic foundation on which Conciliation and Arbitration Bills, and other like measures, are based. The views of several members of the present Government are in opposition to all modern principles of political economy. Is it reasonable for us to expect democratic legislation from a Government, which, by a peculiar combination of circumstances, has secured the support of those who hold views contrary to those of the Prime Minister? It is difficult to understand how professed Liberals have allowed themselves to be associated with men who are opposed to men endeavour to justify their position by the mere use of words.

Every one knows what a very low rate of interest is paid in other parts of the world, so that all the talk of industry being ruined by labour legislation-by such measures as a Conciliation and Arbitration Act-is without foundation. The position is much the same in regard to the outcry against the granting of preference to unionists. Mr Justice Cohen has shown that there is no foundation for the statement made from time to time that the preference section in the Conciliation and Arbitration Act of New South Wales has worked injuriously; and he has pointed of the limit allowed persons of larger means out that in some of the agreements volunto become depositors. tarily arrived at between employers and employees, provision is actually made for fact that this large sum of money exists in preference to unionists.

In any case, it is included in the investments to which I have referred. F u l l details are to be found in the Investor's Year Book. On referring to the Sydney Morning Herald's review of the operations for the year 1903, I find that within a radius of fifteen miles of Sydney a total of £3,020,793 was expended on buildings. Let me give honourable members the items which make up that total. Private enterprise-whic h the present Government specially represents-accounte d for a sum of £ 2 , 4 8 9 , 5 0 0 ; the Public Works Department spent £ 2 5 7 , 8 7 1 ; the Harbor Trust, £ 1 4 1 , 7 1 5 ; the Tramways Department, £ 6 0 , 6 4 6 ; the City Council, £ 4 2 , 4 8 2 ; the Public Schools Department, £ 2 7 , 7 5 9 ; the Fire Brigades Board, £ 8 2 2 . figures are in themselves a sufficient indication of the extent to which private enterprise has been influenced by recent legislation, and show that the assertions which have been made from time to time against the Labour Party have no foundation. They certainly prove that remarkable progress has been made, within a fifteen miles radius of a long established city, during a time of exceptional drought, and notwithstanding the operation of a Conciliation and Arbitration Act. Fortunately, the people are beginning to realize that the statements made from time to time against the Labour Party are put forward only to serve political pur poses, and that they are not true. I cannot refrain, however, from quoting an article which appeared, some little time ago, in the Sydney Daily Telegraph. In one of those rare lapses from its ordinary line of policy, during which the truth' slips into its columns, it published, in July, 1903, the following comments on a cablegram stating that capiOwing to the socialistic tendency of legislation We are not going to scare over the alleged migraof capital from any country. We have of the oldest inhabitant has any rational legisgirding up its fat loins and threatening to leave by the next boat. In England, in America, in France, everywhere, it is the same. CapiB. EDWARDS O r the big intal is perpetually on the wing. The mystery is where it goes to when it leaves the country. Should French capital go to England, if current stories are true, it will .meet on the way English capital in a similarly terror-stricken state fleeing from enfranchised democracy, which is suspected T h a t increase is not, of lurking round the political corner waiting for a chance to bludgeon it with some objectionable law. Should it make for America, or Australia, or Germany, or Russia, it will be met by the same kind of outrush, due to the same cause. Of course it might go to one of the South American republics, which capital never seems to leave, it being all used up in the form of ammunition for the different parties who abstain from obnoxious legislation to shoot each other with. Capital, therefore, keeps away from those places, but, as it is always represented as bolting incontinently from everywhere else, where it goes to is quite impossible to guess. An equally perplexing conundrum is what it lives on ""when it gets there. This article neatly summarises the position in regard to the bogy, which is from time to time trotted out in Australia. I have not much more to say. I have urged a n d that, in the interests of Australia, and havThese ing regard to the well-being of all classes, the present Government should not be allowed to remain in office. I have referred to the attitude taken up by it outside this chamber; but we have not yet 'heard members of the Government say in this chamber what they have said outside. No explanation has been made of the charges levelled against the Labour Party. Nothing has been said of the assertion that the Labour Party is a gigantic conspiracy against the welfare of the community. That was a very serious statement, coming, as it did, from the Prime Minister of United Australia, and as persons charged with conspiring against the common weal, we are entitled to have a fuller explanation than we have yet ""had from him.""

There is no more in it than there is in the statement we often hear about driving out capital.

We do not go to a man's I have enemy to get his character, or to find out his views. If we desire to know what his views are, we go to him direct, and it is unfair to the Labour Party, as a party, as it would I might 'have be unfair to the Government, to ask our opponents what are our views. All that the members of the present Government have done so far has been to set up a bogy and then throw stones at it. The speeches which have been made by both heads of the Government, whether they are called half, or double Prime""Ministers, have been devoted to an attack, not upon what the Labour Government had done, or proposed to do as a Government, but upon something founded upon misrepresentations which have been made outside Parliament, and, in some instances, in Parliament-somethin g I remember the late that has no existence, except in the imagination of some honourable gentlemen opposite, or of those outside who are attempting just now to prevent an accession to the numbers of the Labour Party in t'he event of a dissolution. They may as well attempt to stop the tide with a broom, as a celebrated We 'have character in fictfion is supposed to have attempted to do, as to try to stem the tide of democracy in the Commonwealth. People are daily becoming more educated, and largely through the propaganda work of the Walpoles and Tom Manns, who are all doing some good.

In the same way, I think, the democracy of Australia can look in a certain sense with gratitude to the Prime Minister as being the man who has been indirectly at all events, the means of initiating a movement which I trust willeventually consolidate all the progressive forces of the Commonwealth.

I venture to repeat what I said not so long ago, when the amendment of the honourable and learned member for I feel that the Labour Party Corinella was before the Chamber, that there was no moral justification whatever for the way in which the late Government was turned out. I say, too, that the gloss that was put upon that transaction last evening by the Prime Minister is not justified by the circumstances as . they actually occurred in this House.

We know well that the Labour Party, led by the honourable member for Bland, gave most, effective assistance to the GovernIn our opinion, lit ment I had the honour to support, and which was led by the honourable and learned member for Ballarat. I say that, throughout the whole course of this Commonwealth Parliament, the Liberals of this House and of this country must have observed with gratitude the great assistance that the Labour Party gave to us time after time, when we sat on the other side, and when we faced the Opposition that now comprises most of the Ministerialists in thenantagonism, partly avowed and partly concealed, to 'the liberal measures we brought forward.

I did not agree with him about the making of that promise, but, of course, we know that he always keeps his word, and he kept it honorably on that occasion. The honourable member for Bland was sent. for. He assumed office gallantly and well, and he and his Government ought to have been judged by their poficy and their work. But they were not. The present Prime Minister has asked that he shall be judged by his policy and his work. By his policy, such as it is, he may be easily judged, and I intend to devote a few words to it a little later on. matter. The Labour Government was riot fairly treated. They did not receive the fair oppora legitimate fashion. I say more than that? tunity which they were promised. They were not faced with a direct motion of want of confidence. They were not defeated upon a motion upon which they were openly challenged, and upon which they and their defenders could place before the country their merits. They succumbed to a side thrust.. battle-ground. which has been said to have been a challenge upon the battle-field selected by the Government, but it was not. I was not here to-day when the leader of the Opposition made his speech, but I understand that he has denied that assertion, and I venture to support what he said. The test of the matter is this: If he had never staked the official existence of his Government upon a particular question, the effect would have been the same. It is of no use to tell us, in the endeavour to throw dust in the eyes of the country, though' that cannot be done successfully, that the late Government was defeated upon a battle-ground selected by the gentleman at the head of it. What he said was unmistakable : "" I will ask that this question be reconsidered by the House,"" meaning, of course, that it should be dealt with in Committee on its merits. He did not for a moment anticipate, and we none of hurled at his Government, under which no Administration could maintain office. The late Government was defeated, not upon a field of battle selected by its Prime Minister, but upon a field of .battle selected by those who acted irrespective of the Government and of the merits of the question at issue, and were moved only by the determination to turn out of office men whom they thought were usurpers of the Treasury benches, and almost interlopers in this House. troubled the honourable and learned member much. feels the prickings of conscience, and cannot keep quiet. His uneasiness shows the justice of what I am saying-that the Government was defeated because of the stern determination to eject at all hazards and at any cost what some honourable members contemptuously termed the Labour Government. That is unmistakably the whole truth . of the It has not been proved that the present Government came into office in When the right honourable gentleman for East Sydney asserted that his Government came into office in ordinary legitimate fashion, he immediately proceeded to recognise the weakness of his position.

My honourable friend, the Minister of Trade and Customs, referred tonight to the subject of land taxation. Let me remind him that his leader-no , his equal -the Prime Minister, introduced a land tax into the New South Wales Parliament, and that he, whilst a member of the Government, to which I had the honour to belong, and which was led by ""the present Treasurer, made a very powerful and eloquent speech in favour of a land tax. fied for legitimate revenue purposes. doxy is our doxy, heterodoxy is some one else's.

When I heard my If the fiscal question is dead honourable friend reproach the Labour Party with wanting to impose a land tax, it struck me as remarkable that he should be associated with a free-trade league, one of whose O r a double-headed Opplanks is to impose a single tax upon the people of this country-upo n the landowners of this country. My surprise was the greater when I remembered also that my honourable friend almost electrified the Victorian Assembly in this very chamber by his eloquent support of the land tax learned member's Government introduced a land tax into the Victorian Parliament. I think my honourable friend supported it. The Prime Minister and the Minister of Trade and Customs are, therefore, equals in so far as land taxation is concerned. Are they equals in Socialism also ? I am not going to accuse my honourable friend, the Minister of Customs, of that. I propose to read the words of the Prime Minister with regard to Socialism. I quote from the Argus of a few days ago, 31st August, containing a report of a speech of the right honourable gentleman, addressed to farmers in the Astypical ""Yes-No"" speech. But if he says he is opposed to Socialism I must refer him to this speech. This is what he saidMy belief contains two ideals.

Tories jubilating, as the honourable and learned member said just now? jubilating over that. They may. be jubilating over the "" Yes' ' part of it, but not over the "" No' ' part of it. We were told by my honourable friend that the desire for national legislation marked the Labour Party, and I want to ask what on earth the Prime Minister meant when he addressed the farmers of the country in those terms. turning out the Government,v the Prime Minister in his anxiety to go on with the business, after having wasted the time of the country, asked for three weeks' respite, which was granted, in order to enable him to frame a policy.

We know perfectly well that the great principle which held the Liberal-Protectionist Party together was surrendered-to whom? To a defeated foe, to a leader, able, eloquent, and strategica man for whose power of overcoming difficult situations we must all have the greatest admiration. We all know perfectly well that he has acknowledged himself in this House to have been beaten on the fiscal question.

I am perfectly willing, although I am in no way pledged on the subject, to stand by my honourable friends of the protectionist party, and say that there was a proposal of fiscal peace. But I want to know what is the meaning of fiscal. peace. I shall tell honourable members Having achieved his object by what that fiscal peace meant. It meant this, that the contest in Australia between the policy of free-trade on the one side, and the policy of protection on the other, was decided. There was to be no more struggling as to which, policy was to be triumphant. We had erected the standard of protection, and that flag was to fly all over Australia. When the Prime Minister,'in Sydney, taunted the protectionists of Australia, and said that they had that "" tired feeling,"" and that they dared not raise theprotectionist flag before the people of AusO f course, we knew pertralia, we dared to do so, and the people-, supported us. They declared that there should be a pause in the great strugglehonorable and between the protectionists and the free traders, and that the protectionist flagW e have done that? We should still continue to wave. But they never said that in this declaration of peace between two warring camps any details of protection should lemain unattended to. They never said that in this protectionist domain if wrong were done in any case it should not be righted. learned member should turn, to the galleries, and not to the House, with that story. pinch. He sees how thin is the covering over himself in this regard, and feels that this is cutting very close to him.

I shall read the terms of the proposed alliance between the protectionist and free-trade paities. They will be found in the journals of May 19th. One of the terms was a proposal for two years' fiscal truce. If the constituencies of Australia had ordered a fiscal truce, how could the two parties suggest an agreement for such a truce? How could the members of this House come forward and say, "" True it is that the constituencies have commanded peace, but we shall deliberate whether or not there shall be peace."" posal?

That was the decision that was arrived at unanimously, and which ought never to have been departed from. I have no doubt that the Minister of Trade and Customs has stated what was in his mind. I am only mentioning what was in mine. At a meeting such as that various views are expressed, and one can only give his own impression as to what took place. But I have here something in writing.

Are we then to find the two equal sections of the Cabinet flying, like tigers, at each other's throats? Does this ""fiscal truce"" mean a truce to bury protection ? Labour alliance to last? face of our agreement a statement as to how long it is to last. There has been no concealment on our part. We have placed the whole matter fairly before the country. We wish to meet the Government openly. We ask the same frankness from the other side. The question I have put has been asked before, but we can obtain no answer. Language apparently is made to conceal thoughts; but we wish to know from the Government, and especially from my protectionist friends, for how long they have consented to stifle protection. learned member assumes that he will be in the next Parliament. sume that the honourable member will be a member of it. I repeat that the protectionists of Australia have a right to know from the protectionist members of the Government how long they have consented to bind themselves hand and foot, and to attempt to bind the people whom they represent, to the crushing down of protection. trade baby was dead; the protectionist baby was alive. There was no reason, therefore, -why they should combine their forces. How long are they going to "" farm "" the protectionist baby ? learned member is making a babyish speech. level of the honourable member. Before proceeding to consider the two items, and the only two, apart from colourless matters, that the Government have deigned to put before the country, I wish to emphasize the fact that there is no mistaking the societv in which the protectionist members of the Government find themselves. There is no mistaking the desire and the designs of the leader of the Government and of his free-trade friends. We know that Australia has a great future; we know 'that its resources are great. one dreams of Australia becoming a 7Q 2 great country, and developing not merely as a sheep-walk or as the abode of herds and flocks, and not merely in the"" matter of do our utmost to promote that end. While we desire that it shall develop in this way, we wish at the same time to see a diversification of employment in Australia. It ought to be one of the highest aims of this Parliament, and of .those who lead it, to make Australia an industrial country, and, if possible, an industrial centre of the world. We must have great manufactures here. We have all the materials to support them. We have been endowed with the fullest natural possessions necessary to build up these manufactures, and we have a right to look forward to a time when we shall be a great manufacturing community with a large output and a prosperous exchange between our primary and secondary producers. There is an outlook, according to the leader of the Government; there is a panacea for the great manufactures of Australia. What is the reme'dy? Let me read the right honourable gentleman's own words. In dealing with the matter, he himself asked a question. He saidWhat is the hope of the great manufactures of Australia? How are we to manufacture cheaply, or to compete with the cheap labour of other countries ? He then proceeded to point out that we could not have a monopoly of mechanical appliances; that we could not have better machinery than the British pr German The freemanufacturers have. He pointed out, too, that the manufacturers of Germany and England could buy raw material all over the world, and then he added this strange commentary on free-trade England, although he linked Germany with itand How are we going to compete with these underpaid sweated countries until our own labour is underpaid and sweated too? That was his answer to the great question of how and when Australia is to be raised to the position of a great manufacturing country, and the means by which we can attain that eminence. This is the panacea which he offers, and I commend it to my honourable friends oppositeIn .the plenitude of time, when our millions become tens of millions, we shall have a crop of misery which will solve the difficulty in regard to cheap manufactures.
