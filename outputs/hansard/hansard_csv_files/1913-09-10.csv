Mr Hughes said that it was a far-reaching reform, and it was not allowed to pass. The Agricultural Bureau Bill was a measure to assist the farmers and others. But these two bills were talked about the whole day, and when the House rose on Friday they were no further forward than when it began. The Opposition was not out to do business, and all the talk about non-contentious measures was just so much dust thrown in the eyes of the people, for the purpose of helping in a systematic process of political obstruction..

Mr W. H . IRVINE privilege. An article appears in the Age newspaper this morning, in which the writer accuses me of having read in the debate yesterday one of the two important rules affecting general retainers, ignoring or suppressing the other, which, according to him, would have put a different complexion on the case. Everybody will deplore that Mr Irvine did not think it necessary to be quite frank with the House in this matter. A more serious charge could not be made against any member of Parliament, especially one occupying the position which I happen to occupy at the present time. The statement in the Age is a deliberate and audacious falsehood; audacious because, as honourable members will recollect, the text of both rules was read by me, and appears in the galley proofs which were supplied to me this morning by the 'Hansard Department. The rules are these, and every honourable member who was present yesterday w ill remember that I read the whole of each of them. Rule 5, which the writer in the Age says that I read, is as followsIf the counsel who has accepted a general retainer from one party should be offered a special retainer or brief by another party, the general retainer entitles the party who has given it to reasonable notice before the offered special retainer or brief is accepted. Rule 8, which according to the writer in the AgeI suppressed, but which appears in the report of my speech immediately after rule 5, and which honourable members will remember that I read, is in these wordsIn case a special retainer or brief is offered Speaker, whether I shall be permitted to to counsel by a party other than the party f:«ra bring before the House by way of perwhom he has accepted a general retainer, the sonal explanation a matter to which I counsel, after giving notice to the party from The House adwhom he has accepted the general retainer uf the offer of the special retainer or brief, is at liberty to accept the special retainer or brief of the other party, unless a special retainer or brief be given within a reasonable time by the party from whom he has accepted the general retainer. I absolutely repudiate and give the lie to the defamatory and obviously false statement which appears in tlie Age. order that the Attorney-General, haviug risen to a question of privilege, must, understanding order 285, conclude with a motion. That standing order says thatAny honourable member complaining to the House of a statement in a newspaper as a breach of privilege, shall produce a copy of the paper containing the statement in question, and be prepared to give the name of the printer or pubA s a matter of lisher, and also submit a substantive motion declaring the person in question to have been guilty of contempt. able the Attorney-General said he desired to speak on a matter of privilege, he was really making what was more properly a personal explanation. what he said. He rose to call attention to what he conceived to be a breach of privilege, and made a personal explanation in reference thereto. Under the Standing Orders his proper method as one of privilege was to produce a copy of the newspaper containing the words complained of, and to conclude with a motion. The standing order says: All questions of order and matters of privilege at any time arising shall, until decided, suspend the consideration and decision of every other question. To arrive at a decision it is the practice to conclude with a motion affecting any matter of privilege. Mr W. H . IRVINE In bringing the inatter forward under the cover of privi lege, I thought that I was following the practice usually adopted. If I was wrong in doing so without concluding with a motion, the mistake was mine, and I ask you, Mr Speaker, and the House to permit what I have said to be regarded as in the nature of a personal explanation. the House that that course be adopted ?",12,Personal Explanations

No. The road tractor has been laid up for repairs and because of inefficient running. a. The total load for the tractor was to be 21 tons, and the petrol consumption one gallon per mile f u l l load. 3. The tractor was taken in use on trial from the 19th June, 1911. It was undergoing repairs from the 28th June to the 9th July, and again from the 15th July to the 19th. During the period from 19th to 28th June it travelled 162^ miles. The average was n miles, and the average load per journey 7 1/5 tons. Average petrol consumption 2.4 gallons per mile. In relation to the payment of driver, the Director-General of Works reported, on the 27th January, 1912, that on the 15th July, 1911, the company wrote, saying that they were willing to extend the period of trial to demonstrate that the machine was suited for the work. A trial of the machine was conducted on the 28th August, and it was reported as not being capable of the work which the company undertook it I am not aware whether would perform. The machine was taken over on the 19th September, 1911, and since then "" part of the undergear has broken again and been repaired."" On the 16th July, 1912, it was reported that for the two months ended n t h June, 1912, the tractor had travelled 442 miles (half going and half coming); the average journey was 8 miles; In the question which average load, 4 tons-carryin g in all 106 tons net; running costs ^87 19s. 6d.; average cost per ton mile, 2s. The average cost per ton mile with steam tractor is under 4d. The Director-General of Works then instructed that, under the circumstances, the tractor should not be used except on emergency, when any other form of transport could not be obtained. On the 14th August, 1913, the Director General of Works reported that the engine was delivered on trial subject to certain conditions, and was taken into use for that trial, but did not give satisfactory running results. On one occasion it broke down af the Molongo River (fractured gear casing of carden shaft drive). The broken casting was replaced by the makers, who, however, claimed that the fracture was due to a defective casting fractured in cold water. A trial was made in the Director General's presence, under conditions agreed upon by the representative of the firm, and the results of the trial were unsatisfactory.

"" All this talk about trying to pass legislation may be so much bluff. The political game of the Government is to introduce a B ill of one clause reestablishing the postal vote. On such a measure discussion would be restricted, and the game of honourable members opposite would be successfully played if they could get the measure on to the Senate, and bring about the failure of the Senate Into pass it after it had been twice sent within three months, because that would make a double dissolution possible.

102,Mr Higgs,"That correction does notmust see the objection to that. The capitalist party has an organizer in every electorate, and in many of the large towus. In Rockhampton, for example, a man is kept permanently employed looking after the rolls and after the political organization for which he works, the capitalist party paying h i m . The Attorney General is going to ask tliese paid servants of the capitalist party to make objections to names on the roll. they will object to the names of persons thought to vote for the capitalist candidates ? But is it not likely that an overzealous servant of the capitalist partyand these persons are generally overzealous--wil l make objection to names of men who have every right to vote? far as I can glean, there is to be no provision for publicity in regard to these representations. system was, it had this to recommend it , that publicity was given to objections. On pages 1 and 2 of the Mo wit Morgan Argus of 4th September, which came by the last mail going to lay the paper on the table? casual on the names of f u l l y a thousand persons which have been struck off the roll for Mount Morgan. These names were advertised in accordance with the State electoral law, and before each there appears either the word "" left "" or ""dead."" .For the most part the word "" l e f t "" appears. There is also published in this issue of the Mount Morgan Argus the following warning on the .part of the editorWe would urge every one to look up the list for his own or friends' names. The work of revising the rolls has been done by the police. Many names have been left on for Mount Morgan which should have been on the ""Normanby list, and vice vend. The present attempt to adjust matters entails plenty of work on the new Clerk of Petty Sessions, Mr R. Power, but he has tackled the job, and will now have to stand the many calls of "" l e f t "" voters. In other words the editor suggests that people whose names have been struck off the roll on the ground that they have l e f t the district will be calling on the clerk of petty sessions in their tens, twenties, and forties to explain that they are still resident in the district. One advantage of the Queensland electoral law is that notice has to be given in the newspapers when any name is to be struck off the roll , so that the person concerned, or his friends, may see the advertisement, and be able to take action. The Attorney-General's proposal is, however, to allow political organizations to furnish objections, and that the electoral officer shall have the power to strike off the names of persons objected to without publishing the fact that he intends to do so. Such a procedure is extremely dangerous. notice is not always seen. ney-General may say, "" We shall send notice to the elector i u each case."" There are many thousands of people in the ComSo monwealth who might not receive such a notice, and who f a i l very often to get a uotice eveu when it is sent through the Bad as the Queensland post. Then, again, many men when they received such a notice might be busily engaged at their daily work, and would say, "" Why should we bother about spending half a day or a day in waiting on the . clerk of petty sessions to request that our names be l e f t on the r o l l ? "" able member would not have the rolls If necessary. At a maintained permanently without any reglance, I should say that vision ? intelligent representative of Tasmania to ask! The present electoral law is about as perfect a system as has so fa r been devised. where people had to send in cards two or three times before they could' secure enrolment. faults in the system to which the honourable member may be able to point, I contend that the scheme under which an elector desiring ""to be enrolled must sign a card, which is kept in the office for reference, is the best that has yet been devised. Then, again, in the Act , as it stands, there are a number of sections relating to the purification of the rolls. In Mount Morgan, for instance, at the end of 1912, 800 names were struck off the roll for Capricornia. Colonel RYEIE -Nearly all Liberals.

On previous occasions I have made suggestions for the amendment of the electoral law when an amending Bill was being discussed, but have not been able to give effect to them. Apparently the B ill which is to be introduced will be of such a character that only matters witb which the Ministry desire to deal will be covered by it . WhatI desire is that the B ill shall be so framed that other amendments of the electoral law besides those proposed by the Ministry may be made,should there be a majority i u favour of them. member say we shall be debarred from inserting new clauses ? lowed to insert clauses going beyond the order of leave. over and over again by Chairmen of Committees.

To mention one matter, I wish to do away with the monetary deposit that candidates are now required to make. There should not 'be a deposit. It is unfair to ask candidates to lay £ 2 5 to nothing that they will secure a certain number of votes. To do so is to encourage the gambling instinct, and to that, I am sure, the I do not think that they Prime Minister is opposed. There are other alterations of the law which, in my opinion, should be made, and I ask that favorable consideration may be given to my request for an opportunity to propose them.

I may be told that it is not usual at this stage to make such an exA t that stage, the M i nplanation. That may be so, but the House has the right under the Standing Orders to demand an explanation at any stage. We are quite justified, therefore, in not treating the present motion as a formal one, and in asking for an explanation of the proposed B ill . TheM in ister in charge of the measure might have met us by furnishing information. We are entitled to know what the proposals of the Government for the alteration of the electoral law are. Having a majority, the Government can, of course, ultimately obtain leave to introduce the B ill . All Oppositions are handicapped in not having the power to extend the scope of a B ill . That can be done by getting leave to amend the title to cover amendments not provided for, but obviously a Government that did not wish further amendments to be made would use its majority to prevent such an alteration. There is very little hope, therefore, of succeeding in an attempt of that kind. I do not object to the provision of our That has been ruled electoral law which requires candidates to make a inonetary deposit.

No one believes more strongly than I do that we should, where possible, adhere to the forms and practices of Parliament, recognising the principles underlying them, but the present case is exceptional. The Government had two lines of policy whicli it might have pursued. It might have interpreted the recent election as an expression by the people of the desire that during the next three years there should be rest and respite from the reforming zeal of the Labour party. A patriotic Australian Government would have assumed that that was the interpretation to be given to the verdict of the people.

235,Mr Page,"Hear, hear !Queensland was trustee of the secret f u n d in connection with the organization of the Liberal party, it is reasonable for us'to be very suspicious in relation to the matter now before us. What was the postal vote about which honourable members say so much, and which they are also anxious to restore? Do they mean to say that all who were sick at the last general elections-al l thesick and crippled who were in hospitals and could not record their votes, were Liberal supporters ? Considering the exposure and risk to in j u r y that are likely to occur to the masses of the workers, I do not hesitate to say that there was just as large a proportion of the sick and crippled at the last election who were supporters of the Labour party, as there was in relation to the other side. Yet when we tried to give the people in the institutions an opportunity to record their votes, a number of the same individuals supporting our friends opposite refused to allow us to make polling booths in certain hospitals. those people a chance of voting -the Progressive League and the Labour open to fraud, and corruption, and deceit of every kind.

MrM c DONALD member is a great authority on the honesty of the voting public of Australia. Let me say that those who do dishonest things are not to be found on this side of the House. I have listened to the Prime Minister denying having slandered the people of Australia in regard to the vote at the last elections, although at the time he made the denial he had in his pocket a letter with the name of the writer who had defamed the people of Australia, and he was not manly or honest enough to tell the people who had done it . lieve there is greater opportunity for fraud under the postal-vote than under any other system I know of, and if the Honorary Minister chooses to say that that statement is libelling the electors, he may say it to his heart's content, for what he says does not trouble me. Prom what I [39] have seen of the postal vote, it has certainly opened a means of violating the secrecy of the ballot. To mention again the matter to which I am about to refer may seem almost tedious repetition; b u t I do not think that it can be spoken of too often in this connection. I have not with me at present figures relating to the whole of Queensland, but I know that in Charters Towers alone at one election 2,700 postal votes were recorded, many of them in the names of persons who were dead, and others in the names of absentees, some of whom returned on election clay only to find that they could not vote, because they had been personated. The Government of the day appointed 300 justices of the peace, of whom somewhere about twenty were for the Charters Towers district, to go round witnessing and collecting postal votes. So far as these 2,700 votes were concerned, the voting was practically open and without secrecy. A few persons using the postal vote might have recorded their votes secretly; but the vote generally was maniT h is B ill will give all pulated practically by two organizations organization. I do not claim more credit for my party than' for the other party. I witnessed some hundreds of these votes, and, had I desired, I could have known for what candidates they were cast.

We hunted through the Barcoo roll to see whether this gentleman's name was on it , and as we found it was not there, we let them have their f u n for about seven or eight hours, and when 400 or 500 names had been struck off, we objected to this gentleman appearing as objector, seeing we got a few men that his name was not on the roll. There was, of course, a great flutter in the dovecote amongst the horse-hair gentlemen, and they tried to bluff us; but the acting police magistrate, who was the Registrar at that time, had to adjourn the Court while he telegraphed to Brisbane to get the advice of the Home Secretary as to what he should do; and next morning, at 10 o'clock, he said, "" Mr Page's objection is f a t a l; every one of those names on the must stop on the r o l l .

The Honorary Minister has not told us anything of the scope of this B ill . anxiety to tell the Opposition of its scope. is in this B ill a clause that will deprive many of my constituents who take part in strikes-and sometimes a strike is a day's outing for some of them-of the right to vote. There may be in the B ill a clause depriving all unionists of the right of enrolment. This may seem rather farfetched; but such a proposal was actually advocated a few weeks ago by the Age newspaper, which has been supporting the Government through thick and t h in . An honourable member opposite has said that the rural workers have not asked for a union.

I am satisfied with the electoral law as it stands, and do not think honourable members opposite have mucb cause to complain. here with a vast majority , and are using it i u such a brutal fashion that they sometimes keep us here until midnight. If the Honorary Minister is, as he says, consumed with a burning anxiety to supply us with information regarding the scope of this B ill , why did he not avail himself of the opportunity to give us that information when he submitted the motion? Why did not the Government introduce this B ill in the Senate? The members of another place have nothing to do. They are simply marking time. done only three or four days' work, while we have been labouring here for the last three or four weeks. member is not in order in reflecting on the Senate. the Senate, but on the Ministry, whicli does not give that House something to do.

What a fix we should be in if such machines were used at the next Federal election-which , I hope, will take place within the next few weeks and the honourable member for Wentworth, whilst instructing some ladies at the Paddington booth how to vote, got locked up with one of them, and no one could open the door.

I have a vague idea that the B ill will provide for compulsory voting, and also preferential voting. However, any system would be good enough for the Government and their supporters, so long as it was sufficiently new and complicated; but I am game to bet that there will not be a clause which will make the law more effective than the present Act. If there is compulsory enrolment, the natural corollary is compulsory voting. If a vote is worth having it ought to be used, but we are told by opponents of compulsory voting that although we may take a horse to the trough we cannot make it drink. My experience is that once a voter is got to the polling-booth, he or she is affected by the prevailing feeling, and takes sides just as much' as do those who have been previously bitten by the political microbe. I should like to see compulsory voting tried, because I think it is a very good idea.

IRVINE would the honourable member suggest? sick person should be allowed to vote providing that a doctor's certificate is obtained; and a doctor, justice of the peace, and a presiding officer or other oflicial should be present at the recording of the vote. Our opponents have tried to make ifc appear that we are against the sick having a vote, but we are not. Our objection is to the methods under which, during the election of 1910, and the referenda of 1911, canvassing for postal votes was indulged in . franchised the sick. chised some whose votes would have been properly recorded, but we have disfranchised many more whose votes would have been subject to the exercise of undue influence. look upon it as the solemn and almost the religious duty of every member on this side to speak to this motion. Tn days gone by there have been so many attempts by Conservative Governments to take away rights that had been won by centuries of persistent effort, that we cannot be too ready to defend our liberties. Only last week the Conservative Government of South Australia introduced a B ill to gerrymander the electoral districts old members of the Opposition should do of that State. As that Government has a majority in both Houses of the South Australian Legislature, the B ill will probably be carried, and although at the last Commonwealtli election Labour candidates for the Senate had a majority of nearty 12,000, it will be impossible for the Labour party or any reform party to get the government of the State into its hands again for many years to come. What is proposed by this Government may be even worse. valuable suggestions have fallen from honourable members during this debate that we must be regarded as conferring a benefit on the Government. charge of the Bill may, perhaps, profit by the discussion, and be able to adopt them .for the improvement of the B ill . honourable members opposite would be willing to vote for a proposal similar to thai; moved at a Liberal-or , to speak correctly, a Fusion-conference , by the doctor referred to by the honourable member for Bass. The honourable member W h a t method for Grampians has seriously proposed that the parliamentary franchise should be based on the ratepayers' roll. I do not know the details of the Victorian system of municipal and district council elections, but I know, to my sorrow, the details of the South Australian law. Woe betide the people of Australia if their parliamentary franchise ever becomes like the municipal franchise of South Australia. I do not think that it ever will , because we on this side are the champions and defenders of the people's rights, the watchdogs of political liberty. We shall oppose even the most subtle attempts to in terfere with these rights. In South Australia, a man possessing a large number of houses in a ward may practically monopolize the voting power of that ward. The owner of property has a vote for ifc, or he may give the right to vote to his agents, but not more than three votes may be cast in respect to one property. Sometimes a firm of solicitors goes into thc house agency business, and an owner can make such a firm his agents. He can, moreover, appoint different agents for each property, and I know an owner who must have at least fifty houses in a ward of one of the eastern suburbs. Honourable members may imagine the enormous voting power that can be exercised by such a man. this; it ouglit not to be put upon the young members! to be excused for the interjection, because appealed for order a few minutes ago.

The people of Australia would at all times have power over their representatives in Parliament, and it is absolutely necessary that they should have that power. wait for a general election where personal factors step in , but at all times they would have the power in their hands to pull up their representatives on short terms. The rising generation, on account of the schoolmaster having been abroad, and on account of the high schools established throughout Australia-mainl y through the instrumentality of the Labour party-is advanced enough to follow and intelligently use such an instrument of legislation as the initiative, referendum, and recall. What greater glories could the people of Australia have? I hope the Honorary Minister has included in his B ill the power to initiate legislation, and also the power to recall any legislation objectionable to the majority of the people.

Despite four different nationalities livin g in the one country, they have had the institution of the initiative, referendum, and recall for a goodly number of years, and they use it very effectively. The people of Switzerland are the only people who truly govern themselves. Whether at all times they have used their power intelligently or not I cannot say, because many things require righting in Switzerland-the y are not such a happy community as many of the people living in Australia, that being mainly due to the fact that the natural resources of Switzerland are not nearly so abundant as ours--bu t it is singular that even in Switzerland it is very rarely that on the first time of asking the people have agreed to adopt by the referendum what the Government for the time being have advised them.

MrM c GRATH (Ballarat) [9.17] I am very anxious that the HonoraryM in ister shall have the opportunity of making the statement he refused to make earlier in the day. accurate. I did not refuse to make any explanation. did not refuse; he merely refrained from making an explanation. MrM c GRATH I have been corrected. I should have said that the Honorary Minister refrained from making a statement when he had the opportunity. It would have prevented all this discussion had he made the explanation. admit it is somewhat unusual to discuss a B ill when leave is being asked to introduce it , but the circumstances are somewhat unusual. Have we any reason to be dissatisfied with the electoral law ? Hasi t suited the requirements of the majority of the people ? We can only answer thati by making an analysis of the number of people voting at the last election, and comparing the percentage with that at the previous election. In Victoria, election day was the wettest polling day we have ever had, and yet the percentage of people voting was 75, while in Ballarat we had an 83 per cent, vote, the highest recorded in any part of Victoria. So, in that respect, I think there is little or no need for alteration of the law. The Prime Minister has been accused of making some very defamatory statements concerning the people of Australia in that famous interview with the reporter of the London Morning Post. have been circulated throughout Australia. Irregularities are alleged to have taken place in connection with the elections, and detectives have been sent to If the B ill is a Ballarat. The Liberal party handed a listiI do not know whether it was to the actual Minister of Home Affairs or to the Chief Electoral Officer, but detectives were supplied with this list by the Liberal party, and I understand that as a result of their investigation, the detectives have found nothing wrong at Ballarati n connection with the elections. However, if there has been any abuse in any part of Australia we should have an investigation into the alleged irregularities before any B ill is submitted to the House. If it can be proved that under the absentee voting system there has been any form of corruption, duplicate voting, or personation, I am prepared to vote for the abolition of the absent vote, that is, if the evil can be proved to be at all general. If it can be demonstrated that the Act, which contained some startling innovations, opened the door for corruption, or for T h a t statement is most in people voting for dead persons, I am prepared to support a stringent alteration. A little while ago the Ministry were very anxious for an investigation, and now they are bringing down a B ill before an investigation is held. leave to bring it in . ber intends to follow up this motion with I a B ill , but why does he do it before an investigation is made? plaining of an investigation at the start.

We shall be ready to afford every assistance for the securing of clean elections.

472,Mr Mcgrath,"When detectiveson with business, why do they not introduce their Conciliation and Arbitration Bill? They have told the farmers that they are going to take from the rural workers the right to appeal to the Arbitration Court, and they should carry out their promise, although they know full well that before they can pass any measure into law the rural workers will have come before the Arbitration Court, and will have got an award. The exemption of rural workers from the arbitration legislation was practically the only questiou on which the Liberal party went before the country. Liberal candidates may have said a few words about the re-establishment of the postal vote; but, after what has taken place here in Victoria recently, no one should be anxious for that. Clarke were candidates for a seat in the Legislative Council of Victoria recently, Mr Abbott was defeated by something like twenty-eight votes, and obtained a recount. It must be remembered that the electors of the Council have a property qualification, and are supposed to be better educated than ordinary electors. But this is the report of a Committee of the Council on the operation of the postalvoting system: With regard to the postal votes, 67 postal ballot-papers were issued. Six were disallowed by the Returning Officer, but one of these was afterwards allowed by the Committee on the recount. The Committee found themselves compelled by the Act to reject 22 additional papers, so that there were 27 rejected, or 40 per cent, of the 67 postal ballot-papers issued. So that 40 per cent, of those who voted by post at that election were disfranchised; many through no fault of their own, but because of a mistake on the part of the witness, and for other reasons. Had there been a similar investigation of the absentee voting, the percentage of voters disfranchised would have been found to be much less than 40 per cent. Most of the absent votes that were rejected were due to the casting of votes by persons who believed that tbeir names were on the roll of some other electorate, but whose names had been removed prior to the election; very few votes were declared informal because of any wrong act on the part of the voter. vote is easier and simpler than the postal vote. The system may need slight alterations. I think that the Returning Omcers should have the right to count the absentee votes cast within a division instead of having to send them to the head office to be counted, thus delaying the declaration of the poll. I speak feelingly on the subject, because I was fourteen votes behind my opponent when the direct votes had been counted, and something like three weeks were needed to count 2,600 absent votes that were sent in, pretty well half of which could have been counted on the night of the election had the Returning Officers in the respective divisions had the right to open them. The delay in ascertaining the results of the election caused an outburst of feeling against the absent vote; but the carrying out of my suggestion would have made that delay much less. I do not expect that the Bill will increase voting facilities other When Mr Abbott and Mr than by re-establishing the postal vote^a thing to which I am opposed, because I have seen a great deal of corruption in connection with that system. I do not say that that corruption is chargeable wholly to one party. So long as the door is left open to corrupt practices they will creep in. the postal vote. ballot-paper can be filled in in Melbourne, and sent to Ballarat, and only one person need know anything about it.. The name of a witness can be safely forged, because no inquiry is made as to his existence. I do not wish to tell too much, but I have seen enough of the postal vote to determine me never to vote for its adoption again. The postal vote is unfair, because it means that the party with most money and most canvassers must succeedI do not speak as one who has suffered, because, although I contested four or five State elections under the postal system, I knew how to organize it as well as the others did, recognising that it had to be looked after. It has been said that the Labour party abolished the postal vote because its members suffered from it, but I do not think that that is so. I believe that in 1910 a majority of the postal votes were cast for Labour Ministers and members. The honourable member for Boothby has pointed out that the exercise of the postal vote The absent was allowed, not because persons were ill , but because they thought they might be ill , or might, on polling day, be five miles from a polling booth. The postal vote is a dangerous weapon to place in",53,Elector Al Bill

A t the last election we saw that the wealthy classes would stoop to anything to secure control of the Treasury bench. Having command of capital, and being able to employ armies of canvassers, they could prevent the Democrats from ever regaining possession of office if the postal vote system were in force. It is hard that those who are sick should not be able to vote, and if means could be found to enable them to do so secretly I should be ready to vote for them. Mr W. H .

The honourable member for Wilmot has said that the Labour party is the only political party that has voted to disfranchise electors, but we know that only three years ago the Liberal party in Victoria took from the inmates of benevolent asylums the right to vote. Moreover, only one person in three in the State of Victoria can vote at an election for a Legislative Councillor, and there are only 20,000 in the State who possess the qualifications required of a candidate for the Council. Such a candidate must hold £1,000 worth of freehold property with unencumbered title deeds. Yet the honourable member for Grampians, who is so anxious that the sick woman should have the right to vote, would restrict the exercise of the Commonwealth franchise to those persons whose names are on the ratepayers' rolls. Do we find honourable members opposite fighting to enfranchise the Victorian citizens who are disfranchised, to restore the right to vote to the inmates of our Denevolent asylums ? said a word in favour of that. MrM c GRATH No t a word. One gentlemana doctor of law, I believedeclared in Tasmania that old-age penI have no knowledge sioners should lose their right to vote. If such a statement were made in a moment of excitement by some of our leaders in the trade union movement, it would be quoted against us, but honourable members opposite go to their conferences and declare that they are going to deny various people the right to vote in this way with out any blame being attached to them. The party opposite profess to be anxious that every man and woman should be given an opportunity to vote, yet one of their members, the honourable member for Calare, told us that one rural electorate in Great Britain, comprising only 1,500 people, returned a member to the HouseW h a t method of Commons, whereas a city electorate, comprising 49,000 electors, had only ones I think that it representative, and that he would like to see the same principle applied in Australia.

We cannot deny that the Senate is not elected on a Democratic basis, since the smaller States have equal power with the larger States; but the Labour party had nothing to do with the determination of the basis of representation.

The basis upon which the Senate should be elected was decided by the Convention, in which we were not represented. right so long as the Conservative party were in the majority in this House. Now, however, they talk about class representation in the Senate, although they make no complaint concerning the representation of only one class in the Legislative Councils of the States, in which they have always had a majority. The Senate, at least, is elected by the men and women of Australia. In the case of that House, meu and women count for more than bricks and mortar.

CATTS -The honourable member is wrong, but he reminds me that the present Government have given them £150,000 this year through ineptitude in administering the public revenues.

If a firm contributes £1,000 or £50,000 to an election, surely it ought not to be ashamed of it . Where is the need for all this secrecy, if something is not being done to the detriment of the public? Surely these persons who claim to be patriotic, ought to have no objection to telling us what money they have expended in helping the political party opposite. During one of the recent debates in That is the this Chamber the statement was made that our trade unions spent large sums of money for political purposes. Of course, if organizations are to be called upon to submit an account of their expenditure for political purposes, it should be made to apply all round.

If there is something in it to which he objects and an effort is made to eliminate it , he will be compelled, should the Minister say that the Government regards the matter as vital , It is a lengthy to vote against his convictions. 1 anticipate that the Government intends to abolish the provision requiring returns of election expenditure from the great capitalist organizations of Australia that W as there' an elecpour their wealth into the lap of the Fusion party to secure legislation in their own interests, enabling them to further exploit the masses of the people.

If the Government re-introduced the postal voting system it could not be operated in my electorate without my knowledge, and if I found that tactics were being adopted that left me no alternative but to adopt the same tactics, I should probably resort to them, and I am sure that I could get as many postal votes as could any one whom the Liberal party saw fit to put up against me. I have no complaint to make so far as I am personally concerned against postal voting. In every case I have always had a majority of the postal and absent votes recorded in my electorate. The number of postal votes, however, was comparatively small a couple of hundred for myself and something less for my opponent. much wrong there. MrJ . H .

From the point of veiw of their personal interest, it would be better for them to spend half a million in that way, and so obtain the repeal of the legislation to which they objected. And I do not reso with the Sugar Refining Company. I may have been prepared When they found that they were not to be Personally, the allowed to exploit the community as they were doing, it would be a very good investment for them to contribute £50,000 to defeat certain candidates in order that they might work their own sweet will upon the community. It is quite apparent that it is not possible so to restrict and l i m it postal voting as to provide for the purity of our elections. A f t e r all, how many people are affected by it ? Surely, if these great risks are to be undertaken there must be some adequate number of persons involved. Under every law some one suffers. No doubt every piece of legislation imposing taxation inflicts some hardship upon individuals, but we cannot frame our legislation on the basis of saving these units out of some hundreds of thousands of people. We have so to frame our was not legislation as to safeguard the interests of the great majority.

Then the Prime Minister, in the Sydney daily press of Monday week, stated that the Government are simply taking steps to bring about a double dissolution at the earliest possible time. Apparently the introduction of Bills is only for the purpose of finding an opportunity for that double dissolution; and, with that idea in his mind, the honourable gentleman proposes an alteration of the electoral law. Dnder such circumstances the Government are not justified in interfering with the Electoral Act, except on points regarding which there would be practical unanimity in the House.

581,Mr Webster,"I want another opof serious importance to the electors. Isi t intended to abolish grievance day entirely ? MrJ . H . CATTS (Cook) [11.21] Last year the Prime Minister paid a visit to tlie town which gave him political birth. I refer to Lithgow, in New South Wales, where he spoke on the 10th June, in the Oddfellows H a l l . On that occasion, he said, as reported in the Lithgow Mercury of 12th June, 1912He believed in having his own opinion, and would not allow any caucus to think for him, or to come between him and his constituents. He had not altered his position; the others had done the jumping round, and now imagined he had. I wish to place that statement upon record. in the district which first returned him to Parliament as a Labour representative, and he was there explaining that he had not altered his democratic opinions. It is a matter of some importance, particularly at this juncture. In connection with the little incident that the Prime Minister endeavoured to magn if y just now, I desire to say that when the Acting Leader of the Oppositiou desired to make a statement to the House yesterday afternoon, a very wise course was adopted in insisting that he should first obtain the leave of the House. I wish to point out that if the PrimeM in isber had adopted my suggestion to secure that leave, there would have been no objection by honourable members upon this side to his making a statement.

I repeat that no objection would have been offered by honourable members on this side of the Chamberi f he had first sought to obtain the leave of the House. dramatic fashion and endeavoured to make it appear to the press and people of this country that we did not desire him to speak at all. That was not the case. We merely desired to have the Standing Orders strictly obeyed. The PrimeM in ister's understudy has now obtained leave to introduce an amending Electoral B ill . He has stated that he is bursting with a desire to give information in respect to that B ill . There is nobody in this House who is better acquainted with the Standing Orders than he is, and he knows that under those Orders the motion for the first reading of that measure must be taken without debate. He has not given honourable members an opportunity of seeing the B ill to-night; and, consequently, they will not be able to discuss it until it has reached its second-reading Btage. I feel that he has treabed bhe House w it h scant courtesy in this matter. We are all greatly interested in electoral matters. knows that the discussion has not been serious. be withdrawn. offensive, I ask that it be withdrawn. for Kalgoorlie considers it offensive, I withdraw it . offensive to me, because I did not participate in the discussion, but it is offensive to members on this side. Can the Minister give any reason why honourable members should not be in a, position tomorrow bo read bhe Electoral B ill . That would have been possible had he presented the B ill which he got leave to in troduce, and moved the first reading, which would have been taken without debate. There seems to be aii anxiety on the part of honourable members to leave the chamber, and if it is intended to count me out, I shall continue my remarks on questions , of public importance until that is done. three members preseut on the Opposition benches. upon to keep a quorum. quorum. But, instead, he sat down in a advanbage of honourable members, bub if bhey are leaving blie chamber to counb me oub, I shall continue to discuss public affairs until that is done. I had practically finished when an obvious rush to the doors began. I hope that my remarks will be seriously considered. Had bhe Electoral B ill been read a first time, we could study it to-morrow afternoon, when private busiuess w ill be under discussion. That advantage has been denied to us.
