Thursday, 3 March 2011 ----Kooyong Electorate: Boroondara Citizen of the Year Awards natural disasters earlier this year and the spirit of those who have committed themselves to the clean-up and rebuilding program demonstrates what the people and communities throughout our nation can achieve when united. So, too, on a local level in my electorate of Kooyong, the Australian spirit of volunteerism is alive and well, as displayed by those recently awarded 2011 Citizenship of the Year Awards by the council of Boroondara. The title of Boroondara Citizen of the Year went to Norman Gale. Boroondara’s Young Citizen of the Year is Daniel Cronin and the Outstanding Community Service award winner is Robert Pettit. Norman Gale is an active, well-known and respected leader within the Boroondara area and is currently the Community Services Director at the Camberwell branch of the Salvation Army. The Camberwell branch does much good work in our community, particularly with our youth, and I acknowledge its significant contribution. With a commitment to and passion for helping those less fortunate, Norman has developed and participated in an extensive range of community programs and projects, including SecondBite, which provides food for those who would otherwise be without, and numerous Camcare programs, whose new facility, located on St Johns Ave, Camberwell, I visited on its official opening on 10 November last year. Daniel Cronin is a terrific young Australian. Daniel is the co-founder and Chief Executive of the not-for-profit organisation Step Back Think, which aims to reduce alcohol fuelled violence among adolescents and young adults. Daniel witnessed first hand the trauma and suffering inflicted through alcohol fuelled violence when his close friend James McCready-Bryan was the victim of a brutal and violent alcohol fuelled attack in 2006. James was knocked to the ground with a single punch. With James’s head making contact with the pavement, the resulting medical diagnosis was significant brain damage from which James will never fully recover. Daniel’s passionate advocacy in working to reduce alcohol fuelled violence has seen him take part in education and peer awareness campaigns discussing the implications of youth participation in violent behaviour induced by the consumption of alcohol. I have got to know Daniel well over the last few years and have the utmost admiration for his commitment to helping his fellow citizens. Robert Pettit is a passionate coach and committee member at Ashburton United Soccer Club. While the soccer club’s home ground sits just outside my electorate, many members of the Kooyong community play at and support Robert’s club. Although Robert has been a long term soccer enthusiast, he first became involved with the club when his children joined. I congratulate all three participants on being recognised for their significant contributions to our Boroondara community. I also acknowledge the support of the Boroondara council and the mayor, Nicholas Tragas, as well as our local paper, the Progress Leader, for publicising these awards. The winners follow in the footsteps of many distinguished former recipients. (Time expired) MAIN COMMITTEE",118,Adjournment Zappia A

267,Mr Frydenberg (Kooyong) (9.39 Am),"The resilience of those hit by the devastatingOrgan Donation would like to talk to the House today about what is a vitally important issue, an issue which is about an act of goodwill, pure and simple, that saves lives and which every one of us has the potential to participate in. That issue is organ donation. In Australia, at any one time around 1,700 people are on the organ and tissue transplant waiting list waiting for what is, for them, the gift of life. We can be justifiably proud of our transplant success rate in Australia, but unfortunately we also have one of the lowest donation rates in the world. So, in that context, I was particularly pleased to learn that in my community of Geelong the rate of registered donors is very high. In fact, according to the Australian Organ Donor Register, the City of Greater Geelong has the highest number of registered organ donors of any local government area in Victoria. Greater Geelong is home to 44,323 registered organ donors, which is more than a quarter of the local population and well above the number of registered donors in other local government areas. The next closest are Mornington Peninsula, with 29,500 registered donors, and Yarra Ranges, with just under 27,000 registered donors. These figures show that Geelong families are generous in spirit and happy to help others in need-in this case, the many hundreds of people waiting for life-saving surgery and the chance to lead a happy and healthy life. I did not know this, but one organ donor can save up to 10 lives. Of course, organ donation is not an easy subject to discuss and the decision to register as a donor is not made lightly. But, for a family dealing with the traumatic experience of a sudden and unexpected death in the family, there can be greater comfort in knowing that their loved one has made this decision for them. In highlighting the wonderful response from those people living in the city of greater Geelong, this is also a good opportunity to urge other people who have not registered as organ donors to consider adding their own names to the list. We know, for example, men in bluecollar jobs are the most common Australian organ donors. The median age of donors is 48. Nearly half the deaths of organ donors are from heart failure. Road trauma accounts for 13 per cent of donor deaths. There is enormous tragedy in the death of an organ donor, but through the act of organ donation there can be a small but wonderful other side to that tragedy, and that of course is the gift of life. I am pleased to say that so many people in the city of Geelong have given this issue some thought and made a very conscious decision to give this very generous gift of life. Macquarie Electorate: NSW Rural Fire Service cal Rural Fire Service brigades in the electorate of Macquarie who, through their diligence and hard work, prevented what could have been another natural disaster earlier this year. On Saturday, 5 February, a fire broke out on a private property in the Megalong Valley region of the Blue Mountains. That particular Saturday entered the history books, courtesy of a weeklong heatwave that saw temperatures in the greater Western Sydney pass 40 degrees Celsius. The unseasonably wet start to summer had prevented the traditional back-burning of key bushlands and, when combined with the high humidity, created a dangerous level of ‘natural fuel’ for potential fires.

268,Mr Marles (Corio,Parliamentary Secretary for Pacific Island Affairs) (9.43 am)-I,121,Constituency Statements
269,Mrs Markus (Macquarie) (9.45 Am),"TodayI rise to acknowledge the deeds of our loAt Narrow Neck, some 15 kilometres south of Katoomba, Anthony Hardy was on duty in the fire tower. At approximately 11.35 am, Anthony Hardy raised the alarm that a fire had broken out in the Megalong Valley. The significance of Anthony Hardy’s actions on the morning of 5 February is that it was approximately another 15 minutes before triple zero had received a call alerting authorities to the fire and the related dangers. The extra 15 minutes, together with the expeditiousness of the local rural fire brigades, prevented a potential catastrophe as the heatwave conditions of that week had created a dangerous environment of natural fuel, which potentially could have seen the fire quickly spread from the valley to the escarpment, destroying hundreds of hectares of World Heritage listed Blue Mountains and threatening the lives and property of people living in the region. On behalf of the people of Macquarie, I offer our sincere thanks for the alertness and actions of Anthony Hardy and the efforts of the men and women of the Rural Fire Service brigades who brought the fire under control. Those brigades deserve a special mention: the Megalong Valley, Shipley, Blackheath, Katoomba-Leura, Medlow Bath and South Katoomba brigades. I would also like to mention the brigades from Hartley and Kanimbla, who assisted in bringing the fire under control. The circumstances surrounding the fire are still under investigation by authorities, but I can advise that Rod Walker, Operations Support Officer and Acting Inspector for the Blue Mountains District Rural Fire Service, and Inspector Paul McGrath, their support team and the brigades involved did an outstanding job, limiting the damages to four hectares, with no loss of personal property and, most importantly, no loss of life. There is absolutely no doubt in my mind that the efforts of all involved saved the residents of the Blue Mountains from, potentially, a natural disaster. On their behalf, I say a huge thankyou. La Trobe Electorate: Dandenong Ranges Ms SMYTH (La Trobe) (9.48 am)-I am very fortunate to have much of the Dandenong Ranges in my electorate-from Upwey to Mount Dandenong, from Sassafras to Menzies Creek, from Belgrave to Nangana, through Emerald, Cockatoo and Gembrook, and into the foothills. It really is a delightful place. It is an area of rich environmental value which requires ongoing assistance to ensure that its biodiversity can be preserved. It needs support to ensure that existing species of wildlife and vegetation are able to flourish. The federal government’s Caring for our Country initiative has recently provided funding for five local community groups in La Trobe to support conservation of our local landscape. Those have included the Knox Environment Society; Friends of Glenfern Valley Bushlands; the VFF Farm, Tree and Landcare Association, in Emerald and Pakenham; and Cardinia Catchment Landcare Group. A number of those grants will enable the better preservation of parts of the Dandenong Ranges and the surrounding foothills. Having caught up with several landcare groups recently, I certainly know that those grants were very well received indeed. I also appreciate that there is still much more that needs to be done in order to preserve the environmental value of the Dandenongs. The health of the Australian landscape depends in large part on the work of volunteers and community groups carrying out revegetation and weed removal, controlling pest animals, carrying out extensive tree planning and monitoring those local indicator species that reflect the health of our environment. I also know that the single most significant thing that we can do to preserve our environment and that I as a representative in this place can do is take meaningful and quick action to cut national carbon emissions and address the effects of climate change. MAIN COMMITTEE The Dandenong Ranges are exposed to the risks of extreme weather events, and bushfire risks are foremost in the minds of all of us in the region. The science of climate change tells us that we can expect a greater incidence of extreme weather events if we do not take meaningful and swift action to curb carbon emissions. I accept the findings of that science. I accept the reality of climate change and that unchecked carbon pollution will create extraordinary risks and have a deleterious impact on our environment and our way of life. I believe that any party which has designs on being the government cannot ignore that science. We need to act now. The consequences of a failure to act are not only a matter of national interest; they are of very particular local interest to those who live in an especially vulnerable part of my own electorate. Bradfield Electorate: Hornsby Ku-ring-gai Hospital ring-gai Hospital, which is the major public hospital in my electorate of Bradfield. For many years, Hornsby hospital has been grievously neglected by the New South Wales state Labor government. This is a major hospital serving a large part of the northern area of Sydney, but it is in very poor physical condition. I have had the opportunity to visit the hospital on a number of occasions and I have seen for myself the operating theatres which have very inadequate electrical wiring that is not suitable for modern equipment. I have seen for myself the open passageways running between wards and the operating theatres through which patients have to be wheeled at any time of the day or night, no matter how cold it may be. I have seen for myself the evidence of damage from possums and I have seen for myself the poor state of the wards. It is an inadequate physical facility in which the doctors, the nurses and the staff do a terrific job. It is widely accepted that Hornsby hospital needs to be rebuilt but, for 15 years there has been very little good news on this front. I am therefore particularly pleased to be able to congratulate the New South Wales shadow minister for health, Jillian Skinner, and the Liberal candidate for the state seat of Hornsby, Matt Kean, on the recent announcement that an incoming O’Farrell government would commit to spending $50 million towards the upgrade of Hornsby hospital. This will not finish the job but it will be a very important start on the project of rebuilding Hornsby hospital. I want to congratulate and acknowledge Dr Richard Harris, the chair of the medical staff council, and his colleague Dr Pip Middleton, amongst others, who have been advocates for improving the physical condition of Hornsby hospital for many years. For 15 years we have seen a sorry tale of neglect of the needs of Hornsby hospital by the New South Wales state Labor government, but it is very pleasing indeed that there is now a clear commitment by an incoming O’Farrell government to spend $50 million to improve Hornsby hospital. I am particularly pleased to note the words of the shadow minister for health, Jillian Skinner, that this would be part of a staged redevelopment. Let me congratulate the Liberal candidate for Hornsby, Mr Matt Kean, on his work in securing this important commitment of $50 million for Hornsby hospital. Greenway Electorate: Clean Up Australia Day Ms ROWLAND (Greenway) (9.54 am)-TodayI rise to talk about the very important Clean Up Australia Day campaign that will be operating throughout Australia-and, of course, my electorate-on 6 March.

270,Mr Fletcher (Bradfield) (9.51 Am),"I rise to speak about the matter of Hornsby Kupeople to get outside and do their bit for the environment. Whilst being the perfect occasion on which to contribute to keeping our local areas looking beautiful, it is also a great time to get outdoors and interact with our communities. Over its 21-year history, volunteers have transformed the nation on Clean Up Australia Day. In total, they have devoted more than 24 million hours to helping the environment by removing over 237,500 tonnes of rubbish. With almost 7,000 sites registered for this Sunday, I am sure Clean Up Australia Day will continue to be a great day of environmental action. In my electorate of Greenway, there are scores of Clean Up Australia Day sites at which people can join in and help the clean-up effort. This Sunday, I have the pleasure of rolling up my sleeves with two very important community groups in my electorate. In the morning I will be joining the Glenwood Community Association in cleaning up a site in Glenwood. I am extremely grateful for the valuable contribution this association makes to the Greenway community, and I am looking forward to helping them keep Glenwood beautiful. Through its hard work and that of its president, Bob McKay, this association does a great job in advocating for its residents and the many local volunteers who are helping to make my home suburb a better place to live and raise a family. I also wish to acknowledge Blacktown City Council, which has also been acknowledged by the president for its role in ensuring that Clean Up Australia Day will be a great success in Glenwood this year. In the afternoon I will be joining the Australian Tamil Association in cleaning up Best Road Reserve in Seven Hills. This is another great opportunity to catch up with some of my friends from the Tamil community and lend a hand in my home town. This is the second year the Australian Tamil Association has taken part on the day. It is another great example of their community spirit and untiring hard work. I wish to particularly thank the president of the Australian Tamil Association, Thiru Arumugam, who is very focused on his association taking an active role in such community events. The success of Clean Up Australia Day has relied on a unique and simple idea: that individual Australians can make a difference and can contribute to improving the Australian environment by working together as a community, and I have no doubt that the community in Greenway will come together to do the same this year. It is a great environmental initiative and one that has reaped enormous benefits for Australians. It is a display of environmental action but also, very importantly, a display of the power of volunteering. This country has a proud history of volunteering and the day is a fantastic advertisement of that. As this year marks the 10th anniversary of the International Year of the Volunteer, Clean Up Australia Day is a perfect time to mark that occasion. Earlier this year, a report released by the Minister for Social Inclusion found that volunteering was increasingly trending towards young people, and I would love to see that trend reflected during Clean Up Australia Day this year. Moncrieff Electorate: Allconnex Water local constituents in my electorate of Moncrieff and more broadly across the Gold Coast. In particular, I am talking about the water charges that are being now levied upon Gold Coasters by Allconnex. Allconnex is of course the new monolith that has been created by the Queensland state Labor government. MAIN COMMITTEE",123,Constituency Statements
271,Mr Ciobo (Moncrieff) (9.57 Am),"I rise to speak about an issue of significant concern toThis Labor government completely stuffed South-East Queensland’s water supply as a result of many long years of Labor being in power and not planning adequately. We had a period of drought, to which the Labor Party responded with the ill-conceived, knee-jerk reaction of building a billion-dollar desalination plant. Then we had, unfortunately, all that terrible rain in January which-whilst it was amazingly good rain for the region-was, frankly, a little too much, and we unfortunately also saw the loss of life. To now compound the problem, we have Allconnex, established by the state Labor government, which has foisted upon the people of my constituency and more broadly the Gold Coast an increase in their water charges of some 20 per cent. The reason that this is of particular concern to me is not only that this is a creature of the state Labor government but also because this highlights, because of who Allconnex’s shareholders are, the inherent problem with the structure. Allconnex’s current shareholders are the respective city councils and councils in the South-East Queensland area-Gold Coast city councillors among them. What we see now is that there is a record grab from Allconnex, going back, in the form of a dividend, to those council shareholders. This concerns me because it goes to the core of one of the fundamental problems with the Gold Coast City Council. There are some councillors who stand up very strongly for their ratepayers and have been arguing that these charges have been too high. But it is my very fervent belief that, unless the Gold Coast City Council is politicised, unless we have, effectively, a government and an opposition within the council, and unless there are councillors who are willing to hold the government of the day accountable within the Gold Coast City Council, we will see this kind of outrageous rorting and ripping off of ratepayers by Allconnex which is allowed to go through unimpeded because it is effectively being done by a state government utility. Now, the funds all go back to the council, and it is high time that councils realised that slugging people an extra 20 per cent for their water at this point in time-when people are already feeling the stress and strain of the very high unemployment rate on the Gold Coast and rapidly escalating cost of living, with increasing prices, from fresh fruit to other things, for a whole bunch of reasons-is the last thing, frankly, that our city needs, and that is why it should not be happening. (Time expired) Deakin Electorate: Primary Schools for the 21st Century opening of the $2½ million Primary Schools for the 21st Century project at St James Primary School in the suburb of Vermont, on 20 February this year. St James is located within the new boundaries of Deakin, following last year’s Victorian redistribution by the Australian Electoral Commission. It was my first opportunity to visit the school, which is located just south of Canterbury Road. Late last year, I also opened a new two-storey classroom refurbishment at St James’s sister school-that is, St John the Evangelist School in Mitcham. It is great to see both these local Catholic primary schools having major upgrades and new buildings delivered under the Primary Schools for the 21st Century program and under the National School Pride Program as well. I was given a tour of the new projects by the principal, Andrew Mullaly, and the school captains, Stephanie Prigg, Jamila Wynn, Joshua Drake and Thomas Arrowsmith.

Under the National School Pride Program, the school refurbished three classrooms; installed new interactive whiteboards in all their classrooms-except for a couple, but they went and raised a few dollars for them and they now have them in all; upgraded their toilet facilities; provided a new, external covered learning area; and repainted lots of the internal parts of the school. The new library and resource centre and multimedia lab with computers was also delivered under the National School Pride Program. It is a nice, modern-looking space in what was quite an old building. All up, between the P21 and National School Pride programs, $2.65 million has been invested in the school, and the projects are a truly great addition to the school community. The school has been on site since 1970 and was well in need of an update, so it is great to see it now has that. I thank the Catholic Education Office for overseeing the federal funds and delivering a great result, along with the architects, Crosier Scott, Circon Constructions and all the subcontractors and other people involved in the job. This particular project at various times employed up to 130 people in the local area, which is a great thing for Melbourne, especially for those who are involved in the construction industry. St James Primary is a growing school, with over 300 students attending this year and many more waiting to come, as the area is growing. It is an area that families move to, and we are getting more and more children at all our primary schools. That is a fantastic result compared to what was happening only a decade ago, when many schools in the area were closing due to a lack of numbers. I congratulate the school community at St James on turning great plans into a reality for the students of today and the future. (Time expired) Medicines Australia cines Australia’s parliamentary dinner. Medicines Australia are a peak industry group representing Australia’s innovative medicine sector. Their membership includes over 80 per cent of the prescription pharmaceuticals market and has a specific focus on research and development leading to the manufacture and supply of a huge range of prescription medicines. More than half of our nation’s pharmaceutical companies are located at Macquarie business park, colloquially known as ‘Pill Hill’, in the electorate of Bennelong that I represent. The pharmaceutical industry is a major player in Australia, selling over $11 billion worth of medicines domestically and approximately $4 billion in exports. Medicines Australia’s member companies provide direct employment to over 14,000 people in Australia. As a result, the health of this industry is strongly integrated into the health of our nation’s economy. Despite this, the primary focus of last night’s event was the essential role that Medicines Australia plays in the health of the people, as without our health no other endeavour or personal goal is of major significance. Last night’s event was hosted by CEO Brendan Shaw and Chairman Will Delaat, who cis Gurry, Director General of the World Intellectual Property Organisation and the most senior Australian working in the United Nations. Dr Gurry spoke with clarity and insight about the strong bridge between pharmaceuticals, research and development, and intellectual property.

I also must register my strong discontent with the Gillard government’s unprecedented cabinet decision to overrule recommendations by the pharmaceutical benefits advisory board. The established approval process provides certainty and stability in this important industry, and the government’s decision has caused significant damage and uncertainty. I wish to congratulate Will, Brendan and those at Medicines Australia for hosting an informative and impressive evening, which is a strong reflection of the quality job they do in representing their member companies. As the federal member for Bennelong, covering ‘Pill Hill’, I believe that Medicines Australia is well aware of my commitment to providing strong representation for this industry. (Time expired) Bass Electorate: Building the Education Revolution Program bished facilities that I have in my electorate of Bass, all because of the Labor government’s investment in school infrastructure through the Building the Education Revolution program. The Labor government has committed to the biggest investment in our schools in Australian history. Every school across the nation has benefited from this long-overdue infrastructure investment. The aim of Building of the Education Revolution was to save jobs, and provide infrastructure for our future and for our children, during the global financial crisis. This program is delivering vital infrastructure to school communities and is supporting communities by providing employment. A number of end-of-school assemblies and functions I attended were in lovely new halls and buildings, courtesy of the Building the Education Revolution program and other Labor government programs. These programs have benefited students and also wider communities. The new infrastructure provides a venue that can be used both inside and outside school buildings. When I was on the Parents and Friends at Riverside Primary School, we built a small hall that was never able to cater for the entire population of the school. Now they have a new school hall which is fantastic. Since becoming the member for BassI have visited and witnessed first hand a number of new facilities, and the look of delight on students’ and parents’ faces when they enter these buildings is fantastic. Some of these schools have not had any money spent on them for decades, and they are thrilled to now have the infrastructure they deserve. Schools that I have visited since becoming the federal member for Bass and that have received funding include: Ravenswood Heights Primary School, over $2 million; Ringarooma Primary School, and the Launceston Christian School, over $3 million; Port Dalrymple School, over $2 million; and Mowbray Heights Primary School, $3.2 million. The John Calvin School and the Trevallyn Primary School have now created inspirational learning spaces.

These facilities are assisting in giving our children, as every child should have, the rights to a good education and to reach their full potential. Those opposite me have for many years neglected school infrastructure, and yet they had the nerve to vote against and oppose every step of the way the program that has allowed these schools to have the infrastructure that students and school communities so richly deserve. They should be ashamed of themselves. I would like to express my strong support for the Building the Education Revolution program. The results say it all: it is an investment in our future and the future of our children and our children’s children. der 193 the time for members’ constituency statements has concluded. Second Reading Debate resumed from 17 November 2010, on motion by Mr Garrett: That this bill be now read a second time. ing the Australian Research Council Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2010. This is a bill to amend the ARC Act to alter its administered funding arrangements. Given that this is the pretext for this debate, we are happy to accept and support the government’s actions in bringing these amendments to the House. We acknowledge and respect that this bill is not about changing the substance of the act itself. The Australian Research Council has played a long and central role in helping to ensure the excellence of our country’s research, including at a global level. The coalition has long recognised the value and importance of government funding for that very high quality research, including by providing the ARC with significant increases in funding during the life of the Howard government, especially through the $5.3 billion Backing Australia’s Ability package. So the government is correct on this occasion in introducing this legislationMr Craig Thomson interjectingMs Hall interjectingside-to ensure that the ARC continues to receive an appropriate level of administered funding to support its activities. I commend the bill to the House. speak to a bill that is actually being supported by the opposition. We are used to the no, no, no from the other side, the negative rants that come out of there. I am shocked-we have a bill, the Australian Research Council Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2010, which they are actually supporting! Gosh, this is a red letter day. What makes it even more of a red letter day is that it is about investing in education. The former government had an abysmal record in relation to education, both higher education and school education. The best thing the opposition did when they were in government, the big issue that they are very proud of, was putting flagpoles in schools. That is the crowning glory in their contribution to education over 13 years in government. MAIN COMMITTEE",127,Constituency Statements

279,Mr Craig Thomson (Dobell) (10.11 Am),"It is almost unique in this parliament todid to education. What we saw under your government was that investment in tertiary education went backwards. remarks through the chair. ous government was a decline in investment in education. We were ranked last in the OECD in terms of the investments in education that occurred during the Howard government. They have a very, very sorry track record. That is what makes today such a red letter day. They have decided at last-and let us hope they do this in relation to the NBN and the carbon tax, because they do not have policies; I hope this is a change-to get out of the way and let us get on and do the job that governments do. I am very, very pleased that this bill is being supported. The bill updates the special appropriation fund cap administered by the Australian Research Council to include indexation adjustments and an additional forward estimate for existing schemes within the National Competitive Grants Program. Indexation adjustments and adding of forward estimates are part of the standard budget process and are administrative in nature. The bill only alters or creates appropriations. The Australian Research Council Act 2001 is the source for administered funding which enables the Australian Research Council to provide funding to underpin high-quality Australian research, which is both fundamental and critical to the Australian national innovation system. All universities, including the Central Coast campus of the University of Newcastlewhich is in my region, a region that I share with the member for Shortland, who is here-are eligible to apply for funding under the National Competitive Grants Program. We would not have a university campus on the Central Coast if it were not for a Labor government. The former member for Dobell, Michael Lee, was successful in securing funding so that kids on the Central Coast would not have to travel up to Newcastle or down to Sydney for their higher education because we would have that campus. It is a wonderful campus that is expanding in size every year. It is one of the most successful and innovative campuses in Australia. In fact, the Bradley report came out and there were recommendations in relation to the way higher education should be done, being integrated with TAFE and community colleges, and that is precisely the model that we have on the Central Coast. The Pro-Vice-Chancellor who looks after the Central Coast, Professor Stephen Crump, should be congratulated for the development of that campus and the role that he has played in terms of that. University campuses and investments in education are very important to the people on the Central Coast because they have not always had these resources. It has only ever been Labor governments that have turned their minds to looking after the people on the Central Coast. We still have some problems in education and need continuing investment in what is there. Less than 40 per cent of the kids on the Central Coast actually complete year 12. We are talking about raising national benchmarks to 90 per cent. We are still at half the current national benchmarks of 80 per cent. So you can see that it is a region that, at the high school level, MAIN COMMITTEE",128,Australian Research Council Amendment Bill No 2 2010

283,Mr Craig Thomson,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. What we saw under the previneeds particular investment. It also needs it at the university level. We have this great campus that is now attracting more and more kids and fewer of them have to go to Sydney. One of the problems with going to Sydney is that they often drop out because of the difficulties with the four-hour round trip every day. In my electorate we still have the second lowest number of people who go on to get degrees. We have difficulties in retention at year 12 and in terms of people going on to get their degrees. The Central Coast campus of the University of Newcastle has terrific programs, including Next Steps, which is a program for kids who did not quite have the marks to get into university. They can come to the campus and do courses. If they are successful in doing that, those courses are converted to their first year of university. That has been a great bridge in an area that has struggled to have these facilities for children to go through and get the training they need to get jobs. These programs have been absolutely fantastic. The Ourimbah Campus has a new exercise science building, which is a fantastic project that this government has funded. It will provide three special teaching spaces and laboratories for exercise and sports programs. The Central Coast has a very strong sporting culture. We are home to the Central Coast Mariners. I take this opportunity to wish them all the best in their game on Saturday. I am sure it will not be their last game of the year. I am sure that they will have some success over the member for Moncrieff’s team, Gold Coast United, and go on to meet Brisbane Roar in the grand final. I think it is only fitting that that actually happens. We have a very strong sporting culture. The university, as part of that culture, has developed specialist expertise in exercise science, which plays a great role for us on the Central Coast. That is one of the areas that they work on. Work is well underway on extensions to the campus library. It will soon be bigger and will be a great facility for students, staff and lecturers. It is worth mentioning, while we are talking about the Central Coast campus of the University of Newcastle, that the fine member for Robertson was a lecturer at this esteemed campus until she won the election last year. This is an area that is close to all three federal MPs who come from the Central Coast. The project to open up the library to the quadrangle will promote greater activity in the area. It will relocate the information common area and that will mean it is more accessible. There will also be a boost to the campus’s research capabilities, which is important. The investment needs to continue in one of the fastest growing campuses in Australia. We know Australia is a clever country and now, thanks to this Labor government and the Excellence in Research for Australia initiative, for the first time we can see exactly how our country’s research efforts compare to the rest of the world. The first full ERA evaluation, its 2010 national report, showed us that we have a large number of research strengths and that we should be proud of this. It showed that our performance in areas like history, immunology and quantum physics is truly outstanding. The Minister for Innovation, Industry, Science and Research, Senator Kim Carr, observed: … when it comes to funding quality research it is important the Australian Government fully understands Australia’s strengths and weaknesses. The Australian Government invests billions of dollars in research each year. ERA gives the Australian taxpayer assurance that their money is being invested wisely and gives the Government a clear idea of the research areas we need to focus on for improvement and continued excellence. MAIN COMMITTEE The report also showed that we need to do better in some areas. The evidence the ERA evaluation gave us is helping us to find ways to improve. Earlier this month the government announced the establishment of the Gillard Labor government’s Australian Research Integrity Committee. Australian taxpayers can now be more confident that the research activities that they fund meet the highest ethical and moral standards. The establishment of the committee reinforces the importance of upholding Australia’s science and research reputation in ensuring public research funding is used appropriately. The government recognises that Australian researchers and research institutes are among the best and most respected in the world. We proudly invest billions of dollars in research each year. However, the government’s reputation must be protected and our investment must be ethical. That is why the government takes allegations of misconduct very seriously. We expect all allegations to be investigated thoroughly. The taxpayer deserves nothing less. The committee can be asked to investigate if it believes an institute has not taken appropriate action in their internal investigations into alleged research misconduct. This bill will apply indexation to existing appropriation amounts in the act and add an additional out year for the financial forward estimates. Indexation adjustments and adding a forward estimate are part of the standard budget process and are administrative in nature. In the time that I have available I would like to talk a bit about the grants program. The Australian Research Council Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2010 provides additional funding for the council as part of the standard budget process. This is important legislation to ensure the ARC can continue to support high-quality research in Australia. Through the National Competitive Grants Program, the Australian Research Council supports the highest quality fundamental and applied research training through national competition. The ARC funds research and researchers under the National Competitive Grants Program. As part of its commitment to nurturing creative abilities and skills of Australia’s most promising researchers, the NCGP provides support for the highest quality research leading to the discovery of new ideas and the advancement of knowledge; financial assistance towards facilities and equipment that researchers need to be internationally competitive in; support for the training and skill development of the next generation of researchers; and incentives for Australia’s most talented researchers to work in partnership with leading researchers throughout national innovation systems and internationally and to form alliances with Australian businesses. The NCGP comprises two main elements: Discovery and Linkage, under which the ARC funds a range of complementary schemes to support researchers at different stages of their careers, build Australia’s research capability, expand and enhance research networks and collaborations, and develop centres of research excellence. A major component of Linkage is the ARC Centres scheme, which brings together leading researchers from around the world to work collaboratively on specific research problems. The ARC Centre’s scheme is administered independently of the other components of Discovery and Linkage. As I noted at the start of my contribution, this is an important bill. It is a great pleasure that we at last have a bill that is supported by the opposition. We are hoping that this is a change in trend and that we are now going to see a more positive opposition-though I am not holding my breath. It has been a very unusual feature to see them make any positive contributions to MAIN COMMITTEE any national infrastructure issues or national policies that further develop Australia’s interests. Given their extremely poor record in government in relation to education it is somewhat of a surprise that we find them supporting any government legislation. But we do welcome this support-it is something that should be given bipartisan support. Let us hope that they can come to the party in relation to the other big issues that we are also debating in terms of carbon tax, the future of our planet, and the NBN-some of the big, major infrastructure issues. We need to be able to take a bipartisan view in relation to these issues so that the Australian people get the best they can out of this parliament rather than the continual negative ‘No, no, no’ that we see every day from the opposition. It was refreshing today to hear the opposition support our bill. I commend this bill to the House. In particular, Australia has a proud history of delivering world-leading innovations, inventions and cutting-edge technology. From the Hills hoist, Victa lawnmower and Cochlear implant to the black box, Australian research has set high standards in improving lives all over the world. Our researchers are of exceptional calibre, and change lives for the better. By providing the government with advice on research matters, and administering programs such as the National Competitive Grants Program and the Excellence in Research for Australia initiative, the Australian Research Council plays a vital role in the development of research in Australia. The ARC also provides Australian researchers across all disciplines with international benchmarks with which to measure themselves, promoting excellence in research through providing both domestic and international standards for comparison. My electorate of Ryan is home to the University of Queensland, one of Australia’s Group of Eight research intensive universities. The University of Queensland consistently ranks well above world standards across the board with respect to research. The University of Queensland is host to the Diamantina Institute, directed by Professor Ian Frazer. As we all know, Professor Frazer, a local resident, was Australian of the Year in 2006 for creating the world’s first preventative cancer vaccine-the HPV vaccine against cervical cancer. The HPV vaccine began to be administered in Australia in 2006 under the common name of Gardasil. It has changed the lives of girls and women around the world, and indeed changed the future of the Australian health industry with the virtual elimination of an entire strain of cancer. This development, which will not only achieve huge savings for the health industry in Australia but also, importantly, prevent the pain and stress families may have otherwise suffered through a fight against cervical cancer, is truly invaluable. I would also like to take this opportunity to congratulate Professor Frazer on his recent appointment as chief executive of the new $345 million Translational Research Institute, which will be the only one of its kind in the Southern Hemisphere, able to research, trial treatments, and manufacture drugs all in the one location. Professor Frazer’s work on the HPV vaccine dates back to 1989-almost 20 years before it was widely administered. This in itself shows the importance of continued funding of research. Ensuring that funding of the Australian Research Council is, at the very least, indexed in accordance with inflation is an important part of ensuring that our Australian research community is not short-changed. These projects take time-years and decades-but they change lives forever. MAIN COMMITTEE",129,Australian Research Council Amendment Bill No 2 2010
284,Mrs Prentice (Ryan) (10.25 Am),"Research is of fundamental importance to society.Another researcher in my electorate who is changing lives is Professor Mark Kendall. Professor Kendall is a researcher with the Australian Institute of Bioengineering and Nanotechnology, also based at the University of Queensland. Professor Kendall and the AIBN are currently developing a needle-free vaccination, focusing on the delivery of biomolecular stimuli to cells in the skin using physical methods. On a recent tour of the institute, researchers showed me a device the size of a fingernail that has the power to administer vaccinations without the use of a syringe. The device-a micronanoprojection array patch-is a patch with thousands of tiny projections, invisible to the naked eye, that are covered in biomolecules. When placed against the skin, these projections deliver the biomolecules precisely through to the target cells. How remarkable is that! Imagine the difference such a breakthrough will have in developing countries. Tragically, at the moment 14 million people around the world die annually from infectious diseases, many of which can be prevented by vaccination. With the development of a micronanoprojection array patch so many current barriers to mass vaccination could be simply eliminated. Barriers such as climate control, transportation, fragility of the syringes, the simple size of a vaccination device, needle-stick injuries, ease of administration and even needle phobia could all be eliminated. Imagine a world where, if a swine flu epidemic breaks out, health administrators can send a vaccination out in the post. This world is not too far away as a result of world leading research in Australia, indeed in Ryan. To achieve this world, researchers need access to generous funding and funding needs to be managed. That is the Australian Research Council’s role. I am also privileged to have living in my electorate the President-elect of the Australian Society for Medical Research, Dr Paul Dawson. The Australian Society for Medical Research is one of the nation’s peak professional bodies, representing approximately 160,000 researchers around Australia. I recently met with Dr Dawson to discuss the issues that he regarded as most important to his industry. Funding was his top priority. As Dr Dawson rightly pointed out, Australia is faced with an ageing population. With an ageing population comes increased costs and burdens on our health industry that this government and state Labor governments around the country are clearly already struggling to manage. Continued support for research is as vital as it is valuable. The Australian Society for Medical Research estimates that for every dollar invested in research and development, an average of $2.17 of health benefits is returned-more than double-with a minimum of 57c and a maximum of up to $6. It would also be remiss of me whilst discussing the Australian Research Council not to mention the outstanding result achieved by the University of Queensland in the recent Excellence in Research for Australia initiative. The University of Queensland has recorded above world standard results across the board in every field assessed. This has placed the University of Queensland third amongst Australian universities and is clearly a reflection of the outstanding dedication, commitment and hard work being conducted by both those on campus and the specialised research institutes encompassed by the University of Queensland. Additionally, UQ has been confirmed as Australia’s most comprehensive university, being active in 24 out of a possible 25 fields of research. As well as the University of Queensland’s outstanding ERA results, the findings show that Australian universities across the board are achieving significant feats in research. Whilst all of our Group of Eight universities ranked above world standard, it was heartening to note that MAIN COMMITTEE our younger universities are also making inroads into a wide range of disciplines, giving the sector an important layer of diversity. The success of these younger institutions is reflective of the success of their young researchers and lecturers. As noted in the Australian last week, selection committees that hire new lecturers are being impressed by both the quantity and the quality of publications coming from the applicants. As the paper simply puts it: … most lecturers in Australia are more highly accomplished in terms of publications than their forebears … Whilst this is heartening news for the sector and the motion before us today is an important step, in light of the up-and-coming nature of our researchers the question must always be: can we do more? We face a challenge to ensure that future funding streams are sufficient to maintain the momentum behind research institutions which create social and economic dividends for taxpayers, industry partners and investors. These examples are just part of Australian research, yet they alone achieve so much and provide so much positive change in people’s lives around the world. The continued funding of the Australian Research Council, indexed for inflation and forward estimates, is a vital component in Australia continuing to be a world leader in research. I support this amendment. Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2010. The purpose of this bill before the House is to index funding for the Australian Research Council over the next four financial years. It results in additional spending of just over $824 million over those years by adding an additional out year to the forward estimates and by updating the indexation rates. The ARC is a statutory authority within the Australian government’s Innovation, Industry, Science and Research portfolio. Its mission is to deliver policy and programs that advance Australian research and innovation globally and benefit the Australian community as a whole. We all know that research is critical to Australia’s future prosperity. It drives our economic productivity, delivers new solutions to environmental challenges, attracts global investment and improves our social well-being. The ARC builds Australia’s research capabilities by advising the government on research matters and managing the National Competitive Grants Program and has responsibility for the Excellence in Research for Australia Initiative. In the last parliament, I was privileged to be a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Innovation. That committee undertook a report into the sector as part of its work in the 42nd Parliament. The report was titled Building Australia’s research capacity. It followed an inquiry into that area examining key issues to deal with or happening in Australia’s research fields. I believe the work that was done by the standing committee has fed into government policy and new initiatives. It is a good thing for any member of the House involved with a committee to see the work that has been done over a number of months turned into reality, coming through the legislation in this place. The inquiry into research training and research workforce issues examined the needs of researchers at different stages of their careers. The final report identified the clear need for the government to do more to support researchers’ career development. I am pleased to note that many of the recommendations we made at the time have come into being, although there are many more that are still waiting their turn. The ARC has a series of fellowships to support researchers at different stages of their careers, including the Australian Laureate Fellowships, Future Fellowships and Super Science MAIN COMMITTEE",132,Australian Research Council Amendment Bill No 2 2010
285,Mr Symon (Deakin) (10.34 Am),"I speak in support of the Australian Research CouncilFellowships. The ARC fellowships help support researchers. As an example of the research supported by the ARC fellowships, I would like to talk about a research project at the University of Melbourne. Associate Professor William Shieh, from the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, was granted a Future Fellowship to investigate ultrahigh-speed optical transport for sustaining the growth of the internet. This research aims to study novel transport technologies to construct optical backbone networks supporting internet traffic, and the project will help keep Australia at the leading edge of the exciting terabit technologies that are coming up as well as create commercial opportunities within Australia. This Future Fellowship is one example of how we in government have acted to support the careers of Australia’s researchers. Encouraging and supporting research has been a theme of this government since we were elected. Innovative research feeds into the wider economy, delivers highly skilled jobs and supports our local industries. As well as overseeing the fellowship programs, the ARC manages the National Competitive Grants Program, which includes schemes to encourage individual and collaborative research, research infrastructure, equipment and facilities. The National Competitive Grants Program directly funds research programs from around Australia. The ARC manages linkage projects which encourage and develop long-term strategic research alliances between higher education organisations and other organisations, including with industry, in order to apply advanced knowledge to problems that have been identified. The ARC supports centres of excellence, special research centres, co-funded centres and special research initiatives. ARC centres of excellence are hubs of expertise through which highquality researchers maintain and develop Australia’s international standing in research areas of national priority. As an example of a funded centre of excellence, the ARC Centre of Excellence for Ultrahigh Bandwidth Devices for Optical Systems is based at the University of Sydney. This centre will receive $23.8 million over seven years to conduct its cutting-edge research. Another example is the ARC Centre of Excellence for Quantum Computation and Communication Technology, based at the University of New South Wales, which will receive $24.5 million over seven years to continue research. These are just two of the 13 ARC centres of excellence funded by the government. In addition to the ARC centres of excellence, the ARC funds special research centres. These are funded by the ARC on the basis of research excellence and their potential to contribute to the economic, social and cultural development of Australia. Subject to satisfactory performance, the special research centres have been funded for nine years. Currently there are 15 special research centres covering areas as diverse as particulate fluids processing, the subatomic structure of matter and tectonics. The ARC Special Research Initiatives scheme identifies new or emerging areas of research and provides funding for them. In 2009 the Australian Research Council funded a new collaborative research initiative to develop a functional bionic eye. In government, Labor committed $50 million over four years to fund this research. In 2011 the Australian Research Council will fund a new collaborative research initiative under the Special Research Initiatives scheme to support stem cell science. The Australian government has committed funding of to $21 million for a period of up to seven years. The Special Research Initiative in Stem MAIN COMMITTEE Cell Science will fund one or more proposals to deliver a program of activity supporting stem cell research. This is just a snapshot of the initiatives of the ARC and how these initiatives support Australia’s research output. The ARC’s strategic plan for 2010-11 to 2012-13 was released in October last year and provides insight into the direction of the ARC and, therefore, where Australia’s research efforts are heading. Over the period of this strategic plan the ARC will further improve its fellowship schemes by providing more opportunities for female and early career researchers. The ARC will award two additional research fellowships specifically for women to its funding schemes. The two additional fellowships will be awarded each year under the competitive ARC Australian Laureate Fellowships scheme. This scheme aims to attract and retain outstanding researchers and world-class research leaders. The additional fellowships will bring the total to be awarded each year to 17. The ARC will also deliver the new Linkage Research Training Awards scheme during the period 2010-11 to 2012-13. As part of the government’s Clean 21 initiative, the Linkage Research Training Awards scheme will not only create opportunities for our early career researchers but also target a range of industry sectors, with priority given to green industries and new strategies to enable the greening of existing industries. This research will help develop the new and clean industries of the 21st century that Australia needs and put us at the forefront of global efforts. Also during the period 2010-11 to 2012-13 the ARC will identify and promote Australia’s research strengths following the first full Excellence in Research for Australia evaluation. For the first time, the government and all Australians will be able to identify the disciplines within Australian universities that are internationally competitive, as well as the emerging areas where there are opportunities for development and further investment. This will help Australia map out its research specialities and help focus its resources. The ARC continues its responsibility for the National Competitive Grants Program, which is a significant component of Australia’s investment in research and development. This bill will expand the total funding of the ARC and by 2012-13 the funding for the ARC’s various programs will reach $817 million. The dispersal of this spending reveals the extent of the programs and innovation supported by the ARC. Discovery projects will receive nearly $312 million in 2012-13 and this funding will support individual and team research projects in Australia. As part of this funding, the ARC will introduce the new Discovery Early Career Researcher Award in 2012. This scheme will provide more focused support for researchers and create more opportunities for early career researchers in teaching and research positions and in research-only positions. It is anticipated that up to 200 three-year awards of up to $125,000 per annum will be awarded under this scheme. The ARC will also invest substantial funds to support the careers of researchers through its fellowship programs. The Federation and Australian Laureate fellowships will receive $44½ million, $157-odd million will go to Future Fellowships and the Super Science Fellowship will receive just under $7 million. The Future Fellowships scheme offers four-year fellowships of up to $143,000 a year to 1,000 outstanding Australian and international researchers in the middle of their careers. The Super Science Fellowship scheme will offer three-year fellowships of up to $72½ thousand a year plus 28 per cent of on-costs to 100 outstanding Australian and international early career researchers. MAIN COMMITTEE Funding for Linkage Projects will reach $145.9 million in 2012-13. Linkage Projects is the main ARC funding scheme to advance research collaborations with end users. This funding includes: $30 million for infrastructure, equipment and facilities; $94½ million for research centres; and $24½ million for special research initiatives. The ARC plays a central role in building Australia’s research capacity. This increase in funding for ARC activities will fund new initiatives and continue to build on Australia’s research capacity. I commend this bill to the House. Ms BRODTMANN (Canberra) (10.45 am)-The Australian Research Council Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2010 is an appropriation bill to support the ongoing and incredibly valuable research and work of the Australian Research Council. This bill applies indexation against existing schemes and adds the last year to forward estimates. This will add an additional $824 million over four financial years. That said, this bill does not alter the substance of the act or increase departmental funds. The ARC is a statutory authority existing under the Department of Innovation, Industry, Science and Research. Its mission is to deliver policy and programs that advance Australian research and innovation globally and to benefit the Australian community. To achieve its mission the ARC advises the government on research matters and manages the National Competitive Grants Program, which constitutes a significant component of government investment in Australian research and innovation. Many in this chamber will also be aware of the ARC’s role in monitoring the quality of Australian research and ensuring it is hitting the mark internationally. The ARC achieves this through the Excellence in Research for Australia initiative. The ARC has a long history in this country, beginning in 1946 with the establishment of the Commonwealth Universities Research Grants Committee to advise government on the allocation of research grants. Initially, this was an interdepartmental committee under the Department of Education. In 1965 it was more formally established to advise government on the allocation of the Australian Research Grants Scheme, the predecessor of today’s Discovery Grants scheme. In 1966, almost $4 million was received by 406 successful applicants to the scheme. That was a significant amount of money in 1966 terms. In 1988, under the Dawkins reforms of the Keating government, the ARC was established under its current name. In 2001 it was created as a statutory authority and given broader advisory functions and full responsibility for the assessment of grant applications. The grants awarded by the ARC play an essential part in ensuring that Australia develops and attracts the highest quality of research talent from our own country and overseas. It also plays a vitally important role in retaining researchers in Australian institutions. This is particularly important. In addition, the ARC plays a crucial role in supporting the research and innovation that makes Australia the clever country. It is through this funding that Australia has been able to develop key innovations that have a direct impact on the lives of Australians and people across the globe. Innovations such as the bionic ear have their origins in ARC funding. There are many types of grants that the ARC manages. Each type is designed to foster a different kind of outcome and broadly fall under the categories of Discovery Grants and Linkage grants. There are many layers to the onion, as I have discovered in doing the research for this speech. Discovery Grants scheme recognises the importance of fundamental research. The scheme recognises that a strong capability in fundamental research will result in the deMAIN COMMITTEE velopment of new ideas, the creation of jobs, economic growth and an enhanced quality of life for all Australians. Funding under the discovery schemes goes towards developing early career researchers to make sure that Australia has a high-quality and ready pool of local research talent. It also goes to those researchers with a proven track record of results in research. The Future Fellowships scheme under the discovery program promotes research in areas that have been identified as being of critical national importance. This program aims to attract the best mid-career researchers with a proven track record to work on problems important to us all. The Linkage program, as the name suggests, aims to encourage collaborative approaches to research between researchers, business, industry and community organisations. As someone who has been involved in business and also actively involved in industry associations, I can say that I really appreciate this kind of effort. It is really good to get research ideas realised through business and industry. Linkage grants support the transfer of skills and knowledge to provide direct and tangible benefits to Australian society. The ARC awards grants through the Linkage, Infrastructure, Equipment and Facilities scheme. This scheme ensures Australian researchers have the latest and best equipment to further their projects. Institutions in my own community have been successful in achieving some of these grants. The Australian National University, University of Canberra and the CSIRO have all been successful in gaining funding in 2011. Some of the projects that have been funded include over $196,000 for a project at the University of Canberra to investigate how DNA can be better used to identify physical traits and solve crime-very CSI. University of Canberra researchers also received $105,000 to investigate how mistletoe can be used in the treatment of cancer. A further $80,000 went to the University of Canberra to investigate the social and economic impacts of FragileX syndrome and the benefits of early diagnosis. The Australian National University has also been a significant contributor to the nation’s knowledge bank through the ARC. In 2011, $556,000 has been granted to researchers at the ANU to develop materials for a more efficient solar cell. This is an important aim given our current climate challenge, which some opposite deny. The ANU has also been given $330,000 to look at how recent reforms to the Community Development Employment Program have affected the livelihoods of Indigenous Australians. In all, $40 million has been invested in ACT institutions to fund 111 projects to improve our knowledge of the world. This is a significant investment and I commend the ARC for making that investment in Canberra. As I stated earlier, the ARC recently completed its Excellence in Research for Australia 2010 national report. The report was the first comprehensive review of research conducted at Australian institutions. It was an incredibly large and comprehensive piece of work. This review covered 333,000 unique research outputs and 55,000 researchers across eight disciplines. It showed that Australia has many areas of strength where we are the very forefront of global research. In particular, we excelled in the fields of history, immunology, and quantum physics. These were all standout areas. The report also identified gaps and areas where we need to improve. That is the beauty of reports of this nature, of these transparency measures. They highlight our strengths, but they also highlight our weaknesses. The government has undertaken a project to address the identified gaps because of our continued commitment to innovation. MAIN COMMITTEE It has become cliche to attack academics and researchers as being aloof and distant from the problems of the real world. By extension, it is often easy to question government research grants. However, Australia is a small nation and we are a nation that runs a first world economy on what some would call a third world climate. The only way we have been able to survive as a nation is through our investment in research-research into resilient wheat, for example, and a whole range of other things to deal with the climate challenges we face. Our research holds the key to meeting the challenges that we face today from climate change. Our research also holds the key to growing and developing our economy, to healing our sick, to educating our children, to ensuring we all have jobs and a roof over our heads and, particularly, to ensuring we are prosperous in the future. Far from being divorced from the real world, I know from my time at the University of Canberra that academics are serious people, committed people, who are deeply concerned with answering the real and large key questions that lie before us. While I may not always understand their work, I appreciate the results of their work and I commend this bill to the House. I would like to add that International Women’s Day is coming up next week and I am looking forward to celebrating the achievements of 100 years of International Women’s Day with the sisters. I am also looking forward to working out ways we can continue to fight against the barriers that women face, particularly in achieving equal rights and equal opportunities. One of the areas I would like the ARC to consider looking at is the barriers to women achieving their goals in postdoctoral work. In speaking on this bill, I would like to ask the ARC to examine the introduction of a protected funding pool for female grant applicants. I welcome the initiatives they have had to date, but I wonder if there is more they can do. I would also like them to consider increasing the duration of part-time postdoctoral grants from four to six years and to examine the introduction of female postdoctoral advocates for each grant area. I would like the ARC to look at developing leadership career coaching and network-building programs for postdoctoral women and, finally, to explore possible sources of implicit bias, particularly in the science arena. Again, I commend this bill to the House. Research Council Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2010. I must commend the previous speaker, the member for Canberra, for the very well thought through contribution that she made today. This bill makes a special appropriation funding cap that is administered by the Australian Research Council. The Australian Research Council is a statutory authority within the Australian government’s Innovation, Industry, Science and Research portfolio. Its mission is to deliver policy and programs that advance Australian research and innovation. The ARC provides advice to the government on research matters and manages the National Competitive Grants Program. This is a major part of Australian investment in research and development. The National Competitive Grants Program supports the highest quality fundamental and applied research, and research training, through competitive selection processes across all disciplines. The ARC is a major funding source for research and innovation and investor driven research. I think they are lofty and important aims. The funding will help higher education providers do research in all areas of science and academia. ARC funding has been a big success for regional institutions. Of course, this is very good for my electorate of Corangamite and I certainly look forward to working very closely with Deakin University to ensure that it can access these competitive grants to give the university every opportunity to participate in reMAIN COMMITTEE",134,Australian Research Council Amendment Bill No 2 2010
286,Mr Cheeseman (Corangamite) (10.56 Am),"TodayI rise to speak on the Australiansearch and innovation. This funding for the ARC is also very important for the future research of our higher education system. Since 2007 the ARC has delivered some 1,000 Future Fellowships. This was an election commitment that we took to the Australian people prior to the 2007 election. The federal government will be providing $844 million over the next five years as a part of this. This will fund some 1,000 mid-career research fellowships, which is very important for providing academics every opportunity to contribute to this nation’s knowledge. In 2008 the federal government announced that the ARC Advisory Council would enhance the ARC’s independence, and I think that is a very lofty and important aspiration. This will include indexation adjustments and additional forward estimates for existing schemes within the National Competitive Grants Program. The federal government will also provide $239 million over five years. This will be used for 75 laureate fellowships. This is an important reform for this nation. Institutes will be able to apply for funding under the National Competitive Grants Program. It is pleasing to note that this non-controversial bill, as I understand it, has the support of both sides of the parliament. It is not often that the federal government has been able to rely upon the support of the coalition, and I am very pleased that we have been able to do so on this very important matter. This bill will allow the ARC to continue to support high-quality research in Australia, and that is good news for Australia. This government has put in place many very important educational reforms, and I believe the ARC will play a very important role in the future of this nation’s educational research. We also know that the National Competitive Grants Program is an important part of this, and it will apply to a diverse area of research training through national competition. I want to put on record again my great support for Deakin University. Deakin University continues to play a very important role in my electorate of Corangamite and right throughout the Geelong community. Indeed, Deakin University is our largest employer and plays a fundamental role in assisting the Geelong economy to diversify and in providing opportunities for bright people to contribute to this nation’s future. It is with pleasure that I commend the bill to the House. Ms KATE ELLIS (Adelaide-Minister for Employment Participation and Childcare and Minister for the Status of Women) (11.01 am)-in reply-It is my great pleasure to sum up this important piece of legislation and thank all members who have participated in the debate on the Australian Research Council Amendment Bill 2010. As we have heard, this bill will support the ongoing operations of the Australian Research Council and three specific initiatives that will build Australia’s research capacity and promote excellence in our research. The bill updates the special appropriation amount administered by the Australian Research Council to include new funding for research in bionic vision science and technology, new funding for the Super Science Fellowships scheme, continued funding for National ICT Australia and an additional out-year and indexation of existing appropriation amounts in the Australian Research Council Act 2001. The invention of a bionic eye will not only give and restore sight to tens of thousands of people around the world; it will also generate know-how that can be applied in many other areas. The 100 three-year Super Science Fellowships will support the next generation of researchers in our country. They will also complement our Australian Laureate Fellowships for established researchers, future fellowships for mid-career researchers and continued funding MAIN COMMITTEE for National ICT Australia, the largest information and communications technology research organisation in Australia. This is absolutely essential to ensuring that Australia maintains its first-class reputation for research, training and commercialisation in this vital area. Importantly this bill will see spending increase by approximately $889.6 million over the next four years. The proposed amendments change only the administered special appropriation; they do not alter the substance of the act or increase departmental funds. This is important legislation which will support the research our country needs to remain at the forefront of tackling global problems and also maintain Australian living standards. I commend the legislation to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Message from the Governor General recommending appropriation announced. Ordered that this bill be reported to the House without amendment. Consideration resumed from 21 February. Second Reading Ms KATE ELLIS (Adelaide-Minister for Employment Participation and Childcare and Minister for the Status of Women) (11.05 am)-I present the explanatory memorandum and move: That this bill be now read a second time. During the height of concerns confronting the international education sector in 2009 the Prime Minister, in her then role as the Minister for Education, asked the Hon. Bruce Baird AM to conduct a review of the Education Services for Overseas Students Act 2000 and associated legislation. At that time she also introduced a number of amendments to the ESOS Act to strengthen registration requirements and enable re-registration of all providers by the end of 2010. This interim step was necessary to reinforce the integrity and quality of Australia’s international education sector. When those amendments were passed in February she gave an undertaking to come back with further amendments at the earliest opportunity following the finalisation of the Baird review. This amendment bill is delivering on that commitment. The Education Services for Overseas Students Act 2000, or the ESOS Act, protects Australia’s reputation for delivering quality education services. It does this by establishing a regulatory regime for the provision of international education and training services and looks to the interests of overseas students through the establishment of minimum standards and providing tuition assurance. The ESOS Act also complements Australia’s migration laws by ensuring providers collect and report information relevant to the administration of the law relating to student visas. Since it was first written in 2000 the ESOS Act has been amended several times to keep pace with change, and it is widely recognised as one of the best legislative frameworks for MAIN COMMITTEE international education in the world. However, unprecedented growth in recent years has created new pressure points in the sector which continue to play out. Following extensive consultation with the sector, Mr Baird reported back to the government in February 2010 with 19 recommendations for making the ESOS Act stronger, simpler and smarter. Key messages have been that there needs to be a clearer focus on the interests of students and that, given the size and diversity of the international education sector now, a onesize-fits-all approach to regulation will no longer suffice. In general the recommendations from Mr Baird are about strengthening the registration process, supporting more effective monitoring and enforcement, empowering students with information and improved complaints-handling, encouraging the ethical recruitment of students and introducing a simpler, more robust consumer protection regime. The government released the final report of the ESOS review on 9 March 2010 and at that time indicated a staged approach to the government’s response starting immediately with a number of the recommendations that build on recent changes to the act. Consistent with this staged approach, the government’s response to the remaining recommendations will be considered in a second tranche in the coming months. The Education Services for Overseas Students Legislation Amendment Bill which I am introducing today is the first round of changes to the ESOS Act recommended by the review and will make adjustments to the ESOS Act as well as the Ombudsman Act 1976 and the Privacy Act 1988. The dual focus of this bill is risk management and more effective enforcement. The bill introduces provisions to further strengthen the registration process for approved providers of international education. An amendment is proposed to make it clearer that providers will have to demonstrate that they have access to the financial resources to meet the objectives of the ESOS Act, that they have a sustainable business model and that they have the capability, governance structures and management to deliver education of a satisfactory standard. Recent college closures have highlighted that greater upfront scrutiny of these matters can help identify providers which are at greater risk of not meeting their legislated obligations. This amendment will raise the bar of entry into the international education sector and is consistent with proposed changes to the Australian Quality Training Framework, announced by COAG in December 2009 and taking effect from July 2010, to strengthen the gateway for all registered training organisations. Building on the risk managed approach developed for the re-registration process currently underway, this bill will extend a risk management approach to all registrations both at the point of registration and throughout the registration period. The purpose is to better identify risk and ensure a consistent assessment of risk by all regulators and, in time, the national regulators being established for the vocational education and training and higher education sectors. Together with the strengthened registration criteria, this amendment aims to reduce the number of high-risk providers entering the international education sector and set appropriate conditions on providers’ registration, including for ongoing monitoring to better manage risk. MAIN COMMITTEE This will enable better targeting and reduced duplication of compliance efforts and will shift the regulatory burden to those providers that present the greatest risk to the student experience and the reputation of the sector as a whole. While registration criteria will apply to all providers, higher-risk providers may have new Commonwealth imposed conditions placed on their registration, such as a cap on enrolments, annual financial statements or restrictions on the fees that can be collected in advance, as well as more frequent and detailed auditing. This, in turn, will create incentives for providers to reduce their risk by rewarding low-risk providers with less onerous monitoring regimes. As part of this measure, consistent with common practice, when registering a provider, the regulator will assess the provider’s risk profile and set a period of review and any conditions to ensure appropriate levels of scrutiny are applied to the provider’s operations. The Commonwealth will also be able to assess risk and apply risk based conditions at any time, rather than only as a result of compliance activity. As with re-registration, the details of the risk management approach, such as the broad indicators of risk and type of conditions that should apply, will be further developed in consultation with states and territories through ministerial council processes, and with the sector, prior to implementation. The risk management approach will be supported by limiting a provider’s registration period on the Commonwealth Register for Institutions and Courses for Overseas Students to no more than five years. This will also help introduce consistency into the registration regime by allowing the ESOS Act to formally recognise and align with limited periods of registration for each provider set by the states under domestic quality assurance frameworks. Amendments are introduced to strengthen the ability to take effective enforcement action by introducing financial penalties for a broader range of non-compliant behaviour and to enable regular publishing of targets and information on regulatory activities undertaken by the Commonwealth. A perception raised during the Baird review consultations is that, while the ESOS legislation is sound, it is not adequately enforced. Financial penalties are a tangible immediate action against providers for compliance breaches, reducing the need to go through lengthy court processes or potentially compromising a provider’s ability to continue operating. There is existing scope for financial penalties to be extended for a range of breaches of the national code by making amendments to regulations. The government looks forward to the second tranche of legislative change and implementing our response to the remaining Baird recommendations. I commend this bill to the House. Ms LEY (Farrer) (11.13 am)-I rise to speak in support of the Education Services for Overseas Students Legislation Amendment Bill 2010. The bill seeks to amend the Education for Overseas Students Act 2000, the ESOS Act, to strengthen the registration criteria for providers of education services to overseas students. It introduced a risk management approach for the regulation of these providers. These measures have been introduced by the government to restore confidence in the international education sector and are steps which the coalition broadly supports. The international education industry is our fourth major export industry, worth an estimated $18.5 billion. An Access Economics report into education in April 2009 found that it creates an extra $12.6 billion contribution for our economy through employment such as teaching and MAIN COMMITTEE through services such as food and accommodation for international students. These figures combined mean that the international student market contributes more than $30 billion to our economy. Of course, the contribution international students make to Australia is not just financial; having international students study in Australia contributes to the student experience for Australian students as well. Students from all parts of the world are brought together, and this brings them the opportunity to understand and learn from each other about other cultures and perspectives. Supporting cross-cultural dialogue at the university and vocational education and training sector level plays a key role in our international diplomatic efforts. A strong international education industry assists Australia to build and maintain good relationships around the world. We are lucky in Australia to have a very welcoming and multicultural society. Students do want to come here to experience our culture and lifestyle. I note that Universities Australia recently released the findings of a new benchmark survey. The survey involved 34 of Australia’s universities and covered the expectations and experiences of international students pursuing higher education in Australia. The results indicate that overall 86 per cent of the 36,308 international students who responded to the survey are satisfied with their education experience. There is obviously room for improvement, but the Universities Australia research tells us that, on the whole, students find studying in Australia a positive experience. This is heartening news, particularly in the light of recent events in the international student sector. It is well known that the international education sector went through a period of rapid growth over the last decade. Unfortunately, the downside to such accelerated growth in the overseas student market is that it has attracted some unscrupulous education providers to the system. We saw reports emerge in 2009 that some education providers appeared to be operating only to provide a pathway for students to gain residency in Australia rather than for the primary goal of providing a quality education service. These shonky operators preyed on students, taking thousands of dollars to supposedly guarantee results in the English language exam required for skilled migration. Some students fell victim to such rorts. Other disturbing reports of unethical behaviour towards students also emerged. We have witnessed under-regulated private colleges close. These events, compounded with some violence towards some international students, particularly Indian students, have impacted on our international reputation and led to a decline in enrolments in Australia. The council of higher education providers estimated last year that universities may see a possible downturn of 10 per cent or more in enrolments in 2011. Australia will have to work very hard to reverse the damage to this important industry to remain competitive in the global environment. The Education Services for Overseas Students Act works in conjunction with immigration requirements to ensure that education providers collect and provide information relating to student visas and to regulate minimum standards, financial assurance and tuition. It is about making sure international students receive a quality education and also meet the conditions of their student visa. Improving the current regulatory framework is a complex issue, but it is essential if we want to maintain the reputation of our industry in the long term. To work through some of the matters that I have raised, the government appointed the Hon. Bruce Baird to review the Education Services for Overseas Students Act in August 2009. Mr Baird provided a report back to government suggesting changes to ensure that Australia conMAIN COMMITTEE tinues to offer world-class quality in international education. The report, titled Stronger, simpler, smarter ESOS: supporting international students, suggested some requirements which now appear in this bill. This includes that approved providers be able to demonstrate their ability to access financial resources to meet the requirements under the ESOS Act 2000 and have a sustainable business model with the capability, governance structures and management to deliver education of a satisfactory standard. This new measure will add to the requirements in the original ESOS Act as well as the Education Services for Overseas Students Amendment (Re-registration of Providers and Other Measures) Act, which passed in 2010. Included in this bill is also a new strategy for managing risk in the private education sector. Registration periods for approved providers will be limited to five years. Additional conditions will be able to be placed on a provider’s registration when the provider is first registered or at any time throughout the registration period. The bill also provides for the Commonwealth to take steps without referral from state or territory regulators to introduce financial penalties for a broader range of behaviour, including unethical recruitment and services and failure to comply with the proper maintenance of student records. The Commonwealth will also, upon the passage of this bill, be able to publish any enforcement action taken against education providers. I note one last measure in this bill: that is, the amendment to the Ombudsman Act 1976 to establish an Overseas Students Ombudsman within the office of the Commonwealth Ombudsman. Its function will be to provide advice to private education providers on complaint-handling processes and possibly report on other issues across the international education sector. Reforms to education services for overseas students do not end with this bill. The measures in this legislation are important steps to strengthen the current arrangements to be of support to international students. The coalition hopes these measures help the services to provide and deliver quality education qualifications while being effectively regulated to ensure sustainability. I understand that the Baird review has many other recommendations that we could consider to improve current arrangements in the sector. While the coalition supports the measures in this bill, we would hope that the government continues to take action to rebuild this industry. As this bill before the House goes some way to doing this, I commend it to the House. Ms BRODTMANN (Canberra) (11.21 am)-I rise today to speak in favour of the Education Services for Overseas Students Legislation Amendment Bill 2010. We are blessed in this city to have at our disposal five providers of tertiary or technical education. As a result, technical and tertiary education form a significant part of the local economy here in Canberra. The education sector represents the second largest contributor to the local economy behind government. International education is a significant part of this contribution and it would be remiss of me not to speak today towards any measure that strengthens this vital part of the Canberra economy. I also have a strong interest in the welfare of students in higher education, particularly vocational and technical education, from my days as president of the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology Student Union. At that time the RMIT was the biggest campus in the Southern Hemisphere and it had a mix of vocational, TAFE and higher education courses. We had everything from mechanics and chefs to engineers, journalists and movie makers. We also had the largest mix of part-time and full-time students, and a large proportion of those students were MAIN COMMITTEE international students. SoI am deeply committed to the welfare of students, having that imbued in me from a very young age as a result of looking after about 25,000 students at RMIT at that stage-it was a very large institution, and the oldest workers’ college in the world. As a tutor at the University of Canberra, I also taught undergraduate and postgraduate students from China, Malaysia, Vietnam and Indonesia. These students face enough challenges being here on their own to study, trying to get used to our culture and our food, being away from their families and trying to make new friends in a new land. When I moved up here from Melbourne when I was 18 to study at the ANU and lived in at Burgmann College, I found it very, very hard being away from my family. So not just being away from their family but also being in a new land would be a challenge for these students-and it is a challenge, I know, from speaking to them. That is why I have been deeply shocked and dismayed by the stories that have emerged in recent years concerning some education providers and their seemingly unscrupulous actions. MaybeI should not have been but, nonetheless, it was a great concern to me that some of these operators existed-operators such as the catering colleges with no kitchens and the pilot training schools that would not let students fly planes. These types of fly-by-night operations place at risk not only the students who unwittingly enrol in the courses but also the entire international education sector and the reputation of education in Australia and here in Canberra. Given this threat to such a large contributor to the Australian economy, and to the ACT economy, I am very pleased that the Gillard government has taken on some of the recommendations of the Baird review. The Education Services for Overseas Students Act, better known as ESOS, ensures that students who come to this country receive the quality education promised to them-that is not too much to ask. The ESOS Act also complements Australia’s migration law by ensuring the providers collect and report information relevant to the administration of student visas. The bill follows on from the Prime Minister’s commission of a review into the ESOS Act when she was Minister for Education. The review considers four areas of enhancement for the ESOS framework: supporting the interests of students, delivery quality as the cornerstone of Australian education, effective regulation and sustainability of the international sector. When the report was handed down in March 2011, it contained 19 recommendations covering better consumer protection mechanisms, more support for international students and improved regulation of education providers. The report’s conclusions follow an extensive consultation process with those in the sector-most importantly, the student groups, the education unions, international students and diplomatic missions. The recommendations from the Baird review are being implemented in two main stages, with those recommendations which can be implemented immediately being put first to ensure they are not held up by those requiring more detailed analysis. The bill continues the work from previous amendments and seeks to introduce provisions to strengthen the registration process for approved providers. The bill will require providers to demonstrate, as part of the registration process, that they have the financial resources to meet the objectives of the ESOS Act, that they have a sustainable business model and the capability, governance structures and management to deliver the education to a suitable standard. The bill will strengthen the work already done in this area which aims to ensure a repeat of past incidents does not occur in future. MAIN COMMITTEE These provisions will go a long way to ensuring the viability of providers. Certainly, it is my hope that with these provisions we will never see a repeat of the times when the viability of a provider is limited to the current provisions of the Migration Act. I am glad of this because I was particularly struck by the comments made by SUPRA, the Sydney University Postgraduate Representative Association, to the Baird review. The association stated: It is apparent that the closure of an education provider has a markedly negative impact on the welfare of students. The association went on to say that, from its experience, students felt significant anxiety-as one would-as a result of dodgy providers. The bill complements the risk management approach agreed between all states concerning risk. The bill also addresses noncompliant behaviour by providers by extending the use of financial penalties to a broader range of noncompliant activities. I am pleased that this bill will extend the coverage of the Commonwealth Ombudsman to include students in private providers, such as the flight schools which would not allow students to fly aeroplanesextraordinary! As it stands, while the ESOS Act requires providers to have access to an external complaints mechanism, this is not always easily identifiable. Students enrolled in a state or territory statutory provider such as a university or TAFE have access to the state ombudsman. This is a more difficult prospect for those enrolled in private institutions. The bill will provide that the Commonwealth Ombudsman is able to investigate complaints made by students and ensure appropriate action is taken in those private institutions. The Commonwealth Ombudsman will also work with providers to make sure their systems are rigorous, further improving standards. I am similarly pleased that this bill also delivers on the recommendation to publish the targets and regular reporting of all regulatory activities. Moreover, while providers can appeal against enforcement action, this is no bar to the publication of their reporting data. I spoke previously about the need for transparency and how it highlights strengths and weaknesses. This is another example of the benefits of transparency. I welcome any move that makes our education providers more accountable and transparent to their students, customers, the broader Australian community and the global community. Education and international education are far too important to Australia’s economy and reputation-and to Canberra’s reputation and economy-to be taken lightly. We cannot assume that the complaints from students are isolated, rare or from malcontent individuals. They must be treated seriously and this gives them the vehicle to do that. We must work hard to stamp out the providers who, through their negligence, incompetence or just plain money grabbing, place at risk a valuable industry for Australia and for Canberra. This bill focuses on financial and business viability and is essential to ensuring a repeat of the past does not occur. I commend the bill to the House. tralian economy, both socially and economically. That is why the Education Services for Overseas Students Legislation Amendment Bill 2010 is of such importance. It will enable the Commonwealth Ombudsman to establish an independent body for overseas students to make complaints against private registered providers, offer advice and training to private instituMAIN COMMITTEE",139,Australian Research Council Amendment Bill No 2 2010
287,Mrs Prentice (Ryan) (11.30 Am),"International students bring huge benefit to the Austions to facilitate best practice complaint handling, and review and investigate complaint handling and report on systemic issues. WhilstI do not generally support simply applying another layer of bureaucracy to try to fix an issue, I believe that these amendments will provide much needed transparency and reassurance to international students in Australia who are currently feeling threatened by the Gillard government’s recent actions. Education services are Australia’s third largest export earner, second only to coal and iron ore. For a relatively small country, Australia hosts a high portion of the world’s international students. In 2006, there were almost 2.8 million tertiary students studying abroad, with just over 207,000 studying in Australia-7.5 per cent. Additionally, international students study not only at our universities but also through business schools, English language study institutions, through the VET sector, on study tours, and through foundation courses to prepare them for further study. In doing so, they contribute to a wide and diverse range of sectors even within the education industry, and the benefit of this becomes clear when looking at their contribution to the overall economy. Access Economics reports that each international student contributes approximately $29,000 per annum, on average, value added to our economy. This means that overall, including associated visits from their friends and family, international students contribute $12.3 billion value added. While students spend about 46 per cent of their expenditure-$6.4 billiondirectly on their education, they also spend money on other items such as food, accommodation and travel. Again, based on an average $14.3 billion value added, it is estimated that for every dollar an international student spends on their education, there is a flow-on effect. This in turn, of course, generates jobs for Australians. Tourism Research Australia suggests that, for every two formal students, one friend or relative visited Australia throughout the duration of their studies. These travellers contribute an estimated $314.7 million to the economy. It is clear that international students contribute enormously to Australia as a whole, but the effects are also clear when broken down to a state-by-state level. In Queensland, international students and their friends and visitors contribute approximately $1.7 billion in value added to the state’s economy. Comparing this to the gross state product of $214 billion, international student flow-on effects account for 0.81 per cent of GSP. Of this, $1.2 billion is in the direct form of employee wages, with the remainder representing return to capital owners. International student activity in Queensland contributes close to 17,500 full-time equivalent workers, including almost 14,000 jobs in my home town of Brisbane alone. This equates to $970.4 million in direct wages, and $416.8 million as returns to capital owners, with the sector contributing $4.15 billion to Brisbane’s economy. When broken down to a local level, the contribution and importance of international students becomes particularly clear. These amendments are a positive step towards supporting our international students. However, I do have grave concerns about the management of this sector under the Gillard Labor government. Changes to the Skilled Occupation List made in July last year saw international students across the country reach the end of their degrees without the certainty they thought they had throughout the duration of their course. Whilst the changes may have been necessary, the transitional arrangements for these students were inadequate, undermining international confidence in studying in Australia. This is not good for our international reputation and MAIN COMMITTEE relationships. On top of this, the government’s attempt at reintroducing compulsory student amenities fees would see international students studying at our universities hit with yet another upfront cost for services that are optional. The negative effects of this government’s mismanagement of the international student sector are clear. As reported in the Australian in May last year, the sector saw a 40 per cent decrease in overseas student applications in one month alone. At the time, Stephen Connelly of the International Education Association of Australia cautioned that, should this decline continue, the sector could lose up to 35,000 jobs by the end of 2011. These statistics have not improved. On 12 February, Dan Harrison of the Sydney Morning Herald reported that the number of international students choosing Australia for their degree had continued to fall, with student visa applications from outside Australia decreasing 32 per cent over the past six months of 2010, compared with 2009, which had already fallen 22 per cent compared to the same period in 2008. This drop must seriously concern universities, which have an increased reliance on the funds paid by international students given that the real value of government funding to universities has declined. The cumulative effect of this Labor government’s mishandling of the implementation of these changes has caused uncertainty and decline. Indeed, last year Monash University, Australia’s largest, announced that it would lay off 300 staff to cover the budget shortfall caused by the decline in the number of international students at their institution. Estimates by Access Economics also show the impact of a five per cent increase or decrease in international student activity. The effects of a five per cent decrease are significant, reducing total value-added contributions by more than half a billion dollars. As seen through the Monash example, however, the most telling effect of a decline in international students is its effect on employment rates, with a five per cent decrease resulting in an employment drop of more than 6,000 full time-equivalent workers. Clearly, something needs to be done to regain Australia’s standing within the international education sector. Our universities and education institutions are world class, and I am sure that honourable members would agree that we are yet to find a country that offers greater safety, better natural attractions or, indeed, a better lifestyle than Australia. It is little wonder that Australia has been so competitive in this sector in the past. I have already noted the huge benefits that a thriving international education sector and international students bring to the economy. These are benefits we cannot afford to lose. This bill goes some way to providing international students with a reassurance that they are valued and that they do have a voice whilst they are here. History has shown that students who enjoy their education experience in Australia become friends for life. speak on the Education Services for Overseas Students Legislation Amendment Bill 2010. This bill touches on a sector of the economy which is incredibly important for my electorate of Throsby on the South Coast of New South Wales. We have a great regional university and a number of schools, particularly in the southern highlands, which have successfully tapped into the demand for high-quality education services. I am very pleased to say that the demand for the education services provided by places like the University of Wollongong and St Paul’s International College in my electorate has grown and has not been hit like other institutions have throughout the period of the GFC.

288,Mr Stephen Jones (Throsby) (11.38 Am),"It is with great pleasure that I rise today tolargest income earner in the region. A region that once relied upon manufacturing and mining is now diversifying because of the benefits of overseas education services. I was interested to hear the contribution earlier by the member for Ryan. I am pleased to see that there is some bipartisan support for the implementation of the Baird review findings. I do part company with the member for Ryan on some of her observations. Yes, it is true that international student applications and applications for international student visas have declined over the last three years. But if you listened to the contribution from the member for Ryan you could be forgiven for thinking that we have not been through a global financial crisis, which has had a significant impact on the demand for overseas education services, or that we have not had a high Australian dollar, which has had a big impact on the capacity of many Australian institutions to compete with other countries not only in our region but also around the world in what is now a global market. We also inherited a lack of quality control in a sector that grew like Topsy over a decade under the watch of the previous government. As a result we saw a number of institutions that have been described by previous speakers as nothing more than shonky operations. They have also been described by many commentators as nothing more than visa factories. It was with an eye to the need to implement some quality control in this critical sector of our economy that the government acted. Yes, more refinements to the regulations of this sector are needed, and I will have something more to say about that shortly, but we did exactly what was necessary to ensure that we had some quality control in this sector. Every year, thousands of young people from around the world travel to Australia to enrol in a variety of educational institutions, including schools, TAFEs, universities and English language schools. As previous speakers have noted, our reputation as a safe, multicultural country ensures that we are one of the largest providers of education services for overseas students. It is critical that we in this place do nothing to damage the reputation we have as an open, welcoming country that values multiculturalism and the contribution that our overseas students make not only to our economy but also to our cultural life. We note that the current Australian dollar is impacting on many of our export industries, and the education sector is no exception. Despite this, I am very pleased to say that the education services sector will continue to grow and be a part of Australia’s economy. In my own region the high Australian dollar, thankfully, has not yet had an impact on enrolments and the demand for future enrolments, particularly in the tertiary education sector. I met yesterday with representatives from the University of Wollongong and they advised me that demand was still very strong. That is good news indeed. The principal act regulating this area is the Education Services for Overseas Students Act 2000-the ESOS Act-which protects the interests of students and Australia’s reputation for delivering quality education services by establishing a regulatory regime and standards for the provision of international education and training services, and by providing tuition and financial assurance. The ESOS Act also complements Australia’s migration laws by ensuring providers collect and report information relevant to the administration of the law relating to student visas. In August 2009 the Prime Minister in her then capacity as Minister for Education asked Bruce Baird AM to review the ESOS Act and its associated instruments and to recommend actions for ensuring Australia continued to offer world-class international education services. MAIN COMMITTEE Ahead of the Baird review, the ESOS Amendment Act 2010 required the re-registration of all existing Commonwealth Register of Institutions and Courses for Overseas Students providers and the introduction of two new registration criteria, and required providers to publicly list the names of all of their education agents. This went to the problem that has been identified by many speakers: unscrupulous activity by a small number of institutions and their education agents. The Baird review was tasked to consider the need for enhancements to the ESOS legal framework in four key areas, as set out in the terms of reference. They included supporting the interests of students, delivering quality as the cornerstone of Australian education, and effective regulation and sustainability of the international education sector. A division having been called in the House of RepresentativesSitting suspended from 11.46 am to 12.03 pm simpler, smarter ESOS: supporting international students in March 2010. The report contained 19 recommendations, including, firstly, more support for international students and improved information, secondly, stronger consumer protection mechanisms to ensure students are protected from unscrupulous operators, thirdly, improved regulation of Australia’s international education sector and, fourthly and finally, improved support for those who study and live in Australia, including having somewhere to go when problems arise. During debate in the Senate on amendments to the ESOS Act in 2010, the then Deputy Prime Minister committed to introducing an amendment bill for the Baird ESOS review recommendations. The initial changes proposed to be implemented in this bill will build on recent amendments to the ESOS Act and the re-registration measure to raise the bar for entry into the international education sector and give regulators greater flexibility to effectively manage risk and enforce compliance with legislation. This bill before the House today contains provisions that will, firstly, ensure that only those providers that have a capacity to offer quality education are permitted entry into the sector. Secondly, it will protect the interests of students in strengthening and simplifying the regulatory framework to ensure it can respond to the pressures international education faces now as well as those that it will face into the future. Third, it will ensure resources are better targeted towards high-risk providers and release and reduce the regulatory burden for low-risk providers. It will complement the risk based approach agreed with states and territories for CRICOS re-registration. It will address noncompliant provider behaviour by extending the use of financial penalties to a broader range of non-compliance. It will allow the Commonwealth to publish targets and regular reporting on all regulatory activities taken under part 6 and part 7. Finally, it will extend the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth Ombudsman to include students of private registered providers. Taken together, these amendments to strengthen ESOS will result in a more sustainable international education sector through better protection of international students and an ongoing commitment to continual quality improvement. These measures are important to protect the integrity of Australia’s education services sector, which is, as I said, of great value to our economy, including the economy in my electorate of Throsby. There is no doubt that in the past there have been issues with the integrity of the international education sector, and these measures in the bill today are a response to that. There have been allegations of immigration rorts, shonky providers, poor quality education services, college closures and exploitation of students.

289,Mr Stephen Jones,"Continuing my speech, Mr Baird released his report Stronger,legislation is a positive development to ensure that Australia’s international reputation is protected and these practices are stamped out. In 2009-10 student visas were granted to 269,000 applicants. It is also relevant to note that new measures have been put in place to address integrity issues about some parts of the student visa program, including an increased number of interviews for offshore applicants, increased financial requirements and changes to the way in which course packages are assessed. In December 2010 the Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills, Jobs and Workplace Relations and the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship announced a strategic review of the student visa program. This strategic review of student visas complements the work being done in responding to the Baird ESOS review. The review of student visas is being done because the government recognises that there have been adverse impacts on the Australian international education sector as a result of the rising value of the Australian dollar, together with the ongoing impact of the global financial crisis on countries and the growing competition from alternative providers in countries such as the United States, New Zealand and Canada for international students. As I mentioned, there are a number of international education providers in my electorate and I have had representations from a number of them, including St Paul’s International College in Moss Vale. This college in the Southern Highlands of New South Wales is a leading international school, providing services in education services, particularly to mainland China. I know that schools like St Paul’s have been struggling with the impacts of some aspects of these regulatory changes and the high Australian dollar in this highly competitive market. I have made representations on behalf of the school to the minister, and he is sympathetic to the situation facing schools in my electorate. We are hopeful that, as a result of the review, these issues will be brought forth and we will have a comprehensive response to the problems being faced by these providers. It is important that schools like St Paul’s continue to remain financially viable. I am assured that it is this government’s intention to find the right balance between our economic interests and the importance of an education and immigration system that are based on sound regulatory principles. In conclusion, the goal of the Gillard Labor government is to invest in education and to build the best education system in the world. The ESOS amendment bill before the chamber today protects the interests of students and Australia’s reputation for delivering quality education services, and for these reasons I commend the bill to the House. dents Legislation Amendment Bill 2010 is an important bill both for the electorate of Bennelong and for the nation in general. I support the bill but add reservations that further amendments are required to achieve a better balance between the needs of higher education providers and the legitimate expectations of students. The changes to this bill arise out of the review, chaired by the Hon. Bruce Baird, delivering the report titled Stronger, simpler, smarter ESOS: supporting international students. This bill implements some of the Baird recommendations, adding some further strength and flexibility to the original ESOS Act 2000, as well as the ESOS Amendment Act 2010. The primary purpose of this bill is to: bolster the existing standards for the registration of an education provider; improve the manner in which the industry manages risk; provide the government with the authority to penalise providers financially if they engage in practices considered inapproMAIN COMMITTEE",151,Cricos Re Registration And Better Focuses Resources On Those In The Sector Who Are At High
290,Mr Alexander (Bennelong) (12.10 Pm),"The Education Services for Overseas Stupriate or unethical; and allow a wider scope for the Commonwealth Ombudsman to investigate complaints about education providers. It is my contention that these measures need to be expanded to include enhancement of the student experience, with flow-on benefits to all sectors of the economy-a concept I refer to as ‘edu-tourism.’ Macquarie University is based in the Bennelong suburb of Marsfield and recently ranked ninth in the Australian Education Network’s ranking of Australian universities. Like many higher education providers, Macquarie University’s financial viability is inextricably linked to the health of our overseas student market, which is responsible for a large proportion of their tuition income. Australia is one of the largest providers of education services for overseas students. Education is our nation’s largest services export industry and is currently our fourth largest export earner overall, following coal, iron ore and gold. In 2008-09, education contributed more than $17 billion to our national export earnings and it is linked to the employment of approximately 120,000 people. The total value-add generated by international higher education students was $9.3 billion. On average, each international higher education student studying in Australia contributes over $50,000 to our economy each year. Two-thirds of this amount is spent on goods and services, injecting vital income into the economy and generating more jobs. Many overseas students will remain in Australia, contributing to our nation in a variety of economic and cultural ways. Others will return home and share their affection for their second home as a legitimate business, study and tourist destination. In short, government inaction or poor policy can have massive repercussions on our nation’s economic well-being, on each education provider’s financial viability and on the costs of tertiary study for our own citizens, thereby impacting on the professional and intellectual capacity of our future generations. Over the past few years we have observed a sharp decline in commencement numbers of international students. In 2009-10, the number of visas granted for the higher education sector dropped by 11.5 per cent, compared to the previous year. A John Curtin Institute of Public Policy report, dated August 2010, found that overseas enrolments in higher education could slide by up to 100,000 places by 2015, costing up to $7 billion in fees and risking up to 8,800 university jobs. This serious issue has been widely linked to a variety of factors, including the global financial crisis; competition from improved domestic networks, specifically those choosing to use English as the language of tuition; recent changes to the General Skilled Migration Program; the increasing strength of the Australian dollar; the collapses of local providers found to be dodgy through improved checking mechanisms; and incidents of violence perpetrated on overseas students, which attained sensational press in their home markets. I agree that these factors, many of which are out of our control as policymakers, have been largely influenced by global events. Any efforts we can implement to right the ship and improve our position will be of great benefit. But these efforts should not be limited to just trying to take things back to how they were prior to the GFC. A key reason for the current situation is the increased competition we face from other countries, particularly the United States, Canada and the UK, who offer international students the package experience of studying in a foreign country. This is the idea that education institutions provide a holistic experience which includes not only a high quality of teaching from the MAIN COMMITTEE provider but also the living and cultural elements associated with the national experience. In countries such as the UK and Canada, it is normal practice to accommodate first-year students, as a minimum, within the university’s portfolio of accommodation. Almost all US colleges and universities provide their students with the option to live in campus residences or dormitories. Australia must compete with these countries by taking a more proactive role in securing student accommodation and ownership of the broader student experience and development. At the very least, larger education providers should take responsibility for finding first-year foreign students suitable accommodation, preferably on campus but possibly in private accommodation. In addition, Australia must ensure that we give foreign students a holistic experience of life in Australia by ensuring that they have access to affordable public transport and to the social aspects of life on campus which make studying in another country so enjoyable. We must nurture these individuals so that they either remain in Australia as skilled workers and contribute to our society or return to their home country with genuine praise and affection for our country. We need to be creative. We need to fully utilise the opportunities available to us to improve the overall student experience. We need to move away from just viewing overseas students as purely economic assets. We need to take a wider perspective on the overall impact of this industry on our local community as well as our broader economy. Macquarie University is a very large provider of education services to overseas students. As the local MP I have witnessed first hand the impact that an inadequate system can have on the local community. As I mentioned in my maiden speech to the House, since my very first day of campaigning for this position over a year ago I have observed and participated in the protest actions of a community group called MARS-Marsfield Against Residential Suffocation. Coincidentally, I will be addressing a MARS rally this coming Sunday afternoon in Dunbar Park. MARS was formed by residents neighbouring the university who have witnessed a sharp escalation in the number of illegal boarding houses providing cheap and substandard accommodation options to overseas students. Some reports have up to 15 students sharing a three-bedroom unit, leading to a degree of physical and psychological abuse by those choosing to prey on the students’ ignorance of the Australian way of life. The flow-on impact on infrastructure, services and detriment to the quality of life of the community cannot be overstated. Some of this matter relates to powers administered by the state government, particularly those relating to tenancy laws. My New South Wales state colleague Victor Dominello, the member for Ryde, introduced a private member’s bill late last year to impose significantly increased sanctions on operators of these illegal boarding houses and to set a cap on student numbers per room permitted under the legislation. Unfortunately this private member’s bill did not proceed through the Legislative Assembly prior to the New South Wales parliament being prorogued. I am very grateful to Mr Dominello and hopeful that he will serve as a government MP later this month and that this bill will becomes part of the new government’s legislative agenda. Under the federal government’s authority, as exemplified by the bill we are debating, it has become increasingly clear that action is not being taken to protect one of our greatest industries-one that has every potential for sustainable growth. We are in the early stages of suffering a syndrome that those of us in Sydney’s north-western suburbs know only too well MAIN COMMITTEE whereby appropriate action is not taken in a timely manner in the form of infrastructure investment to provide dividends for generations to come. Several weeks ago I inspected the clever yet simple prefabricated budget student accommodation buildings constructed over the past few years at the Australian National University. ANU has taken proactive measures to provide real options to the overseas student market and has markedly reduced the rental pressure on the surrounding residential neighbourhoods in the process. It gave me no surprise to learn that the ANU is ranked as the No. 1 university in Australia on the ranking guide mentioned earlier. I also note that several days ago the University of Canberra announced their intention to follow the lead set by ANU and convert a block of offices in neighbouring Belconnen into student accommodation. Aside from the obvious and immediate assistance this would provide to the university’s standing in the overseas student market, the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Canberra, Professor Stephen Parker, was quoted by ABC News as saying: In many way it’s the big issue for Canberra about Tertiary education and for the community, because if you’ve got students out there renting houses that aren’t really suitable for them, then they’re making housing less available, less affordable for members of the community. It is imperative that a program is commenced to provide high-standard budget student accommodation with a unique Australian experience for our overseas students. This will serve to broaden their educational experience and create a distinct point of difference and superiority to the conditions and services offered by other countries in an increasingly competitive overseas student market. This opportunity should not be missed. I understand this bill is the first of two amendment bills on the legislation which will be debated in this House over the coming months and that the next bill also has correlation to the issues I am addressing today. I will be working to ensure that preliminary negotiations on the future legislation include discussions on a university’s duty of care to their overseas students, including access to budget accommodation options of sufficient quality. Incorporation of these standards can assist in the development and improvement of the ranking or grading system of universities to include the quality of the students’ overall university experience, thereby assisting those providers to promote their services in international markets. The focus of our parliament must not be to promote unnecessary regulation or bureaucracy and other burdens which weigh down the strong performers. Instead, we must motivate our great schools of learning to be proactive in attracting the best young minds of the world, giving them the standard of support they deserve and assisting them to reach their full potential. The flow-on benefits to our country will be significant. The measures covered in this bill will go a small way towards addressing these numerous issues. With the key role that Macquarie University plays in Bennelong, and the important position that the industry holds in our national economy, I will be working towards implementation of greater and further reaching reforms into the future. I commend this bill to the House. to the Education Services for Overseas Students Legislation Amendment Bill 2010. This bill aims to ensure that all providers of education services to overseas students are financially stable, have a solid business model and have the right management practices in place to ensure they deliver education that is of a suitable standard.

291,Mr Tehan (Wannon) (12.22 Pm),"I rise today to give my support, with conditions also,In Australia we have a fine record in educating students from overseas and, given that we are one of the world’s largest providers of overseas education and a market leader, it is imperative that we constantly seek to set high standards in education. The fallout from the global financial crisis, combined with the rise in the Australian dollar and, unfortunately, the sledgehammer approach to the issuing of visas, means that gaining an education in Australia has become more expensive and more difficult for students from overseas. This has put considerable pressure on the industry and has resulted in 11,544 fewer students in 2010 than in 2009. Therefore, it is important that we ensure the standard of the education we offer is high, giving an additional incentive so that we can limit the impact of the high dollar and continue to attract students from overseas. We also have to ensure that students have a seamless approach in applying to access our tertiary education, because such approaches are being offered in competing countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom. I feel that if this bill works towards this aim it will provide greater certainty for overseas students that the product they are paying for is of a suitable standard. With the establishment of the Overseas Students Ombudsman, there will also be an avenue for complaint resolution of any issues that students may have with their provider. This is certainly a welcome move and may uncover any problems with providers before they reach crisis point. Recent collapses of educational providers and issues with overseas student integration have also damaged our standing as a desirable education destination, and we do need to act to ensure that this does not happen again. While our capital cities accommodate the majority of overseas students, these students are increasingly important for our rural and regional educational facilities. The right balance of local and overseas students results in a viable and diverse educational facility. This is especially important in more remote areas with lower population densities, where international student numbers can support a provider whose facility may not be viable if accessed only by local students. This has great advantages for local rural and regional students because a local facility is available and helps to create greater cultural diversity in our regional areas. As we see in our university residences, students mix and live in a truly global environment which adequately prepares them for the challenges of today’s workforce. Most young students now aim to live and work overseas for a period of time, and the contacts made while studying with students from other countries are extremely valuable. Many students form lifelong friendships with people from another country, and many make vital future business contacts. In Wannon, we have campuses of both the Deakin and RMIT universities and, as an example, the training for doctors is especially popular and considered superior to some city based options, due to the variety of experience students get when working in a regional area. This influx of students leads to a greater chance of them choosing to stay and gain employment in rural and regional areas, helping considerably to fill some gaps that exist for skilled professionals, especially in the area of health. This in turn benefits our local communities. Many of our doctor and other health professional shortages are filled by overseas trained immigrants in regional areas. Encouraging overseas students to train in rural and regional areas can encourage those people to consider applying for permanent residency in the area and further assist in providing essential services to local towns. Overseas students who have been trained in regional Australia are already up to date with our standards and are more likely to stay in regional areas to work if they have a connection with the area formed while studying. Students MAIN COMMITTEE who do return to their country of birth take home with them a better understanding of Australia and the Australian culture, assisting Australia’s standing in any future business dealings that they may have throughout their career. A good example of the importance of international students to educational facilities in Wannon is the Hamilton and Alexandra College. When most people think of overseas students, they assume that they are mostly in our universities, but there is a growing trend for secondary schools to be actively attracting overseas students as well. The Hamilton and Alexandra College, an independent school educational leader in south-western Victoria-which, I might add, some of my children attend-fosters a relationship with China and our other Asian neighbours which results in strong overseas student numbers at the college. As this is a relatively small school, the component of overseas students at the Hamilton and Alexandra College means that the college is still able to support a boarding facility. This, in turn, benefits Australian-resident country families who might otherwise have to send their children to a city boarding school. All students learn Chinese, and the year 9 group undertakes a ‘China Experience’ in which they attend school in China for approximately two months. The students at the college benefit from forming friendships with students from other countries at an influential age. It produces more worldly and tolerant young adults who are prepared for the demands of our modern, multicultural society. I am glad to see that with this bill the government is acting to address the decline in overseas students that occurred last year and the negative publicity that occurred as a result of the collapse of some educational providers. However, I am severely disappointed that the government will not acknowledge and act on the growing disadvantage our Australian resident country students face in gaining a tertiary qualification when compared to their city counterparts. While I support the aims of this bill, I hope that continual improvements will be made. (Extension of time granted) High-quality, world-class educational opportunities are a reflection internationally of Australia. Our international students go forth into the global community and we need to ensure that they have wonderful, positive and beneficial experiences to tell the world about.

Mallee Electorate: Exceptional Circumstances by the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Senator Ludwig, has caused enormous uncertainty across my entire electorate. The north-west of Victoria has been in EC for the last five or six years on the basis of severe drought. It has been a substantial drought, not all of it consistently for that long period. In fact, today there is only one small area in the south-west corner, in the West Wimmera Shire, that is not included in EC but the rest is and we are talking about a significant region of Victoria-a third of the state which is now in a state of complete uncertainty because of this announcement.

293,Mr Forrest (Mallee) (12.30 Pm),"The lifting of exceptional circumstances last Fridaystrumental in keeping the social and economic fabric of north-west Victoria together as we wait for more prosperous times to return. Yes, we had thought these more prosperous times had returned with the good spring rains. Back in 2010 the future for grain crops looked very positive and constructive and that created some expectations of much better returns. However, as history has proved time and time again, when a drought breaks the skies open. Unprecedented rainfall since September 2010 has now demonstrated an outcome of exceptional circumstances of the opposite kind to drought, equally debilitating but not drought. I believe the timing of this announcement is completely inappropriate when cyclonic meteorological outcomes of a like never seen in living memory in the arid Mallee region of Victoria are leaving people staggering. We have seen TV scenes and images comparable with those we have seen of tropical Queensland. Who would have credited that an area with a notional average annual rainfall of 250 millimetres per annum would have three times that since September? In fact, on one occasion, on 4 February, the average annual rainfall fell on the Mildura region in less than 12 hours. The resulting financial and economic strain as a result of crop damage and infrastructure damage is enormous and, to be frank, I am struggling to give moral support to my communities to keep them together. So the announcement of this withdrawal of EC support has the most abominable timing. It sends a very bad message to my constituents that they are not important when they see Queenslanders getting so much attention-and, rightly so, they should because they have had to cope with significant climatic change’s dramatic outcomes but so have the people in north-west Victoria. SoI am pleading with the minister and the state government of Victoria to find an alternative way so that, in 28 days, at least 2,000 of my desperate families do not find themselves in a position where their household support is stopped. We have time-we have four weeks-to lodge a new application, whether it is called exceptional circumstances or national disaster relief assistance. No matter what is called, to be frank, it is time my constituents were sent a moral message that this House does care: it cares about their future well-being, it appreciates the contribution they make to the nation’s prosperity and GDP and it appreciates that they are very real families who are dealing with real uncertainty. They need an approach from us that shows we understand that their preciousness is important to us. I make an appeal to the Victorian state government to work with the federal government to come up with a program through national disaster relief that leaves that ongoing support in place and does not leave my constituents in some sort of hiatus where they have incredible uncertainty about their future. I thank you and I hope my message gets heard by the relevant minister. Broadband Ms HALL (Shortland) (12.36 pm)-I want to place on the record of this House the importance of the National Broadband Network to the people that I represent in this parliament. The Shortland electorate falls partly in Lake Macquarie and partly on the Central Coast. Regional Development Australia (Central Coast and Hunter) have worked together to promote a wider Hunter and Central Coast region as a priority area for the NBN rollout. This initiative has been supported by 13 councils and I note that the two councils that the Shortland electorate falls in have passed motions supporting the NBN rollout in their area. A statement of intent was forwarded to the government stating that the Hunter and Central Coast were NBN capaMAIN COMMITTEE ble and that they had the capacity and the commitment to be involved as a priority area for the rollout of the NBN. Some areas of the Shortland electorate are quite isolated. The electorate has fairly high unemployment, particularly the Central Coast part of the electorate. Wyong Shire has an 8.8 per cent unemployment rate and that is higher than the New South Wales and Australian averages. A large portion of that area of high unemployment is in the northern part of the Central Coast which is more isolated. The NBN would be of so much benefit to those people living in the northern part of the Central Coast. It would allow them to work from home rather than having to travel either to Sydney or to Newcastle as practically all of them need to do to access employment. Yesterday the Central Coast members of parliament-Craig Thomson, Deb O’Neill and Ialong with Gosford and Wyong councils, Regional Development Australia Central Coast and industry consultant Dave Abrahams, met with Minister Conroy and Minister Crean to emphasise the importance of the NBN to the Central Coast. That covers the Lake Macquarie area that I also represent. The ministers were able to recognise that this is an area of high need. They were exceptionally impressed with the prospectus that had been put together. They were cognisant of the fact that this proposal has the support of all sectors of the community, and they could see that the Central Coast community was ready and that the region would provide an attractive return for NBN Co. The rollout will help the region to provide: sound community and business support, support for commuting workers through demonstrating the value of the NBN in reducing unnecessary travelling time, linking of schools, and a balance between work and home with all those people needing to travel to get to work. There are implications of the NBN for health and the fact that the Central Coast is a water authority and is prepared to work very cooperatively with NBN in the rollout. The most important thing to note about the Central Coast and the Hunter is that there is support throughout the community for the NBN. The business sector particularly is behind NBN being rolled out to the Central Coast and the Hunter. One of the things that we were able to present to the ministers yesterday is that the Central Coast is within the Hunter-Central Coast proposal that is being put forward as well as the proposal that is being put forward by Southern Cross University for a spur down eastern Australia. I strongly put on the record my support for the NBN being rolled out in the Central Coast and Lake Macquarie.

294,Mr Briggs (Mayo) (12.41 Pm),"I rise today to speak on a very important topic. The hiswe can to support these people in their fight. However, when significant change occurs we must remind ourselves that we need vigilance. The uprisings in this region will have shortand long-term repercussions that we as policy makers must consciously consider. For instance, there will be a short-term impact on petrol prices that will be felt throughout our economy. But it is the potential longer term consequences to which I believe we must turn our attention. One of the most important stabilisers in the Middle East in recent years was the 1979 peace treaty between Egypt and Israel. It has been and remains a vital element in ensuring that large scale conflict has been avoided in this region. It is an agreement that we must ensure survives the recent upheaval in Egypt-because its survival is not assured. In 1979, a popular revolt in Iran overthrew an autocrat, but of course the popular revolt was eventually hijacked by extremists. The same extremists continue to threaten world security today. There is no doubt that there are some in Egypt, backed by the silent hand of Tehran, who wish to bring the same type of Islamic extremism to power in that country. We must ensure that this does not happen. While it is unlikely that an Iranian-backed extremist will gain control in Egypt, we must be vigilant. Australia is a great friend of Israel, and it should remain a great friend of Israel. While there are some on the far left in Australian politics who will continue to seek to demonise the people of Israel, I will stand with our friends to support their right to exist in peace and their right to have the security that we often take for granted. Ultimately we must remember that we shared the battle against the same deranged strain of Islamic extremism that has killed Australians in Bali, in Afghanistan and in other parts of the world. Indeed, many of our young Australians continue to fight against some of these people in Afghanistan today. It is Iran’s stated policy aim to push Israel into the sea. Iran is led by a regime which, even in the face of united, concerted, international opposition, continues to pursue an aggressive nuclear program. If their pursuit of this nuclear program is successful, it will bring massive instability to this region and to our world. It will undoubtedly have an impact on us. It is a program that I believe must never come to fruition. The risk that Iran continues to present underlines why it is essential that modern Egypt and other Middle Eastern powers do not fall into the hands of these extremists. This is not just a threat to our friends Israel; it is a threat to our free world. I believe Australian policy must maintain consistency and strong support for Israel. It concerns me when senior members of the government float ideas that suggest our support for our friends in Israel is not rock-solid. While some on the lunatic Left fringe, like the Greenscontrolled Marrickville Council, will continue their campaign against Israel, it is vital that the bipartisan support for Israel does not waver. I support democracy in the Middle East. Any movement towards free and open democracy is to be supported. But we must be vigilant against the risks of extremists hijacking these movements. We must continue to show our strong resolve and our support for our friends in Israel, because their fight with extremists is our fight with extremists. I urge the House to maintain the necessary resolve to ensure our ongoing security. MAIN COMMITTEE Braddon Electorate: Healthy Communities Initiative around the health and well-being of my patch on the north-west coast of Tassie. Unfortunately my region does not have good health indicators. Indeed, a Tasmanian population health survey of 2009 revealed that 56.5 per cent of the people in my region were overweight or obese. Despite having some fantastic local produce, which you have heard me talk about in this place many times before, some 89 per cent of people in Braddon do not eat enough vegetables and nearly 51 per cent do not eat enough fruit. We are also above the state average for smoking, risky alcohol consumption, heart disease and so forth. That is why the Healthy Communities Initiative of this Labor government has been so welcome in my neck of the woods-and some 24 projects are now underway. I would like to congratulate the Cradle Coast Authority, particularly Bev Hayhurst, a dynamic organiser in this program, for being successful in getting $410,000 in pilot project funding to put into effect the Healthy Communities Initiative on the coast. I would like to share some details of these projects. At Latrobe, they set up a project involving exercise and dance classes for residents in an aged-care facility, some six weeks prior holding a major dance on St Patrick’s Day. This not only gave them a range of activities but has also become a major fundraiser. The funds raised have been used to buy equipment and to put in raised beds for a community garden at the facility, which will have its own benefits for the residents. In Circular Head, at the western end of the electorate, through a Job Services Australia provider, a small group of long-term unemployed people were part of a 10-week course of twohour sessions on nutrition. They cooked healthy meals on a budget, developed basic health literacy and did community gardening and exercise. With each of the cooking components, they did half an hour’s exercise as well. They have now set up a walking group under the Heart Foundation banner. So that is fantastic. They also kicked off the ‘Balance Your Life’ project, which signed up more than 300 people to a program of community exercise events subsidised by the fantastic council there. At nearby Wynyard a group of families have been part of what they call ‘Wheelin’ Wynyard’, a school holiday project to get people out on their bikes and riding together. One local man with a talent for bicycle repairs has been part of the project, and it looks like he may establish a small business. A number of other adults have had assistance to get out on their bikes, often with their kids, for the very first time. At the lovely little town of Waratah, a small former mining town, the project has organised regular exercise sessions for the region, which also include workshops on nutrition and eating on a budget in a remote community. The City of Burnie is working towards the Burnie Challenge and has enlisted the help of Commando Steve, from the Biggest Loser television program, to stage an obstacle course competition. Local personal trainers are part of the lead-up to the event in April and have been offering free cross-training to those in the target group. Further to the east, in Devonport, they are looking for a fresh start with its events, which are part of the Healthy Living Expo and will combine low-impact physical activity, health awareness and cost-effective healthy cooking. They are also planning ‘From Garden to the Plate’, which will develop a small group program for up to 16 people to meet for about three hours over 10 weeks. They will learn a variety of skills around healthy cooking and be part of caring for a garden bed at the community garden. MAIN COMMITTEE",159,Adjournment
295,Mr Sidebottom (Braddon) (12.46 Pm),"I am very happy to talk about a move to turnThe people on the mighty west coast are clocking up the kilometres in ‘Swim the West Coast’, where individuals or teams are being encouraged to register and record kilometres swum at the region’s community pools. The winning team or individual with the highest combined kilometres will win a season ticket to their local pool for the coming season. The central coast is working with the North-West Environment Centre and the Penguin Sustainable Living Centre to coordinate a sustainable living festival. This will be followed by a series of workshops to teach garden skills, cooking skills and nutrition skills at the community garden. On King Island they are ‘Going for Gold or Growing Old Living Dangerously’, which involves exercise and activities for over 50s. As you can see, it is a fantastic program that is well piloted in the north-west coast of Tasmania. (Time expired) Petition: Youth Allowance Ms MARINO (Forrest) (12.51 pm)-I rise to table a nationwide petition signed by just some of those who so strongly oppose the Labor government’s discrimination against students who, by the use of arbitrary lines by the government, have been classified as ‘inner regional’ when applying for independent youth allowance. This petition consists of thousands of signatures from people who believe that rural and regional students should have equity of access to a tertiary education or training. This Labor government made changes to youth allowance in 2009 which made it harder and, in some instances, impossible for regional students to access higher education or training. Originally I thought this may have been an unintended consequence but the continued resistance the government have shown-and as they have shown again today-to fixing this abominable legislation has unfortunately proven to me that this appears to have been a deliberately discriminatory action. I cannot assume anything else. There can be no other conclusion. The government have had two years to amend the legislation and fix the problems that they have created. Not only have the government chosen not to do so; they have blocked every move by this parliament, by the coalition, to end the discrimination and give certainty to thousands of regional and rural students around the nation. Why wouldn’t you want to do that? The will of the people is represented in this House and members of this House passed the motion to fix the problem. The Senate also conducted an inquiry where students, parents, families and organisations gave overwhelming evidence that the Labor government changes are unfair and have significant health, education and career impacts on regional and rural students. Recently the Senate passed Senator Nash’s bill to reinstate the former workplace criteria. But the Labor government have vehemently opposed every opportunity to fix the problem-which can only mean that the government are absolutely determined to continue to discriminate against inner regional students. I wonder why the government is so intent on denying regional students higher education and training. Why would you do this? The principal petitioner, Linda Brown, from my electorate of Forrest, described the changes to this legislation as ‘dumbing down regional students’. She had a daughter who was half-way through doing her gap year when the Prime Minister decided to change the criteria, which meant that her daughter was no longer eligible for a single gap year. The last thing her daughter wanted to do prior to taking on a four-year law degree was to be forced to work for another year-that is, if she can find work in the first place! Amanda Whittle’s submission to the Senate committee hearing said: MAIN COMMITTEE We live in Bunbury-2 hours from Perth-and I feel discriminated against as my two sons live in this so-called ‘Inner Regional’ area and will have to work 30 hours per week for 18 months, whereas closer to Perth in a neighbouring town, their friends need only to earn $19,500 over 12 months. Both go to the same school and both have to live away from home to study in Perth. I urgethe Labor governmentto have a fairer system for country families, which should be supporting country students and their families, not disadvantaging them. I have story after story. My office continues to receive contact over this issue. Unfortunately, young people are choosing not to take university pathways in years 11 and 12 as a result of this. That is a tragedy. This is not the education revolution the Labor government promised. For those students this is education discrimination. This issue is one of equity-equity of access to a tertiary education and a professional career. The parliament has sent clear messages to the Labor government that this legislation is flawed. I have called repeatedly for the Labor government, and those Independents who have voted against every move to end this discrimination, to stop blocking the attempts to give rural and regional students a fair go. I am really disappointed that again the Independents have sold out the interests of their young constituents. In conclusion, I would really like to take the opportunity to thank Linda Brown and thank my colleagues-the members for Farrer, Grey, Groom, Hume, Murray and Wannonfor their work and effort in collecting signatures. honourable member for Forrest wishes to table the petition? has gone through the committee. approved so it will be received pursuant to standing order 207. The petition read as followsTo the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives This petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House the deep concern students, parents and families have, throughout Australia, regarding the Labor Federal Government’s changes to Youth Allowance, In particular the exclusion of students residing In the Inner Regional zone of the Australian Standard Geographical Classification -Remoteness Area (ASGC-RA) map from Subsection ICE (a) of the Social Security and Other Legislation Amendment (Income Support for Students) Bill 2010. The exclusion of the Inner Regional zone has and will continue to disadvantage Australian students within this classification, and deter many students from obtaining a higher education. The lack of financial assistance available for students who must relocate to study is hindering the opportunities of all young people. We therefore ask the Government and the House to act on Nola Marino’s Motion which was passed 28 October 2010 to include Inner Regional students in Subsection ICE (a) of the Social Security and Other Legislation Amendment (Income Support for Students) Bill 2010. from 4,257 citizens MAIN COMMITTEE",161,Adjournment

Clean Up Australia Day Mrs D’ATH (Petrie) (12.57 pm)-I rise today to talk about an important event that is happening on Sunday, 6 March across this country: Clean Up Australia Day. This is an important event, one that I am sure many, if not all, members of this parliament participate in on an annual basis. I certainly have enjoyed being part of Clean Up Australia Day in previous years. I wish we did not have to do this. I wish that our streets, beaches and parklands were clean all the time, but the reality is that is not the case. An event like this, Clean Up Australia Day, is not just a great opportunity to get that rubbish picked up. It is also a chance to lift awareness in our community about the importance of not dumping materials and about the damage that dumping actually does. I talk about it being this Sunday, but on Tuesday this week, 1 March, there was Business Clean Up Australia Day and tomorrow, Friday4 March, there will be School Clean Up Australia Day. I know that a number of my schools are going to be out there tomorrow with a clean-up team. I was at Clontarf Beach State High School only a week ago and met some of the students who will be out there tomorrow helping to clean up our wonderful Redcliffe Peninsula. The Clean Up Australia Day Council, in their press releases and on their website, have outlined the types of rubbish that are normally found in Queensland during Clean Up Australia Days. The top five rubbish items are small paper, polystyrene pieces, cigarette butts, bottle caps and lids, and plastic bags. My electorate is surrounded by Moreton Bay, a beautiful bay in which we have dugongs and dolphins. Sometimes we have the pleasure of seeing the whales swimming north. These materials in our waters are devastating. It really is quite distressing to see some of the pictures of what they do to our turtles, fish, dolphins and dugongs. We are working hard to educate our children in the schools in the surrounding area as they are told to make sure that they put their own rubbish in the bin and that, if they happen to be walking past a plastic bag that they see on the ground-whether they put it there or not-they should pick it up and put it in the bin. They know where it could end up and the damage that it could do. In Queensland we expect to find during this Clean Up Australia Day this year-and the Clean Up Australia Day Council has noted this-different things in addition to our normal rubbish items as a consequence of the floods and what is still washing up on our beaches. Across the entire Redcliffe Peninsula our beaches are still closed. They were closed the day before Australia Day and they remain closed because of what is washing up on our shores and also because of the quality of the water. Despite it being tidal, the quality of that water is still at a level that is not healthy for people to swim in. It is going to take some time before we see those waterways improving. I have registered this year with the Redcliffe Environmental Forum, who will be cleaning up Hays Inlet, a very important area of the Redcliffe Peninsula. It includes fishery nurseries. It is a natural water treatment system in its own right. It is an air purifier. The bushland areas around Hays Inlet are very good at absorbing carbon dioxide from the air. The scenery is exquisite. Our wildlife is amazing. Because of the importance of the wading migratory birds in the area, it is listed as an internationally significant area under the Ramsar convention. SoI will be out there with my children, just as they have helped me in previous years, cleaning up this very important area. You can always leave it to the children to make the point. Last year MAIN COMMITTEE my children said to me, as we were driving away from cleaning up around the Deception Bay area with the Deception Bay Conservation Park members, ‘Why do we only do this one day a year? Why isn’t it all the time?’ We can only hope that message will get through and that Clean Up Australia Day will not be one single event each year as each day we will all play our part. (Time expired) Question agreed to. Main Committee adjourned at 1.03 pm MAIN COMMITTEE Superclinics (Question No. 13) Dr Southcott asked the Minister for Health and Ageing, in writing, on 30 September 2010: In respect of the first 36 sites for GP Super Clinics, for each Clinic: (1) Where is the site, and in what electorate does it reside. (2) Is it in an area (a) of high growth, (b) with poor access to GP services, or (c) with low socioeconomic status. (3) What is the Government’s financial contribution to its establishment. (4) On what date (a) was it announced, (b) did it become operational, (c) did it become fully operational, and (d) were first patients seen. (5) What is the total number of (a) patient visits, and (b) medical and allied health professionals providing services. (6) What services are offered. (7) What number of GP services are (a) billed, and (b) bulk billed to Medicare. (8) What number of other Medicare services is available, by type. (9) What number of existing GPs and allied health practices currently service this area, and what impact has the Clinic had on them. Ms Roxon-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (1) The location of the 36 GP Super Clinics, including information on their electorate is referred to in the table attached. (2) Note that the 36 sites were selected against the following principles, rather than the three criteria identified in this question: Poor access to health services; Poor health infrastructure; Where a GP Super Clinic could help take pressure off emergency departments; High levels of chronic disease and/or populations with high needs, such as large numbers of children or the elderly; and Areas currently experiencing, or anticipated to experience, rapid population growth. Please refer to the table attached for responses against each site, as per the criteria listed above. Data obtained from: http://www.doctorconnect.gov.au/internet/otd/Publishing.nsf/Content/locator (at time of location announcement); http://www.publichealth.gov.au; and The socioeconomic indexes for areas (SEIFA) score as per the Australian Bureau of Statistics 2006 Census data. (3) Please refer to the table attached. (4) (a) The original 31 locations to receive a GP Super Clinic were announced (from late August to late November 2007) as 2007 election commitments. The Government announced a further five locations in late 2009 (Cockburn WA, Gunnedah NSW, Portland, Wodonga and South Morang VIC). Dates for the announcement of Funding Agreements to establish the individual clinics are identified in the table below. (b) (c) In a number of instances (e.g. Modbury and Noarlunga, SA and Ipswich and Brisbane Southside, QLD), the capital works projects for a GP Super Clinic involves separate stages/phases of construction. Upon completion of a stage/phase of construction, it is expected that a GP Super Clinic will commence service delivery and therefore become operational. Where a GP Super Clinic has a staged or phased implementation, all stages/phases are required to be completed before the project is deemed to have achieved ‘Practical Completion’ under the terms of the Funding Agreement. Refer to the table attached for further details. Some funding recipients have decided to offer services prior to the commencement of construction of their GP Super Clinic or while construction is underway. These clinics are deemed to be delivering ‘early services’, rather than being deemed ‘operational’, as the construction project has not been completed. Early services are being delivered at ten sites: Blue Mountains, North Central Coast, Riverina (NSW); Bendigo and Wodonga (VIC); Townsville, Cairns and Gladstone (QLD); and Modbury and Noarlunga (SA). (d) The Department does not collect this information. (5) (a) Information regarding patient service numbers is confidential under the secrecy provisions (Section 130) of the Health Insurance Act 1973, as it would provide activity and billing information for individual medical practices. As the Australian Government does not own or operate GP Super Clinics, recruitment and engagement of service providers is the responsibility of the owner/operator of each clinic. (b) The number of GPs and nurses are indicated in the answers to Question6 below. The Department of Health and Ageing (the Department) does not keep data on the number of allied health professionals, rather the range of allied services provided that address the needs of the local communication are monitored, also outlined in Question6 below. (6) The eight operational GP Super Clinics have advised that they offer the following services: Ballan (VIC) The clinic offers services by (3.5) General Practitioners (GPs), (1.4) practice nurses, a dentist, physiotherapist, dietician, podiatrist, occupational therapist, psychologist and a pathologist. Other services include echo cardiograms, audiology, district nursing, community health nursing, women’s clinics, chronic disease management, drug and alcohol support services, welfare support services and transport connection, and a 24 hour emergency care by the GPs but provided in the Bush Nursing Hospital. Devonport (TAS) The clinic provides access to a wide range of multidisciplinary, integrated primary care services, provided by (11.8) GPs, (5) practice nurses and allied health professionals, including: audiologist, osteopath, psychiatrist, occupational physicians, rheumatologist, orthopaedic surgeon and consultant physician.

The clinic offers family appointments, drop-in appointments and opportunities for longer consultations for people with complex and chronic conditions. An Urgent Care After Hours Service is available. Port Stephens (NSW) The clinic provides access to a broad range of services and specific in-house and outreach aged care services through its (4) GPs (including 2 female), (2) practice nurses; and a range of allied health practitioners including a diabetes educator, psychologist, podiatrist, pharmacists (medication review), visiting medical specialist (geriatrician) and physiotherapist. There is also a dedicated aged care service available every Tuesday and Thursday morning. Southern Lake Macquarie (NSW) The clinic offers a range of services by (4) FTE GPs and (2) part-time GPs, (5) part time Nurses and a range of allied health practitioners including podiatrists, a Dietitian, a Social Worker, a Psychologist, and an Occupational Therapist. Services include: hydrotherapy, rehabilitation services, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, pathology, psychology, dietetics, speech therapy, podiatry, visiting medical specialists (cardiology, urology and gynaecology), a number of clinics and support groups and targeted services for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Strathpine (QLD) The clinic offers services by (8) GPs, (9) nurses (practice, mental health and Indigenous health), and allied health professionals including a dietician/diabetes educator, physiotherapist, exercise physiologist, chiropractor, psychologist and podiatrist. X-ray, ultrasound and audiology services are also available. (7) This information is confidential under the secrecy provisions (Section 130) of the Health Insurance Act 1973, as it would provide activity and billing information for individual medical practices. (8) This information is confidential under the secrecy provisions (Section 130) of the Health Insurance Act 1973, as it would provide activity and billing information for individual medical practices. (9) Release of small area data is potentially problematic as there may be issues with privacy and confidentiality under the secrecy provisions (Section 130) of the Health Insurance Act 1973.

(6) What anticipated numbers of health and allied professionals will be providing services. (7) What number of existing GPs and allied health practices currently service this area. Ms Roxon-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (1) The 2010 Budget identified funding for approximately 23 GP Super Clinics. Subsequent to the election this was refined to the establishment of 28 new GP Super Clinics and the expansion of the Redcliffe GP Super Clinic. The location of the 29 GP Super Clinic projects, including information on their electorate is referred to in the table below. (2) (a) (b) (c) Note that the 29 GP Super Clinics sites were identified under the following principles as identified in the GP Super Clinics National Program Guidelines 2010, rather than the three criteria underpinning this question: Poor access to health services; Poor health infrastructure; Where a GP Super Clinic could help take pressure off emergency departments; High levels of chronic disease and/or populations with high needs, such as large numbers of children or the elderly; and Areas currently experiencing, or anticipated to experience, rapid population growth.

Citizenship, in writing, on 30 September 2010: In respect of passengers of unauthorised boat arrivals detained on Christmas Island: (1) What information is gathered by the Minister’s departmental officials on Christmas Island from detainees at their initial interview. (2) Do these interviews include questions to ascertain an applicant’s previous country of residence, in addition to their country of birth/origin. (3) From these interviews, how many of the detainees held on Christmas Island in the period 1 August 2008 to 30 September 2010 were residents, for more than three months prior to arriving on Christmas Island, in a country different to their country of birth/origin. (4) For each detainee in part (3): (a) what was their country of birth/origin, (b) in which country had they been residing prior to arriving on Christmas Island, and (c) for what length of time. (1) The initial interview which is called the entry interview is conducted by departmental officers and is primarily intended to confirm biodata provided by irregular maritime arrivals (IMAs) and ascertain whether the individual IMA, prima facie, engages Australia’s protection obligations under the 1951 Refugee Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol (The Refugee Convention). The entry interview is also used to collect information to ascertain their personal history, establish how and why they came to Australia, the travel routes taken to arrive in Australia and the reasons for coming to Australia. (2) Yes, the entry interview includes questions about the interviewee’s previous country or countries of residence, in addition to their country of birth/origin. (3) The information held by the department does not specifically relate to the time frames in the question. However, we can advise that approximately 45% of the IMAs who arrived in Australia from 1 August 2008 to 19 August 2010 indicated that their last country of long-term residence was outside their country of birth, or that they had spent more than three months in a single transit point en route to Australia. Data analysis has not yet been completed for IMA clients who arrived in Australia after 19 August 2010. (1) (a) The country of birth of IMAs described in part (3) is as follows: Afghanistan 75.3% Iraq 9.8% Sri Lanka 6.6% Burma 3.4% Iran 2.1% Kuwait 1.4% Pakistan 0.4% Vietnam 0.3%",163,Adjournment

Curtin Detention Centre (Question No. 22) Mr Morrison asked the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, in writing, on 30 September 2010: (1) Since the previous Minister’s announcement, what actions, including but not limited to, physical construction, detailed design and the procurement of construction materials, have been taken to recommission the Curtin Detention Facility. (2) As at 30 September 2010, what was the cost of all works referred to in part (1). (3) What will be the total capacity, including any staged development, of the recommissioned Curtin Detention Facility. (4) What is the cost of all proposed works involved in recommissioning the Curtin Detention Facility, including the costs of the initial development and any subsequent development. (5) Is there any requirement for the works at the Curtin Detention Facility to be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works; if so, when will it be referred. (1) Since the previous Minister’s announcement on 18 April 2010 that RAAF Base Curtin would be used to accommodate Irregular Maritime Arrivals (IMAs), the Department of Immigration and Citizenship has commenced a staged refurbishment and upgrade program at the site. The first stage was completed on 11 June 2010 to ensure the site’s suitability for the accommodation of single adult male IMAs. This provided accommodation, covered walkways, raised decking, recreation marquees, communications, a kitchen upgrade, gym equipment, a mini soccer field and primary medical facilities. By mid-November 2010, accommodation for a further 300 people became available. Other works completed by that time include development of a concept master plan and the installation of demountable buildings for gymnasiums, recreation rooms and religious rooms. Work to bring the accommodation capacity of Curtin to 1200 people was completed in late December 2010. Other ongoing work includes construction of a commercial kitchen, library, classrooms, canteen, visitor centre, a sports ground, administration areas and additional medical and interview rooms. Upgrades to the power, water and sewer systems are also underway. (2) As at 30 September 2010, the Department had paid or accrued invoices totalling $20.2 million. (3) 1200 single adult males.

307,Mr Bowen,The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:,180,Questions In Writing
308,Mr Bowen,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(a) where are these minors being detained, and (b) what is the breakdown of this group by (i) age, (ii) gender, and (iii) country of origin. (2) For each nationality group of detainees, what is the average processing time for an accompanied minor in detention compared to that for adults of the same nationality. (3) Where unaccompanied minors are not in possession of identification documents to verify their age, does his department undertake tests to confirm the age of detainees in all cases; if not, why not; if so, what method of age identification testing does his department use, why does it use this method in preference to any other available method(s), and how many tests have been conducted since August 2008. (4) What are the findings of any examinations/tests that have been performed, and what medical studies does his department rely upon to confirm that the results of any medical examinations/tests are reliable. (5) Since August 2008, how many examinations/tests undertaken have identified detainees claiming to be minors to in fact be 18 years of age or older, and what actions have been taken in respect of the detention arrangements for those detainees. (6) What processes are in place to allow unaccompanied minors to sponsor family members to Australia. (7) Which family members are eligible to be sponsored, and under the provisions of what stream of the migration or refugee and humanitarian program do they enter Australia. (8) How long does it take to process the application of a family member sponsored by an unaccompanied minor; and how many family members of unaccompanied minors have been sponsored to Australia, and what visas were they issued. (1) As at close of business 24 November 2010, there were a total of 443 unaccompanied minors in immigration detention. (a) Please see the table below regarding the locations of where these minors were detained as at 24 November 2010. (b) Due to privacy reasons, the Department is unable to provide the breakdown for these groups as requested in (i), (ii) and (iii) because this level of detail would make some individual cases identifiable.

The number of UAMs column with an * indicates that the number of UAM Irregular Maritime Arrivals in this location is less than 10. The figure cannot be reported due to privacy reasons. (2) The average processing time for accompanied minors is no different to adults, as accompanied minors are processed at the same time as their parents. Family groups from the below nationalities have the following average processing time: (a) Afghani: 125 days (b) Iranian: 119 days (c) Iraqi: 171 days (d) Kuwaiti: 174 days (e) Palestinian: 148 days (f) Sri Lankan: 271 days (g) Stateless: 167 days (3) The Department seeks to establish and/or verify the identity of persons who arrive in Australia without documentary evidence. Age is just one aspect of identity that the Department seeks to establish in relation to undocumented clients. Where it is not clear whether a client is over or under 18 years of age, the Department seeks to establish this by taking into account a range of information, including undertaking focused interviewing with the client, taking into account results from medical tests that the client has undertaken, and contacting family members through contact details provided by clients. The Department also works with clients to locate documentation which is relevant to establishing their identity. The Department’s approach to age determination is informed by the approach taken in the refugee assessment context internationally. Because of the challenging nature of age determination, the Department is developing enhanced policy in this area and in that context providing more robust guidance for Departmental decision makers. The Department is always looking for ways to strengthen policies and technologies in this area to support decision makers. The Department does not keep separate statistics on the number of cases where age determination processes have been undertaken, as establishing age is just one aspect of identity checking that the Department undertakes in relation to undocumented clients. (4) The issue of age determination is often complex, with many clients who arrive as Irregular Maritime Arrivals presenting with no proof of identity and often not being able to provide a date or even a year of birth. The Department’s approach to age determination is to seek to establish whether it is more likely that a client is over or under 18 years of age, taking into account a range of information, rather than seeking to attribute a particular age to the client. (5) As noted above, the Department does not keep separate statistics on the number of cases where age determination processes have been undertaken, as this is just one aspect of establishing identity. The Department can confirm that there have been some cases where, following examination of age-related claims, clients claiming to be minors have been assessed to be adults. In such cases, clients are provided with an opportunity to comment on this finding and to provide further information in support of their age-related claims. The Department will treat a person claiming to be a minor as an adult from the date that a determination that they are an adult is made. (6) Unaccompanied minors can sponsor family members to Australia under the Humanitarian program or under the Migration program. Under the Humanitarian program, a minor who has been granted a permanent Refugee and Humanitarian, Protection or Resolution of Status visa can be the proposer for a Humanitarian visa for relatives including their immediate family members (including spouses or de-facto partners; dependent children, including step and adopted children; and parents, including step and adoptive parents). However, an application made with respect to a parent can only be granted where the proposer is under the age of 18 at both time of application and at the time of decision. Under the Migration program, a person must generally be over the age of 18 years in order to sponsor family members under the Family stream. However, in the Remaining Relative, Carer, Parent and Partner visa classes there is a provision that allows certain other people to be the sponsor on the minor’s behalf. (7) Family members eligible to be sponsored or proposed under the family stream of the Migration program and under the Humanitarian Program are outline below: Program Relatives able to be sponsored or proposed Humanitarian Program Humanitarian (subclasses 200– Spouses, de facto partners, parents (including adoptive par204) ents), children (including adopted children), siblings, grandparents, aunts/uncles, nieces/nephews, cousins, distant relatives and friends. Relatives include step-relatives. Migration Program Parent (subclass 103, 804) and Parents (including step and adoptive parents) who satisfy Contributory Parent (subclasses the Balance of Family (BoF) test. This requires them to 143, 173, 864 and 884) demonstrate that at least half of their children are lawfully and permanently resident in Australia or, alternatively, that they have more children lawfully and permanently resident in Australia than in any other single country. Carer (subclasses 836 and 116) Grandparents (including step-grandparents), grandchildren (including step-grandchildren), aunts/uncles (including step-aunts/uncle), nieces/nephew (including stepnieces/nephews) in addition to spouses, de facto partners, parents (including step and adoptive parents), children (including step and adoptive children), and siblings (including step-siblings) Remaining Relative (subclasses Children (including step and adoptive children), siblings 835 and 115) and step-siblings Partner (subclasses 300, 309, 100, Prospective spouse, spouse or de facto partner. 820 and 801) It should be noted that, depending on the visa class applied for, there may additional criteria relating to the relationship between an applicant and their sponsor or proposer, which might prevent a visa being granted. For example, in order to propose an immediate family member under the Humanitarian program, the immediate family member must have been a family member at the time that the proposer’s visa was granted (where the proposer was granted a Refugee or Humanitarian visa) or at the time that the proposer made their visa application (where the proposer was granted a Protection or Resolution of Status visa). (8) Normal service standards apply to the processing of visa applications, regardless of whether the sponsor or proposer is an unaccompanied minor. The Department is unable to provide details of the number and type of visas granted to family members of unaccompanied minors as this level of detail is not captured by Departmental records. Ministers and Ministerial Staff: Mobile Phones and iPads (Question Nos 147 and 148) Mr Briggs asked the Minister for Resources and Energy and the Minister for Tourism, in writing, on 25 November 2010: (1) How many (a) mobile phones, (b) blackberries and (c) I-Pads are currently allocated to the (i) Minister, and (ii) the Minister’s ministerial staff.
