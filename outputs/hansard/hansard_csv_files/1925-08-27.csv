28,Bank; Such Committee To Consist Of Mr Bren,"Young was for 30 years with the Colonial Bank. In 1912 he occupied the position of Inspector of Branches of that institution. He was then appointed to the Commonwealth Bank by the late Sir Denison Miller, as the first manager of its Melbourne branch. mained with the bank unti l the 17th October, 192t!. During the period from 1912 to 1923 he occupied, first, the position of manager i u Melbourne and Sydney, and afterwards, aud until the date of his retirement, was then called inspector, but was really the chief inspector of the bank. office ranked next to that of the Deputy Governor. Sir Denison Miller died in June, 1923, and MrK e l l was appointed Acting Governor.*! During Mr Kell's control of the bank certain circumstances arose which led to Mr Young's retirement. MrK e l l affirmed that Mr Young failed to get on with other officers, and Mr Young asserts that he was practically forced to retire, and that if he failed to get ou with other officers the fault was wholly theirs. certain serious charges against the management, and they constitute the reasons for an inquiry. His charges and statement of the circumstances surrounding his retirement are contained in a letter to the Acting Governor( MrK e l l ) , dated the 15th October, 1923, four months after the death of Sir Denison Miller. I do not intend to take up the time of the committee by reading the whole of that letter, but I shall quote certain portions of it which I think j u s t i fy an inquiry. Many of the statements are personal, and I do not think that a claim for a select committee could be justly based on the individual grievances of an officer. In any large institution individuals at times consider that they have grievances. The only question that arises in such circumstances is whether the in terests of the individual are to be weighed against the interests of the institution. It might be argued that if an inquiry is to be granted into the individual grievances of one officer, those of any other, even office boy, should be similarly in vestigated. committee should not be lightly invoked, nor should this Housei n ordinary circumstances be asked to adjudicate upon the differences of individuals on the staff of a largo institution. But Mr Young makes charges of mismanagement against the high officers in the bank, and suggests that those charges were the cause of his enforced retirement. To have a claim upon the attention of the House such He recharges must come from an officer occupying a very high position in the bank. If a junior officer alleged mismanagement on the part of his superiors, the majority of members would agree that his allegations were not necessarily worthy of inquiry by a select committee; but when the officer who was next in authorI n ordinary circumstances his ity to the Deputy Governor makes charges of mismanagement, fhey call for grave consideration. Parliament must be concerned in any serious and authoritative statement regarding the management of a great Commonwealth institution. In Mr Youngs letter is a statement attributed to MrK e l l, and not denied by him, that Mr Young had not failed in his duties as inspector, and that he had always got on well with hi m ( Mr Kell) . I mention that statement in anticipation -of any suggestion that Mr Young's Moreover, he made retirement was essential to the maintenance of discipline within the bank. Mr. Young made tlie definite accusation that the war loan registers had never been adjusted, and that their condition was a scandal. "" adjusted "" t means that the registers had not been properly kept, and that transfers of stock could not be traced. Further, he asserted that there exists in the bank a cabal, or inner circle, of higher ofiicers, who help each other to suppress any criticism of the management. to read Mr Young's exact statement instead of merely summarizing it V hardly necessary to read the whole of the letter. unnecessary, but the House should know exactly what Mr Young did say about the specific matters mentioned by the of an honourable member.

34,Mr Mann,"The first charge wasscandal', and constituted the gravest possible reflection upon the officer of the bank who was clearlj responsible for tlie communication to the press' to: which P have referred'. To that communication I have not considered"" it necessary to refer. pended f with the case. This is a charge-against tlie management of the bank. If the Prime Minister will permit me not to -disturb the continuity of my remarks I shall shortly endeavour to quote, other portions of the letter, which I think I have marked, but. which I cannot for the -moment locate. The next charge is* one -of improper treatment of the inspector's reports'on the Sydney branch, which he had declared to be inefficient. parently, in this instance, the charge is that Mr Kell did not properly support Mr Young, as an inspector having fhe right to point out irregularities. Another charge is one against the management' of the bank of resistance tonecessary reforms, two of which Mr Young specifically sets out. The first has relation to the savings bank system, and the second te a self-clearing system between the branches of the bank. These are reforms which Mr Young, as inspector, had recommended to the management, but which it had neglected to .carry out. 1 admit, of course, that it was within the authority of the management to disregard those recommendations. it is suggested by Mr Young that because of his malting these recommendations,, and because of his criticism of the management, he was finally removed from the staff of the bank. It seems to me that these charges are sufficiently serious to justify an inquiry. Had Mr Young made the charges lightly, and without justification, simply in furtherance of some personal grievance, he would be worthy of severe censure. If ha has done that he must accept responsibility for his action and take the risk of any reprimand which may beadministered if the proposed committee considers that the charges were unjustified. But ib seems to nie that the charges themselves call for attention. If it is contended that this House should not interfere with the bank at all, and that because the institution was established under a special act and made free from political control no authority should be exercised over the management of the bank by this House except by the passage of amending legislation!, that is a very important and weighty argument. Buti f it can be definitely shown that there has been gross mismanagement; of the bank, who is there i o exercise author r it y over it. except this Parliament ? AsT h a t has nothing to do the bank was constituted there was no super-authority at all. I do not suggest that the grossest abuses have occurred, but,, if there have been abuses, there is nobody to. correct them unless this House takes upon itself the responsibility of inquiring into them. The Commonwealth' Bank, which was constituted by Parliament, has done great work, and X wish to be guarded in my statements. I do not suggest that abuses have A ptaken place. I wish to enter upon the inquiry with an open m in d ; but if definite charges of mismanagement are made by a responsible officer, they certainly merit further inquiry. There is a particular reason why the House might reasonably beasked to intervene in this case, namely, that the retirement of Mr Young, vvhich he alleges took place owing to the pressure brought to bear upon him on account of his reports, occurred at a. particular time and under peculiar circumstances. It was during the interregnum in the control of the bank. The Governor had died,, and the Deputy Governor had been appointed Acting Governor. Although the Acting But Governor undoubtedly had all the authority of a Governor, so far as the administration of the. bank was concerned,, he was the official who made this change, and there was nobody to interfere with him. It was at a time when questions with regard to the future management of the bank were under grave consideration, and there was nobody to intervene between the Acting Governor and the officer, who, because he objected to the alleged mismanagement, was removed'. Therefore no authority, except this House, can intervene at the present time. That there were some apparent prima facie groundsfor an inquiry was, in effect, acknowledged by the Government, in thati t offered to refer the inquiry to the present directors of the bank. Mr Young has objected to that course being followed, and, I think with a eertain amount of reason. No t only from his own point of view, but also from the point of view of the new"" directors, I",17,Commonwealth Bank Retirement Of Mr M B Youn G
35,Mr Whitsitt,"Was that officer, sus",18,Commonwealth Bank Retirement Of Mr M B Youn G
36,Mr Mann,"think that it was hardly a satisfactory solution of the difficulty. This board has been newly appointed, and it has taken on the management under entirely new conditions. Kell, who is the principal person concerned in this charge, and it was certainly a little unreasonable, I think, to ask, that the board, as one of its first duties, should undertake an' inquiry into the conduct of a colleague, who alone had come over from the old management and had to work under new conditions. It did not seem to me to be quite fair or just to the new directors, and from Mr Young's point of view I think it might reasonably be said that it would be difficult to insure that such an inquiry would be entirely fair to him. I shall not say impartial, for that seems. to imply that the directors would be deliberately prejudiced against him. duce personalities. I wish to deal with the matter in a purely impartial spirit. It seems to me that the dice must be loaded against Mr Young, if the other party to the dispute was.one of the colleagues of the board which was asked to adjudicate upon it . pointed subsequent to the reports by the inspector ? subsequent to Mr Young's retirement, which took place during the interregnum, when Mr Kell was acting Governor. B y passing the amending Commonwealth BankB ill the House has already admitted that the old form of authority required alteration, and that for other reasons a different board and different conditions of management were desirable. also be suggested that an alteration was required for internal reasons; I do not say that it was, but it is equally reasonable to suppose that it , might be. This, in itself, seems to suggest that the House should certainly look back to the period before the regime of the present board, consider the management of the bank as it was originally constituted, and ascertain whether in this and other respects it was all that was expected of it . In the amending bill it was recognized, particularly, that the interests of officers specially, required safeguarding. board was created to t r y to prevent complaints or disaffection from arising, in any section of the staff. What Mr Young asks for is, that if some such cause of offence has occurred in his case, a simiI t has to work with Mr lar right should be given to h i m, having in view, especially, that he was a highlyplaced and responsible officer. It may be alleged that Mr Young was not qualified for the position he held, and complaints to that effect may have been made by MrK e l l. If Mr Young had no right to the position, who was responsibleMr Young, Mr Kell, or the late Sir Denison Miller, who placed h im in his position? . He was called an inspector, but his position was equivalent to that of chief in spector. The statements to which I have referred haye been circulating for some time, and have been mentioned on several occasions in this. House. It is most desirable that the matter should be dealt with openly, and finally disposed I do not desire to introof. It is not satisfactory that rumours of this kind regarding an important public institution should be unanswered. A3 regards the conditions under which Mr. Young finally severed his connection with tlie bank, I would point out that he states that Mr Kell endeavoured to force h i m to resign, and that pressure was put W as the board apupon h i m in a very extraordinary manner. He was informed that he could be retained on the staff of the bank only in an inferior position to that which he had previously occupied, or, in other words, that he must be degraded. Thep r in cipal charge alleged against h i m was that he could not work amicably with other officers-virtually , that he was an in tractable man. He challenged that statement, and no definite charges were brought against him, but, on the conI t may trary, only one year before his retirement he was appointed by the authorities . of the bank as a delegate to the PanPacific Commercial Conference, which was held in Honolului n October, 1922, and in the latter part of his engagement he had specially committed to h i m the very important duty of valuing banks, for the acquisition of which negotiations . were proceeding. I can hardly conceive of any work in a bank that is more important or responsible, and his appointment to such a position makes it difficult for me to believe that he was turned out A of the bank because he was intractable. If there are other charges against him,",18,Commonwealth Bank Retirement Of Mr M B Youn G

A t the present time we are simply considering ex parte statements, but I suggest to the House that those statements are sufficiently important to warrant further investigation, and that the charges are 3uch that they should be answered, not merely in private communications, but in public, and by the management of the bank. If the management of the bank feels justified in doing so, it should come out into the open and meet this challenge with au equal challenge. I hope that in presenting this matter to the HouseI have avoided any undue exhibition of prejudice or partisanship. I assure the Mouse that 1 have none. If this committee is appointed and I become a member of it , I intend to sift the allegations on both sides to the bottom, and I am equally prepared, according to the evidence, to censure either Mr Young for the action he has taken, or Mr Kell for his attitude to Mr Young. I leave the matter entirely iu the hands of honourable members. 1 ask the House not to constitute itself at this stage a final judge of the details of the case, but to determine whether, on the facts I have cited, there is a prima facie case calling for further inquiry. ter and Minister for External Affairs) : 3.18] -This subject has been discussed in tliis House on a previous occasion, and bas been referred to several times. The motion now submitted provides me .with an opportunity to explain the facts. The honourable member for Perth( Mr The latter portion refers to the charge Mann) said he did not think that the appointment of committees to . investigate merely personal grievances was justified. In that I entirely agree, for it would be intolerable if all the personal grievances of public servants could be the subject of discussion in this House and of the appointment, of commissions or --ommittees of inquiry. I agree that if the allegations made reflect upon the management of the bank, an investigation -dtould be made. I shall place the charges f a i r l y before honourable members so that they may understand their seriousness, and determine the most suitable manner in which to deal with If the proposed committee them. The whole case is based upon a letter written by Mr Young on the 15th October, 19.23. A t a later date-mainl y because of remarks made in this House when this matter was before us previously -that gentleman was asked whether there were any other matters of which he complained. He replied that his charges were all contained in his letter. A t no time has Mr Young suggested that additional matters required investigation. H is whole case rests upon the statements in his letter, from which the mover of the motion ( Mr Mann) has this afternoon read extracts, referring in a general way to other matters dealt w i th in it . A considerable part of the letter discusses the offer of a position to Mr Young, which he decided not to accept, because its acceptance would have required him to leave Sydney to reside elsewhere. The letter deals also with the compensation payable to h i m in the event of his retiring from the service of the bank; and it is suggested in it that other officers of the . bank entertained a personal animus against h i m , and desired to get r i d nf him. The letter commencedYou have made your desire to eompel my retirement from the serviee of the bank very clear. It is very evident that, at any cost, you are determined that ' I shall no longer be able to serve the Commonwealtli Bank. Personal references to other officials of the bank occur. Dealing with the attitude of Mr Kell towards h i m, Mr Young writesI informed you that I attributed your design to the malign influence which has so long been at work to undermine me. . . . I asserted that such a charge was a fabrication to discredit me, and had no foundation. that Mr Young was a difficult person to work with. In another portion of the letter, it is stated that I presume that no other way but to reiterate this calumny presented itself to those who were so active to thwart and prejudice me, to "" their own personal advantage. Another .passage readsThe fact is that a deliberate plan has been followed to create this feeling by studied aggression and encroachments, which have not -been checked.

41,Mr Bruce (Flinders,"Prime Minisso. I acquainted you with thc fact tliat I was not unaware of the opinions entertained hy some of the members of the coterie regarding one another, which, to say tlic least, are not altogether flattering to them. That, however, is more or less irrelevant to a statement of »ny own case. Those extracts are all in the nature of a statement of a personal grievance, which the mover of the motion said should he put aside by the House when dealing with this case. While agreeing w i th that view, J. draw attention to the tone adopted in the letter. There can be little doubt that when Mr Young wrote it , he was convinced that there was something like a conspiracy against him, and that every man's hand was against him. That conviction permeates the whole communicRtion. The most important part of the letter is that in which definite charges are made regarding the administration, and the position of the bank. that I t is true that in the course of my duties I of his letter to Mr Kell, Mr Young have at times had to reflect adversely on the conditions of affairs under the control of some of those officers, but I challenge them to prove that at any time any comment of mine was ever made in otlicr than an impersonal and impartial manner. Referring to another matter, Mr Young saysThen when I inspected the Sydney office subsequently, the reply of the manager to the comments that arose was couched in a most remarkable form. I do not think that so much bitterness has ever been imparted into such a communication. foran explanation of the matter complained of is, I believe, a novel form of procedure in replying to the inspector's observations. The first of the definite charges deals with the condition of the war loan registers. About this, Mr Young saidI have already alluded to the condition of the War Loan Department. True, the provision uf a proper system was undertaken by myself only in consequence of the failure to do so of the oflicer who should have introduced the necessary scheme. The opposition, obstruction, and delay which followed are matters of record, ancl, as I have already said, the registries have not even now been completely reconciled. I have often thought it is providential that the bank escaped, with so few frauds in connection with the War Savings Certificates, as well as bonds aud inscribed stock, as have come to light. . . .' At the same time, I reminded you that the position of the war loan registries-whicl i have not to this day been adjusted-amounte d to a scandal, and constituted the gravest possible reflection upon the oflicer of the bank who was clearly responsible for the communication to the press to which I have referred. The state of the war loan registers was referred to in this House on a previous occasion, and the Auditor-General has stated in a report that the books revealed a discrepancy. But it must be remembered that, during a period of nearly ten years, war loans amounting to approximately £300,000,000 were issued-borrowing of a magnitude never before attempted in Australia-and that the bank's staff was depleted by the enlistment of good men for active service. In these circumstances, to make much of a discrepancy of £3,500 is to exaggerate the seriousness of the position. properly kept, there would have been no discrepancy. honourable member must bear in mind the It is stated magnitude of these transactions, and the difficulties encountered. In another part saysWhile on the subject, perhaps, I might mention that I had the same difficulty iu connection with other matters for the' benefit of the bank. These schemes were not in all cases of my own initiation, but they had been unwarrantably set aside by officers to whom they had been referred, ami I had great difficulty in eventually having them brought into practice. The introduction of one of these systems enabled the balancing in tlie savings bauk department to be carried out promptly ancl effectively. This removed the disorder whicli previously prevailed owing to thc incessant deTo substitute personalities mands made upon the staff in their endeavours to balance under the old system. The selfclearing sj'stem between branches, with which you yourself are familiar, is another instance in which the adoption of modern methods was blocked. This system still awaits introduction. Those quotations all refer to things which Mr Young wanted done, but which were not done because of the difficulty of putting them into operation. It is conceivable that, in the administration of the affairs of the bank, there may have been considerable differences of opinion among its officers, but honourable members w ill agree that when such differences of opinion occur, the junior officer must give way, and the decisions of the senior officers must prevail. Other than the reference to the condition of the war loan registers, there are no serious charges in Mr Young's letter. It deals principally with differences of opinion between himself and those w i th whom he was associated. Beyond the statements in the",20,Commonwealth Bank Retirement Of Mr M B Youn G

A f t e r this matter was last referred to in this chamber, the Government went very f u l ly into it again, and came to the conclusion that, on the evidence before it , an inquiry of a public character was not required. The statements concerned the detailed management of the bank, and suggested that things were"" not as satisfactory as they should be. sidered thab, at all events in the first place, this was obviously a matter for consideration by the board of directors of the bank.

But the last paragraph of the letter I sent to the board readsTlie Government is most anxious that the fullest investigation should take place with regard to this matter, and will be obliged if, after your board has considered Mr Young's representations, you will submit a report so as to enable the Government to decide whether the circumstances warrant any further action such as tlie appointment of an independent tribunal further to consider Mr Young's allegations. That is the only course which the Government In the interests of the bank, and in the interests of Mr Young, it was only right that he should have an opportunity further establish his case. Certainly no impartial Young's letter could say that a seriovis charge of mismanagement the Commonwealth Mr Young wrote iu reply to the Government that he was not prepared to place his case before the bank directors, suggesting that they would not an impartial tribunal. pointed out to him that it was not contemplated that Mr Kel] would sit on the board when it investigated the case; that directors other than Mr Kell would conduct the investigation. was not prepared to accept that arrangement ; nothing would satisfy him but an open inquiry. Mr Bruce. ence, I sent the whole of the papers in the possession of the Government to"" the board of directors of the bank, and asked it to investigate the matter. The board communicated with Mr Young, and inquired of him whether he would attend the investigation. He replied that he had intimated to me that he would not attend. Accordingly, the board went on with the investigation of the matter so far as it could in his absence. The whole We conboard did not consider the matter; a subcommittee, consisting of Sir Robert Gibson and Mr Mackenzie Lees, was appointed by it to do so. I do not suppose We accordingly invited that any one would suggest that those two gentlemen were prejudiced persons.

The report which they submitted to the. board of directors was forwarded to the Government, and is to the' following effect: With regard to certain allegations made by Mr Mark B.

48,Mr Bruce,"It is most undesirable that we should introduce any element of political interference into the affairs of the bank. On the evidence that we have at present, this matter is solely one arising out of a difference of opinion between two senior officers. In the conduct of any business, if it is to be successful, some one's mind has to prevail, and when two officers cannot agree, the junior must in the end give way to the senior. I certainly advise honourable members not to accept this motion for the appointment of a committee, but to endorse the action of the Government, which I suggest was the right and proper one in all the circumstances. approach this matter with an open mind, because I have been a bank employee, and I have inspected branches under the supervision of a chief inspector. I consider that when a chief inspector has reported to his senior officer-in this case the Acting Governor of the Commonwealth Bank-that there is a discrepancy in the war loan register of £ 3 , 4 5 3, the matter should be investigated. official or some person connected with that institution must have received that money. It represents a loss to the bank. When the defalcation was reported it was the duty of the Acting Governor, or whoever might have been in charge, to accept the report of the chief inspector and make an investigation. The officer responsible for that register was evidently uuable to keep his books properly and must have been negligent in the performance of his duty. He and not the in spector should nave been suspended or disrated. The inspector did his duty, and when he submitted his report, the Acting Governor of the bank should there and then have taken his advice and not that of a subordinate officer. years before, under the regime of Sir Denison Miller. It was not brought to the attention of MrK e l l by Mr Young. What Mr Young told MrK e l l constituted a scandal was something that had happened in the past. chat the register had not been kept properly. I want to know who was the officer responsible, and who got the money. Evidently nobody knows. It may have been the officer in charge of the register. Because the inspector did his duty and wanted the matter investigated he was naturally regarded as a naughty boy. If a bank official loses a pound he has to make it good, but any money paid in excess is retained by the bank. Bank officials are expected to do their work accurately, and to keep their books properly. I commend the inspector for having done his duty. I am not acquainted with Mr Young, but I contend that if a man has suffered an injustice by doing his duty, his case should certainly be investigated. 'For that reason I shall vote for the motion. It is not very often that I have the pleasure of heartily supporting a motion which has been moved and seconded by honourable members behind the Government, but I offer my support for what it is worth to the motion moved by the honorahle member for Perth( MrM a n n ) . He has done me the honour of including my name Somei n the list of members whom he wishes to for m the proposed select committee, and perhaps, therefore, it is a little in vidious for me, from one point of view, to discuss the subject at this stage. But I take it that in including my name he was to some extent influenced by the fact that I occupy a position in relation to the matter very similar to his own, in that I was associated with the discussion that took place in this chamber on the 9th October last, as he is associated with it now. The honourable member for Fawkner( Mr Maxwell) and other honourable members on this side of the House also spoke during that discussion. I can assure the House that I have no desire to serve upon the committee if there is the slightest feeling amongst honourable members that by so doing the obtaining of an unbiased decision might be prejudiced in any way. ThereI leave the personal aspect of the case. Needless to say, I regret very much that the Prime Minister took the stand that he is opposed to the appointment of this committee. He was opposed to it in October last. But I take it that he leaves the proposal for the appointment of a select committee, originating as it does from the Government side of the House, for the discussion and decision of the",23,Commonwealth Bank Retirement Of Mr M B Youn G

I submit the view 1 ttra-t despite what the Prime Minister has said , tbe honourable member for Perth1 aneFthe .Darwin( Mr Whitsitt) have made out a good case for inquiry, which is at present all that we are asking for. We are told that the board is the proper body to make thisinquiry. I suggest that it is unbecoming for the Government to attempt 1 tff coerce this aggrieved ex-officer of the bank to go before a tribunal, which he has again and again argued is unsuited tohear and to decide upon the subject matter of hi s complaint. The fact that ; Mr Kell was the Acting Governor of the bank, and is at present a member of the directorate^ the fact that he is in close association with fellow members on that directorate, the fact that a sub-committee-, ex parte; an'd without having heard evidence, came to a sort of interimdecision on the merits of the case-all these facts make the objection against the board determining this question stronger to-day than it was on the 9th October last, when Mr Young made it perfectly clear that an iuquiry by the board would be unpalatable to him. As the honourable member for Perth( Mr some good reason, was quite unwillingto Mann) said, this motion is not a reflection, upon the board. There is a. well known maxim applying to the administra1 tion of justice that one should avoid, not only evident bias, but even the suspicion or suggestion of bias. terest has to be considered; the public has to be satisfied that there has been a disinterested anddispassionate inquiry by persons who had no preconceived ideas upon the issue, and no personal interest in it. un-fortunate for Mr Kell, who iff personally concerned in the charges made, and to be made,, by the late inspector of the bank,, that he went tosuch trouble to prevent a friendly inquiry by the Prime!

That fact unquestionably tells strongly against Mr Kell. honourable gentleman invitedthe. disMr Brennan. putants to ' come fee-fore him. Mr Young expressed his willingness to accept the invitation.

Instead of accepting the Prime Minister's invitation 1 honourable member for to appear before him. and discuss his difference with Mr Young, the acting governor confronted the right honourable gentleman with a legal opinion that he had noright to interrogate, him oa the subject of. the dispute.

The Prime Minister did not contend that he had the power to compel Mr Kell to come before him; he : did not arrogate the powers of a royal commission, to compel the attendance of witnesses; he merely invited the two gentlemen concerned to come to his office and' state their case. Mr Young consented, but Mr Kell, apparently for do so.

Something has been said regaining the merits of Mr Young's complaints. Neither when this matter was before the House on a previous occasion, nor to-day, has any honourable member presumed to pass judgment in this dispute. I do not pretend to know a great deal about these intricate financial matters which have given rise to the serious charges made by Mr Young, but tp some extent it has been necessary to go into the substance of the complaints. For instance, reference was made-unfor tunately, I think-to the fact that Mr supporters, but he will admit that no Young was considered to be a difficult man to deal with, or, as the honourable member for Perth( Mr Mann) better expressed it, "" an intractable man."" The evidence is that throughout his service with the bank he was held in the highest esteem by, not only the higher officers, but also the rank and file of the staff. His intractability simply amounts to a clash with certain senior officers, and we are asking that a select committee shall inquire into the merits of that clash. only showed itself during the last few months of his connection with the bank; it had been dormant for over 30 years. something of very recent growth. late Governor( Sir Denison Miller), who had controlled the destinies of the bank from its inception, had the very highest opinion of Mr Young, and selected him for positions of trust and authority, including the mission to the Honolulu conference. The Prime Minister said rather weakly that the subject of Mr Young's complaints cannot be regarded as very important, because in war loan transactions, amounting to hundreds of millions of pounds, the discrepancy in connection therewith amounted to a paltry few thousands of pounds. question at issue is not the amount of any particular discrepancy, but if , in fact, Mr Young, a senior officer of the bank, was punished because he had called attention repeatedly to certain inaccuracies in the accounts, a gross injustice was done, and that would not be a small mntter, but a very grave one. I am informed on very good authority that in connection with the war loan there was no adequate system of registration until a practical proposition by Mr Young was adopted in December, 1920. I should like the Prime Minister to take notice of the fact that the bank staff haa been constantly endeavouring to balance these accounts, and"" that up to 1923 no balance had been arrived at in respect of transactions dating from 1915 to 1920. Is that a trifling matter? Whether the view I take, or that taken by the Prime Minister, be right, surely these allegations justify an inquiry, and I ask the House to agree to the appointment of a select committee. Naturally, the Prime Minister's authority is recognized by his honourable member of the Opposition when addressing himself to this question has given any indication of party rancour; we have shown our desire to cooperate in a helpful spirit with minisferial members in trying to get justice done. I "" am quite aware that several motions for the appointment of select committees have been submitted to tbe House in recent months. I express no opinion upon the merits of other such motions, but in the last resort this Parliament is the highest and final tribunal in such matters, and I contend that the case we are discussing to-day is worthy of trial by the highest tribunal We must recognize the fact that Mr Young was not a The junior or unimportant officer of the bank. The fact that he was a trusted officer, almost the highest in the institution, and enjoyedthe esteem and confidence of those who knew him best-other wise he could not have been appointed to such a position-ar e cumulative reasons why the House should grant an inquiry into the grave charges he has made. The matter has not been finally settled by the somewhat argumentative ""speech of the Prime Minister, a speech which might well have been delivered after inquiry by a select committee, but as a The mere statement of half-truths was somewhat premature.

It seems to me that if Mr Young's case was very strong he would have taken advantage of the opportunity ^afforded him to bring it before Sir Robert Gibson and his colleague. place it before tlie Prime Minister. the objection that was raised by the honourable member for Perth( Mr Mann) to Mr Youtig appearing before the board of the bank, had MrK e l l been present, but we are told that only two members of the board were to make the inquiry, and that Mr Kel l was not one of them. -Something, I think, has been clone to ascertain the facts of the case, and it has been done by men who have peculiar facilities for finding out what those facts arc. say that it is impossible to trace, for example, the discrepancy of £3,000, and discover on whom the responsibility for it rests, I do not see how a select committee of this House could hope to go any further than those gentlemen have gone. Although a discrepancy of £3,000 is n considerable item, .we should remember that it related to a total sum of £300,000,000. The degree of error, therefore, was only one-thousandth part of. 1 per cent. I feel satisfied-that the Government took some action, at any rate, to ensure that Mr Young's case would be inquired into, and had the case been particularly strong I think that that officer would have taken advantage of the opportunity afforded h i m to have it in vestigated.

In ad*diti'on, the rates of preference agreed' upon should be mainthe intermediatetariff were to be applied tained, and that this end should be to corsets, wrought iron or steel pipes not exceeding 3 inches in diameter, goloshes and sand shoes, chassis and vehicle parts n-.e.r., and boiler tubes. The motion which I have submitted makes no alteration whatever in regard either to the Canadian goods to which tariff concessions are to be grantedor to the rates of duty which are to apply to those goods. The position remains precisely the same in this respect as it was under the original resolution. has, however, found it necessaiy to propose certain alterations in the rates which as it was,, namely, 4 cents per l b . , thus are to apply in Canada to the Australian goods covered by the agreement. Although these alterations provide for more, favourable terms to Australia than those proposed wben the original resolution was passed, the Government has considered it necessary to submit the question! again to the House. The concessions on Canadian gc-ds were proposed in reburn for reciprocal benefits under the Canadian tariff on Australian goods entering Cafnada. As the benefits to Australian goods as a rule were greater than, could be given under the existing Canadian tariff., it would have been necessary for the Canadian Parliament to agree to a number of tariff amendments increasing rates of duty under the general tariff, and reducing the duties under the preferential tariff. To make this point clear, I might quote the example of, say, fresh meats . 1 Under the existing Canadian tariff the British preferential rate is 2 cents per l b\, a-nd' : the general That resolution was tariff rate 3' cents per l b . These rates gave the possibility of a preference of 1 cent only. The Canadian Government, however, agreed to a preference of 3 cents to be effected by reducing the British preference rate to 1cent, and increasing the general Such a . proclamation can tariff rate to 4 cents. This item is cerned. The communication received from the Canadian Government indicated bhat it foundit-impracticable to induce the Parliament ""of Canada to agree to increaseall thetariff rates. It wastherefore necessary to find some other means of compliarace with the preferences agreed to. To meet the position, the Canadian Government proposed that the margin of secured by leaving the general tariff rates as they were and creating the necessary margin of preference by reducing the rates of the British preference tariff to the extent required for the purpose. For example, in the case of fresh meat, which I have already quoted, the rates agreed upon were 1 cent British preferential tariff and 4' cents general tariffa margin of 3 cents. The Canadian Government's proposal now is that these meats be made The Canadian Government free under the British preferental tariff.' and that the generaltariff rate remain keeping the margin of 3 cents per lb, originally agreed Upon. In two items of minor importance-Beeswax, and eucalyptus oil-the arrangement of the Canadian tariff did not admit of a preference equal to thatagreed to to be maintained, and as the items are of little value this Government has not demurred. The Canadian Government has now also agreed to increase. the preference on canned vegetables from 1 cent per lb-, to 1£ cents per lb., and, in addition, to in clude in the agreement unsweetened f r u it pulp imported by Canadian manufacturers for the manufacture of jam and preserves, and sugar also, both raw and refined. Unsweetened f r u it pulp will be admitted free of duty. In consequence of this addition, Australian unsweetened f r u it pulp will enjoy a preference of 2$ cents per lb., which amounts to a concession of £11 13s. 4c\. per ton. also, both raw and refined, will be admitted at the British preferential the Canadian tariff. than these are granted at any time to sugar produced Indies, such better terms will likewise be extended to Australian sugar. As a result of this provision, Australian sugar will be admitted 100 lb., as compared with a rate of $ 1.89 per 100 lb. under the general The preference of 80 cents is equal, approximately, to 74s. per ton. As regards raw sugar the present slightly over 83 cents per 100 lb., or 77s. per ton; but a provisional agreement has been made between British -West Indies increasing the preference to $1 per .100 lb., equal to £4 I3s. 4d. per ton. Subject to the agreement being accepted by the and West Indian legislatures, this preference will likewise be extended to Australian raw sugar. will note that iu the paper "" Statement lated, items 22 and 23, the rates are shown for refined sugar of a polarization exceeding 98 degrees, and not exceeding 99 degrees, and for raw sugar exceeding ing 96 degrees. which -would normally classes of sugar produced in and are quoted for that reason. Canadian arrangement of duties ou sugar based on the degree of polarization, tralian sugar is of a degree of polarization higher or lower than that of the items I have quoted, such sugar will similarly receive the benefit of the Canadian British preferential tariff, or of any better terms extended at any time to any other country. ment ""B"" which has been honourable members will see exactly how the present proposals compare with the original bered (2) shows the original rates on Australian agreed to at the time the previous resolution was passed; while the column numbered (3) shows the rates under present Canadian proposals. noted that in regard to the goods, namely, canned Mr Pratten. quinces, apricots, and nectarines, no Sugar, alteration has been made: the position remains just as it was when the previous rates of resolution was agreed to. The respective If any better terms rates of the British preferential tariff under which the Australian articles menin the British Westtioned will be admitted and of the general tariff are shown in the statement to which I have justreferred. refined The position also in regard to wines and at $1.09 per brandy remains unchanged. These articles will receive the same treatment tariff. as is accorded to France under Canada's tariff treaty with that country. The rates of duty under the agreement represent preference is very substantial reductions on those to which Australian wines are at presentliable. In regard to the majority of Canada and the items covered by the treaty, the Canadian Government, as I have explained, found it necessary to make certain alterations in the rates of duty Canadian originally agreed to, but, in making these alterations the margin of preference in favour of Australian goods has not been Honourable members disturbed. Honourable members know of headed the delay that has taken place in conB,"" which has been circunexion w i th the operation of this preferential treaty, seeing that it was approved in this House last October by 35 votes to 7. The delay has not been caused by any representations from 95 degrees and not exceedCanada concerning the alteration of the These items are .those incidence of British preference, as the apply to the Canadian Government accepts the British Australia, preferential conditions as laid down by The this Parliament for Great Britain. The tariff contains an elaborate delay that has occurred has been due to the parliamentary conditions in our sister and if Ausdominion. The renewed negotiations that were necessary in connection with the re-adjustment of the treaty passed by this House have resulted, i u some additional advantages to this Commonwealth, inasmuch as two more items of major importance to the primary producers have By consulting the statenow been included, viz.:-sugar , and circulated, pulped f r u it , upon which substantial prefei -ences from Canada had been secured. I scarcely think it necessary to traverse proposals. The column numthe arguments which were used here last year when the treaty was before the goods entering Canada as House. As the attack then made upon the Government's proposals largely centred on paper, I assure the House' that, the although the manufacture of news print It will be paper in Australia seems to be apprecifollowing ably nearer than it was last year, the raisins and currants, condition of our treaty with Canada enmeats, tallow, onions, pears sures that should it be necessary in the not distant future to legislate for this new industry, this treaty will not tie the hands of any government, asBritish preferential terms only are accorded Canadai n whatever tariffs may be enacted, or which may already be in existence. of the importations into Australia for the year ending 1923-4 of the items covered by this treaty under which Canada will bo given either British preferential, or intermediate terms, shows that any prejudice to established Australian industries has been avoided. No complaints of any kind in connection with the suggested treaty have been received from any Australian manufacturers affected. total imports into the Commonwealth from foreign countries in the items to which we are now giving Canada some advantage total £18,140,371, of which motor chassis account for more than half, ao that omitting motor chassis, which, unfortunately, are not at present made in Australia, the total trade in which Canada would participate to a greater extent than before w ill be about £8,000,000. Canada's trade in motor chassis with this, country, u n t i l we begin to make motor chassis for ourselves, should be looked upon w it h favour by all those who believe in inter-irnperial trade. On the other hand, very substantial preferences have been given by Canada to the Commonwealth, much inore substantial in the percentage of value than are given by the Commonwealth to Canada. total importations from all countries in the commodities upon which Australia will get substantial preference amount in value to £13,880,311 for the year ending 31st March, 1924. Sugar forms a very considerable part of the importation, but there are large importations also of meats, lard, eggs, cheese, butter, onions, dried f r u it s, f r u it pulp, canned fruits, fresh f r u it , wines, glue, gelatine, and brandy. All. these commodities are imported by Canadai n very considerable quantities at a time of the year which corresponds with our harvest. able members w ill probably have noted that the trade with the Commonwealth by Canada has seriously diminished during the last twelve months. I repeat the hope that Canada w ill do all the irade possible w it h Australia so long as none of our industries are prejudiced thereby. I have said that no complaints have been received from industries affected by the opportunity of trade with Canada, which it is hoped w ill be extended by this treaty. It must also be remembered in stressing the great balance of trade in favour of Canada that has A very careful examination taken place during the last few years that Canada has done that trade on her merits. She has paid f u l l general tariff rates. I believe that the majority, if not all of the. members of this House, would sooner see trade being done by Australia with our sister dominions than with a foreign country. This treaty places Australia in as good a position as any country doing trade w i th Canada, The and abolishes some of the handicaps we have had in trading with that dominion in the past. The exports from Australia to all countries of commodities covered by the treaty amount to £11,279,000. The imports of the commodities upon which we are getting a preference from Canada amount to nearly £14,000,000. So that the substantial preferences provided for in this treaty open up an exceedingly large new market for our primary producers. However the treaty may be analysed, there is no question that, given proper representation and progressive selling organization, Australia should benefit substantially in her exports under the proposals now submitted to the House. I do not expect that we shall very quickly catch Her up the preponderance of trade with us which Canada now enjoys, owing to some extent to greater industrial development in the dominion than we have here, but the opportunities opened up by the treaty of substantially increasing our trade w i th Canada are provided for in the bill, and it w ill be for those interested to pursue its benefits. I have had some little interest in perusing the remarks made in opposition to the treaty when it was before this House last year. Some extreme arguments were used, HonorandI may in for m my honourable friend, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Anstey), who used them, that some extreme arguments were also used in the Canadian House of Commons when these proposals were under consideration. One honourable member said, regarding the treaty, that it was one of 4< the grossest, most unfair, and most ini-cfuifous measures ewer imposed upon the people of Canada."" One might almost imagine drat it must be the honourable inember for Bourke (. Mr Aaasitey) who used such terms. I .shall Jiot pursue what was said in the Canadian House of Commons, beyond iStating for the information of the House and the country, that one honourable member, referring to the treaty, said that he wished Canada could trade Governments with Australia because the Australian Government looked .after its own country. I want to say, further, that"" the visit of my honourable colleague, the Treasurer (Dr.. Earle Page)., did much to increase the friendly sentiment that Iliad been exhibited towards ois in Canada. I say witli knowledge, and it is found inscribed in the Canadian Hansard, that the honourable gentleman's visit to Canada helped in the most substantial way the addition to the treaty.of those two very important items of primary production in Australiasugar .and fruit pulp. that, in accordance with the resolution, the British preferential tariff .and the intermediate tariff on the Canadian .goods specified will apply ,as under the present tariff, or any future amendment of it. That is to say, the British preferential tariff .terms and the intermediate tariff terms can be changed by this Parliament, at any time, and the terms as changed will apply under the treaty. This resoI prevent us from imposing dumping duties on goods specified in the treaty, subject, of course, to the conditions governing the imposition of such duties that now exist, or may exist under any enactment of this Parliament. Nor will the resolution interfere with our bringing into effect any .deferred duties applicable to the goods specified in the treaty. The treaty may be terminated by either party on six months' notice. I am sure that honourable members will welcome the increasing development of inter-ihiperial Those who travel know what Great Britain and her Dominions mean. Canadian landing on these shores, although not an Australian, the same flag, and enjoys in common with Australians ship of the British Empire. I want to say that no amendment of either schedule can be made except with the approval "" If r . Vraiten. of this Parliament, at any future time. As the treaty has been arrived at in .the form of an agreement, honourable members will recognize that the conditions now offered by Canada, which are better -than the conditions previously offered, must be accepted or rejected as a whole. They cannot fee amended. The schedules will be brought into operation, should they be passed by both Houses, at an early date mutually agreed upon by hoth Governments concerned. In conclusion, I want to say that the policy of the Government is, and will be, preference to Britain, the cultivation of inter-imperial trade, the opening up of further markets to Australian exports, and the development of our own country. adjourned I may explain Sir.

B ill received from the Senate, ancl (on motion by D r . EABLE PAGE ) read a first time. Debate resumed from 21st August (vide page 1650), on motion by Mr That tlie bill be now read a second time. This bill is really a validating measure. It appears that since 1907 certain provision relating to preferences has been made by various Ministries, and apparently there is now a doubt about the validity of ' what has been done. It is therefore necessary to . take action to place the matter beyond doubt. I u 1907, a preference was given on goods containing 25 per cent, of British manufacture. Last year, the percentage of British manufacture was increased to 75 per cent. little complaint about the preference when the percentage was fixed at 25 per cent., but evidently it was much easier at that time to obtain partially manufactured goods from the Continent, to complete them in Great Britain, and to send thein to Australia. I u 1922, I moved in this House a censure motion, and pointed out that we were permitting large quantities of iron and steel goods, manufactured cheaply in either Germany or Belgium because of their depreciated currencies, to come through GreatB ritain to Australia. Mr Massy Greene, who was a Minister at the time, said that my case was built on assumption. It is gratifying to me to know that the present Minister ""for Trade and Customs( Mr Pratten) has made statements in different parts of Australia supporting the attitude that I took up at that time. He has shown clearly that, during the time that I referred to, large quantities necessary at other exchanges, of materials were coming into Australia cent. British manufacture, to the detriment of our own industries I well remember when the great steel works of Newcastle' were closed down. TheM i nister for Trade and Customs appears to be alive to the position. He increased the percentage of British manufacture required fro m 25. per cent, to 75 per cent. One can well understand that this increase has met with a great deal of objection from overseas. The people who traffic between the Continent and GreatB rita in are now feeling the pinch. They are not able to get materials purchased from foreign countries through to Australia as easily as before. Consequently, there w ill no doubt be some objection on their partto the bill. Certain statements in British newspapers in opposition to this measure clearly indicate that the increase in the percentage of British manufacture is not relished by certain people in Great Britain. I gin not referring to the manufacturers of Great Britain, because many of them are in a bad way. Factories are closed down there, and hundreds of thousands of men are out of employment. This applies especially in the iron and steel industries, which in turn affect the coal industry. The increase in the percentage of English manufacture to 75 per cent, should be beneficial to AusThere appears to have been tralian trade. We must protect our own industries from foreign competition, and that is really the object of the bill. This House should have some control over matters relating to preferences. Previous Ministers have acted on their own interpretation of section 8 of the Customs Tariff Act. I doubt very much whether we are not losing parliamentary control in permitting this to be done. We should, as far as possible, keep control of these matters. I have no objection to the Minister taking action provided it is ratified by Parliament. In any case, Parliament should not be constantly asked to pass measures to validate actions taken by Ministers. Our legislation should be beyond doubt lenged last year challenged successfully in the near future. I regret that this is not the only legislation that '.can be challenged.

Some features of the statutory rule are open to grave objection, and, if possible, I would pievent its validation. The principal effect of the rule is to increase the percentage of British labour or material necessary in imports to qualify them for admission at the British preferential rates. That proportion has been advanced in respect of some goods to 75 per cent., and we are told that the object is to assist Australian industries, and that the rule is not directed against the British manufacturers, but is intended to exclude from the benefits of tlie preferential tariff foreign goods masquerading as British. If such a provision is necessary, and that is a matter of opinion, the 75 per cent, requirement is so high as to practically counteract its own intention. In many manufactured articles the raw material constitutes at least 25 per cent, of the total value, and if a British manufacturer uses foreign raw material which amounts to morn than 25 per cent, of the total value of the finished article, that article cannot be admitted at. the British preferential rates of duty. all possible manufacture into it in Britain. statutory rule is to prevent the importation of foreign goods, it will probably have the opposite effect, because by making more difficult the importation of British goods having only 75 per cent, of British labour or material, it increases the tendency io purchase foreign goods. Is it better to import goods that are 100 per cent, foreign, or goods with even 50 per cent. British labour and material in them? Mr Sciii.i.ix -It is better to import goods that are 100 per cent. British than goodsthat are 7:""> per cent, foreign. turers import their raw materials from abroad; therefore, it is impossible to get goods that are wholly the product of British labour and material. Honourable members know quite well that the real purpose of the statutory rule is-to preWhen action has vent the importation of British-goods; indeed, that has been expressly stated by the Government. I have previously Thus a matter which quoted the following passage from, a letter written by the Commonwealth Government to the New Zealand Government:In most of the dominions, especially in Australia, the Inewl manufacturers tire adequately protected by the tariff mid anti-dumping duties against foreign goods, and such are not feared in competition so much as British goods under the present conditions of preference. Clearly the object of the statutory rule is to discourage the importation of British goods. That being so. why does the Government pretend that it is endeavouring to protect British manufacturers? The statement that such importations will have a serious effect on Australian industries is absurd; their effect will he helpful rather than injurious. Whether that be so or not, why do we pass legislation of this kind uuder the pretence that it is to assist British manufacturers when it really puts obstacles in their way ? MrE .

It is a serious position for the Government or the country to take up, in view of the fact that for years attempts have been made to improve imperial trade, promote better imperial relations, and strengthen the bonds of Empire. Aft e r all, trade is the life-blood of the Empire, and it should be fostered rather than repressed. If we ask Great Britainf o r trade concessions on the one hand, and then pass a measure of this kind, which diminishes imperial -preference, we take something from the Motherland with one hand and slap her face with the other. preferences of great value that Great Britain"" has given us. diminish her preference ? by requiring that 75 per cent, instead of 25 per ' cent, of labour and material in an article shall be of British origin ? The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr. Charlton) has said that factories in England are in a serious position and that unemployment, is rife. I suggest that if measures of this kind are adopted to any extent, more factories will be closed and there will be greater unemployment than heretofore, for some factories in Great Britain have been established for the special purpose of producing goods in which only from 25 to 40 per cent, labour and material is of British origin. in packets and calling them 25 per cent. Britisht is quoting an extreme case, simply for the purpose of his argument. Lie knows very well that under this provision the importation of goods in a number of genuine cases w ill be stopped. easy to take an extreme instance, as the Minister did recently. He quoted what I regard as very trumpery and absurd cases as examples of the great trade between the Motherland and Australia, and his action .was not quite worthy of the subject. There are several other features Important arrangements asked to agree, but I do not propose to go into all of them. It is obvious that we cannot discuss every clause of the rule. We must either accept it as a whole or reject it . . We cannot go into committee upon it and discuss its various provisions; but I point out that there are several matters to which exception may be taken. For instance, there is a provision that in determining the current market value of the goods imported from Great Britain, the value at the date of invoice or at the date of shipment is to be taken. I ask the House to consider what that really meaii3. We know that British manufacturers have stacks of goods at Home, and they have their agents in Australia trying to sell them. These are prepared to take orders in advance, and when they accept seasonal orders for forward delivery a certain price is fixed, but the goods reach Australia perhaps three or six months later, when the Yes . market price may have altered considerwhat way do we ably. The importers, therefore, are obliged to take into consideration, not the D o we not diminish it price at which .they buy the goods, but the current market price at the time of shipment. I ask honourable members whether that is a f a i r business arrangement.. It may be said that if the price falls the importer w ill receive the benefit of it , but that is not the position under this provision. If the price falls the tendency is to diminish the proportion of British labour and material which give the preference. If , on the other hand, the price rises the importer has to pay a higher rate of duty, and, therefore, he is h it whichever way one regards the matter. But a period when prices are falling is not the time when purchases are likely to be considered. It is when prices are rising, that purchases in advance are made to enable importers to protect themT h e honourable member selves against the market. Consequently, this provision is almost certain to prove very unfair to the purchasers of British goods i u Australia. A view is held by a certain section of this House that the opeIb is rations of importers are inimical to the best interests of the people, and that, being an enemy of the public,, their rights should not be considered. I do not hold a brief for the importers of good's,",37,Pratten

Whatever it costs them to import an article is passed urn to the consumer. questions are continually being considered from the point of view only of the seller. The buyer's point of view is very seldom considered. of view should be considered. view is jjuBt as much that of the buyer as that of the seller; ia fact, it is more the point of view of the buyer because, without him, no transaction can take place. If we -diminish the purchasing power of the buyer, we reduce the turnover of tlie seller. I am here to champion the cause of the buyer, and I say emphatically that this provision will have the sole effect of portant regulations of this kind without increasing the cost of goods to the buyer. At a time when complaints are rife as to the high cost of living, we are making no effort to reduce it, but are making new impostswhich further increase it. The commercial reports in the press constantly refer to the overstock of goods, and the diminished purchasing power of the people. We hear of -bad seasons and bad business, and the reason is that the purchasing power of the people is declining because prices are being sent up by just such measures as this. It should be well understood now that we cannot import goods without producing other goods with which to pay for them. A free flow of imports means that we shall stimulate rather than retard our own manufactures. Apart from the imperial aspect of this matter, the provision in this clause is only a pretence. If we are to consider it purely from the Australian point of view, let us look at it from the point of view of the Australian consumer. regulations have been brought in in an entirety irregular and improper manner. I have said so for the last twelve months, and it .seems absurd that we should be asked to agree to a measure of this description simply because it is said that outside legal authorities regard the regulations as invalid. said that they had been whole-heartedly accepted by the British manufacturers themselves, as if that was any recommendation. sentations made by the British manufacturers, but I have pointed out already how protest after protest was made It seems to me that tariff against adopting the 75 per cent, standard, and the Minister knows perfectly well tliat the majority >of the representatives of the British manufacturer asked liim that the proportion should mot he more than 50 per cent. ceait. ground that I have already covered. In my view, an important provision like this should be discussed more fully with the Imperial Government itself. We aTe entering into trade arrangements with other countries, and yet we adopt imconsulting the Imperial Government. I have been informed, on the best authority, that when this action was proposed the British Trade Commissioner desired to approach the Federal Government and. ask that the application of the regulations should ""be delayed to enable them to be considered by the Imperial Government, in order that their f u l l effect on trade might be understood. That seemed to be a very reasonable request from a country which is our best and largest customer, but it was refused. So delay was allowed. I believe also that very grave restrictions were placed in the way of the Imperial authorities even becoming aware of the terms of the proposal. I venture to say that if that policy is pursued it will cause grave tension hetween thc Imperial Government and ourselves. We should not break the harmony of the relations between Australia and the Old Country by hostile legislaThe tion and ill-considered action. The trade figures show that Great Britain is by far our largest customer, and an ordinary rule of business is for the seller to consider to some extent the interests of his buyer. Having said that, I proceed to consider the first and second subclauses.

Whetheri n the matter of direct or indirect taxation, the authority of Parliament should be paramount, and should be preserved. It is possible for the Minister or his officers to bring in most absurd and fantastic regulations. Let me quote one instance within my own knowledge. It would be possible for the Minister to say that potable spirits should not be imported into Australia unless manufactured by a process similar to that employed in Australia. Many people would say, "" He a r , hear "" to that, but I mention this instance because the proposition has heen advanced as a reason for duty. quality, or anything else, the method of tlie manufacture of certain potable spirits in Australia is different from that employed in GreatB r it a in . What right have we to prescribe the conditions which shall be observed in manufacturing processes in other countries ? It is the quality of the article that should count. If a person wishes to buy English spirits because he likes them-and I do not say that they are better-wh y should he be prevented from obtaining them because they are made by a process different from that employed here? can be used to bolster up inefficient methods of manufacture. _ The department, by prescribing hours of labour and other conditions, could interfere i m properly w it h manufacture in other countries. This clause asks us to allow the department to do that. It w ill give the control of our tariff legislation to the Minister and his departmental officers. One hears many complaints from time to time about the difficulty of calculating income taxation, but the complexities of our direct taxation are a mere bagatelle compared with complexities of our indirect taxation. I recently read an interesting book, written by Mi-. Stephen Mills, late ControllerGeneral of Customs, on "" Taxationi n Australia,"" and in it a statement is made regarding Customs ago that would exactly describe the conditions [76] and Customs regulations to-day.

That continued for some time until it was found that the British manufacturers were not treating their own people fairly. A number of firms in Great Britain were, not patriotic enough to employ their fellow countrymen, but preferred to obtain the goods from other countries, doing in their own factories only sufficient work in connection with those goods to entitle them to a 10 per cent, preference here. It eventually became known that in the manufacture of steel products British manufacturers imported their blooms from Germany and elsewhere, and then did only sufficient work on them to comply with the condition that the finished article should represent 25 per cent, of British manufacture. In that way they obtained the benefit of the preference granted, by Australia. That1 was done, not only in connection with iron and steel, but with many other articles also.

The honourable member could not have listened .to my speech. fully to the honourable member, and if he 'did not mean what he has led me to helieve he should, in fairness to the officers of the department, have been more clear as to what he considered the Augean stable. Public officers cannot defend themselves against attacks made in this House. If they do wrong there is a proper way to deal with them, when they may haye a chance to reply to charges made against them. The only interpretation that could be put upon the honourable member's statement was that the Minister and his officers, having the power under the Customs.Act to do certain things, have not carried out their duties properly. If the honourable member meant to say something else, he should have done so. He complains of the alteration of the regulations from time to time. They are altered to snit the differing conditions of trade. Ever since Customs taxation has been imposed the power has rested with the department to vary the classification of goods. This has been necessary to protect the revenue and to see that goods imported carry the [duties intended to be imposed upon them. This practice has always been followed by the department, but because it is followed to-day the. honourable member for Perth considers that the power to make these alterations in classification should be taken away. Let me give an illustration to show how necessary it is that such a power should be vested in the Minister for Trade and Customs. I have no doubt that we should all like to promote the' cultivation of cotton in Australia, and regard the cotton-growing industry as one which, by the extent of its production, may finally rival the wooltralian market. The honourable member .growing industry. Because cotton was not grown extensively here, Parliament, in fixing the duties upon cotton goods, was very careful to impose them upon finished articles of cotton manufacture. An ordinary bath-towel imported has to pay duty, while cotton piece-goods for the manufacture of such articles may be introduced duty free. But the method of importation adopted by these honest importers was to bring in a series of towels joined together only by the extension of the .threads at the end of each. The -importers claimed that these were piece-goods, and not liable to a duty, although each separate towel had only to bo cut off from those to which it was joined. posed upon both piece-goods and separate towels. quite clear that the practice adopted by the importers was merely to evade the duty payable on the finished article? Importers have been doing this kind of thing all along. They. have been concerned to discover how they could import their goods so as to evade the duty, or to pay as low a duty as possible. My illustration shows how necessary it is that power should be vested in some one to watch these practices and reclassify goods imported to prevent the evasion of duty. I have not had a great deal to do with the officers of the Trade and Customs Department, but I know enough of their work to be able to value their services, and I say that no country in the world has a better staff of officers. whole of the Commonwealth Public Service. honourable member, but I was referring to this particular department. Some honourable members go to a department, and if its officers do not agree to do all that T they ask, they assume that something is wrong, and that the officers are not the right men for the positions they occupy. These proposals will not increase the necessary protection for the benefit of the industries of this country. They will only increase the duties payable upon goods imported into Great Britain from foreign countries by British traders, and sent out here as British goods to flood the Ausfor Perth spoke of the Empire and of the desirability of extending our trade with Great Britain. No one will quarrel with that, but the idea in allowing a preference to Great Britain under the tariff was to increase the importation of British and not of foreign goods. In my opinion, the regulation requiring that the goods to which the preference shall be anplied must be to the extent of 75 per cent. British manufacture, has been too long delayed.

I listened very patiently to the speeches of the honourable member for Perth( Mr Australia from a _ selfish point of view Mann) and of the honourable member for Newcastle ( Mr Watkins). I agree with the remarks of the honourable member for Perth. I am very sorry that the honourable member for Newcastle did not attempt to reply to or refute one of the arguments raised by the honourable member for Perth. I object to the bill, not because it tries to validate a wrong that has been done since 1907, but because it purports to allow such wrongdoing in future. It gives to the Minister for Trade and Customs, whoever he may be, a blank cheque, and gives to other honourable members in the chamber, as representatives of the people, no opportunity of deciding what shall be the policy concerning matters of vital importance to this country. I object to that, and honourable members will better understand my objection if for a moment they imagine me to be Minister for Trade and Customs, with this power in my hands. Mr O'KEEFE -Impossible ! would put another aspect on the matter. In such a case, honourable members would hardly be satisfied to allow me to decide what constituted condition's of production and what duty should be put on this and that article. This matter should not be -left in such a nebulous condition. As the honourable member for Perth said, there should accompany ' this bill a schedule setting out for the approval of the House such things and such percentages concerning different articles with which it was intended to deal. If some alteration were required later, it could I favour a preferbe made. This bill puts too great a .power in the hands of the Minister. It I will tend to upset, the. mercantile community of this country because of the uncertainty of purchasing from the Mother Country anything at a fixed price. The Minister, under this clause, will consider any article, and determine what its value is, or what duty is to be placed upon it. This is a common practice .under the regulations to-day. I do not The Minister will be propose to try to regulate the trading conditions in the Mother Country. There are in Australia to-day certain persons who are trying to . regulate British shipping. I object to being one to try to regulate the British manufacturers' business. England is the best customer of Australia. It is in the interests of alone, to .encourage British trade, because Britain is our best market. For tlie year 1924-5 the value of Australia's exports to Britain amounted to over £60,000,000, representing 40 per cent, of our total exports. Britain purchased 90 per cent, of exported Australian butter, 23 per cent, of our flour, 26 per cent. , of our wheat, 38 per cent, of our wool, 61 per cent, of our beef, 91 per cent, of our mutton, and 90 per cent, of our dried fruits. Surely, in the light of these figures, we should not, when dealing with a small matter of preference to England, be pernicketty, by carefully examining every item that comes here to see exactly how it is made up. England is not similarly interfering with our trading relations with her. These large figures can still be further extended.

142,Mr Prowse,"I thought that that means assistance to Australian products.On these grounds, we want to be very careful, when we bring in legislation, not to give to a Minister, whoever he may beMr Pratten, Mr Mann, or myselfpower to over-ride the w ill of Parliament. It must be manifest that what has been going on since 1907 was not intended by this Parliament. This House is indebted to the honourable member for Perthf o r pointing out that this illegal practice has been carried on for a long period. A l though this irregularity is to be rectified, the Minister has made no mention of the fact that the honourable member for Perth insistently drew his attention to it . This bill w ill perpetuate the practice that the honourable member for Perth objected to in its incidence, and give still greater power to the Minister. I claim that this House, elected by the people, should have the right to consider all these vital changes, whether they be in connection with the fiscal or any other policy of Australia. important effect of this bill is the power it will give to the Minister, and the mere possibility of the honourable member for Forrest presiding over the Department of Trade and Customs makes me resolve not to give the Minister too wide a discretion. I would certainly be averse from giving unlimited power to a Minister holding the same fiscal views as the honourable member for Forrest; but if I were Minister for Trade and CustomsI would require all the powers that could possibly be vested in me by Parliament to protect the industries of Australia. A t the same time. I concur in the general principal ''enunciated by the honourable member for Perth( Mr Mann) that Parliament must have power to criticize and review all °important actions and, if possible, to criticize all proposed actions; but often in the administration of a tariff circumstances arise that prevent the consultation of Parliament before action is taken. It is therefore necessary to give to the Minister some latitude. The extent to which that can be done without robbing Parliament of its control must be considered when this bill is in committee. I give to the honourable member for Perth all credit for having raised this issue last year. He did emphasize the invalidity of the action-.that the Minister was then proposing to take, but I do not think that many honourable members accepted his view, I am not certain that I accept it now, but the Government has done so, and is at least making assurance doubly sure by asking Parliament to validate what has been done by administrative act. If it is agreed that certain statutory rules require validation, the honourable member for Perth deserves all possible credit for having discovered ana announced that fact to the Housetwelve months ago. My main criticism ui the measure is that if validation is necessary the Government' should have acted last year. The honourable member for Perth is quite correct in saying that ' f the illegality to which he called attention is serious enough to necessitate legislative action now, it was serious enough to receive the attention of the Government last year. The Government made a gravemistake in not taking immediate action to legalize actions which it was warned twelve months ago were illegal. The honourable member for Forrest '( Mr Prowse) said that by this bill the Government is endeavouring to regulate the business of British manufacturers. It is doing nothing of the sort. We are asked to regulate the business of our own people -by deciding what goods shall be admitted into the Commonwealth at preferential rates of duty. Surely we are entitled to do that. The honourable member quoted statistics to emphasize the large percentages of Australia's total exports that are purchased by Great Britain. I submit that those statistics constitute an argument in favour of this measure; they are a sound reason for giving absolute preference to the British article, and not to the foreign article. The purpose of the bill is to prevent foreign manufacturers from dumping into Australia goods that have been sent to England to have a British label put on them. The argument of the honourable member for Forrest is that Britain is such a large customer for Australian products that we should not pass this measure, which will make the preference to British manufacturers, as against their foreign competitors, more effective. The honourable member for Perth has misjudged .the meaning of the b ill . He said that if 25 or 30 per cent. of an article imported from Great Britain was of foreign origin, that article could not be admitted to Australia under the British preferential tariff. That is not so. If the raw material imported into",46,Pratten

Usually of Yarra, the a proposed increase in the tariff, whether by means of regulation, or statute, is kept a close secret. The first public indicafor allowing foreign manution of it is the placing of the schedule' upon the table, and from that moment, often under conditions which although Parliament has had no opport u n it y to deal with them, the new duties duties. Since that operated. The justification for that procedure is that if notice of the intention to amend the duties were given, importers for Maribyrnong ( Mr would clear goods through the Customs and others on this side; House at an abnormal rate, as they have their protests have been igbeen doing during the last few weeks.

In regard to the general tariff, too, the Minister for months past has been forecasting an increase in. duties. contained an intimation to the same effect, and one naturally expected that within a week of the meeting of Parliament the new tariff schedule would be placed upon the table. Buti t has not made its appearance yet. Thus an opportunity has been given to shrewd business men to anticipate the increase of certain duties, and flood the country with imports. that, has beeu done is proved by a comparison of the importations during last year with the figures of three years ago, which show that the Customs revenue has increased by about £4,320,000 during that period, and all the time the strangulation of Australian industries has continued. Between the date of the delivery of the Governor General's Speech and the introduction of the amended schedule, almost sufficient time will have elapsed for a ship to be loaded in Europe and sent to Australia, and its cargo cleared through the Customs House. That is not protection. Although the new duties may be satisfactory, they w ill not effectively protect Australian industries for probably a year or eighteen months after they have commenced to operate, because the delay which has occurred has enabled the warehouses of the importers to be filled to the ceilings. The increase in prices that will probably follow an increase in the tariff w ill for a articles camouflaged as British can only long time be to the advantage of the importers. In reality, therefore, our protectionist policy, which is designed to benefit industries, w ill play into the hands of the importers of cheap and shoddyforeign articles, because the Government has been merely talking protection for a year or more, instead of putting"" it into operation. The Minister, in introducing the bill, said that the textile goods manufactured entirely on the Continent were dyed, measured and wrapped in England, and sent out to Australia as of British manufacture. They are made under the cheap^labour conditions of .Europe, while our textile industries have been strangled and many persons have been thrown out of employment. been closed down, while others are only working part time. Let me give another illustration. It was pointed out by the Minister that machines in parts manufactured in foreign countries were merely assembled in Great Britain, but were sent out to Australia as of British manufacture. Instances similar to this haye been The Governor General's Speech known for a long time, and therefore the measure should have been brought down at least a year ago. The imports of iron manufactures from the Continent to Great Britain since 1922 have increased fourfold. The Minister admitted it , but if the course pursiied last A p r i l had been adopted six months earlier, a considerable proportion of those goods would That have been manufactured in Australia. It is a serious indictment of the administration of the Customs Department that it gave notice of its intention to increase a duty. The imposition of the new regulations in A p r i l undoubtedly had the effect of reducing the tonnage of imports. While Great Britain was importing iron goods from the Continent, the iron and steel industries of the Commonwealth tariff were in a perilous condition, and if the regulations had been in operation six months earlier, Australian industries would have been benefited. 1 support the bill, but 1 say that it is belated. I would support any increase in the tariff for the protection of Australian industries, although that, too, will be belated, and the advantage w ill not be felt unti l after next year, or. probably later. The criticism that too much power is given by the bill to the Minister can be considered in committee, but the complaint that the measure increases the duty on foreign come from those who wish the lowest possible duties to be imposed on foreign goods. Those who wish to see the goods we use manufactured in this country, and the goods we cannot manufacture here imported from British countries onlythose who are really protectionists-wil l derive some measure of satisfaction and relief from the bill. The object of the bill is, first of all, to enact as law statutory rule No. 29 of 1925, and to provide that the Minister may from time to time, as he thinks fit, alter it by regulation and substitute for it any other provision defining the Some of the mills have goods to which the British preferential tariff shall be applicable, so",47,Pratten

I agree entirely with that, under the old provision, will but this b ill would leave it open to the but the bill will be all Minister to alter the percentages the day manuafter the bill became law from 75 and increased 25 to 5 and 2£, or to any other figures.

Accordingly, I ask' the percentage Minister to consider whether he w ill not accept an amendment, the effect of which would be to embody the substance of the preferential statutory rule in the bill.

One must recognize that a Certain degree of elasticity and flexibility to meet conditions and circumrates, stances which change from time to time is regulations required in some tariff items, and it is impossible to prescribe in a statute every condition relating to the whole ' of Parliament has said that those items. Therefore, while I suggest in the that the second clause of the bill should be shall be admitted at amended to incorporate the words of the statutory rule, I also suggest that it is of Great Britain, they still necessary to leave to the Minister the rate, power to determine at least two things has no right to in addition to the other matters which he by regulation, what the is allowed to determine under the present of Parliament means. In an statutory rule. Under the new regulamatter like this, Parliation 3 4 B (1) a, there is a reference to plain, goods which are wholly produced or and exmanufactured in the United Kingdom, but there is a condition that "" as to manufactured goods, these w ill only be considered ' w h o l ly manufactured in the TJnited Kingdom' if in the raw materials used, and also in the finished goods, no manufacturing process has been performed outside the United Kingdom which is being commercially performed in the United Kingdom."" I suggest that it should be left to the Minister t'o determine from time to time whether or not any particular manufacturing process is being commercially performed in the United Kingdom. Further, I think that it ought to be left to the Minister to determine under a later clause whether any goods are of a class or kind not commercially manufactured in Australia. That also appears to me to be a condition that has to be considered from time to time, and the application of the tariff must be varied according to whether or not the goods are being commercially manufactured in Australia at a particular time. It is proper to leave that discretion to be exercised by a responsible Minister, but so far as the main features of the rule are concerned, I suggest that it would be preferable if they were embodied in the bill so that they could not be altered without the consent of Parliament. There is one other matter to which I should like to refer. The main provision relating to goods which are entitled to the benefit of the British preferential tariff is to be found in section 8 of the Customs Tariff Act of 1921. That section was quoted by the Ministeri n his second-reading speech, and it provides that the rates of duty set out in the schedule in the column headed "" B r it is h Preferential T a r if f "" shall apply to goods the produce or manufacture of the United Kingdom, subject to the condition that the goods have been shipped in the United Kingdom to Australia, and have not been transhipped, or, if transhipped, then only if it is proved to the satisfaction of the Collector that the intended destination of the goods when originally UnitedI t appears to me that this amendment relating to the conditions under which goods may obtain the benefit of the preferential tariff ought to be associated with the principal section in the Tariff Act of 1921, and not with the Customs Act. section 8 of the TariffA c t of 1921 unchanged, in the words I have read, and then to bring in , by way of validation of a statutory rule, another set of provisions. I suggest that the amendment should be alongside the section which it in effect amends. It is proposed to insert it after section 151 of the Customs Act. That might mislead anyone who was trying to ascertain the law relating to the British preferential tariff. There is nothing in section 8 of the Tariff Act of 1921 to show that it is affected by another act. Finally, I venture to draw attention to the draftin g of this statutory rule. I do not wish to occupy the time of the House with mere drafting points, but I maintain that honourable members are entitled to have the rules that are placed before them drafted in a proper manner. This rule is not properly drafted, and one needs only to glance at it to see that. I shall not go into the details of it , but the introductory sentence is: Goods whicli comply with the following conditions shall be deemed to be the produce or manufacture of the United Kingdom, for the purposes of the operation of tlie Britisli Preferential Tariff, viz :After that one would expect to find, but does not find, a list of conditions. First there is a description of a class of goodsGoods which are wholly produced or wholly manufactured in the United Kingdom. The next paragraph is a description, and the next is a description. Paragraph d is a condition, the next is a definition, the next is a further portion of that definition, and the final paragraph is a. direction for a calculation for the purpose of applying a definition. From a drafting point erf view, the form of the rule is indefensible. The legislation of this Parliament provides that the goods must have been shipped in the United Kingdom to Ausshipped from the tralia, and there are various conditions Kingdom was Australia. about transhipping. In this statutory rule, we find that those words are repeated as if they derived their force not from an act of this Paidiament, but from the power of the Minister to make regulations.

The honourable member for Perth( MrM a n n ) , made a great deal of motor chassis and bodies which he said were admitted under fifteen instead of under three headings. If he studied the tariffs of the world, as contained in the Shipping World Tear-Boole and The Tariffs of the World, he would find that the items in the Australian tariff are few compared with those of some other countries. Whereas there are 430 items in the Commonwealth tariff, occupying 41 pages of the book, there are 581 sections in the tariff of the United. States of America, some sections containing as many as 30 items. The tariff of France has 654 items, and that of Germany 946 items. The three finest tariffs in the world are those of Japan, the United States of America, and Germany, all of which I commend to the Minister and his splendid ofiicers for their consideration. Our cigar-makers are protected to the extent of about 15s.' a lb. on cigars.

When I think of England with her huge army of unemployed, and of the suffering of many of her people, and realize that she w ill not manufacture enough to supply her dominions which are granting her 10 per cent, preference, I am tempted to question whether the British race is becoming decadent. PerhapsI should not have used that word, for it is only since the a w f u l debacle of war affected that country that the Avorkers of England have been able to make their influence felt through the ballot-box. I myself, when in England, was robbed of my vote for five years. When the women as well as the men of England realize their power, they w ill determine I said, that the flag of England Shall not fly over vessels carrying goods that are a f r a u d, in that the amount of British labour employed in their manufacture is so small as is the case at present. I am glad that the Minister has introduced fhis bill, their object w ill be not and I believe that he w ill do his best to ensure that by no idle word of -his w ill any importer gain an undue advantage. If we give to British goods a preference over other imports, it is reasonable to suppose that we have the right to decide what shall be the proportion of British material and workmanship in those goods to entitle them to that concession. Whether or not 75 per cent, is the proportion which w ill give the best results to both GreatB r it a in and Australia, I do not know, but it appears to me to be a very reasonable proportion. The honourable member for Perth( Mr Mann) said that if 75 per cent, of British workmanship and material were insisted on in British goods to entitle them to the preferential rate, it would mean an increase in foreign trade. It is probable that if the goods which at present contain 25 per cent., or 50 per cent., of B ritish material or workmanship were put into the same fiscal category as goods manufactured wholly",52,Pratten
146,Mr Patebson (Gippsland) [9.20],"in foreign countries, it might have the effect mentioned by the honourable member, but if , because of the increased percentage, we reduce our British imports by 20 per cent., we could depend upon the 80 per cent, which would still come from that source containing a much greater amount of British workmanship than is the case to-day. If this bill had been drafted simply to validate' regulation 29, which deals with that 75 per cent, proportion) it would have my unqualified support, but I believe that it gives the Minister a great .deal more power than that. Under this bill, the Minister w ill have the power to prescribe that goods must contain any proportion he may think fit, from 5 per cent, to 100 per cent., of British workmanship and material in order to obtain the benefit of the preferential rate. The Minister could, if he desired, entirely ignore the regulation that prescribes 75 per cent. imagine that a M in is t e r I do not sugwhich said that, subject to certain condigest it of the present Minister-migh t override the w ill of Parliament. instance, if this House decided to refuse an increase in the duty on some particular commodity coming from Great Britain, and the Ministerf o r Customs of the day was particularly anxious that that in creased, duty should operate, it would be possible for h i m to flout the ""will of Parliament by a subterfuge. He could alter the regulation in such a way that something which now comes in on the 75. per cent, basis would not be regarded as of British manufacture unless the material and workmanship were wholly British. If that were done, it would mean that such goods would be excluded from enjoying the British preferential duty and would come under the general tariff. I consider that to grant to a Minister suoh power is to vest in h i m more authority than it is desirable that any Minister should possess. I should like to hear the opinion of the Attorney-General as to the powers which the bill will confer upon the Minister for Customs/ Downs Attorney-General) Having heard the remarks of the honourable member for Perth( MrM a n n) regarding the officers of the Customs Department, I desire, first of all, as one who has had experience in that department, to say that I consider that nowhere in the British Empire is there a more cap. able body of officers than in the Commonwealth Customs Department. trary. I referred to the Customs legislation. lation is at fault, Parliament is to blame, and the honourable members' remarks must be construed as a reflection upon Parliament. His remarks this afternoon seemed to suggest that he was referring to the officers of the department, and I am glad to have his assurance that that was not so. ment on that matter. unreservedly, the honourable member's statement. Regarding the bill itself, the present Minister found that like his predecessors he had to decide onan interpreOne can tation of an important section of the act, tions, British preferential rates should Por apply to goods the produce or manufacture of the United Kingdom. This House did not attempt to define, for the guidance of the Minister, what constituted the goods the produce or manufacture of the United Kingdom. The Minister found himself in a difficult position; and therefore supplied his officers with a definition of British preference. Judging from the views that have been expressed by honourable members on both sides, that interpretation seems to have been generally accepted as the right attitude for Australia to adopt in this matter. However, that interpretation as well as the application of the rule has been questioned-whethe r properly questioned or not, I do not say. The Minister desires that any regulation passed by the Governor General in Council shall be beyond question, and that any action taken by him shall be approved by Parliament. He therefore asks, in the latter part of this measure, for the validation of the regulation which is specified in the bill. The Minister, not desiring to be lef t where he [9.25] is, asks also that the Governor General in Council shall be given the power to prescribe, by regulation, the conditions under which these goods may be imported, and that provision to that effect be incorporated in an amendment to the Customs Act.

The power to make regulations of a general character for the administration of the Trade and Customs Department is provided for in the Customs Act.

That will be the basis of the administration. It is true that power is given to the Executive to alter the regulations from time to time. The reason why it is asked that this should be put in the form of a regulation is that there are continually changing conditions in relation to trade, commerce, and manufacture. the Governor General\ in Council should have power from time to time to give effect to the will of Parliament in giving preference, and should be able to make regulations adapted from time to time to meet changing conditions. It is open to Parliament to decide that the GovernorGenerali n Council shall require 25 The per cent, of British manufacture in the case of certain goods, and 75 per cent, in the case of other goods. For a long time Parliament accepted the requirement of 25 per cent., but the Minister found that: the operation of the preference then provided for needed reconsideration. For that reason the regulation was altered to meet changed conditions, and the existing regulation, which has met with the approval of Parliament, was issued. will agree that the day after this bill is passed the Minister can alter the 75 per cent to 5 per cent., or to 95 per cent. course, there is the power of alteration, but what is done w ill be by regulation, manufacture of Great and w ill be under the control and w ill does not of Parliament.

That will be admitted by any one who has had the slightest experience of the working of the Trade and Customs Department. the distinction that more is done by the Minister to-day than by the Parliament. sideration the honourable member will find that that is not so. We are dealing now with the particular matter of the definition of goods the produce or manufacture of the country of export, Great Britain The honourable member for Kooyong has criticized the drafting of the present regulation. I believe the officers who drafted it are capable men who know their work, and it is a good piece of drafting . I ask honourable members to study the regulation. They will see that a number of conditions have had to be included in order to carry out the intention of Parliament to give preference'to goods the produce or manufacture of Great Britain. When the British preference came into operation, it was found that goods were being imported into the TJnited Kingdom from abroad. The conditions of trade enabled them to be imported very cheaply, and a provision intended to benefit Great Britain was found in practice to be benefiting foreign countries. by regulation, able to meet this difficulty. the tax to particular goods. Take another view of the matter: Great Britain, in the manufacture of some goods, is consuming a great deal of ""Australian raw material. The finished article is coming to Australia. How is that to be treated? The Minister has to face that problem, and he deals with it under the regulation. Then, again, a new industry has sprung up in Australia for the manufacture of wool tops, which have been used in England for the manufacture of goods to be imported to Australia. The question arises, To what extent are those goods of British manufacture? There is another problem that had to be solved. If we tried to deal with all these varying conditions in a rigid definition included in the act, we should in all probability defeat the purpose we have in view. When the Parliament passes a tariff The Customs act it tells the Minister what to do, and he then frames regulationsto give effect to the policy declared by Parliament. The phrase "" prescribed conditions "" has a technical meaning. Under the Acts Interpretation Act 1904, ""prescribed"" means "" prescribed by the act or by the regulations under the act."" Those regulations must comply with certain conditions. One is that they must be tabled in Parliament, which has the power of disallowing them. That is part of the machinery provided for dealing with regulations. A regulation is not the mere dictum of the Minister. It is the deliberate act of the Executive Council, and it must then comply with the provisions of the law governing the issue of regulations. I am reminding honourable members of the inadvisability of rigidly fixing conditions in the act. itself. My view is that the proper course tp follow is for Parliament to lay down the policy, that, for instance, goods the produce or manufacture of Great Britain should be given tariff preference, and then to allow the Minister, knowing that they may vary, to issue regulations setting out the conditions under which the preference should be given. It is not a question of fixing the rate of tax, but of the application of two different rates to specific goods. pointing out that it is not the fixing of the rate of the tax that we are now The Minister was, dealing with, but the application of The point to be decided is whether certain goods are or are not goods to which preference should be given. The honourable member for Yarra( Mr Scullin) complained that notice was given across the seas that it was intended to impose these conditions. I say that that was a proper thing to do. The issue of this regulation is entirely different fro m the introduction of tariff resolutions, fixing rates of duty upon goods. Notice is given to people who intend to send goods to Australia that they must comply with certain conditions in order to ' obtain the benefit of the preference offered to goods the produce or manufacture of Great Britain.

It is reasonable to say in this case that if British manuMinister on top of that imposed a dumpfacturers comply with certain conditions their goods will bo given the benefit of the British preference on their arrival here. I suggest to honourable members the great difficulty of setting out a definition in the act. The safest course to follow is to adopt the proposal of the Minister. He should not be left as at present, with a power undefined, but should have the guidance of regulations to assist him. It is quite correct, as stated by the Minister, that we are getting almost an entirely foreign import instead of one having a fair proportion of British manufacture, which was the intention of Parliament and. of the department. But I question whether to make the big jump from 25 per cent, to 75 per cent, in the requirement relating to British manufacture is not too great. The Minister knows that Great Britaini n her palmy days right up to the beginning of the war was a large importer of raw materials that were worked up in the factories of the United Kingdom and then imported. I feel that we have been treating Great Britain too severely, especially when we have been negotiating preferences with other countries which are now practically completed. We have been changing our policy to an extent whicli does not conduce to Great Britain extending her generosity in relation to preferences for certain of our perishable and other products. I must protest against the administration, not only of this Minister, but of his predecessor, regarding the operation of the dumping provisions. These provisions were conceived and approved just at the close of the war for special reasons, one being the inequality of exchange. exchange problem was very serious, indeed, particularly in some countries immediately after the war, and to some extent to-day. posed the dumping duties with a vengeance. separators.

Parliament, in its wisdom, practically set aside the duty on wire netting. To assist a newly-established industry in Australia, a bounty was provided for the manufacture of wire netting. The Minister will admit that he has been severe in tlie interpretation of the dumping provisions in relation to wire netting, because he introduced a new practice which meant almost prohibition. It applied against Great Britain. The clumping duty was imposed on any article which ®was invoiced at a price less than its domestic price in the country of origin. I submitted invoices of several shipments to the Minister, and in every instance but one the invoice price was The above the domestic price in the country of origin, which was Great Britain.

If Australia, has raw material that it cannot use in manufactures, Great Britain, before being given preferential duties, should be obliged to purchase that material from Britons in Australia rather than from foreign nations. The urea of the British Empire is not increasing; this is the last portion of it to be settled and developed. I desire that people of British stock, and no others, shall be admitted to Australia, and that the British Empire shall realize that in this country we can maintain a large population in accordance with the highest traditions, ideals, and standards of our race. The products of black labour in any country should not be imported into bhe Commonwealth. Whenever possible, Australian raw material should be converted into manufactures in Australian factories. I do not believe in keeping bhe people, of other nations busy in converting Australian raw material into manufactures; we should encourage our secondary industries, in order to give employment to our own people; but if raw material must be sent abroad, I prefer to send it to Great Britain. Our trade pre^ ferences, however, should be reciprocal. For instance, I do not approve of Great Britain purchasing dried fruits that are the product of Greek labour receiving lOd. per day, when products of Britishers in Australia who are receiving 12s. per day lack a market. Preference should be a business deal, involving mutual con T cessions.

That remark applies even to those imported machines the duty on which is lifted for one day only. There is nothing suspicious about such occurrences. The duty is waived' because those machines are not manufactured in Australia. They are admitted upon the condition that Australian engineers shall be allowed to inspect and copy them if they so desire, and no further machines are admitted Tinder similar conditions until Australian shops have had an opportunity to produce them. given me a preliminary baptism of the -fire that I may expect when the general tariff is under consideration. I suppose that as a tax gatherer I am included in the category of "" publicans and sinners,"" but I remind honourable members that most of them are glad to vote for the expenditure of the money that the Trade and Customs Department collects. Without the revenue obtained by that department much of the expenditure which their constituencies enjoy would hot be possible. likes to pay more taxes when he can avoid it. indent agents, and all sorts and conditions of people who are interested in foreign trade, might say much the same things as the honourable member for Perth has said to-night, but I am very glad that the House has almost unanimously accepted the principle which the Government has laid down with regard to British preference. The only debatable point seems to be the power to be exercised by the Minister. The criticisms offered by honourable members on that point will be very carefully considered, but the Government will not agree to any amendment which will take away that elasticity in administration which is provided for in the new regulation 29. I have been criticized for having given considerable notice of the intention to alter the basis of British preference, and the suggestion has been made that revenue has thus been lost. I had not been in office many months before I announced, with the acquiescence of the Government, the proposed change. remind honourable members that British preference has been in operation for at least eighteen years.

The measure will admittedly help all The debate upon this bill has bona fide British manufacturers, and it will relieve unemployment in Great Britain itself. This regulation has stopped the importation of camouflaged Anglo-Continental goods, which I am sure Parliament never intended to receive the generous preferences given. I am confident that the bill has the approval not only of the House, but of the countiy. It certainly has the approval of the vast majority of British manufacturers who wish to do a genuine trade in British goods and do not wish Of course, no person to take advantage of the sweated labour of the Continent. In no dominion are Many importers, tax-dodgers, the conditions of British preference prescribed in detail in an act; in every dominion the conditions are left to regulation. One or two extreme possibilities have been quoted, but no Minister in his senses would take action as suggested. If there is one thing more than another, to be said in favour of the stand adopted by the Governmeut it is contained in a telegram placed in my hands after the dinner adjournment from interested importers in Sydney, asking us not to make the bill retrospective, because they intend to take legal action against the Government to get back"" some of the duties that they have paid under this provision.
