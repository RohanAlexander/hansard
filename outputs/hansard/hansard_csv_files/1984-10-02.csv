In addressing this issue it is very relevant to note It is only when Parliament, government, the law that the Acting Attorney-General in the Fraser agencies and, above all, the people of Australia Government, Mr Neil Brown, said in this House join in a gen-ine, united effort that the threat on 21 October 1982 during the second reading deposed by this menace can be beaten back.

The function of a royal commission is essentially to National Crime Authority. But there should be no inquire into and report on the matter referred to it. It may room amongst honourable people for recklessly recommend the institution of prosecutions; however, most undermining the authority and the credibility of Australian governments, Commonwealth and State, have the National Crime Authority and for impugning had the experience of a royal commission recommending the prosecution of named persons but it being subthe motives for its establishment at this time. sequently found that it is not possible to bring the prosecutions because of lack of evidence. It is in the spirit of the genuine advancement of real debate that I now wish to address three It is the very shortcoming referred to by the Actspecific questions. First, why is the Costigan ing Attorney-General in the Fr.aser Royal Commission now being merged into the Government-the need for better machinery for National Crime Authority? Secondly, are the assembling admissible evidence to maximise the powers of the Authority adequate for the task of chances of obtaining convictions against major effectively fighting organised crime in Australia? criminals-which the National Crime Authority Thirdly, how is this task being affected by the is intended to remedy. To put it bluntly, it is an unsatisfactory outcome for this country of ours if Mr Costigan'S work until the National Crime the tentacles of organised crime are exposed, as Authority was established, has given him three they have been by successive royal commissions, extensions of time to his letters patent. Furtherbut limited progress is made in actually obtaining more, as a result of a specific request put by me convictions against major criminals. On this point when I met with the Commissioner on 25 AprilI think there is little that I can usefully add to the last year-honourable members can see Mr remarks of Mr Justice Stewart-:-I was pleased to Costigan's letter of 3 February 1984 to me, hear the Leader of the Opposition speak in the already tabled in Parliament-the Royal ComHouse today in such high, glowing andunqualimission's recent investigations have concentrated fied terms about Mr Justice Stewart-at his Press on drug trafficking.

There has to be a period when things do statements in recent weeks, particularly those of change.

In the case of the Authority, table or to publish the final report of the Costigan what the Opposition has been about-for reasons Royal Commission in a full; unexpurgated form, that have no basis, as I have indicated today-has as the Leader of the Opposition has suggested, been to .undermine its credibility and in this way without taking advice of those who have to carry to weaken the fight against organised crime in this country.

We are worried, as is the Law Council of Australia, about the proposal What all of that means is that because of the reto reverse the onus of proof so far as it affects moval of the health care and housing rebates and officers of companies who might be liable for taxother taxation changes made by this Government, ation neglect and taxation offences of the hundreds of thousands, perhaps several million, company. Frankly, we are at a loss to understand Australians who otherwise would have received the reasons why a reversal of the onus of proof is taxation refunds have not done so and that, in thought necessary by the Government. I say on fact, many of those taxpayers are finding, for the behalf of the Opposition that we would welcome first time in a c.ouple of years, that, instead of an explanation from the Treasurer as to why he having a refund, as a result of these rebates they believes, on behalf of the Government, that a reare getting debit assessments. So it is no wonder versal of the onus of proof can be defended and that they will want some answers. They will want justified. the Prime Minister to tell them what he is going to In the words of the Law Council-I quote from do about a capitfl,l gains tax, a wealth tax, indirect its letter to the Treasurer which was made public taxation and the reintroduction of death duties this morning-it is 'a staggering and unpreand estate duti.es. We want simple ariswers-yes cedented reversal of the onus of proof, imposing or no. Will we have a capital gains tax? It is not an improper and unnecessary burden and a good enough to say: 'I am sending it off to the change in the fundamental rights of every AusEconomic Planning Advisory Collncil'. That does tralian'. That is a very heavy criticism from a not prove a thing. We can all send it off to EPAC. respected body. I do not automatically adopt EPAC knot running the country.

Again, if my memory serves me under the Income Tax Assessment Act. I do not correctly, one of the areas of conflict when .that have enough time at the second reading stage to legislation was being debated during 1980 was the deal in detail with all of them but I will try to sumonus of proof provisions. There were some who marise the position of the Opposition. The Oppothought that a reversal of the onus of proof was sition welcomes many of the changes proposed by necessary. Others thought it was unnecessary. In the Government. We think they are necessary and the end the latter group substantially won the arsupportable and they will have our support.

I am not trying to score any political point seriously. but the problem is that, if the date is not altered back to 30 June 1982, anything of this kind given I noted that the honourable member for Benin relation to the Ash Wednesday catastrophe will nelong also spent a lot of time talking about next not attract tax deductibility.
