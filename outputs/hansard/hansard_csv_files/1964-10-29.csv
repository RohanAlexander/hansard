THE PARLIAMENT. the Opposition) Mr Speaker, before you call on the orders of the day, I want to rectify a wrong 1 did the Prime Minister( Sir Robert Menzies) recently. In the course of answering a question which I had asked about Boeing 727 aircraft, the Prime Minister saidMr Ansett is fortunate or unfortunate enough failure to take any action to limit the export of to see me once a year. I understand that he is a much closer personal friend of the Leader of the Opposition. I became angry at this and saidNo, he is not. I have not seen him for about five years. He came to offer me a donation to the party funds and I refused to see him. 1 was still angry and then saidHe cannot bribe me like he can bribe the Prime Minister. That was an unwarranted insult and I withdraw it and apologise for having made it. 1 am completely opposed to the Prime Ministers politics, as he well knows, but his integrity has never been in question. It is of the highest order. I do not want the remark to remain uncorrected in respect of Mr Ansett either. I do not like the way Ansett has obtained all the benents and advantages that he has, but I honestly do not believe he has ever obtained anything by bribery. I do not think he would offer a bribe and I do not think any Minister or any public servant would take one. I have made amends in this matter. 1 would like to say that I would not want not to be on friendly terms with all members of the House, as far as I can be-and I use the double negative to emphasise the positive. However, sometimes we become worked up and annoyed and make insulting comments to each other. WhatI have quoted to the House today did not appear in ""Hansard"", although the ""Hansard"" staff recorded portion of it. The last portion, the insulting portion, appeared in the daily Press. I think more people read the Press than read ""Hansard"" and therefore the damage was doubly important and could have a doubly bad effect. Sir Robert MenziesI thank the Leader of the Opposition for his remarks. General a question. I would like to read a letter that has been distributed in trade circles. It is a matter of grave seriousness to the business community. The letter has been distributed by a Melbourne firm of accountants, and I will give it to the Attorney. It reads: The Manufacturers of High Pressure Brassware are still seriously affected by the rising costs of raw materials, and the Government's continued copper-alloy scrap. The Manufacturers are therefore reluctantly forced, as from 24th September 1964, to apply a net surcharge of 5% to the price list dated 1st August 1964. It is most important that this surcharge be added to all invoices for High Pressure Brassware. If it is found that any resellers omit to add this surcharge the Manufacturers will be forced to take disciplinary action as inst the offenders. As metal prices are very unstable a new price list will be issued as soon as practicable. I ask the Attorney to take note of this complaint and perhaps to take some action to prevent the future dissemination of such threatening letters. at the letter which the honourable gentleman produces, but I should say to him quite clearly that as far as I am aware I have not received a complaint. OIL. Development seen a report that the Ampol Petroleum Limited refinery in Brisbane plans to use imported crude oil in preference to Moonie oil for the stated reason that Moonie oil is too dear? Can he say who is responsible for fixing the cost of Moonie oil to the refineries? Is the price of imported crude oil below that of Moonie oil because it is heavily subsidised by either the exporting country or the company? Will the Government take appropriate and prompt action to ensure that all locally produced crude oil is taken by Australian refineries? agreement to purchase Moonie oil runs till about the end of August next year. In the meantime my Department bas been active",7,Setup

6,Mr Fairbairn,"I believe that thein seeing that the local users of the oil and the owners of it get together to arrange for the sale of the oil. We hope that the sale will be concluded between the seller and the purchaser without Government intervention but, if it is not, obviously the Government will have to intervene. The Government has already looked at this problem to see what steps it can take in fhe event of a breakdown of negotiations. The honourable member has asked whether imported crude oil is cheaper than Moonie oil because of subsidies. To the best of my knowledge imported crude oil is cheaper not because of subsidies but because it comes from very large fields whereas Moonie is quite a small field. Further, many of the overseas fields have been in operation which are put forward by the Territory for a long time and their capital has been amortised, so the price of oil produced from them is much cheaper than it would otherwise be. Obviously, the policy of the Government is that all crude oil produced in Australia should be taken and used fully in Australia. This is a matter of policy which it would not be appropriate to discuss during question time, but I can say that the Government will see that fhe policy is implemented. the honourable member for Barton put a question to me concerning, among other things, recommendations in relation to teaching hospitals, and I said that I would find out the position. IfI may, I will comthis framework, however, the Department plete my answer to that question. This matter has been outstanding for 12 months. The Australian Universities Commission, which, as the honourable member knows, has had a rather busy year, will make recommendations for both capital and recurring grants to teaching hospitals some time in December, we hope early December, and the Government will, of course, deal with those proposals at the earliest possible opportunity. a question that I asked, the Minister for Territories said that the Department of Territories had made no proposals to the Department of National Development in respect of Northern Territory developmental matters. Is the Minister prepared to give the reasons for this situation? function of the Northern Division of the Department of National Development is to advise generally on northern development, and particularly to advise the Commonwealth Government in relation to projects put forward by the States of Queensland and Western Australia. Since the Northern Territory is administered by the Commonwealth, the position in relation to projects does not exist in respect of projects proposed by the Governments of Queensland and Western Australia. I point out also that the Minister for National Development and I are Commonwealth Ministers and the work of the Northern Division of the Department of National Development affords us useful opportunities for collaboration and consultation. All funds for works, particularly development works, in the Northern Territory are provided by the Commonwealth Government. This also is different from the situation in the States. The relationship between the Department of National Development and the Department of Territories is one of consultation and collaboration. Within of Territories is responsible for works and development relating solely to the Territory. The Northern Territory also has a very great interest in the Commonwealth beef roads project and in the Ord River scheme. I think that about one-third of the Ord River basin is within the Territory. Many developments are being undertaken in the Territory by private enterprise, including the manganese projects on Groote Eylandt. The Government hopes soon to receive proposals for the development of the bauxite deposits on the Gove Peninsula. Finally, I assure the honourable member that the Commonwealth is very anxious to promote development of the Northern Territory, particularly in the pastoral, mineral and agricultural industries.",13,Restrictive Trade Practices
7,Sir Robert Menzies,Yesterday,14,Northern Territory Development
8,Mr Nelson,"Recently, in answer to",14,Northern Territory Development
9,Mr Barnes,"I point out that thefor National Development a question concerning a statement in this morning's "" Australian"" about changes in the Petroleum Search Subsidy Act. As the report, in my view, does not make clear the Government's intentions, will the Minister assure the House that the Government still intends to aid exploration for new oil and gas deposits? Is he satisfied that the expected changes in thc Act will not penalise future exploration or the full provrecent Ss. a week increase in pensions? ing of a field when oil or gas is found? that we have faced concerning the petroleum search subsidy was brought about by the very success of the subsidy scheme. Honourable members will recall that when the subsidy was introduced the search for petroleum deposits in Australia was almost grinding to a halt, and this was the reason for the introduction of the subsidy scheme. I think that in one year only 14 wells were drilled throughout Australia. The Government introduced the scheme with the aim of encouraging the search for oil. It has been so successful that we are now reaching a rate of drilling of over 200 wells per annum, and we have had great success in finding oil. Altogether, some £15 million has been paid out in subsidy, and we aim at paying in subsidy £5 million this financial year. Because of the success in drilling for oil, so many more applications have been received as to make it impossible to satisfy all out of the £5 million allocated. Therefore, the Government has had to decide whether to increase the sum-thi s would have to be done at the expense of the taxpayers-o r to evolve some new system to encourage the search for oil in areas where deposits have not previously been located. I have discussed this matter with representatives of the Australian Petroleum Exploration Association and the various interests that are searching for oil in Australia. They have agreed that the system we adopted of limiting the subsidy in respect of operations in areas where oil or gas has been found is best. Oil or gas has now been located in some 17 areas in Australia and we have two oilfields as well. In areas within a specified radius of these locations, the subsidy will not be paid. It will be paid in respect of operations in more remote areas, and we hope that it will encourage operations resulting in more oil and gas strikes. Labour and National Service a question. Has the honourable gentleman seen the statement by the financial editor of the "" Sydney Morning Herald"" that prices have already deprived pensioners of the value of the Do:s the Minister know that the Australian consumer price index reveals rises of from 8s. to 10s. 6d. a week in the last two quarters -the greatest rise in any two quarters since 1956? Does he recollect that on 30th September, in reply to my request that he assist in preventing galloping inflation from robbing workers of the value of their wages, he stated that I was not in my right mind in suggesting that there was a danger of galloping inflation? If inflation is not galloping will the Minister agree that it is speeding along at a merry old canter and may at any time break into a gallop? Will the Minister now assist workers and persioners to obtain adequate income increases? Will he also assist in preventing those increases from being taken away by unjustifiable price rises? said that the honourable member for Scullin was not in his right mind. IfI did use those words I regret it. I have a great deal of respect for the honourable member. As to the matters raised by the honourable member, I did point out yesterday that you cannot take month by month or quarter by quarter variations in the consumer price index as indicating the true trend. I pointed out that only a few days after the last consumer price index was issued the prices of potatoes and meat, particularly mutton and beef, fell substantially. I still adhere to what I said earlier-ther e is no galloping inflation or sign of galloping inflation. As the honourable gentlemen well said, inflationary pressures are being reflected in the consumer price index. Nonetheless, the matters raised by the honourable gentleman will be considered by the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission when it next reviews the basic wage. Equally, price changes are one of the things that influence the Government when it considers pensions.",14,Northern Territory Development

The honourable member is right when he says that the Government introduced what he calls a well conceived scheme for increasing the number of apprentices in country areas.

Under the formula which was put into operation in May last, employees today are earning anything up to £2 per week over their normal salaries because of measured productivity. In the course of producing this happy situation for the factory, and, indeed, for the employees, we have had a good deal of understanding and cooperation from the Australian Council of Trade Unions and also from the omcers of the Department of Labour and National Service, for which we are very much appreciative.

That the Bill be now read a second time. ments to the Export Payments Insurance to strengthen and improve its ability to provide payments insurance. The purpose and general functions of the Export Payments Insurance Corporation will, by now, be familiar to the House. Briefly, it was established by the Government in 1956 to promote exports, by insurnon-payment not normally insured by commercial insurers. The outstanding prooperations in 1957 demonstrates, quite dramatically, that there was, and still is, a real need for these facilities, and that the Corporation is fully alive to its responsibility to meet this need. In 1957-58, its first full in 1963-64, the figure was almost £64 million. Over the same period markets which would otherwise hjTe been virtually inaccessible, because of the trading risks involved. Security against the risk of non-payment, however, is not the only benefit of export insurance. E.P.I.C. can, if the exporter wishes, assign the insurance policy to a is often an invaluable aid to the exporter",20,Nuclear Tests

54,Mr Mcewen (Murray,"Minister forin securing finance for exports on credit terms. In most large capital goods transactions involving medium or long term credit, for example, E.P.I.C. insurance is usually required as part of the security if the exporter is to obtain bank finance. Even with this added security, however, it is not always easy for banks to accept the residual risks involved, whicb E.P.I.C. insurance cannot cover, and agree to provide medium or long term finance. It is this feature of export insurance which the major amendment in the Bill before the House is intended to strengthen. Under the proposed amendment the repayment of advances which banks make to finance export transactions may be guaranteed by the Corporation against non-payment by the buyer for any reason. The normal E.P.I.C. contract covers only specified risks of non-payment whereas the guarantee covers non-payment for any reason. The guarantees would work in this way: The exporter would obtain from E.P.I.C. normal payments insurance cover on the transaction and assign the policy to his bank. If the bank required further security the exporter could then obtain from E.P.I.C., for a small additional premium, a guarantee in the bank's favour which would extend cover to include risks of non-payment not insured against, under the normal policy. The extent of indemnity under the guarantee would be 90 per cent, initially, rising.to 100 percent, if, after two years, performance of the contract had been satisfactory. This reduces the need for the exporter to provide collateral security to the bank and protects the bank's interestsif non-payment occurred the bank would receive payment under the guarantee within three months of the date of non-payment, regardless of the cause of non-payment. Guarantees of this sort will not be required for the bulk of our exports which are transacted on a cash or short term credit basis. They will therefore be confined to transactions in which: Capital or semi-capital goods are involved; The value involved is £100,000 or more; Credit terms of two years or more are being extended to the overseas buyer. It is worth noting at this point that a number of overseas countries including the United States of America, Canada and the United Kingdom-the United Kingdom is the model for our proposal-provid e similar guarantees to their exporters. It is quite probable that guarantees will be required in cases where the Government, in the ""national interest"", which in this context is a technical term, accepts liability under the insurance contract. These are normally likely to be transactions involving capital goods of substantial value. Indeed, this is very often why they cannot be insured on a commercial basis by E.P.I.C. and are therefore accepted by the Government under the national interest provisions of tbe Act. It is proposed under the Bill that where guarantees are issued in national interest cases the Commonwealth will be liable for any claims. The Bill proposes several other amendments to the Act, which I shall now deal with briefly. It is proposed that the Act be amended to allow E.P.I.C. to share with the Government some part of the insurance or guarantee contract where national interest cover is provided by the Government. There have been cases in the past where, due to the size of the contract and the risks involved, the Corporation has been unable to accept for insurance on its own account the full amount of the transaction. Nevertheless it would have been prepared to accept part of it. It is proposed to amend the Act to enable the Corporation to participate in such national interest cases if, and to the extent, it wishes. It is also proposed that the maximum percentages of cover which the Corporation may offer should be removed from the Act where they are now specified, and alternatively be prescribed in regulations to the Act. This will enable changes to be made in the levels of cover provided, without undue delay, and thus allow E.P.I.C. to move quickly to meet changing competitive conditions in international trade. It is not proposed, however, that there should be any change for the time being in the maximum percentages now specified in the Act, namely 85 per cent, of loss where the cause of loss is commercial-identifie d by the description "" commercial risk ""-and 95 per cent, of loss from any other cause-identi fied as ""political risk"". In addition it is intended to make provision for the Minister to approve, in special circumstances, higher percentages of cover than those prescribed in the regulations. Special circumstances warranting consideration of higher cover could rise where the insurance cover under the standard E.P.I.C. policy would expose the exporter to unduly high financial risk, and where the effects on thc exporter of accepting this risk could endanger current or future export transactions in a particular market. Special higher cover might be justified, for example, on large commodity transactions, where margins are very fine and the amount at risk on the exporter's own account is very large. In the drive for exports it is important that facilities should exist under which E.P.I.C. can seek ministerial approval to issue special contracts of this type. The maximum contingent liability which the Corporation can assume is specified in the Act and sets an upper limit to the Government's liability in respect of export payments insurance, and, in effect, to the volume of business the Corporation can write. When the Corporation was established in 1956 its maximum contingent liability was fixed at £25 million. As the business insured by the Corporation increased this figure was found to be inadequate and was increased to £50 million in 1959. The continued success of the Corporation in developing Australia's export trade has led to a situation in which the total of its firm commitments and business under firm offer or negotiation is very close to the maximum contingent liability at present specified in the tion is the function of the State authorities Act. As at 30th September 1964, the Corporation's actual contingent liability on contracts was £34.4 million. Since business under firm offer or negotiation totalled £12 million at that time, the total current and prospective contingent liability of the Corporation is now of the order of £45 million to £46 million-onl y £4 million or £5 million short of the statutory maximum. There is therefore an urgent need to increase the maximum contingent liability of the Corporation, and the Bill proposes that it should be raised from £50 million to £75 million. Finally, the opportunity has been taken to make several minor amendments to certain sections of the Act. It is proposed to amend the banking provisions of the Act to take F.12500/64 -R -[91 ] account of the change of name of the Commonwealth Bank and to bring them into line with the corresponding provisions included in other recent Commonwealth legislation relating to statutory authorities. It is also proposed to raise from £2,500 per annum to £3,500 per annum the maximum salary of a position which the Corporation may determine without ministerial approval. The proposals contained in this Bill are designed to strengthen and improve the facilities provided by the Export Payments Insurance Corporation in a way wbich will enable it to add to the already valuable contribution it is making to the drive for increased exports. I therefore commend the Bill to honourable members. Debate (on motion by Mr Crean) adjourned. MEAT INSPECTION ARRANGEMENTS BILL 1964. Bill presented by Mr Adermann, and read a first time. Second Reading. for Primary Industry) [11.32] I move That the Bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this Bill is to make provision for the Commonwealth to enter into an arrangement with a State or a State meat authority for Commonwealth inspectors to undertake the inspection of meat for consumption in Australia. The Commonwealth has the responsibility of inspecting meat for the export markets whereas the inspection of meat intended for home consumpconcerned. In most approved export meat establishments Commonwealth and State inspectors work together on the inspection of meat for both export and home consumption. There has been a commendable degree of co-operation between Commonwealth and State inspection services, but a certain amount of overlapping has been inevitable. The problem associated with Commonwealth-State inspection has been considered by the Australian Agricultural Council over a lengthy period but an acceptable solution to cover all States has not been found. It has been generally agreed that there would be considerable advantages in having meat inspection under one authority in each State, but it has been recognised that a number of difficulties such as disease",21,Export Payments Insurance Corporation Bill 1964
55,Mr Adermann (Fisher,"Ministe rcontrol, seasonal conditions affecting transfer of staff, salary differentials, etc., must be overcome in achieving this objective. The desirability for the introduction of a single inspection service has been further emphasised recently by the import conditions applied by the authorities in some of Australia's important markets. One of these conditions is that the control of meat inspection must be under "" a service organised and administered by the national Government"". This implies that the overall control of registered export premises, including those which process meat for home consumption as well as for export, must be under a Commonwealth department. To comply with this requirement it has been necessary, in States which prefer to maintain their own inspection services, for agreements to be made for Commonwealth and State and/or municipal inspectors to work together under the supervision of a Commonwealth veterinary officer. This has ensured uniform inspection procedures and standards for export ahd home consumption meat and meat products. The Bill is primarily intended to enable an arrangement to be concluded with the South Australian Government and the Metropolitan and Export Abattoirs Board in South Australia for Commonwealth officers to inspect both export and home consumption meat in registered export establishments in that State. The Bill has, however, been expressed in a manner which would enable other States to enter into a similar arrangement if so desired. If, at the request of a State or a State meat authority, the Commonwealth undertakes the inspection of meat for home consumption, action will be taken to ensure that there is no retrenchment of State meat authority or Commonwealth inspectors. Under the proposed arrangement with South Australia, all State Department of Agriculture and Metropolitan and Export Abattoirs Board meat inspectors will, if they so desire, be transferred to. the Commonwealth Public Service as permanent officers. The Bill provides for the South Australian inspectors to preserve their eligibility for a first time. accrued recreation leave up to 30 days, also the total credit of sick leave and furlough credits. The Bill also makes special provision for those officers who are contributors General) [11.39] I moveto the South Australian Superannuation Fund to transfer to the Commonwealth Superannuation Fund on appointment to the Commonwealth service. It is proposed that the Commonwealth will be reimbursed for the inspection of meat for home consumption (a) by the State Department of Agriculture on the basis of the cost to the Commonwealth of the work performed and (b) by the Metropolitan and Export Abattoirs Board on the basis of a formula which will determine the upward or downward movement of charges based on the throughput for home consumption. There have been tremendous changes in the character of the meat trade in recent years. These changes have been brought about by the development of the North American market for Australian meat and the fact that 99 per cent, of exports to that market are in the form of boneless beef and mutton, which requires much more extensive inspection and supervision than that provided in the previous carcass inspection procedure. This tendency is also developing in respect of the United Kingdom market, to which approximately 90 per cent, of the export meat now being shipped is in boneless form. The traditional trade with the United Kingdom for many years has been in carcass form. Associated with this development is the tendency for a greater number of meat works to register as exports establishments so that the surplus meat above home consumption requirements can be diverted to export markets. A combination of requirements of importing countries and the inspection procedures which will enable the meat to be sold for either the export or the home consumption market is bringing Commonwealth and State inspectors, standards and procedures closer together. I commend the Bill to honourable members. Debate (on motion by Mr PoDard) adjourned. FEES BILL 1964. Bill presented by Mr Hulme, and read Second Reading. That the Bill be now read a second time.",23,Export Payments Insurance Corporation Bill 1964
56,Mr Hulme (Petrie,"PostmasterThc purpose of this Bill is to provide for the payment of fees in respect of licences for commercial television stations. I will later introduce Bills to provide for the payadvertising, as representing the cost of proment of fees in respect of licences for commercial broadcasting stations, to repeal the existing Broadcasting and Television Stations Licence Fees Act 1956 and to amend section 106 of thc Broadcasting and Television Act 1942-1963, as amended by the Broadcasting and Television Act 1964. The 1956 Act, which is now to be repealed, provided that the annual fee payable by a licensee should be £25 in the case of a broadcasting station and £100 in the case of a television station, plus in each case 1 per cent, of the gross earnings of the station "" in respect of the broadcasting or televising of advertisements or other matter"". This Act was passed by Parliament in 1956, the year in which television services commenced in Australia. Its provisions were, of necessity, framed in the light of experience with the broadcasting services and the manner in which, at that time, it was envisaged that the television station licensees would conduct their operations. Experience has since shown, however, that it is virtually impossible to properly assess the licence fee in respect of television stations on the basis now preof assessment, which is reflected in the scribed-that is, on the basis of the "" sale of station time "". I should here explain that broadcasting ancl television stations earn revenue in two ways-(a ) in the case of sessions sponsored by an advertiser, partly by selling the pro""gross earnings"" specifically excludes gramme itself to the advertiser and partly, but as a separate transaction, by selling the advertiser ""station time"" to put the programme on the air; and (b) in the case of unsponsorcd sessions, by selling "" station time"" to ""spot"" advertisers, the station itself meeting the cost of the programme but taking this into account in fixing the price to advertisers for ""spots"" during the session. Licensees of commercial television stations have, in determining the amount of gross earnings to be shown in statutory declarations lodged with the Australian Broadcasting Control Board pursuant to section 106 of the Broadcasting and Television Act, for licence fee purposes, adopted of rates to be imposed. This is the practice of excluding not only the thc most important aspect of the amounts paid by advertisers for programmes legislation, as it is the rates of in sponsored sessions but also, in the case of unsponsored programmes, an estimated amount of the revenue received from spot grammes with which the spot advertising is associated. The deductions from spot advertising revenue are being made on the basis of arbitrary and varying proportions which the Board has no way of controlling. Honourable members will agree that it is desirable, from all points of view, that the basis of assesment of licence fees should be clearly defined and capable of ready determination. After considering the various possibilities it has been decided to adopt an "" advertising receipts "" basis of assessment on the grounds that the fee should be assessed on the station's turnover and be a first charge on revenue. Such a basis is also directly related to the main business activity deriving from the grant of the licence-that is, the selling of advertising. The adoption of the advertising receipts basis, to which I bave referred, would mean that the licence fee would be levied on all revenue received from advertisers by a licensee with respect to the broadcasting or televising of advertisements, extending to cover both station time and payments for programmes. Under this basis definition of ""gross earnings"" in clause 4 of the Bill, all spot advertising revenue would be subject to licence fee, and likewise all revenue received from sponsored advertising, both with respect to station time and programme sales, would also be assessable. It will be noted that the definition of earnings from the production of filmed advertisements. It is known that some organisations closely related to licensee companies perform such work on behalf of advertisers as a commercial activity separate from the licensee's normal business of operating a television station. If this exclusion were not made, licensees' earnings from this source could be subject to licence fees, pursuant to clause 7 of the Bill, which relates to the diversion of revenue to related oganisations. This did not seem appropriate. I turn now to the question of the scale probably proposed the levy which determine its impact. Honourable on gross earnings from advertising receiptsmembers will be aware of the spectacular 1 per cent, up to £500,000; 2 per cent. increase which has occurred in the revenue £500,001 to £1,000,000; 3 per cent. of commercial television stations.

Despite the spectacular increase in the earnings of both television and broadcastadjourned. ing stations, the rates of licences fees have remained unchanged since 1956.

So far as broadcasting stations are concerned, the fees paid were £109,544 as against gross earnings of £12 million and profits of £2.5 million.

Television Act 1964. The Bill proposes an amendment made necessary by the proappropriate provisions to enable a refund visions of the Bills for the Television of fees to be made by the Department Stations Licence Fees Act 1964 and for where there is a moral or implied legal the Broadcasting Stations Licence Fees Act obligation to do so; for example, where 1964, which I introduced earlier, and a licence has been taken out unnecessarily amendments to the licensing conditions for or a person eligible for a reduced rate broadcast and television receivers. Clause3 of the Bill seeks an amendof this clause, I would mention that there ment to Section 106 of the principal Act; are occasions when a wife, not knowing the amendment is of a machinery nature that her husband has taken out a licence, arising from the changes in the licence fees for the commercial broadcasting and television stations and the definition of ""gross earnings"" which now forms the basis of the fees to be paid by the stations concerned. The other provisions of the Bill seek to amend the licensing arrangements for broadcast and television receivers. Provision is being made for the transfer of the responsibility for taking out licences for broadcast and television receivers provided as part of the furnishings of rented furnished premises from the tenant to the lessor. Under the present legisation, it is necessary for each tenant who has the use of a broadcast or television receiver which has been provided by the landlord in rented furnished premises to take out a licence at the pre(Petrie-Postmaster scribed full annual fee for the receiver concerned. As a result, with a succesion of tenants during any period of twelve months a number of such licences would be required in respect of the one receiver. This was not the intention of the present legislation and the new arrangements proposed by the Bill arc designed to overcome this anomaly. The present Act enables the grant of a licence with effect from a date prior to that placed on the provisions of that Act and the Broadcasting and Television Regulahas raised doubts as to whether an antedated licence may be accepted as an answer receiver. The proposed section 126 (d) in clause 4 of the Bill specifies that in any (Petrie-Postmaster proceeding for an offence against those sections of the Act which relate to licences for broadcast and television receivers, an Clause5 of the Bill seeks to introduce licence pays the full fee.

The same situation applies where a pensioner, not realising that he is entitled to a reduced rate licence, pays the full licence fee.

Debate (on motion by Mr Allan Fraser) adjourned. Bill presented by Mr Swartz, and read a first time. Second Reading. the House, I should like to make a second reading speech which will cover four Repatriation Bills, three of which have yet to be presented. They all refer to the same amendments. tion, that course will be followed. Minister for Repatriation) [11.58] I move That the Bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this Bill and of those associated with it is to give effect to a number of desirable machinery changes in the repatriation legislation. In addition, arising from recent legal advisings and administrative difficulties in relation to medical treatment which has long been provided for non war caused disabilities, appropriate amendments are being made to section 124 of the Repatriation Act which authorises the making of regulations. The amendments proposed continue the Government's practice of making adjustments to legislation in the interests in total payment to be made to the sustenof ex-servicemen and their dependants as the need for them is brought to notice in the normal course of administration. Details of the proposals follow Appeals to Assessment Appeal Tribunals are on two grounds-wher e pension is granted but the pensioner is not satisfied with the rate of pension allowed, or where a disability is accepted as due to war service but, in the opinion of the Repatriation Board or the Repatriation Commission, the degree of incapacity does not warrant a pension assessment. In the former category, the Tribunal, if it allows the appeal, can give effect to the increase from the same date as the commencement of the pension assessment against which the appeal was made; that is, three months before the lodgement of the claim. In the latter category the earliest date the Tribunal can fix is six months prior to the date of lodgement of the appeal and, because of the time taken to process claims, it happens in some cases that this is later than the date the Board or Commission could have fixed. The amendment proposed to section 78 will remove this anomaly. The second proposal concerns the treatment of medical sustenance for service pension purposes. Medical sustenance is paid where a war pensioner or claimant is prevented from working because of the necessity for treatment of an accepted disability, or while he is undergoing medical investigation in connection with a war pension claim. Sustenance is regarded as income in assessing a service pension under the Repatriation Act, and its payment there-' fore leads to pension adjustments. Because sustenance is paid for relatively short periods the adjustments to pension are temporary, but can involve reduction or even suspension or cancellation of the service pension. These temporary adjustments cause a good deal of administrative inconvenience, and, moreover, cancellation or suspension of the service pension can result in the temporary loss of eligibility for associated medical and other Commonwealth benefits and for other benefits provided for these pensioners from public and private sources. The Bill therefore provides that for service pension purposes, medical sustenance, will not be regarded as income. Passage of this legislation will enable any necessary adjustment ance allowance instead of to the service pension. The Repatriation Act does not define a step-child. It has hitherto been thought that the expression includes only the child of a former marriage dissolved by death. Legal advice however, is that the expression may include the child of a marriage dissolved otherwise than by death, for example, by divorce. In principle it seems that a war pension should not be paid in the latter case",27,Broadcasting And Television Tions Which Relate To Ante Dating Of Licences

62,Mr Swartz (Darling Downs,"unless the step-parent "" member"" has accepted responsibility for the child's maintenance, or unless after the member's death liis widow has accepted that responsibility. The Bill inserts a definition of step-child which gives effect to this principle. There have always been provisions in the Repatriation Act and in associated legislation which require tbe amount of war pension payable under the law of another part of the Queen's Dominions to be taken into account in assessing the rate of Australian war pension payable. As a result of some countries ceasing to be part of the Queen's dominions, war pension payable by those countries will no longer be taken into account unless an appropriate change is made in thc relevant legislation. The preAct as it presently stands. An amendment sent Bills make this change. Three changes are being made in service pensions provisions. The first removes the present means test as to the child's own means in the case of the first or only child of a service pensioner if he is in the custody due to war service for certain ex-serviceof his parents. This brings the service pension provision into line in this regard with the comparable provision for child's allowance payable under the Social Services Act to the wife of an invalid pensioner who has custody of a child. The position of a child not in its parents' custody remains unaltered. A further amendment removes any doubt regarding the eligibility for payment of the higher rate of 15s. per week service pension to a younger child where the pension of an older child ceases and, in such a case, for the payment of the lower rate of 2s. 6d. per week to any younger children not exceeding three in number. The third amendment in the service pension area relates to payment of service pension during the temporary absence overseas of the pensioner. Under the Repatriation Act a service pension may be continued during the temporary absence of the pensioner from Australia for a period of up to six months irrespective of which country the pensioner visits. Under the Social Services Act a social service pension may in similar circumstances be continued generally for a period of up to twelve weeks. However, in consequence of reciprocal arrangements with the United Kingdom and New Zealand, social service pensioners visiting those countries may have their pensions continued for un indefinite period. The Repatriation Act is being amended to enable the Commission to extend the period of payment for visitors to the United Kingdom and New Zealand, on the lines of the arrangements for social service pensioners, while retaining the existing policy of six months limitation for visitors to other countries. Under the Repatriation regulations medical treatment may be provided for the widows of deceased members of the Forces as well as for certain other dependants. In consequence of a recent legal advising it appears that there may be some doubt about whether this provision in the regulations is sustained by the regulation-making power in section 124 of the Repatriation to section 124 included in this Bill will put this matter beyond doubt. The Repatriation regulations also authorise medical treatment for disabilities not men who are seriously disabled as a result of war service, for war nurses of 1914-18 war and for member service pensioners. Regulations in force since 1943 have authorised the Commission to recover the cost of such treatment where the patient has a right of recovery against some other person by way of damages or compensation. Doubts have recently been expressed about whether the regulation-making power authorises the provisions for charge and recovery in these cases and there have been difficulties in proving the cost of treatment where this has been disputed. The opportunity is therefore being taken in this Bill to confirm that the regulations may provide for the recovery of the cost of treatment in such cases and that the regulations may authorise an appropriate scale of charges in these circumstances. Certain of the amendments I have mentioned will also need to be applied to other repatriation legislation. The Bills accompanying this measure give effect to these requirements. They are the Interim Forces Benefits Bill, the Repatriation (Far East Strategic Reserve) Bill and the Repatriation (Special Overseas Service) Bill. In the case of the Far East Strategic Reserve Bill the opportunity is being taken to insert a provision validating certain payments under that Act which were made prior to the making of regulations. As I have indicated the Bills make a number of changes in the interests of the welfare of ex-servicemen and of common sense administration and I commend them to the House.

Honourable members will recall that in the course of the debate on the recent Seamen's War Pensions and Allowances Bill it was indicated that a further Bill would be introduced as soon as possible to give effect to certain other proposals. This is tbe main operative clauses of the Bill seriatim. Clause3 inserts a deiinition of step-son and step-daughter, because such a definition has been found to be necessary in the Ught of recent legal advice. The definition will ensure that for the purposes of the Act"" step-child"" will be confined to a stepchild of a mariner where the previous marriage of the mariner's spouse has been dissolved by death, or otherwise than by death and the child is in the custody, care and control of the mariner, or is being maintained by him, or in the case of his death was in his custody, care and control or was being maintained by him at the time of his death, or after his death is in the care, custody and control of his widow. Appropriate wording is included to cover cases where the mariner is a female. Clause4 ensures that in cases where the marriage of a pensioner under the Act is dissolved otherwise than by death, the wife of the pensioner ceases to be eligible for payment of pension under the Act. Section 53A of the Act requires that where a mariner or any of his dependants is entitled to receive a war pension or other benefits under the law of another part of the Queen's dominions the amount involved is to be taken into account in assessing the rate of war pension or other benefit payable under this Act.

Secondly, it inserts a power authorising the recovery of the cost of medical treatment for disabilities not due to war service for certain classes of seriously disabled mariners where the mariner has a right of recovery against some other person by way of damages or compensation. In addition to effecting minor amendments necessary to clarify the meaning of the Act and to remove certain anomalies the amendment confers real benefits on seriously disabled mariner pensioners and I am sure it will have the support of all the honourable members. Debate (on motion by Mr Pollard) adjourned. Bill presented by Mr Snedden, and read a first time. Second Reading. General) [12.17] I move That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill has three purposes. Two of them are quite formal, but the third is a matter of substantial importance in the administration of justice in the Australian Capital Territory and is the reason for bringing the legislation before the House at this time. The substantial matter is a proposed amendment to ensure an appropriate right of appeal to persons who plead guilty in the Australian Capital Territory to criminal charges before a magistrate and are committed by the magistrate for sentence and are subsequently sentenced by the Supreme Court. The Act presently provides for appeal to the High Court by "" a person convicted on indictment before the Supreme Court"", and leave of the High Court is necessary where a person so convicted seeks to appeal only against sentence. The High Court recently held that a person sentenced by the Supreme Court after plea of guilty and committal for sentence was not "" a person convicted on indictment"" and that therefore the High Court had no jurisdiction to entertain his appeal. There has been judicial comment here in the Australian Capital Territory that any appeal prospect should not be denied to an accused, and with this comment I am sure honourable members will at once agree. I have therefore adopted an interim practice of signing ex-officio indictments in cases of committal for sentence. This ensures that, even though there is a plea of guilty, there is a conviction on indictment which is appealable. A permanent remedy is, however, essentia], and the Bill will therefore operate directly to preserve the appeal rights in cases where the simple committal for sentence procedure is followed and there is no indictment at all. The opportunity has been taken to include in the Bill a provision to put beyond doubt that the judges of the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory may hold judicial appointments in other Territories without affecting the validity of their Australian Capital Territory commissions. They do not of course receive any additional remuneration in respect of these other appointments. The Conciliation and Arbitration Bill at present before the House makes clear that the Judges' commissions as judges of the Commonwealth Industrial Court are not affected, but that Bill leaves it to the Australian Capital Territory Supreme Court Act to protect the Supreme Court commissions. In other words, the two Bills are complementary. The Supreme Court Act at present deals with the position so far as the permanent judge is concerned but not the additional judges. The Bill before the House closes that gap. It also brings the relevant section, 8A, up to date in another respect by omitting its existing provisions that a judge may hold the office of Judge Advocate-General of a part of the defence force and that he may hold other non-judicial office, not being an office of profit, with",30,Seamen S War Pensions And Allowances Bill No 2 1964
67,Mr Snedden (Bruce,"Attorneythe approval of the Governor General. In recent times a judge has not held the appointment of Judge Advocate-General and it is probably undesirable that he should do so because it is not a judicial appointment. Regarding a judge holding other nonjudical office, the Acts creating other federal United Nations authorities. I am pleased to and Territory courts do not contain provisions permitting it, and it would be consistent to omit the provision in the Australian Capital Territory also. The remaining matter dealt with in the Bill is the matter of appointment of court officials such as the Registrar, Deputy Registrar, and the Sheriff. There is need to permit the appointment of additional deputy registrars and of deputy sheriffs. The Bill provides for this. It also provides that all court officials will, in future, be appointed by the Attorney-General instead of by the Governor General. The Attorney-General appoints court officials in the Northern Territory, and there seems to be no reason why the Governor General should be required to appoint them in the Australian Capital Territory. I commend the Bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Whitlam) adjourned. Bill presented by Mr Snedden, and read a first time. Second Reading. General) [12.22] I move That the Bill be now read a second time. The immediate purpose of this Bill is to give effect to international arrangements covering the exercise of jurisdiction over members of the United Nations Force in Cyprus. Honourable members will recall that earlier this year the Commonwealth Government was asked by the United Nations to furnish some forty policemen for service with the United Nations Force. These men were not to perform military duties, but were to undertake roles which the Commander of the United Nations Force considered could be better filled by civilian police. The Commonwealth and the States have co-operated in meeting the request of the United Nations. The Police Forces of all States are represented in the unit that has been serving in Cyprus since 25th May 1964; so are the Commonwealth Police Force and the Forces of the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory. The Australian police have been well received in Cyprus by the Greek and Turkish communities, and also by the inform the House that the Government has agreed to a request by the United Nations that Superintendent Hamilton, who is an officer of the Commonwealth Police Force, and who was the officer-in-charge of the Australian Police Unit, be seconded to the United Nations to become Police Adviser to the Commander of the United Nations Force in Cyprus. He will succeed the Chief Constable of Stockholm who formerly held this post and who has returned to Sweden. Superintendent Hamilton has for some time been acting as Deputy to the Police Adviser. This is a distinct honour, especially when regard is had to the fact that the United Nations Force includes police from four countries other than Australia, namely, Austria, Denmark, Sweden and New Zealand. Thc House will also be interested to know that the United Kingdom defence authorities have praised the efforts made by the Australian police to unravel the circumstances surrounding the disappearance in Cyprus of two United Kingdom soldiers, Major Macey and Trooper Piatt. Although, regrettably, their investigations did not succeed in identifying the abductors, the thoroughness of their work under trying conditions was described as magnificent. The United Nations Force in Cyprus is operating under a status of forces agreement concluded between the United Nations and the Republic of Cyprus. The agreement extends to the Australian Police Unit. Honourable members will, I think, be familiar with the general pattern of these status of forces agreements, and they will recall, in particular, the agreement concluded last year between the Commonwealth and the United States with regard to the exercise of jurisdiction over United States forces in Australia. Here we have the reverse position, and we are concerned with the exercise of jurisdiction over Australian personel in another country. Under the agreement concluded with the United Nations, the Republic of Cyprus has made very substantial concessions in favour of countries that have contributed personnel",31,Australian Capital Territory Supreme Court Bill 1964
68,Mr Snedden (Bruce,"Attorneyto the United Nations Force. The concessions so made, indeed, take away entirely the right of tbe Cyprus courts to exercise jurisdiction in respect of offences committed by members of that Force. At the same time, all countries contributing personnel have an obligation, pursuant to the status of forces agreement, to see to it that their own laws apply, and that the jurisdiction of their own courts is available, in relation to any offences that might be committed by their personnel. At the moment there is, so to speak, a legal vacuum insofar as members of the Australian Police Unit are concerned. They are not subject to the jurisdiction of the Cyprus courts, and yet, as matters stand, the laws in force in Australia with respect generally to the commission of offences do not apply to them. The Bill now before the House is designed to fill that gap. I have referred more than once to the Act passed by Parliament last year. United Nations operations in Cyprus. The Bill itself, as bonorable members will have returned to Australia and there charged perceived, makes no reference either to with an offence. It further provides that the Cyprus or to the Australian Police Unit law of the State or Territory where a person serving in that country.

The laws applying to members of the defence force are already in a form that enables advantage to be taken of status of forces agreements of the kind that we have been discussing. Members of the defence force are, accordingly, first time. expressly excluded from the definition of ""person to whom this Act applies"" in Clause3 of the Bill. I have just two further comments to make before looking at the scheme which The purpose of this Bill is to extend the the Bill adopts with regard to the exercise operation of the Cellulose Acetate Flake of jurisdiction by Australian courts. First, it would, of course, be hoped, and expected, Bounty Act 1956-1964 for a 'maximulm that Australians serving with a United period of three months to 31st March 1965.

But-and this is my second pointif, perchance, expectations in that regard are not realised, the person concerned will have the very real safeguard of trial in an Australian court in accordance with law in the same way as if the act or omission had occurred in Australia itself. Broadly, what the Bill does is to make it an offence for a person to whom it applies to do anything in the place in which he is serving which would be an offence if it were done in the Australian Capital Territory.

69,Mr Bury (Wentworth,"Minister forby the Tariif Board which is investigating the general question of what assistance should be afforded the production in Australia of cellulose acetate flake and related products. Although the duration of the Act has already been extended for a period of six months, it still appears likely that the Tariff Board's report will not be received in time for the Government to study it and take appropriate action before the expiry of the extended Act. The Board has completed its public inquiry on this matter, but the wide scope of reference of the inquiry has, in part at least, caused the delay in finalising the report. The Bill, therefore, extends the operation of the Cellulose Ace'.ate Flake Bounty Act 1956-1964 to 31st March 1965 or to a date to be proclaimed, such date to be not later than 31st March 1965 and not earlier than the date of proclamation.

Debate resumed from 22nd October (vide question had been on the notice paper, That the Bill be now read a second time. purpose of this Bill is to increase the number of puisne judges of the Commonwealth Industrial Court from three to four. The last time a bill on this precise subject came before us was in 1960, when the number of puisne judges was increased from two to three. The reason given on that occasion was that one of the existing judges was due for long service leave and that the judges in general were required to establish a pool of Federal judges for Territorial Supreme Courts. On that occasion the suggestion was made that such a pool would be a useful adjunct to Commomvealth powers in many fields. It was suggested that the members could man a new Federal superior court. This is a matter upon which there has been a great deal of speculation in the last few years. In fact, I first mentioned the subject in the House in the debate in the estimates for the Attorney-General's Department in 1958. I raised the subject again in the debate on the Judiciary Bill 1959, the Patents Bill 1960 and the Copyright Bill 1963. On the last two occasions, on behalf of my party I suggested that a pool of judges should be used to hear appeals in matters of industrial property, which is a Commonwealth preserve under the Constitution. I made a similar proposal for a Federal superior court at the legal convention in Perth in July 1959. In January last year the then Attorney-General authorised the Solicitor-General to announce at the legal convention in Hobart that Cabinet authority had been given to design such a court. I had the temerity to refer to the delay in ths project in the debate on the estimates for the Attorney-General's Department at the first appearance of the present Attorney General( Mr Snedden) as a Minister last month, but it was among several subjects I raised and he abused me for having made scarce have ventured to mention the subject again in his hearing, even in thc debate o:i morning our learned friend, the honourable his maiden question on this point. I did not have the gall to point out that the very unanswered, in my name for five weeks. The reason for the increase in the number of puisne judges on this occasion is for no such purpose. What is the reason? The Attorney-General has stated that the existing members of the Commonwealth Industrial Court have been engaged in a number of functions over the years. The Chief Judge, in particular, has conducted courts of marine inquiry under the Navigation Act. He has presided over boards of inquiry into air accidents under the Air Navigation Regulations-no t the ones which were suddenly introduced at the beginning of this month, but the ones which had been in force for some years. He has acted also as an arbitrator under the Copyright Act, pursuant to the amendment made last year.",33,Cellulose Acetate Flake Bounty Bell No 2 1964

The judges of the High Court of Ausjudges of the High Court, who are now tralia have always eschewed such royal all members of the Privy Council, to sit commissions. The only case in which a in Australia to hear appeals which lie royal commission was accepted by a High from State Supreme Courts to the Privy Court judge was, I think, 40 years or more Council-that is, whether arrangements will missions except in the most extraordinary circumstances.

Should Australia participate in some sort of Pacific privy council? I doubt it. At all events, here again, more deliberate and specific consideration should be given to this question than was given in the Minister's second reading speech. Those are the two reasons given by the Minister for appointing another judge to the Commonwealth Industrial Court-to act as a royal commissioner and to act in colonial courts. He does not mention the reason that he gave in the debate on the Copyright Act in April of last year. Honourable members may wonder how this subject arose when we were debating the Copyright Act. I remind the House that during that debate I took the opportunity to forecast, and then to move, an amendment that appeals under the Copyright Act-thes e are matters of industrial property-shoul d lie to judges of the Commonwealth Industrial Court instead of being heard by judges of the High Court. The Attorney-General, before he had been elevated to the Ministry or admitted to the inner bar, supported the general idea that such judges should hear such appeals. He developed the theme further. He said that another judge should be appointed to the Commonwealth Industrial Court to give a prompt hearing to applications under section 109 of the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act. He has not given that reason on this occasion, but that is the reason why we now have this Bill, which provides for the appointment of another judge. The Attorney General naturally has not said who the judge is to be, although, as I understand the practice of the Menzies Government, it is to appoint members of the Sydney bar to the High Court and of the Melbourne bar to the Commonwealth Industrial Court. In either case, there is an ample reservoir of talent for both courts. If the Commonwealth Industrial Court were to confine itself to its traditional functions-that is, the matters it dealt with during its first years of operation and matters under the Air Navigation Regulations, the Navigation Act and the Territorial Supreme Courts-the Court would have enough members to carry on its work just as expeditiously and efficiently as it has hitherto. Another judge is only required because of the astonishing increase in the amount of work arising under sections 109 and 111 of the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act. It will be recalled that these sections were introduced under different numbers by the Treasurer ( Mr Harold Holt) when he was Minister for Labour and National Service in 1951. The Australian Labour Party voted against the insertion of the provisions. The sections were renumbered in the codification of the Act in 1956, again at the instigation of the Treasurer, as he now is. Again Labour voted against the perpetuation of the two sections. Section 109 is the injunction section. This is the section, under which the Commonwealth Industrial Court orders that registered organisations shall obey awards or shall not disobey awards. Section 111 is thc section under which the Court commits and fines for contempt such organisations as have disobeyed orders made under section 109 or under the corresponding section of trie Stevedoring Industry Act. For many years after these sections were introduced, no very great resort was made to them. Employers had not developed the reflex action which they have shown in the last few years by making an application under section 109 whenever there is a dispute and then, if they do not achieve their ends, acting under section 111. These sections have become a very great source of industrial irritation. honourable member does not intend to engage in a debate on the arbitration system, the question of penalties and so on. The scope of the BiU before the Chair is very limited, as he has already reminded me. very true, but I want to establish, and I am certain I will establish to your satisfaction, that it is only because the activities with which I am now dealing have increased so greatly in number and severity in the last few years that there is any call to increase the numbers of the judges, as this Bill does. If the activities that 1 am now describing had not developed to the extent that they have, there would be no",34,Conciliation And Arbitration Member For Parramatta Mr Bowen Asked
72,Mr Speaker,Order! I hope the,36,Conciliation And Arbitration Member For Parramatta Mr Bowen Asked
73,Mr Whitlam,"Mr Speaker, that isneed to increase the numbers of the puisne judges of the Court. My party certainly supports the principles of conciliation and arbitration. There is no portion of the Commonwealth's Constitution, except perhaps its financial powers, that has flowered as luxuriantly as the arbitration power. The arbitration power has now become a system of discipline for persons employed in industry, and in the last few years the disciplinary powers inserted in the principal Act in 1951 and re-enacted in 1956 have come to full flower. It is for this reason that the numbers of the judges of the Court are now to be increased. The mischief arises from the too ready resort to these powers by employers. It is vitiating the whole spirit of industrial relations. Employers always hold the whip hand over any union or organisation of employees; if there is any interruption in employment, any strike or any working to award, the employers will apply to the Court under section 109. There is never any period of negotiation. This applies not only to such overseas companies as General MotorsHolden's Pty. Ltd. but also to the indigenous employers. No opportunity is given for the use of the conciliation processes under the Act. Little enough time is given for the arbitration processes. There is an immediate resorta reflex action by the employers-to these penal provisions, section 109 and the consequential section 111. I will illustrate the extent to ber 1963 there were 13 applications by organisawhich this function of the court has been called in aid by referring to an article in the journal of the Industrial Relations Society of October 1963 and also to answers given to questions put on notice in another place by my learned colleague, Senator Cohen, and in this place by my colleague the honourable member for Grayndler ( Mr date on which Senator Cohen put his quesDaly). I point out that there are a number of Government members who deplore this too ready resort to the penal provisions. If one can rely on newspaper accounts or on glances exchanged between members of the Ministry there is a deal of embarrassment amongMinisters on this subject. The Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr During the period 1st July 1963 to 31st DecemMcMahon) not too promptly, but inevitably as it turned out, had to remove some penal provisions from the Stevedoring Industry Act. He has been trying to moderate the use by the employer organisations of penal provisions in this Act, but the provisions remain. I shall now quote figures which will establish the amazing increase that there has been in the resort to these sections. In the journal of the Industrial Relations Society an article by Professor J. E. Isaacs, then Professor of Economics at the University of Melbourne and now at Monash University, statedSince 1961, the Commonwealth penal provisions have been administered more frequently, more heavily and more widely than in any previous period. In the 12 years ending 1961, there were 203 applications for orders under section 109 and its precursor section 29. Of these, 109 orders were made absolute. These represent an annual average of 17 and 9 respectively and may be compared with 67 and SO for 1962, in which year a larger variety of unions than usual, numbering 20, were involved as respondents in these proceedings. And the annual average for the first half of 1963 is nearly twice the correspondingfiguresfor 1962. In the same 12 years, SOfineswere imposed under sections 29A and 111 amounting to £13,800. In 1962, there were 28 fines amounting to £9,150. More than half of this amount was incurred by the Waterside Workers' Federation, the rest being borne by eight other unions. And in the first half of 1963, 23finesamounting to £9,200 were imposed. I follow up from that by reading from an answer which the Minister for Labour and National Service provided tp Senator Cohen on l l t h August 1964, as followsDuring the period 1st July 1963 to 31st Decemtions of employers for orders under section 109 of the Act and none by organisations of employees. Of the 13 applications made during this period, 6 were granted, 6 were refused and 1 was adjourned. During the period 1st January 1964 to 15th May 1964I point out that 15th May 1964 was the tion on the notice paper, and the reply was received three months laterthere were 25 such applications by organisations of employers and none by organisations of employees. Of these 25 applications, 12 were granted, 3 were refused and 10 were adjourned. ber 1963 20 penalties for contempt of the Industrial Court, amounting to £3,800, were imposed under section 111 of the Act on organisations of employees; and during the period 1st January 1964 to 15th May 1964 31 penalties amounting to £8,700 were imposed on organisations of employees. On9 occasions during the period 1st July 1963 to 31st December 1963 the Court refrained, by consent of the informants, from imposing penalties under section 111, while 52 cases were adjourned indefinitely. In section 111 proceedings during the give the number of workers involved in the period 1st January 1964 to 15th May 1964 there were no occasions on which the Court refrained from imposing penalties or adjourned the proceedings. I follow up by quoting from an answer given on 29th September to the honourable member for Grayndler ( Mr Daly) who had asked what fines had been imposed on trade unions under the Act in each of the last 10 years. The figures indicate a remarkable acceleration in the last two years. In 1954 there were 10fines;in 1955, 3; 1956, none; 1957, 5; 1958, 16; 1959, 1; 1960, 9; 1961, 4; 1962, 28; 1963, 37; and in 1964, until 27th August, when the honourable member put his question on the notice paper, 61. I will not go through all the details of the amounts of thefines,but after the beginning of 1962 all fines were for amounts of three figures. Before that, particularly in New South Wales, more often than not they had been for amounts of £50 ancl once for £5. As a matter of fact, in the last two years most fines have been £500, the maximum. This illustrates the increasing number of times that unions have been brought before the Commonwealth Industrial Court under section 109, and the corresponding section of the Stevedoring Industry Act, and section 111. The figures also illustrate the increasing severity of the fines which have been imposed. One might assume that the greater resort to the penal provisions of the Act has been brought about by some increase in the number of industrial disputes, or in the number of workers involved in disputes, or the number of working days lost in disputes in the last 10 years. This is not the position. I shall commence by giving the figure for 1954 of the number of industrial disputes in Australia and then read the figures for subsequent years-1,490 , 1.532, 1,306, 1,103, 987, 869, 1,145, 815, 1,183, 1,250, and in the last financial year 1,338. pute "" defined? industrial disputes bulletin I am quoting does not define "" industrial disputes "" other than as stoppage of work for 10 man days or more. It might be thought that there has been a slight increase in the number of disputes in the las.t three years. I will not 10 years, but for the same 10 years I will now read the average number of working days lost per worker involved. The averages were 2.44, 2.27, 2.62, 1.87, 1.56, 1.54, 1.20, 2.02, 1.44 and 1.41. In the first two quarters of this year, the averages were 1.18 and 1.25. So there has been no relation between resort to stoppages of work by employees and resort to the penal sections of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act by employers. The average number of working days lost per worker has in fact fallen and is now very much less than it was ten years ago. Over the last two years, it has shown no increase. But it is during those years that resort to the penal sections of the Act has increased. If these penal provisions are to be used as often as they have been in the last two years, not only will the Government be embarrassed, as it has been, by the truculence, intransigence and inflammatory attitudes of its industrial supporters, but also hardship to all in this country will result. In other words, the whole spirit of industrial relations will worsen. Both sections 109 and 111 sbould now be repealed. If the Government is determined to preserve the sections, it sbould make them conditional on prior consultation and conciliation. Thus, following amendments this month, employers cannot commence proceedings under the penal provisions of the New South Wales Arbitration Act without leave given by a member of the Industrial Commission of New South Wales. Leave will not be granted unless the judge before whom an application for leave is made is satisfied that the employer had not himself taken part in any lockout which had wholly or in part given rise to the strike, had given notice to the Industrial Registrar of the matters giving the strike, and, to the extent to which the",36,Conciliation And Arbitration Member For Parramatta Mr Bowen Asked

75,Mr Whitlam,"The statistician whosecircumstances permitted, had made a bona fide attempt to negotiate a settlement. The recent amendments to the New South Wales Act ensure that employers, before they resort to the penal sections of the industrial arbitration legislation, shall make a genuine attempt to negotiate, to conciliate and to arbitrate. Similar provisions should now be made in the Commonwealth Act. if the Government is not prepared to repeal the sections outright. As the Ministry itself realises, the sections inserted in the Commonwealth statute in 1951, and re-enacted in 1956, are now being abused by employers. There is no industrial justification for employers resorting to the penal sections as often as they have done. If the Ministry's wishes in this respect were heeded by its industrial backers and fewer applications were made under section 109, the present membership of the Commonwealth Industrial Court would be quite adequate to deal with all thc business coming before the judges as members of that Court, as members of the territorial Supreme Courts, and in marine and air accident inquiries. The Court would be well able to cope with all its business, as it was able to do until two years ago. It would be able to deal with its business more promptly than most courts deal with their business, as it was able to do until two years ago. The processes of the Court are being abused by employers. The remedy is available to the Government. If repeal or amendment would involve too great a capitulation and too much loss of face, the Ministry should at least try to restrain its backers. It does not need to ask the Parliament to increase the number of judges of the Court so that employers can abuse the processes of the Act and so disrupt the country's economy. The Opposition will oppose the increase in the number of members of the Commonwealth Industrial Court proposed on this occasion. Question putThat the Bill be now read a second time.

At a later stage I shall table the relevant reports. The Tariff Board has recommended the removal of protective duties from a range of elastomeric fabrics in accordance with its finding that local production does not require assistance. Pree entry is proposed under the British preferential tariff and the most favoured nation rate is being fixed at the lowest level consistent with international commitments. It is proposed to THE SCHEDULE. Tariff Rates on Tariff Item. Goods the Produce or Manufacture of New Zealand.

However, no alteration in the rates for salmon is proposed at this stage pending the outcome of international consultations. All other fish in air-tight containers will carry minimum rates of duty. On electrical generators, motors and rotary converters, protective rates of duty at common levels of 27i per cent. British preferential tariff and 40 per cent, most favoured nation are proposed. These duties will only apply to electrical machinery below certain power ratings. Non-protective rates of free British preferential tariff and 71 per cent, otherwise are proposed for generators, motors and rotary converters above those ratings. The duties on certain generators and starting motors for motor vehicles remain unchanged. In the main the proposed duties amount to a moderate increase in the level of protection and an extension of the protected range. The alterations proposed by Customs Tariff (New Zealand Preference) Proposals No. 7 are complementary to those proposed by Customs Tariff Proposals No. 23 in respect of fish in air-tight containers.

Whilst some honourable members opposite may not support our views on the changes which we believe have developed in the international situation, it is clear that the prime distinction between peace and war is no longer relevant. There are some people who will say that South Vietnam is at war with other countries and that Malaysia is at war with Indonesia, if we apply the definitions of some previous time. Under the existing defence legislation it would not be possible to employ Australian forces, such as the Citizen Military Forces and the ReservesI do not refer to the Australian Regular Army-in the kind of situation that could develop to the north of Australia and with which Australia may be faced unless we in fact entered a period of war in which the clean-cut definitions of earlier times were appropriate. So it has been necessary to change the law in relato remain inside Australia under conditions which would make it necessary for them to be used in support of allies in areas outside we believe. I think the measures have been adequately and clearly explained by the respective Ministers. The permanent forces are, legislation the Minister for the Army has made it clear that new Emergency Reserves for each of the three services will be estabdramatically at one stroke.

80,Mr Malcolm Fraser (Wannon) Service While The Condition Of Defence,"Of course, if this had to be done, a report containing reasons for the call up would have to be made to the Parliament. So here we have a clear progression starting with the Regular Army and ending with the call up of the Regular Reserve and the Citizen Military Forces under a condition of defence emergency. If the situation deteriorated still further there are provisions which should be adeand Australia entered into a period of war in its fullest sense, then, clearly, this would employment of those members of the lead to full mobilisation. It is important to understand that the Regular Army Emergency Reserve, which will be entirely voluntary, will also be available even if there is no state of defence emergency, but, under those conditions, its members will not be available for continuous service for periods greater than 12 months at any one time. The provisions contained in these measures will make it possible for the Emergency Reserve to provide a useful, if small, addition to the forces immediately available to us. It is important to examine these changes that are being introduced in relation to the possible threats which could confront Australia. I think most people in this House will agree that it is unlikely that a general or global war will develop in South East Asia. I think they will agree, too, that it is not at all impossible that Australia could have commitments, in conjunction with our allies, on more than one front, which would involve many thousands of troops and that such a situation could arise when, in fact, we were not in a condition of general war in the old sense as defined in the Defence Act. If such a situation did arise and the Bills under consideration were not passed by Ihis House, a large part of the Australian forces could not, in fact, be used to help meet our commitments. The legislation now before us will make considerably larger forces available to the Government of the day to assist Australia in meeting whatever commitments might face her in South East Asia, or in the situation between Malaysia and Indonesia. The House and the country sbould welcome the fact that the Government has introduced these changes. It goes without saying, of course, that everyone who volunteers for service in the Regular Army, in the Emergency Reserve and in the C.M.F. will be liable for service not only in Australia but anywhere overseas. This is an essential part of the Government's plan for defence forces which can much more properly and much more adequately meet the threats that could well confront Australia. I am glad to see that in this legislation quate for preserving the positions in civil C.M.F. and the Emergency Reserve who may be called up for short or long periods, depending upon the position that may arise. Not only their positions but their right to re-engagement and their seniority are preserved. This is a most important clement of the legislation and is necessary if the Government is to expect adequate numbers to volunteer for service in the C.M.F. and the Emergency Reserve. This legislation should be looked at in its proper perspective. It is part of a graduated response that began in May 1963 with a defence statement by the Prime Minister( Sir Robert Menzies) in which he announced that there would be considerable additions to tbe Australian armed forces. Since that time other additions have been made, and this legislation, as the Minister has pointed out, is only giving effect to decisions that were announced last June with relation to the creation of the Emergency Reserve and a change in the conditions of service for members of the C.M.F. It should not be thought by anyone that this is the final step in what the Government is doing with relation to defence. It has been made quite plain that a general review is being made of defence at the present time, and it is hoped that a statement will be placed before the House before it finally rises later this year, so that what the Government proposes may be debated in the Parliament if necessary. The legislation before us will lead to a more useful addition to Australia's forces, and in particular, to the Army. Prior to the introduction of the legislation, we had a permanent Army with a total strength of 23,000 or 24,000 men to meet any defence situation which Australia is likely to meet As a result of this legislation, the Emergency Reserve and the C.M.F. can also be used. I say again that it is much more likely that we will face a condition of limited war, not general war as defined in the Defence Act, or with a need to prevent subversion OT to counteract the effects of subversion in South East Asia, perhaps in relation to the dispute between Malaysia and Indonesia. The provisions of this legislation will make it possible for the Government and the Australian forces to meet any commitments that might confront them. I emphasise that this legislation should not be taken by anyone as the Government's final step in the current build up of Australia's armed forces which the strategic situation to the north has made necessary. If honourable members opposite propose to take the attitude which was adopted by their colleagues in another place, it would appear likely that they will support this legislation. I will certainly welcome that support and their recognition of the fact that if service in the Australian forces is to provide some addition to Australia's defence then it must involve service overseas in the real sense. Even though it appears that, generally, the Opposition would support this legislation, I can well imagine that one or two honourable members opposite would oppose it. Indeed, I would have thought that at least the honourable member for Yarra (Dr. J. F. Cairns) would argue that these provisions are quite unnecessary. Neither he nor those who think like him on the Opposition side, recognise the sort of defence situation with which Australia could be faced. They do not recognise the external threats to countries like South Vietnam. Indeed, if the honourable member for Yarra is to be believed, then, to use his own words, he would draw a line between Kamchatka and Darwin as being the line of containment against the eastward spread of Communism from Asia. This is an odd line to draw because behind it there is really nothing in the Pacific to contain. The honourable member's geography is probably good enough for him to realise that this line gives away not only Formosa, but all of South East Asia, including Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines, because it clearly would come down well to the east of all the Philippines. lf the honourable member is to argue that this should be our line of defence, we might well ask him which side of Australia he would be concerned to defend if the line is continued south of Darwin. Believing that everything to the east of this line from Kamchatka to Darwin should not be defended, which would seem to be the clear implication from what he said, then he must clearly deny the need for Australia to have any forces available for service in South East Asia, whether it be in South Vietnam, Malaysia or anywhere else where service may be required. At the same time the honourable member does not appear to recognise the nature of the threat that confronts various areas of South East Asia and which makes it necessary for the Government not only to build up our forces in the general sense but also to introduce the kind of legislation that the House is now considering. I would just like to refer to some remarks the honourable member made a few days ago. On 21st October he saidI have examined the evidence of this over a period of yearsHe was speaking of developments in the South East Asian areaand as far as I have been able to discover there is no evidence whatever of any material assistance coming from outside Vietnam-fro m any country outside that area. The honourable member was repeating a conclusion that he had arrived at some considerable time earlier. In an earlier debate he had brought forward evidence which he claimed was conclusive but which will certainly not bear any detailed or close examination. This is important, because it is necessary to recognise and understand the threat that confronts Australia and her friends and allies in this area before one can appreciate the kind of effort that many people wish to have put into Australia's defence forces. If we do not understand the nature of the threat, what we do in relation to our Navy, Army and Air Force will certainly be misconceived. The honourable member for Yarra, in giving to the House evidence which he claimed was conclusive, quoted some remarks made by various other persons, of which I will give one or two examples. He said on 13th August 1964The former head of the United States military forces in South Vietnam, General Paul D. Harkins, said at a Press conference in SaigonThe guerrillas obviously are not being reinforced or supplied systematically from North Vietnam. . . The important word there is "" systematically"", because that expression clearly months implies that a certain amount of equipment lies with North Vietnam. It is estimated that 300 or a certain number of people are coming to SOO cadres a month are being infiltrated into down at regular intervals, and no-one South Vietnam from North Vietnam. would contend that this was necessarily so. But it is significant, I think, that these Vietnam are being continuously supplied by remarks were made by General Harkins in North Vietnam with automatic weapons, 50March 1963, and he has since been caliber machine guns with sights that make them relieved of his command in South Vietnam ammunition. effective against helicopters, light artillery and or moved to some other post. A good deal war from the beginning, but now it is clear that of evidence has been gathered since then day-to-day operations are being handled from of what is happening in this area. The honourable member for Yarra also quoted the United States Secretary of 1964 that he knew of no North Vietnamese military units in South Vietnam. Again it is important to look closely at the words used. units"". When I was in South Vietnam nobody tried to tell me that military units from North Vietnam were operating in this area as units of the North Vietnamese Army. But nobody would deny that there were many people from the North Vietnamese Army operating as hard core stiffening in the various units of the Vietcong in South Vietnam. So it becomes a question of defining the terms that are used in order to decide what a person is talking and arguing about. To quote the Secretary of Defence as saying there were no military units from North Vietnam or Communist China operating as units in South Vietnam was certainly not to say that there were not omcers, non-commissioned officers and instructors from North Vietnam in South Vietnam, training the Vietcong, supporting them and giving them necessary orders, and planning a tactical offensive against South Vietnam. Some later evidence has been very concisely presented on this matter in the ""Washington Post"". I think the Minister for the Navy( Mr Chaney) quoted these remarks in the House in another debate, but since the honourable member for Yarra has repeated his conclusions that no outside military support is being offered in South VietnamI think it is pertinent to repeat these comments. On 22nd June 1964 in the ""Washington Post"" an editorial appeared of which I will read two paragraphsIt has become increasingly clear in the last few that the war now going on in South Vietnam and Laos is one in which great advantage Moreover, it is clear that the Vietcong in South Hanoi has directed the strategy of the North Vietnamese headquarters in as intimate a contact with field units as a front-line command post in a conventional war. So the South Vietnamese, with our help, are fighting an enemy which has its command posts, its reserves, its reinforcements and its quartermaster corps in a sanctuary beyond the reach of the South Vietnamese military power. How the honourable member for Yarra can say in this House in conclusive terms that there is no evidence of any of this kind of activity I just cannot understand. All of us in this House know that the honourable member recognises only the evidence that suits his cause, but it would suit the cause of Australia a good deal better if he considered all the evidence available before making a judgment, instead of giving out conclusions that could only mislead the House and the people. I would just like to conclude on this note: Recognising the threat that could confront Australia and recognising the possibility of war in South East Asia between Malaysia and Indonesia on more than one front and involving not only our troops but also those of our allies in tens of thousands, it is absolutely vital that Australia's defence forces, manpower and equipment be improved and added to to the extent that the Government finds itself able to add to them. The provisions of the legislation before the House will enable us to make a useful addition to the Australian Regular Army and the forces that could back that Army if at some time in the future units of the Australian forces had to serve overseas, on the mainland of South East Asia or in some other area as a",44,Defence Bill 1964
81,"Defence, Mr Mcnamara, As Saying In July",,47,Defence Bill 1964
82,"Mr Mcnamara Used The Words ""Military","result of a conflict between Malaysia and Indonesia. This measure provides in realistic terms for us to take steps which will be quite appropriate to circumstances that we may have to face. It would have been quite useless to provide for Citizen Military Forces or an emergency reserve that could be used overseas only if a state of general war were declared. In these days, when there are so few blacks and whites, and all is grey on the international scene, it is essential for us to be able to use our forces to suit our objective of securing the survival of Australia. Opposition supports these measures. Ideally, defence matters should not be in controversy. Although thc Opposition will suggest certain amendments, they are not really fundamental. I would like to comment on the speech of the honourable member for Wannon( Mr Malcolm Fraser) but I feel that any such comment would be irrelevant at this stage. It would be more relevant to the debate on defence review that the Cabinet is apparently going to make during the recess. The honourable member's speech related to applications of military strength and the like in South East Asia, which is foreign policy. What we have before us is very largely machinery legislation. We do not feel that this is the occasion on which to open a general debate on foreign policy in South East Asia. As to the legislation before us, the degrees of emergency short of war which it envisages seem to us to be realistic. They are a response to the new policies of "" confrontation short of war"" which we may have to encounter. Therefore there are powers vested in the Governor General to proclaim emergency states which would give the Government the power to counter confrontations. These things, we feel, should be supported. We are not sure that the legislation enables any government to counter a situation similar to the otber problem that has developed in South East Asia. We have on the one hand the problem of Indonesia's confrontation of Malaysia. Remember there is the problem of thc transformation of bad political, social and economical conditions into a situation of complete disorder, and war waged by creating a situation of complete chaos and disorder. We are not certain that this legislation has any answer to that. I am not certain that I could envisage any amendments to the Defence Act which would have any particular bearing on that problem. The answer is in the field of foreign policy. I would like to put one or two critical queries in respect of some of the statements which have been made in this House, in view of the new power to send overseas those members of the Citizen Military Forces who wish to serve overseas. The statement has been made in this House constantly, as if it were an unanswerable proposition, that it is better to fight in other people's countries than to fight in your own. I suppose this statement is unimpeachable if the alternatives are strictly that if you do not fight in another country you will be fighting in your own. But if the statement means that the intelligent policy all the time is to be intervening overseas, then it is often a false proposition. Take for example the position of the garrisons at Quemoy and Matsu. The forces which have formed the garrisons at Quemoy and Matsu in the face of Communist Chinese aggression have resisted effectively because the Communist Chinese cannot bring to bear against Quemoy and Matsu anything other than small forces. How unintelligent it would be for the garrisons at Quemoy and Matsu to leave the island on the ground that they should fight on other than their own territory or the Chinese mainland! They would be destroyed. So, it would be senseless to apply the slogan to Quemoy and Matsu. There are many situations in which it would be utterly unintelligent on the part of Australia to attempt to match our manpower against the limitless manpower of Asia on the Asian mainland. We would sink our manpower into the bottomless pit. France came close to doing this in Indo China. We should not imagine that any slogan provides a complete solution to all the defence problems with which we might be confronted. The other point I wish to make is in connection with the idea of the deployment of masses of manpower. Australia is a country with a highly skilled manpower compared with some of our neighbours in South East Asia. Undoubtedly, in regulating the introduction of conscription, the Government has come to the conclusion",47,Defence Bill 1964
83,Mr Beazley (Fremantle) [3.24],"Th ethat the best defence is not secured by mass manpower but by highly trained and highly equipped forces which from technology derive enormous fire power but whose numbers, in relation to the mass of manpower mobilised in the past, are relatively small. What is imposed upon the Government by this policy is to see that the Australian forces are technologically equipped in the most efficient manner. I come now to the amendments which we will be putting forward in the Committee stage. First of all, the Opposition hopes that a clause wUl be added which will provide for the benefits of the Repatriation Act to be extended to members of tbe Citizen Military Forces incurring disabilities during service in Australia. The C.M.F. has now become a force which is committed to overseas service. Troops may be injured in Australia. At present they will receive their compensation under the Commonwealth employees compensation legislation. They should gain their compensation as servicemen under the Repatriation Act. Clause 41 should be postponed and redrafted to provide for re-enlistment and re-attestation on fhe basis of the new commitment to overseas service. To put it simply, as the legislation stands the C.M.F. man is under obligation for overseas service unless he contracts out. We feel that the C.M.F. man should be under obligation for overseas service if he deliberately contracts in. We feel that the Government would be wiser, as it is calling on C.M.F. men for a clear new commitment, to provide that they make that commitment definitely and consciously. In the long run, this will prove more satisfactory from the point of view of the Government, the country and the men enlisted in the C.M.F. themselves. The rest of the provisions of the Bill concerning reserves and the arrangement about reserves for the armed forces seem to the Opposition not to be controversial. As I have said, we desire that, on defence matters, there should be the greatest unity possible between the Government and the Opposition. After all, the remarkable fact is that over the 15 years' relationship between the Government and the Opposition no defence estimate has been opposed by the Opposition. Some people evidently feel that by misrepresenting the position of the Opposition on defence they can gain a very great deal of political benefit to themselves. But I should think that most countries of the world, looking at our situation, would have been glad to have enjoyed the degree of unity that has existed in this country on the subject of defence. We desire to maintain that unity unless we feel there is some real and vital issue of principle involved. In the main, these amendments are realistic adjustments to the new world in which we live. The Opposition will have suggestions to make in the Committee stages; otherwise, we support the legislation. Speaker, before I comment on the various provisions in the Bill, I would like to say a few words about a couple of the thoughts that the honourable member for Fremantle ( Mr Beazley) put forward. He saidI thought rather theoretically-that the statement had been made time and time again in this House that it was better to fight in other people's countries than to fight in your own. It is not quite right to say that this has been said time and time again. This proposition has been advanced as an argument in support of Australia having troops in countries such as Malaysia and South Vietnam. But I am sure the answer that is always given as the reason for this country having troops overseas is not that it is better to fight in someone else's country than it is to fight in your own. That argument by the honourable member is, I think, largely theoretical. The honourable member also mentioned that the Opposition would be putting forward an amendment for the benefits of the Repatriation Act to be extended to members of the Citizen. Military Forces. I think the weakness in this argument to provide a blanket cover for every member of the C.M.F. is that members of the C.M.F. could be serving in areas which are not operational areas. They could be going to areas for non-operational purposes. This matter has been covered in the past in struggles in which Australia has been engaged by the prescribing of areas or sectors as operational. To my knowledge, noone who has served in an operational area, whether he be a member of the C.M.F. or any other force, has been excluded from the benefits of the Repatriation Act.",48,Defence Bill 1964
84,Mr Holten Andi) [3.32],"MrFor instance, in thc last war those people who served in Darwin between certain dates became eligible to share in the benefits of the Repatriation Act. Also, anyone in the Citizen Military Forces who went into any operational area at all was granted entitlement under the Repatriation Act. So, -I do not really see that this is a vitally important amendment as far as this legislation is concerned. In these three Bills we see provisions which are designed to step up Australia's preparedness for war. Their introduction has been made necessary by the increase in the instability of the South East Asian area. They provide further evidence of the Government's willingness to introduce new inducements or new measures to build up our armed strength, as warranted by the circumstances of fhe time. They underline a continuance of a policy of voluntary enlistment and recruitment. This principle of voluntary enlistment, as opposed to compulsory enlistment, is appreciated, understood and supported by the Australian people. These Bills represent progressive steps to in Australia's defence effort than the present encourage people to undertake service trainRegular Army Reserve. ing and to strengthen our preparedness for an emergency.

If he so decides, these men will be liable for 12 months service only, and after giving that service they will not be liable for further call up until a period of 12 months has elapsed. In the event of war, the members of the Reserve will be liable for full time service. But I stress that they are to be enlisted only if they volunteer. They will be paid the normal rates of pay which are paid to Regular Army personnel, plus a bounty rising from £100 in their first year to £175 in their fourth year. The establishment of the Regular Army Emergency Reserve probably will make a big difference to the numbers at present in the Regular Army Reserve. As the Minister for the Army (Dr. Forbes) pointed out, the latter Reserve should be depleted considerably. But I agree that the Regular Army Emergency Reserve will be a much more positive force and will be more useful We all should appreciate that the people stitute an emergency and require them to be called up. Under this legislation, the But I am sure that everyone will agree out of touch with the latest developments international position should be taken and the people who continued to work in into account, but we should also take into the firm might have an advantage over account our treaty obligations and the him. So this decision that the people whom availability of men, materials and resources. we expect to join the Emergency Reserves will have to make will be very important to them. I know that the Government and the people of Australia will be very gratified if there is a strong response to the call for members of the Emergency Reserves. The new conditions that will apply to when most of us were of an eligible age, members of the Citizen Military Forces as 1 shall call it, in 1939, 1940 and 1941. represent a dramatic change. I am sure In those days all we had to do was join that the new conditions will give such up and serve a few months doing elemenmembers an increasing awareness of the tary training and we were then almost gravity with which the Government views ready for combat.

The plain fact is that he would not know. his remarks from "" Hansard"". He said it would take three months to get the tanks to the Northern Territory. It is very interesting to hear comments on Australia's defence made by honourable members opposite. The honourable member for Yarra (Dr. J. F. Cairns) has been interjecting quite strongly. It was interesting to hear his condo not claim that these suggestions are my tribution to the debate. All that he did was to theorise on the nuclear weapon set-up and to say how dangerous it would be if somebody exploded a nuclear bomb. We all know that, but we also know that it is essential to have a nuclear deterrent because of the present world situation, and that if we do not have a nuclear deterrent the imbalance of world population will surely mean disaster for countries like Australia. I see these Bills as part of the Government's efforts over the past two or three years to build up our defence forces gradually in the light of the resources availservice, if either should ever be needed. able to it. In 1961-62, the allocation for defence was £200 million; in 1962-63, it was £214 million; in 1963-64, it was £260 million; and for this year it is £293 million. like to add one thought of my own. I think The honourable member for Capricornia, when speaking on the Estimates last week, said that the Government would spend about £230 million on defence this year. In fact, the Government will spend £293 million. He was only £63 miUion out. The honourable member is supposed to be a responsible member of the Parliament; yet he makes these misleading statements. In the past few years, we have seen the action taken by tbe Government to build up our defences. In January 1963, the Prime Minister( Sir Robert Menzies) announced that a submarine arm of the Royal AustraUan Navy would be established. In May 1963, the manpower targets were increased and vast quantities of new and modern equipment were ordered. In October 1963, two squadrons of the FlllA-the TFX aircraft-were ordered and delivery will commence about 1968. In June of this year, ""ervice pay and allowances were substantially increased and provision was made for housing for the armed forces. We have heard the suggestion that more money should be spent on defence; but more money is not the complete solution to our defence problems. If we buy more aircraft or ships, we must still find the people to fly them, to service them, to man them and generally to understand the vast complexities of the electronic equipment installed in them. A realistic appraisement of the situation shows that we must of necessity move slowly in building up our armed forces. I want to adopt some of the suggestions made last week by the honourable member for Calare( Mr England). I original ideas; the honourable member for Calare made them. In the defence review that is now being undertaken and on which final decisions will be made next week, I hope that the Government wiU consider the suggestions of the honourable member for Calare. They are that we immediately compile a national manpower register, that we give more active encouragement to the cr.det corps at the various schools, that we make every effort to increase the strength and efficiency of the Citizen Military Forces and that the Government prepares plans for compulsory enlistment or national The Bills now before the House are designed to move towards these ends, but probably additional action could be taken. I would a register of industry throughout Australia could be tremendously important. I am not fully aware of the position, but I have it in my mind that the State Governments have a register of industry. I am not certain of this and I think it would be wise for the Government to check with the appropriate State Ministers to make sure that a register of all industry, large and small, throughout AustraUa is kept up to date and is readily available to the Federal Minister for Labour and National Service and the Government should the need for it arise. I want to stress again that it is not money alone that counts in defence. An important factor is the fire power that we have in the hands of personnel in the Services. The Government has been turning its attention more and more to this factor and I am sure that it will continue to do so. I would like to mention one other",52,Defence Bill 1964
92,Mr Benson,He did not say that.,53,Defence Bill 1964
93,Mr Holten,"O h yes he did. I copiedfactor. We should encourage the public generally to have a good deal more respect for and appreciation of the members of our armed forces than we tend to have at the moment. I think it is fair to say that the members of the armed forces during peace time are not shown the respect and appreciation to which they are entitled. It is only in time of war that we really show our appreciation of our forces. All of us are too inclined in peace time to disregard the importance of members of the armed forces. I urge the Australian people to show the members of the armed forces the respect that thcy deserve. 1 suplost the confidence not only of its inport the Bills very strongly and commend the Government for the action it has taken, especially in the past three years, in the defence of Australia.

The honourable member for Indi( Mr Holten) has appealed for more respect to be shown for the members of the armed forces. For reasons that I will Minister( Sir Robert Menzies) chose to mention in a moment, there is need for this have an election almost 18 months earlier appeal. However, I believe that any decline than was necessary simply, the Prime in respect for the armed forces in recent Minister said, to get the mandate of the years is not a result of anything done or Australian people to go to the defence not done by the armed forces. I think the responsibility for the decline can be laid of Malaysia. He got the mandate of the firmly at the door of this Government. We Australian people, presumably, but what have not had a clear defence policy for has he done about it? The Government the 15 years that the Government has been has designed a force to go to Malaysia. in office. The people have not known what It has been deliberately designed so as the Government is doing with the defence not to become engaged in any hostilities forces and if today they are not taking with Indonesia. So it will make an unthe defence of Australia seriously, the equivocal and almost unnoticed contriburesponsibility lies firmly on this Governtion to the situation in Malaysia. All the ment. The solution of the problem wili not Government wants is for its contribution be found until the people are convinced to be noticed in Australia. It wants to play that we have a consistent defence policy up the feeling of suspicion and uneasiness and that the purchase of defence equipin the Australian people because it bement and arms is foUowing a consistent lieves that that pays off politically. On the and logical pattern. I do not think it is an other hand it has been completely inconexaggeration to say that the pattern has sistent in what it has done in the north. been a shambles. I believe that this is the Defence has been a sham under this main reason for the loss of respect for our Government, and the honourable member defence effort. For 15 years, the Opposition has never people in the defence of this country it opposed any defence estimates in the is because of this sham policy of the Parliament. We have given the Government its head on defence matters. We have been critical, and we have had no thanks for that. Hardly any notice has been taken of our suggestions. No amendments that we have moved have ever been accepted. But we have said to the Government: "" You are the Government and we wiU not prevent you from getting the finance you seek. You have the money; do the best you can with it . "" No-one can be satisfied with what the Government has done with it. It has had its head, it has had its way, but it has formed and responsible critics, like some of those on its own benches, but it has lost the confidence and respect of the people too. It is not genuine in respect of defence. What it has been mainly concerned The Government led by the Prime for Indi can find his answer there. If there is any loss of confidence by the Australian Government, which has been mainly defence for election purposes and for no other purpose. While the Australian Labour Party will support defence, as it has done for 15 years, never denying the House or the Committee one penny for which it has asked for expenditure on defence, at the same time the Australian Labour Party is proud to say that it stands for peace, and we emphasize peace in all these situations. We stand for friendship. We recognise that today we are living in a new world, a world where new ideas, new developments and new inspirations are of greater importance in holding the fronts than are weapons on those fronts. Unless we look at the world in which we are situated with a new mind and new ideas we will continue to fail as we have failed so often in these circumstances. ber think that we want war? opposite act like it so far as their policy is concerned. They talk with strong words. They are great fighters with the weapon of words, but poor fighters with any other instruments. Their anti-Communism is a matter of emotion, a matter of words, but they fail when they are tested in a situation. However, let us leave that aside for a moment. The world in which we live today is a world in which only new minds with new ideas of the future are capable of holding their own. The coloured world we face today is a world that so far has a better record in respect of aggressiona world that shows itself more capable of co-operation-that the old white-dominated world that is passing. I do not think it is necessary to answer there were 27,505 members of the C.M.F. much the other point made by the honat that date. In other words, 7,495 additional orable member for Indi, that what the personnel must be found by 30th June next critics are saying is that we must have if the target is to be reached. Is the fact more money for this and more money that members of the C.M.F. are going to for that. It seems to me that in about be available for overseas service going to 3 per cent, of the gross national proattract a significantly greater number of duct in present circumstances there is persons into the Citizen Military Forces? ample money for the defence of this Some people feel that it might have less country. I think the important thing is effect and that it might discourage people that the money be used better, and when from enlisting, because many people in the it has been used better for a year or C.M.F., whilst they want to train themselves two we can decide whether we need any and be available for service if necessary more. I do not go along with the cry want to do it consistent with remaining F.12500/64 -R -[92 ] that we have to spend more and more on defence, because I think that is the kind of thing which in the past has been taken as a substitute for defence. Our main responsibility is to make sure for a year or two that we are spending much better that which is now available, and when we have done that, see whether we need any more. I believe that in the measures lhat have been put before thc House the Government is no more genuine than it has been for 14 or 15 years. Let us have a look at some of the measures. The honourable member for Wannon( Mr Malcolm Fraser) said that the essence of this legislation was that it was directed to the availability of forces-to making more forces available. We know that one of its purposes is to create an emergency reserve. The member for Wannon recognised the limitations of this. He said it might be useful, but it would be small. Of course it is going to be small, and I agree it might be useful, but if the contribution that this legislation is going to make to the availability of forces is to be restricted to an emergency reserve, no member on the other side is going to say it will be more than very marginal and more than very insignificant. Let us have a look at what it might do to the Citizen Military Forces. It is going to make a change so that those who enlist, those who volunteer for service, in the Citizen Military Forces will be automatically committed to service overseas. How is this going to affect the total recruitment? We are sometimes told that the Citizen Military Forces have already completely volunteered for overseas service, but what has been happening to the C.M.F. target of 35,000 men set for 30th June next? The report dated 30th June shows that",53,Defence Bill 1964

This Government will not do what so many honourable members opposite think is necessary because it is afraid of upsetting too many employers. So what does the Government do? It takes this mealy mouthed, half way sort of course and prepares legislation of this kind, though those who form the Government know very well in their own hearts that these measures will not meet the situation. As in so many other matters, the Government lacks real genuineness in its attitude to defence. Let me now turn to some of the stateweapons. The only way for Australia to ments made a little while ago by the acquire nuclear weapons would be to obtain honourable member for Wannon.

As I have said, nuclear weapons dition under which we live today. War hardly concern us at all. They are a matter would be a condition in which nuclear for the great powers almost alone. But bombs would be likely to be used. In these Australia has a responsibility to do all she circumstances, war would be a condition can to support every action taken anywhere which most responsible men and women in to stop tests of nuclear weapons, to prevent the world today would regard as so revoluthe stockpiling of them in increasing tionary and different as to make it imposquantities and, finally, if possible, to reduce sible for mankind to accept.

The Australian Gooutstanding characteristics of nuclear vernment has a responsibility, in formulatweapons today are, first, their power of ing its defence policy, to support to the destruction and, second, the fact that only full the appeal made last week by U Thant, a very large nation can muster the the Secretary-General of the United Nations, resources necessary to produce them and who called on the powers with nuclear place them effectively on their targets. This weapons to meet at the earliest possible enormous power of nuclear weapons and opportunity and reach agreement about the enormous resources required for their bringing to an end all nuclear tests and the use distinguish the condition of war today production of further nuclear weapons. But from the condition of peace as never before has our Government shown any awareness throughout history. SoI think the honorof U Thant's appeal?

Will the cal distinction between peace ancl war Australian Government support that appeal because the distinction is no longer at the United Nations or elsewhere? I relevant. We know that in earlier generations there was debate about the question of whether the ultimate weapon had been produced, even when gunpowder was developed and certainly when aircraft and chemical bombs came into use. But, ever since about 1957, there has been no real disagreement among the responsible people of the world about the fact that nuclear weapons represent a revolutionary change. So the destructive power of nuclear weapons and the large resources needed for their use are factors of first and basic importance in determining any defence policy. These factors mean that Australia, like Britain and France, can never independently have nuclear I believe that a number of propositions tralian people and which would overcome doubt whether it will. Quite apart from this, the Government leaves aside the question that has been put to the nation in the last couple of days by Professor Titterton. I do not imply any particular fault in him as distinct from many others. His business is the production of nuclear weapons. That is the big field of power that would develop him to a big man in this nation, and that fact has something to do with his belief that Australia should have nuclear weapons. He is the Teller of Australia. The first thing that Ausline beginning somewhere north of Dartralia should do in respect of nuclear weapons is not to think about getting them, it is to make sure that we seek agreement with Indonesia that neither country will ever obtain nuclear weapons from some other nation or try to make them itself. That is the first duty of any responsible Australian today. If we fail to reach such an understanding, we may have to deal with the consequences. For Australia, as the first nation in this part of the world, to think about acquiring nuclear weapons in lunacy. I say that Professor Titterton is involved in an act of lunacy. We have to be concerned to adopt a consistent defence policy. The trouble about debates on these matters in this place, Mr Deputy Speaker, is that we have too little time to discuss these affairs. I hope now to begin something that I can continue in the course of the next week. I believe that the first thing for the Australian nation to do is to decide the line of defence where we would have the best advantage in defending ourselves if the need arose. I think it is pretty clear that, if we consider that matter, we shall come to the conclusion that our best strategic defence position is primarily in the seas and in the air to the north of Australia. This, I believe, is true also for the United States of America. I suggest that the best strategic line has been described by American experts. This is a line that I stated recently. WhatI said, report on some other report, but never however, seems to have come as a great shock to so many of those on the opposite side of the House who pretend to have some knowledge of strategic factors. They behave as though I had presented a new and revolutionary thought. My statement was, almost word for word, precisely a quotation of something said by General MacArthur in 1949. He stated then that the strategic advantage for the United States, being an air power, was in the seas and in the air around Asia and that no one would consider that it was to the strategic advantage of the United States, as the honourable member for Fremantle pointed out a few minutes ago, to become involved with the millions of Asian people in war on the land if that could be avoided. So it seems to me that, if common sense is any guide, we must think mainly, first of all, in terms of a strategic win. For the moment, I am not suggesting exactly where it would be in relation to longitude. That line should extend as a sort of shield over the north of Australia, running westerly down the coast of Western Austalia and easterly down the coast of Queensland. The first requirement would be very fast and mobile air and sea forces. I understand that most of the new thinking in the Navy concerns submarines and small weapons carriers, not vessels like aircraft carriers, which Professor Miller so vividly described as an extremely vulnerable basket. Let me leave that aside for some development, I hope, at a later stage and now confine my attention to the criticism made a few minutes ago by the honourable member for Wannon. I have tried to think first of the best strategic position. What about the land? What is happening on land in Asia? The honourable member for Wannon said that he would criticise some statements I have made. He said that I had said there was no outside military force assisting in South Vietnam. I have never made any such statement. I would have expected the honourable member for Wannon, with his educational background and sense of responsibility, to have at least been fair minded enough to ascertain what I did say. But like most honourable members opposite he sometimes takes a completely abbreviated and inadequate press do honourable members opposite take even those accurately or fairly. They always give to them their own interpretation to suit their purposes. I said nothing about there being no outside military force operating in South Vietnam. WhatI did say was that the classic Western argument was that what was happening in South Vietnam was something that was fundamentally a matter of outside inspiration, direction and supply and that if it were not for this outside support there would be no significant problem there. I said that the interpretation that this was simply a matter of something that was caused by Communism in China and North Vietnam is what the Western viewpoint is asking us to believe. We are being asked to believe that this simply a consequence of Communism because honourable members opposite think that is the best way to scare us for political purposes here in Australia. I said that proposition was fundamentally unsound and I do not care who tries to contradict my claim. Thc honourable member for Wannon quoted the "" Washington Post""a report with which I am quite familiar. The report said that 300 or 500 people a month were coming into South Vietnam from the north. The word used is "" cadres"". That means one person, not 10, 20, or 100. who has been present at most of the comThe report said that 300 or 500 were mittees of inquiry, said in the American coming in.

Some command posts and reserves are in the north but they are only being supplied even now according to the report at the rate of a few hundred a month. The honourable member asked me to indicate the evidence on which I have relied and which I have given to the House for the past months. It goes back to the reports of the French officers after the capitulation in 1954, published at length in a book titled ""Modern Guerrilla Warfare"", edited by Osanka and published in the United States of America. LieutenantColonel Geneste gave a thorough detail of this and said in effect that everything done up until 1954 was predominantly local; hardly anything had come from the north. In 1962, General Paul Harkins, the American commanding officer at that point, made a report and said that until 1962 the Viet Cong had mainly home made weapons and weapons that had been captured from the Government forces.

I have examined every scrap of evidence I can obtain about this subject over a period of ten years and I have put a good deal of it before the House. Those who oppose my view have been able to produce at last one statement-the report in the ""Washington Post"". The ""Washington Post"" is first referring only to June and July of this year and only qualifies the evidence over that period of time. The evidence still stands without any real modification. It is important to examine this legislation in relation to the threats Australia faces. This legislation will not go one inch of the way towards meeting those threats. The Government is still as far away as ever from recognising the fundamental situation that it faces. I do not believe the Government is out to face the situation that exists today. It is out to use defence for purposes of Australian political consumption. Mr Malcolm Fraser Mr Deputy Speaker, I wish to make a personal explanation. Brimblecombe) -Does the honourable member claim to have been misrepresented? Mr Malcolm Fraser -Yes. The honourable member for Yarra (Dr. J. F. Cairns) misrepresented my criticism of him. He said that I had taken his remarks incomplete from a newspaper report. He said also that he had never said there was no outside aid to the Viet Cong in South Vietnam. My authority for my remarks is ""Hansard"" of 21st October, where the honourable member is reported to have saidI have examined the evidence of this over a period of years and as far as I have been able to and other situations. It would appear from discover there is no evidence whatever of any material assistance coming from outside Vietnam -fro m any country outside that area. That is a complete sentence. Dr. J. F. Cairns Mr Deputy Speaker, I do not want to allow that statement to escape unanswered, because it implies a misrepresentation of me. The honourable member does not seem to realise the significance of the word ""material"". The word does not mean none at all. Material is what it says-somethin g of matter; something tangible. It does not mean none at all; it is material in the situation. If the honourable member takes it to mean none at all it is quite contrary to what I intended it to mean. He cannot claim that as its meaning. Mr Malcolm Fraser -If the honourable member for Yarra wishes to say that ""material"" does not mean material in the sense of manpower, guns and equipment I would be prepared to accept his explanation of what he in fact said, but I think he will find it very difficult to persuade anybody in this Parliament that "" material"" does not mean material and manpower. very difficult to follow the honourable member for Yarra (Dr. J. F. Cairns) in a debate of this kind. Indeed, it is always very difficult, after the honourable member has spoken, to work out just what is Labour policy so far as defence is concerned. The honourable member for Fremantle ( Mr Beazley), whom I consider a very sincere man and one who does not ever betray Labour Party policy, said that the Opposidefence should not be in controversy. We are agreed on this, and it is to be greatly regretted that we have not such a policy at the moment. There are many men on the Opposition side who are in agreement with us. but when the honourable member for Yarra gets up and, with great cleverness and fine techniques, endeavours to misinterpret the position and puts forward certain suggestions, I am sure that we and the people of Australia look upon what he says with the utmost suspicion. Let us consider some of the things he has said. Apparently he admits to having made a 10 year study of the Vietnamese his findings and the remarks that he has made that our ally, the United States of America, is wrongfully interfering in Vietnam. Everything it does is wrong. Has the honourable member ever obtained from the generals whom he has quoted, confirmation that the views he puts forward are actually their views? Does he quote the whole of what they have said, or does he pick out a little here and a little there and mould it to what he wants to portray as the policy",59,Defence Bill 1964

100,Mr Jess (La Trobe) [4.35],"It is alwaysof the United States of America? Has he exactly what he thinks? Thc honourable member made another interesting remark. He said that the Australian Labour Party stands for peace. I think it was proved in this chamber last week that the Australian Labour Party is divided on the question of peace. The honourable member for Yarra openly admitted -and I admire him for doing so-that he was a supporter of the Peace Congress. He admitted that he was a foundation member of the original peace congress which was called by the Labour Party a Communist front organisation. He also endeavours here, in an insidious way, to disseminate propaganda which, when analysed, certainly fits in with what is going on at the Congress in Sydney at the present time. He also stated, as did the honourable member for Fremantle ( Mr Beazley) that the Opposition supports the principles of this Bill. He said that the Opposition had never opposed the defence vote. That is true. The Opposition has not voted against the defence estiniates but, quite frankly, it did not have sufficient numbers to make any difference to the defence vote even if it wanted to do so. Let us examine some of the statements made by honourable members opposite. The honourable member for Yarra said: "" We are critical, but we have never suggested that defence expenditure should be cut down"". On 24th November 1957, the present Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Calwell) saidIt would have been far better if some of the defence grant had been spent on universities, and secondary and technical schools, instead of being figuratively poured down the drain. said it. The honourable member for Reid( Mr Uren) who, like the honourable member for Yarra, is a supporter of the Peace Congress, is reported in "" Hansard"" of 1 ith October 1960, as having saidThis Government should reduce its expenditure on armaments and use thc money it is now wasting on expenditure for war to work for peace. It should devote the money to peaceful uses, such as thc Colombo Plan. . . . It should disarm and contribute to the work of the United Nations. Tliis man is still sitting in this House as a member of the Labour Parly, The former honourable member for Parkes, Mr Haylen, a very well known gentleman who is now a Labour Party Senate candidate in New South Wales, is reported in "" Hansard"" of l l t h October I960, as having saidI firmly believe that the best defence measure we could take would be to ensure that we had a railway system of uniform gauge throughout tbe entire continent. I will not quote all that was said by Opposition speakers during the debate but I invite honourable members to read for themselves the remarks of the honourable member for Lalor( Mr Pollard) and thc honourable member for Wills( Mr Bryant) and others. On 12th October 1960, the honourable member for Yarra saidMy point is that we should prepare ourselves to supply troops to the United Nations and this is the only justification that Australia has for supplying any troops anywhere at any time. Those are the arguments of the honourable member for Yarra and of those who support him in his faction of the Labour Parry. He talks about the strategic concept. He also talks about a mythical line behind which he suggests we should stand. He believes that we should conduct our defence only from the air and the sea. He never makes clear what he thinks should be done about Thailand, which is one of our allies under the South East Treaty Organisation. He never says what he thinks we should do in respect of Malaysia, to which we are committed as a fellow Commonwealth country. Indeed, he never makes clear exactly what he means about anything. If we wanted to be difficult, we could say that what he is now suggesting fits in with the Communist propaganda and the peace congress propaganda. He believes that we should withdraw all troops from foreign bases, that we should keep out of South East Asia, and that we should do nothing to prevent the advance of Communism. I suggest to the Australian people that it is a great tragedy that the alternative government of this nation has not a defence policy that is acceptable to the people. I welcome the Bill. It is something for which the Services have been asking for a considerable time, and it is something which, time and time again, governments of all political colours have refused to grant. There is no doubt that it is a move forward, although I feel that it will not have sufficient effect to bring the three Services up to the",60,Speaker Mr Tion Supported The Bill And Considered That

103,Mr Jess,"The Leader of the Oppositionstrength of which I personally think they should be. Let me now read an extract from a book entitled ""Why England Slept"" written by the late President John F. Kennedy in 1940. He wrote it in answer to another book which was written at that time called ""While England Slept"", which sets out what Nazi Germany and all the other Fascist countries were doing to prepare for war while England, as a peace loving nation, was not doing much. At the time of writing the book, the late John F. Kennedy was a student, and what he said in it then applies equally to us today. He saidWe must be prepared to recognise democracy's weaknesses and capitalism's weaknesses in competition with a totalitarian form of government. We must realise that one is a system geared for peace, the other for war. We must recognise that while one may have greater endurance it is not immune to swift destruction by the other. It means that in preparing for war today, which takes such a long time and is so expensive, a democracy may be struck such a knockout blow by a totalitarian form of government, which has prepared for war over a long period, that she will not be able to bring in the latent advantages that she possesses. It is only in the long war that the advantages of a greater spirit and determination among the people will be effective. In the last waT, luckily, Australia had time to raise her forces and train them to a certain extent before committing them to action. I feel that under the circumstances confronting us today we will possibly not have such time available. It is difficult to discuss whether this Bill will be effective without knowing what the Government proposes to bring forward after completing its review of defence. It is pointless to say that the Bill is inadequate or that it will not achieve what is required without knowing the Government's intentions. I sincerely hope that in the week after next the Government will make a statement which may well alter the whole situation. This Bill affects the Citizen Military Forces, and it is most difficult to know whether the action proposed under it really will be effective in strengthening those Forces, because the Minister for the Army (Dr. Forbes) has already said in this House that the re-organisation of the C.M.F. is under consideration at the present time. We do not know yet what this means. We do not know whether they are going to be set up on a different basis, as, indeed, many of us feel they should be, and we will not know until we are advised. However, as I have said, I welcome the Bill. I believe it is a move forward and I certainly hope it will have the desired effect. But I do not believe that, on its own, it is sufficient. When one considers what the Bill is designed to do one knows that it will be welcomed by the Services, both the regular Services and the volunteer Services. I feel quite sure that nobody wants to go back to the old system we had at the beginning of the last war. I am also sure that in the forefront of those who do not want to go back to that system are the Citizen Military Forces. We all know that many members of the C.M.F. had had battalion training for a long time before the last war commenced. They had a fine esprit de corps. The men knew their officers and the officers knew their men. They were prepared to go away as battalions or batteries or other groups and serve anywhere overseas. But because the governments of the day would not allow them to do this, because the legislation did not allow them to do it, they were prevented from going away. In many instances the C.M.F. units were cannibalised. The officers were separated and sent to different battalions. The units were split up and the men were sent either to various battalions of the Australian Imperial Forces or, if they wished to stay at home, to other units of the C.M.F. The provision in this Bill that the C.M.F. may be sent overseas will be welcomed indeed by the C.M.F. I have no fear that any members of the C.M.F. will not be delighted. As I have said, particularly if the re-organisation of the C.M.F. is implemented this will be a very good thing. As to the strategic situation, which has been discussed today, I am slightly confused, but perhaps I have not read correctly the remarks of the Minister for Defence (Senator Paltridge) who made a number of statements when introducing this Bill in another place. The Minister saidThe review in June was carried out against the background of instability in South East Asia which shows no indications of improvement today nor in the foreseeable future. He went on to talk of the volunteer emerpeople in the defence forces, without exgency reserve and he saidThey will provide a ready means of suppleprepared to go overseas. I hope that at menting field force units, increasing our cold war some stage such a provision will be made. militaiy capability and providing reinforcements in the initial stages of hostilities short of general war. In other words, this reserve will increase our be liable to be mobilised and sent overseas, cold war military capability and still allow as is the case with the Australian Regular for reinforcements in the initial stages of Army. In support of this contention I would hostilities short of general war. He stated, like to quote portion of an article entitled furtherThe Government decided also that there was a Brigadier A. G. Patterson, Commander, need to have regard to the circumstances of today 99th Gurkha Infantry Brigade Group in when situations involving hostilities of a limited Borneo, which appeared in the ""Australian nature are more likely than general war. He said that the situation today indicates that we are more likely to see hostilities five of a limited nature than general war. But operational effectiveness in this theatre and which then I thought he went further and moved are, I believe, in need of an airing. I do this in the into a slightly different field. He saidIt is necessary to cater for the more likely situain the affairs of South East Asia, a region which tions, when hostilities occur which, although not posing an immediate direct threat of attack on Australia, could develop to the stage where Australia's security could be gravely jeopardised. . . . These circumstances could arise with little warning. When the Minister for Defence admits that a situation could arise without little warning in which Australia herself could be threatened, one is forced to ask oneself whether this legislation is adequate. AgainI say that there is difficulty in this regard because we do not know what the Government will propose in its defence review. But I think this is something that we should ponder upon, and if a deteriorating situation which could jeopardise Australia's security could come with little warning, perhaps we should be moving a little more rapidly. The Minister also saidShould it be necessary to declare a state of war, then the whole nation would be mobilised-by was defeated. Although it was a well conscription. In such circumstances I presume the Aushappened when the war ended and saidtralian Regular Army would have been moved immediately to a theatre of war theThe because, after all, our commitment is to signals wire on tricycles, despatch riders on pushmeet an advancing enemy, to stop the adbikes.

If we are to make certain that the whole area does not disappear behind the bamboo curtain, Britain and her allies must continue to lend a hand to our friends in South East Asia, and this means inevitably that the British Army, and in particular the Infantry, will continue to be involved. He went on to relate what happened in Indo China, as an illustration of what follows when you put European troops suddenly into a jungle area. We can train troops here in Australia; we can train them in the northern parts of Queensland; but there is no doubt that if you had to commit battalions of the Citizen Military Forces to the jungle to fight a war they would find themselves at a disadvantage. The author of this article tells what happened in Indo China when the cream of the French Army equipped and modern army it was defeated by guerrilla forces. He spoke of what victors came in sandshoes, trudging through mud with ammunition slung on bamboo poles, and other weapons of conventional war. And all the while the rains the French had prayed There was no honour in defeat, only humiliabeen almost equal. Technologically, the was heavy against the Vietminh. In all eight years of the war they did not have a single plane. The flights of fighters and bombers that passed over the jungles and rice fields each dav were always French. So were the streams of transport, the Dakotas and Flying Box Cars, rushing supplies to every battlefront. The French had hundreds of artillery pieces, the Vietminh comparatively few. Later he spoke of training and preparation, and this is what is relevant to the C.M.F. in Australia. He saidMy next point concerns the provision of forces required to fight in South East Asia. The experiences of the last twenty years have made it very clear that European troops pitched suddenly into the jungle are defeated by the climate, thc terrain and lack of facilities before thc enemy even takes a hand. To imagine that a soldier, a unit or a formation can be flown out from Europe in an emergency and flung into a jungle battle against the ant-like forces of Asian Communism is dangerous thinking indeed. It will take a good unit four months of climatisation and retraining in the theatre before it will be fit to take officers. I can see little change in this regard on the Vietminh, the Vietcong or the T.N.I. During that four months there would be casualties -me n whose bodies or minds are insufficiently robust to accept the necessary adjustment. Furthermore only a unit which is really well led and well disciplined will make the grade. Jungle war will mercilessly expose any weakness in this respect. Thus the forces required to fight at short notice in South East Asia must be stationed in South East Asia. Reinforcement plans must accept a four months acclimatisation and retraining period for all forces brought in from thc outside. From the point of view of the Army, it is essential that in time of emergency short of war we should be able to mobilise, if necessary, and we should be able to move Citizen Military Forces battalionsI should like to say divisions-to the rear forward area so that they can receive their acclimatisation. As I understand it, the new emergency reserve as far as the Army is concerned is hoped to bring about the recruitment of somewhere in the vicinity of 3,600 troops. I understand that there are no officers involved in this reserve. At the present moment, the Regular Army reserve is 4,709. It seems to me that we cannot be hopeful of getting the full complement of 4,709 to sign on in existing circumstances. However, this will be a very useful reserve from which to fill the gaps which, in my opinion, are existing at the moment. We have seen, and the Minister for the Army himself has mentioned, the shortages in our logistic forces which were found during the recent Army operation. Indeed, if we went to war, we might possibly be able to get one battalion or so away if we had this reserve to fill in some of the plugholes that would be left behind. I agree with one honourable member who said earlier that there should be a manpower register in Australia at this moment. I think this is something that nobody would oppose. Our defence forces, the Government and the people of Australia must know what the availability of manpower would be in the event of mobilisation necessitated by any threat to this country. If we did have a manpower register then, in a situation where, without actual warning, a threat could arise, such as the one to which the Minister for Defence referred in another place, we would know who we were calling up. There are other matters in the Bills to which, if I had the time, I would like to refer. One relates to the resignation of as far as this Bill is concerned. It still seems to me to be equally as difficult now as it was before for an officer in the service to resign his commission should he so desire. I can see the reason why resignations were refused a short time ago. They were refused because we are short of officers. But I still feel that if we are going to ask the right type of young man to enlist, and to go into one of the three services, or to go as an officer into a military college, we have to make it clear to him that after a certain number of years service, if he so desires, he has the right to resign, other than in a time of emergency. This right to resign applies to members of the Public Service, members of this Parliament, and also people in many other areas of employment of which I know. Why should any officer, if he is unhappy, if he wishes to, and if he has served a reasonable time, be prevented from resigning? Why should the refusal to accept resignations be justified because the Government has allowed the Defence forces to get to a stage where they have not sufficient officers at this time? I come now to the question of recruiting. I feel the recruiting campaign has been quite extraordinary. It has been most unimpressive. The results have shown this fact. I think it would be better if the three Services themselves could handle their own recruiting programmes because I think that those who have volunteered to join the Services, and who love them and have served in them, would know much more than other people what would appeal to the young men of today. I agree with the criticism that has been made that when you see a bulldozer digging a trench or when you see some character doing something similar in connection with working in tbe forces, it is pretty uninteresting and has very little romance attached to it. I would like to see something like the American system of recruiting where by the use of radio and television and other means of propaganda the Armed Services are put into perspective. You find that each morning at, perhaps, 7.30. you are told: "" This is the anniversary of such and such a battle "", or you are told: ""This is the anniversary of some event in which our Services were concerned."" In the United States of America the armed services are treated with great respect. They are given a position of pride. I was glad to hear the Minister for the Army suggest that this is going to be one of the objectives of the Government. I noticed that the Minister made a plea to the people of Australia. I frankly feel-and this is a matter on which I could to a degree join with the honourable member for Yarra (Dr. Cairns) -that the responsibility for this state of affairs rests on this Government which has over the years in my opinion allowed the Public Service and certain associations to whittle down the rights and privileges of omcers of the Services. As I have said before, there is only one difference between servicemen and civil servants and that is that look at this matter. I cannot see anything the servicemen can be sent off on a day's notice into battle and can be asked to die. In my book, this demands increased privileges, and the best that can be given to these men. As far as the recruiting plan and the increases in pay and terms and conditions are concerned the honourable member for Yarra said that we should give more. I do not think that what the honourable member for Yarra said is necessarily so at the moment. I think most of our servicemen are quite happy with the increased pay, allowances, and serving conditions. But I do think that this Government at the same time as it introduced these increases in pay and allowances should have had a look at the Defence Forces Retirement Benefits scheme. This is the greatest canker from which the Services are suffering at the moment. If the various Service Ministers cannot get this message over to the Treasury, I do not know what they are going to do about the problem. This is one of the greatest causes of unhappiness to men in the Services. They join the Services and they are prepared to devote their time to them. They are retired at an early age, or under certain circumstances, they may even resign on a question of principle. They find that what they receive on retirement is whittled away because some person in the Treasury has said: ""Well look, chum, we don't get that, so you have not any hope of getting it."" I think that this matter is something at which this Government should look pretty quickly. As far as the proposed amendment with regard to contracting in or contracting out of the C.M.F. is concerned, 1 do feel that the Minister and the Government could have a look at this matter. There seems to me to be no problem-perhap s there iswhich would prevent the commanding officer of a battalion from calling a parade, having the necessary forms and saying: ""There you are. You sign in if you want to."" This contracting out does have a tendency towards the old theme to which I have always objected; An advertisement is put in a newspaper and, if you are lucky enough to see it, you are in, but if you are not lucky enough to see it, you are out. The present proposal is that situation in reverse, and it does seem to me to be slightly unfair. I would like the Service Ministers to have a which will be lost. I am quite sure that few will contract out because these men have, as is known, already agreed to go overseas. I am quite sure that they will continue to be willing to do this. As I say, I support the Bill. I think it is good. I think the Government should have taken action along these lines a long time ago. This is something the Services have wanted. I hope that, when the defence review comes in, the other things which are required for defence will be implemented, and implemented very quickly. I say this because I think that the situation today is not a comfortable one for Australia. I do think that very much more is required than what is proposed in these Bills. I support the Bill. support the Bills, as well as the remarks of previous speakers from this side of the House and some of the remarks of previous speakers from the other side of the House.

108,Mr Benson,"Thes e are speakers'That was supposed to have been said by the then Minister for the Navy, Senator Gorton, according to the ""Sydney Morning Herald"" of 30th January 1963. Many of us probably stand up in this chamber and say things that we should not say. I suppose that in a few years time, if I still happen to be here-havin g recently been returned with a majority of 703 votes -somebod y will stand up and quote what I have said. The Australian Labour Party is often referred to as a party that has no defence policy. I have said in the House before that very often things happen on the Government benches after we members of the Opposition have made certain recommendations. I have in my hand a very interesting booklet which I should like everyone to read. It is called "" Build a Strong Australia with Labor"". There is a photograph of our leader on the front page. was published before the last Federal election. I will not quote all that we said on defence because that would take too long; but we said thisLabor will do its utmost to make Australia selffor the Navy. These words are quite famous. reliant in defence so that the nation can play a full role in its obligations to its allies under ANZUS., S.E.A.T.O. and UN. We put copies of this booklet into as many letter boxes as we could all over Australia. We also saidLabor declares it will honor and support all Australia's existing treaties and defence alliances. on having a strong Navy. The preamble, that fits in with the Kamchatka-Darwin Jine? yet. I point out to honourable members opposite that they eventually adopted most of the things that we suggested, although those things were not included in the Government's policy speech. In respect of the Army we said in the booklet that we would make Citizen Military Forces pay and allowances free of income tax. We said that before November last year. The Government has now adopted that proposal. In respect of the Navy we said in the booklet that we would establish a naval base on the Western Australian coast and that we would construct two dry docks in Victoria and Western Australia. I will leave it at that and refer now to matters that are contained in the Bills. I hope that I will be able to make a few more remarks on defence when the defence review comes before the House. The Minister for the Navy( Mr Chaney), in his second reading speech on the Naval Defence Bill, pointed out that many of the laws governing the Royal Australian Navy at the present time emanated from the British Navy. That is true. The time has now come when those laws have to be changed in order to fit in with the requirements of this country. Sad as it may be and although it may appear to be a break from the old traditions of the Royal Navy, that cannot be helped. The world is moving quickly and these changes must be made. I regret the changes because I have much admiration for, and considerable pride in the British Navy. In Australia we seem to be growing apart from the ways of the British Navy and, because of geography, we seem to be leaning more towards America. We cannot help that, because America is closer to us than Britian is. We must put in order the laws as they apply to our Navy. It is interesting to read the preamble to the Articles of War as laid down Many people have not heard them. I shall read only from the famous preamble to the Articles of War, which is well known to naval officers. I believe that it should be well known to other Australians, particularly at this time when we depend so much which was written many years ago, saysOn the British Navy, under the good providence of God, the wealth, safety and strength of the Kingdom chiefly depend. This statement, which was in use before the time of Nelson, applies just as much now as it did when it was written. Today we have not a British Navy of strength, so it is not on the British Navy that we must depend, but on our own Navy. We relied on the British Navy right up until the last war, but now we have to stand on our own feet and build our own Navy. The purpose of this Bill is to streamline the Navy, the Army and the Air Force and to attract more men into the Services. It could be said that the Bill is, in a way, an indictment of the present Government",66,Speaker Mr Tion Supported The Bill And Considered That

112,Mr Benson,"I have not come to thatbecause, although the Government has been in power now for 15 years it still has not reached its defence target. It still has not been able to make the Services popular enough to induce the young men in Australia to offer themselves for duty. That is a deplorable state of affairs. Whether this state of affairs is the fault of the men who are not offering or the fault of the Government will have to be decided later. I am unhappy that so many of our young men today cannot make themselves available to do a bit for their country. Whether we like it or not, the time will surely come when some measure more drastic than this Bill will be necessary. We cannot sit back in an affluent and prosperous country Uke Australia and not do something to keep our defences in order. If anyone in this House or anyone in Australia says that at present he is quite happy with our defences, he is being unrealistic. At present Australia is confronted with forces that are pointing towards us. I hope that they will do no more than point towards us, but events that one sees happening, one after the other, give cause for concern. I do not like saying this, but 12 months ago when I was in Indonesia with the present Minister for the Army (Dr. Forbes), Dr. Subandrio was asked what he thought about the nuclear free zone in the southern hemisphere. It is well to remember what he said. He said many things about it, but all that I can remember of what he said was that so far as he was concerned .the nuclear free zone in the southern hemisphere was unrealistic. I heaTd him say that, and it is fair that the nation should know that I and 12 other people heard him say it. Since then, Red China has exploded an atomic bomb. At that stage Indonesia was building an atomic power station and, so far as I know, she may have completed that atomic power station. That project shows that Indonesia is going ahead with its nuclear know-how. I believe that it is only a matter of time before Indonesia has the atomic bomb. I agree with the honourable member for Yarra (Dr. J. F. Cairns) that we should, if possible, get together with Indonesia and try to arrange a treaty to ensure that Indonesia and Australia wiU keep away from atomic weapons. AU we can do is try to get such a treaty. That may be a weak way to solve the problem that we have because we are not prepared. But I want to return to thc provisions of this Bill. able member do if we failed to get that treaty? get the treaty. If we fail in our attempt we can then do something else. As to what we will do then, the Minister's guess is as good as mine. There are a few matters that should be brought into line with regard to people who join the new Emergency Reserve. No mention has been made of dental treatment for those who join the Reserve. A few matters have been brought to my notice and I hope that the various Service Ministers will consider them. I should like to know what the situation would be where a fuU time or part time member of the Citizen Military Forces in Australia becomes ill or is involved in an accident due to Service causes, or any other causes. WiU he remain on full pay and be kept on in the Service until he regains his former health? I should like to know also what the situation is with regard to a full or part time member of thc C.M.F., whether inside Australia or outside Australia, who is killed while on service. Will his widow be entitled to a war widow's pension? I should like to know also whether this Bill will empower the call up of individual C.M.F. officers and non-commissioned officers for full time duty both inside and outside Australia. I do not think this point has been made clear. It would be of great benefit to people who intend to join the Emergency Reserve if the Service Ministers could make that point clear. While referring to the NavyI omitted to mention one point. At the present time in Australia we have no register of Australian ships. Every Australian ship, whether it is a warship or a merchant ship, is on the British register of shipping. Every naval ship is registered as a merchant ship, in some respects, and consequently goes on to the British register of shipping. I bring this to thc notice of the Minister for the Navy because he intends to introduce a bill to alter the law concerning discipline and the law governing the relationship between the British and AustraUan Navies. The Minister should consider whether Australian ships could be placed on an Australian register.",67,Speaker Mr Tion Supported The Bill And Considered That

114,Mr Benson,"First, we must try toEven Australian merchant ships are classed as British registered ships. Our warships also portunity is also taken to amend other are registered as British ships. This is a matter to which attention should be given. I make another plea to the Minister: When our reserve officers are called up they should not be required to wear the letter "" R "" on their uniforms because when a reserve officer goes on board a warship he is set apart immediately by the "" R "" on his arm. I think he is placed on rather disadvantageous terms in relation to other officers. have joined the Services. It does not happen in the Army and I do not think it happens in the Air Force at present. During the war, England had the R.A.F.V.R., but towards the end of the war it was disbanded. The Army eliminated the symbols on officers' uniforms a long time ago and I think the Royal Australian Navy should also do this. ber sure that all personnel would want to remove the symbols? leave it at that. I hope I will be able to speak on the defence review when it is presented to the Parliament. am not considered to be too much of a square, I would like to speak to the Bills. I support them, not only because I consider that they make a practical contribution to the solution of the defence problems in front of us today, but also because of the good work of the Minister for Defence (Senator Paltridge). If ever we have 6een a new Minister have a good look at his new responsibilities, start work at the bottom and work up, we have seen it with the Minister for Defence who has produced this legislation. At the outset we should be quite clear about what the Bills do. This may seem to be trite at this stage of the debate, but after listening to the honourable member for Yarra (Dr. J. F. Cairns) and other bonorable members, I think we should eet out what the Bills do. They do not purport to solve all the defence problems that face us at the moment. They do not purport to attract so many men to the forces that we will have full complements. They set out, first, to establish volunteer Emergency secondly to deal witb changed obligations for members of the citizen forces. Opportions of the Defence Act. IfI may gently chide the Minister for the Army (Dr. Forbes), I think he is too modest and does not do justice when he says that these amendments may be treated as machinery amendments. That may be true but to me the amendments are of very real import both in regard to recruiting and in regard to the treatment of the men when they The Bills take their place in a master pattern which is designed to solve our defence problems. This master pattern changes with the times as the Government tries to look ahead. A constantly changing international situation requires a changing strategy. Tbe legislation takes its place with decisions that have been made in the past. These decisions have meant that we have acquired new equipment, new fighting stores and weapons, new destroyers of a very modern type, the most up to date conventional submarines and helicopters. We not only have the means to fight but we also have the opportunity to train with modern weapons. We have not previously had this opportunity. We also have the Mirage fighter and the Caribou transport aircraft, and we will later have the F l l l A aircraft. This is all part of the pattern to which these Bills belong. We have dealt with other legislation and regulations dealing with pay and allowances, better conditions for personnel and housing for personnel. We have seen changes in equipment and greatly changed uniforms and personal gear. All this is done to maintain our armed forces at a modern standard. Now other smaller measures are being adopted and I would like to mention some of them. They do not of themselves appear to make any big contribution to our deffence, but at the same time some of them are most imaginative. Men are given a choice of the branch in which they will serve when they join the Army. Such a choice was not given before; the men were drafted. Members of the Army school cadet corps are being given the opportunity to go to the Antarctic at the end of the year. This may Reserves and seem to be a very small matter to those who are not associated with the corps, but",68,Speaker Mr Tion Supported The Bill And Considered That

It is an imaginagive us a good body of highly trained men. tive move ancl will create interest and build It will consist of eligible, former regular up morale. It may not do very much to increase our fighting efficiency but it will definitely encourage the boys in the corps. C.M.F. officers are being sent to Papua and New Guinea. Once again, only small numbers are concerned, but it is important for C.M.F. officers or prospective officers to know that the opportunity is being given to them to see Papua and New Guinea, where they may at some future time be called on to fight. The wise commanding officer will use the men who visit the Territory in discusions with other officers and intending officers, N.C.O.s and men who have not been there and want to know something about the conditions there. Although these are small matters, they will be helpful and they fit into the general pattern -the Navy, the Army and the Air Force. Let me mention another tremendously important aspect. I have seen an advertisement in the newspapers seeking a director of public relations for the Department of Defence. One of the tasks of this officer will be to formulate the public relations policy of the defence group of departments. If ever we needed an outstanding man for this position, we need him now. We are not selling our achievements well enough. I have never said that our efforts are adequate, but we should tell the people what we are doing. I think that the appointwhich are broken up into four parts-the ment of a director of public relations, under Australian Regular Army, the Regular Army whom all the other public relations officers in the departments will work, is a very wise move and I commend the Government for creating the position. The decisions that are implemented in the Bills have been made after looking at the constantly changing situation in the areas that concern us most. For the moment, these areas are in South East Asia. The situation is changing from day to day and we must look at it in the light of our treaty Supplement, and possibly the Minister for obligations under ANZUS., S.E.A.T.O. and, to an extent, A.N.Z.A.M. In the legislation before us we are creating a Regular Army Emergency Reserve. In the future it will become well known by the initials R.A.E.R. The Minister said frankly that the Emergency Reserve would comprise 3,600 men. This is a good number and will soldiers, men who have been trained. It is good to see the Minister give an estimate that the Reserve will consist of 3,600 men who will be available once the scheme is working. They will be capable of call up for service anywhere at any time. As I see it they are un-officered, but I think it is the intention to assimilate them into other regular units which are already officered, so that difficulty will be overcome. IfI were to express a slight doubt on these Bills at all it would be to ask the question: Have we not gone as far as we can go with the number of parts to our forces? As I add them up there are 12 or more parts to our forces now. Can we handle them administratively? Our Defence Forces are divided into three separate arms The Navy, our senior Service, is divided into three parts-the Permanent Naval Forces, the Naval Emergency Reserve Forces and the Citizen Naval Forces. With the Air Force we have the Permanent Air Force, the Air Force Emergency Force and the Citizen Air Force, which again is divided into two parts-the Active Citizen Air Force and the Air Force Reserve. Our military forces are divided into two parts. First, the Permanent Military Forces, Supplement, the Regular Army Emergency Reserve and the Regular Army Reserve. The second part of our military forces is the Citizen Military Forces. So, our forces are divided into about 12 parts. I hope that we do not divide them further. However, as I see it, there is a need for every one of these parts, because each part has a separate set of circumstances governing its activities. I am not au fait with the Regular Army the Army (Dr. Forbes) can teU us something about it later. 1 can see nothing much about it in the Bill. PossiblyI should be familiar with it from my other studies. However, I take it that the Regular Army Supplement is in existence now and that the Bill continues its existence and does not do away with it. I think we should be clear on some of the characteristics of the groups established under this BillLet us deal first with the Regular Army Emergency Reserve, which is a new force. It can be called out by order of the Governor General. It can be called out for continuous service with the Permanent Military Forces and it can be asked to serve anywhere at any time in peace or war. It also carries an obligation to train. The men in the Regular Army Emergency Reserve will be required to meet certain training commitments which I will not detail now. It is no good my expressing an opinion on this, because this is a matter for the experts. However, I think that the establishment of this Reserve is a masterpiece, and I commend the responsible Mimster and the Government more particularly as its establishment was not predicted by any outside body so far as I know. Its establishment was left to the military advisers and to the Government. No outside experts, pseudo or otherwise, thought of it. I commend the Government for proposing thc establishment of an organisation which wili be able to produce 3,600 men at short notice and which will be able to move to any point and to fight on arrival. The Regular Army Reserve is slightly different, lt may be called out by the Minister but, as I see it, only after a proclamation by thc Governor General of a state of defence emergency. In this the Regular Army Reserve differs from the Regular Army Emergency Reserve. Members of the Regular Army Reserve bave no obligation to continue with their training, as I understand it. I know that if I am wrong the Minister will correct me. Although our Army today has many parts, they are all different and they all have different functions to perform. I have little comment to make on that part of the Bill relating to the ability to call the Citizen Military Forces out for overseas service, except to say that from my knowledge of the C.M.F. this provision will be received with great delight. It should not be forgotten that these men have already signed up to serve overseas, but apparently there is some doubt as to the legal processes. AlthoughI have not seen the amendment foreshadowed by the honourable member for Fremantle ( Mr Beazley), as I understand it-and I know to what it is directed-it is virtually redundant and unnecessary. Members of the C.M.F. have signed on the dotted line for overseas service and they are not going to worry much about this new arrangement, which is purely a machinery matter. The end result will be exactly as they expected it to be. I think it will lift the morale of the men. It could act as an aid to recruiting, although to what extent I would not venture to say. As the Minister said, it will give a real meaning, a true sense of purpose to service in the C.M.F. I think it will assist materially in obtaining the co-operation of employers whose employees want to serve in the C.M.F. The Bill is designed to protect civil employment and it restricts the employer from preventing an employee from serving in the forces. I have heard it said that the Australian employer has been put on trial. I do not think it is as severe as that. We are calling on industry, whether it be primary industry, secondary industry or service industry, for co-operation. We are calling on industry to make a sacrifice which, in this case, is a form of insurancea type of war risk insurance. At the same time, do not let us underestimate the premium which we are asking employers to pay. I fully agree that we are doing the right thing, but I do not think that we should accept this without realising that it will cost employers, particularly the small businessmen, something. I can foresee difficulties for the small businessman-the grocer or the butcher who employs one man. The employee has every right to enlist in the C.M.F. In fact, many people would regard it as his duty. His employer will be hit to some extent. I referred to this particular problem recently and queried whether some thought could be given to providing some form of compensation to the small employer. I realise that the problem of where to draw the line-wh o is in and who is out -woul d arise. We must watch the situation closely to prevent hardship, particularly to small employers. The legislation, however, will help to overcome the employer block which exists at present. I know that an employer block exists today, not only in private enterprise but in some semi-governmental undertakings -hospital s and so on. I have not found this block of Commonwealth departments, but I am surprised to say that it exists in some State Government departments. I have found that difficulties arise with civic and local government bodies. For instance, I have recently noticed a case in which a Pastures Protection Board would not allow the local Citizen Military Forces unit to exercise on an unfenced reserve. This is the sort of thing that occurs. When I go into these matters I always first approach the C.M.F. members concerned and ask whether they will be embarrassed if I talk to anyone about the problem. I inform them that they can talk to me quite freely. If the persons concerned are embarrassed, I respect their situation. Ifindthat those concerned will always tell me what has happened. However, usually, like many other people, they are somewhat afraid of politicians and they also fear for their future in their jobs. Nearly always, they ask me not to go ahead with the matter. I believe that the raising of the status of the citizen forces as proposed in these Bills will largely overcome the employer block that at present exists without any further action on the part of the Government by way of regulation. I turn now to the Naval Defence Bill. I see that it will establish a Naval Emergency Reserve which will be composed of fully trained officers and men and will be subject to call up by the Governor General in circumstances short of war. However, this force will differ from the other emergency reserves because it will be a third part of the Naval forces, not part of either the Permanent Navy or the Citizen Naval Forces, unlike the Regular Army Emergency Reserve. Members of the Naval Emergency Reserve will have an obligation to undergo refresher training. That is reasonable. I would be most interested to learn the number of men who are likely to make up this Emergency Reserve. Perhaps the figure can be stated. I am sorry that there has so far been no mention of it. about 3,600 fully trained men in the Regular Army Emergency Reserve and about 2,000 in the Naval Emergency Reserve. officers and 1,800 men. that the House ought to have this information. One Opposition speaker expressed the hope that a purely Austrahan code of discipline would be introduced. I turn now to the Air Force Emergency Force. Here, again, we have been given no indication of how many men are likely to be available, but we have been told that 1,200 are likely to be required and that keen competition for the available places is expected. So it looks as if we shall have in this reserve 1,200 fully trained Air Force personnel who, of course, will be subject to further training. Preference is to be given to former members of the Permanent Air Force or present and former members of the active Citizen Air Force. We have been told that there are now no pilots in the active Citizen Air Force. I understand that to be correct. All the members of that Force are ground staff. Preference is to be given also to members of the Air Force Reserve and the University Squadrons. There appears to be little mention of the Air Force Reserve in the Air Force Bill. What is intended to happen to that Reserve in the future? There has been little explanation of its role in peace, times of emergency or war. I think the Minister for Air( Mr Howson) will recall my asking a question in September about doubts in the minds of members of the Air Force Reserve, particularly those who act periodically as instructors for the Air Training Corps. I asked about their role in the event of a national emergency arising. I hope that the Minister will give us some information on this matter. These men have devoted a good deal of their time and patience, and, in many instances, a good deal of expense, to the initial training of the youth of Australia in the Air Training Corps. I should say that they have done much to assist in moulding the character of young men who have served in the Corps. I believe that they do a most commendable job. I hope that their future will be well looked after, though their future role is not made clear to me by the Bill. I should like to hear more on the subject so that I may advise a number of Air Force Reserve officers in my electorate. Summing up, Mr Speaker, I point out that these measures will establish Reserves of trained men. These Reserves will facilitate rapid movement of those who are trained and will provide a sound basis for",69,Speaker Mr Tion Supported The Bill And Considered That

121,Mr England,"I understand. I think the expansion of training. Thc menibers of thc citizen forces will feel more wanted than in the past. They will feel that the Parliament has assured them that they have an effective role to play in times of strife. This legislation will also bring us up to date in a number of smaller matters. Though they may be described as smaller matters, anybody who has had any association with Service life will realise that these improvements will be particularly welcome in all the Services. They are most constructive. Finally, I ask the Government to consider representations that I have made previously about the advisability of instituting a manpower register. I hope that tbe Ministry, during its deliberations on defence next week, will closely consider the need for a more virile and more dynamic recruiting campaign than we have at present. We are already spending big money on recruiting, but I believe that the campaign could be much improved. An effective manpower policy is necessary. Perhaps there is provision for it tucked away in the archives somewhere, but I know nothing of it. The need for a proper manpower policy has particular application to the citizen forces. Wc must know which occupations will be reserved. What is to happen to medical officers, nuclear physicists and skilled machinists? They will be in great demand when a national emergency arises. They will want to be in thc thick of things, and I know that many such men are already in the Citizen Military Forces. But is it right for them to undertake expensive training only to be pulled out of the forces when an emergency arises? We only pull our own legs when we say that we have so many trained men in the citizen forces, if we know that, immediately hostilities are declared, or just before, a national manpower policy will be adopted and many of these men will be removed from the forces. I ask the Government to consider this matter earnestly during its deliberations on defence next week. I commend these measures as constructive ones, Mr Speaker. I believe that they will be very helpful in our present situation. We look forward keenly to the next series of proposals that will be submitted after the deliberations to be undertaken by the Ministry next week. Mr L. R. JOHNSON (Hughes) [5.56] Mr Speaker, as previous Opposition speakers have pointed out, the debate on these measures does not raise any great difficulties for us on this side of the House. Our general view, however, is that the Government's proposals are relatively infinitesimal and of little consequence. One would have thought that the Emergency Reserves for the Army, the Navy and the Air Force which are provided for in these Bills could have been reasonably well accommodated in the permanent forces. Not a large number of men will be involved. I believe that the Regular Army Emergency Reserve will number some 3,600 men. No more than 1,200 will make up the Air Force Emergency Force. The Government has failed to mention any specific number. So if the intake is, say, 5,000 personnel in total, it is a fair contention in my view that the Australian permanent forces could have stood expansion to this extent. After all, it is intended that these Reserve personnel are to be on hand in times of emergency. This, of course, would not be anywhere near as good a situation as if we had an extra 5,000 men in the permanent forces who could be trained and capable of giving leadership and training to other personnel to be recruited in times of emergency. Nevertheless, we do not oppose the legislation. It is little enough. It is another case of too little too late. The Regular Army Emergency Reserve is to be engaged for a period of four years. Its members are to be paid the same salary as is applicable to Army personnel and at the end of the period of engagement a £100 bounty is to be made available to them. I agree with the honourable member for Yarra (Dr. J. F. Cairns) who contended earlier in the debate that better attractions could have been offered to these people. I have referred to such things as repatriation benefits. Not infrequently honourable members interview ex-servicemen from the last war who never left this country and who were not engaged in combat but who, nevertheless, incurred some injury or disability which necessitated them applying for repatriation, benefits. It seems reasonable to expect that the members of the Emergency Reserve should be covered by repatriation. The legislation provides that preference in respect of recruitment for the volunteer Emergency Reserve will be given to former regular soldiers who have had three years continuous service. One wonders why such emphasis is placed on the type of personnel to be engaged. After all, it is some considerable time since the last war ended. I suppose many former regular soldiers have had enough of the Service and are not inclined to go back to it. In the 19 years since the last war ended a large number of young men have become available who may be willing to engage in this Service. I hope that at the Committee stage the Minister for the Army (Dr. Forbes) may have an opportunity to say why, except for members of the Citizen Military Forces, some opportunity to engage in the Emergency Reserve is not given to younger and less experienced men. Sitting suspended from 5.59 to 8 p.m. Mr L. R. JOHNSON -Before the suspension of the sitting, I was referring to some features of the provisions of this legistries, the Australian Government refused to lation relating to the volunteer Emergency Reserve and I expressed the hope that the personnel to be engaged in this service would have repatriation benefits extended to them. Of course, we on this side feel that this kind of protection should be given to the entire Australian community. A decent national health scheme would give it to everybody. Just as ex-servicemen from the last war who did not engage in combat or go overseas have benefited from the provisions of the Repatriation Act, so does it seem reasonable that servicemen being enlisted in this particular service should facts. It is not nonsense. If 11 million Ausreceive similar benefits. I wish to refer to the general inadequacy weapons who can possibly deny nuclear of the Government's defence policy. Every weapons to 100 million Indonesians or 700 time an election is held the defence issue million Chinese? After all, one in every four is trotted out. Somebody said earlier during people in the world is Chinese, and our the debate that the Opposition is intent on only hope is to discourage nations from putting fear into the minds of the people, having nuclear weapons. Nuclear weapons but obviously that is a stock in trade of this would not mean survival for the people of Government at election time. When we Australia. In fact when we set out to proexamine the Government's defence policy vide defence against an aggressor by acquirwe see that it is a fairly patchy sort of thing ing nuclear weapons we are creating a far and that it is directly associated with the greater threat than the aggressor himself deficiencies of the Government's foreign represents. policy. For example, this morning I asked the Prime Minister( Sir Robert Menzies) clear that, from the standpoint of the whether a protest had been made to the United States of America, it is not a good French Government about its proposed thing to have a series of national deterrents. nuclear tests. I went on to mention In other words, the allied forces-if we are that Professor Titterton had suggested that still using that old fashioned term-hav e no Australia should acquire nuclear weapons. need to spread nuclear weapons all around He contends that this represents the only adeqate defence for Australia. This morning, I also brought to the attention of the House the remarks of Dr. Linus Pauling who indicated that something like 500,000 children yet unborn would be adversely affected as a result of the proposed French nuclear test in the Pacific-thi s one test. It is alarming to know that the Government has done very little about protesting. It is also alarming to know that this Government has failed to protest effectively even against the Chinese test. I do not think that Professor Titterton has the answer at all. It is important to recall that this Government has not really given effect to the spirit of the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, ln 1961, when the Secretary General of the United Nations wrote to member countries asking them to indicate the terms on which they would agree not to acquire nuclear weapons from other counindicate that it would not acquire nuclear weapons. That is the Government's present attitude. Again, when we remember that we have in Western Australia a United States base designed principally to control nuclear submarines capable of projecting nuclear missiles into other continents, we realise that here is another example of the Government's failure to give proper effect to the spirit of the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty.

122,Mr Chaney,"Nonsense.thc globe. Our powerful friends have nuclear weapons and this should be sufficient. 1 hope that no one on the Government side has been tempted to take Professor seriously. Over the years, the Government has had a conglomeration of defence policies. 1 have before me an indication of how concerned the honourable member for Chisholm( Sir Wilfrid Kent Hughes) is about the training of Indonesians in Australia. This to me represents a remarkable contradiction. I have never contended with any enthusiasm at all in this place that the Indonesians represent tbe kind of threat to Australia that the Government claims they represent, yet this Government has been providing facilities for training Indonesians alongside Australian Army personnel. Recently, the honourable member for Chisholm asked the Prime Minister whether the continued training of Indonesian officers in Australia meant that Australia was training them to plan bigger and better raids on Malaysia. He pointed out that there was a possibility of Malaysian and Australian soldiers being killed or wounded as a result. Here is evidence of the conglomeration of attitudes on the part of this Government which is supposed to be inspired by its concern about Indonesia. Let me now compare the defence expenditure in this country with that of other countries. The United States of America spends £112 per head per annum on defence. The United Kingdom spends £32 per head per annum, Canada spends £39 per head per annum and Australia spends only £13 9s. per head per annum. Again, the United States of America spends 11 per cent, of her gross national product on defence while the United Kingdom spends 7 per cent, and Australia only 3 per cent. Why, a greater percentage of our gross national product was spent on defence as far back as 1952 and 1953. Certainly a greater amount of money is spent today, but that is only because of the decrease in the value of money owing to inflation. In terms of real expenditure we are slipping backwards and we compare very badly with a number of other countries. Before making a few comments about the NavyI should like to mention that there are many honourable members on this side of the House who are inspired to take a very great interest in defence. Almost every electorate north of the Tropic of Capricorn Titterton's recommendation is represented by a member of the Australian Labour Party. It is for this reason that so many of my colleagues from the north have spol en about defence in recent times. The honourable member for Kennedy( Mr Riordan), a former Minister for the Navy, has expressed his concern. The honourable member for the Northern Territory ( Mr Nelson), has spoken about defence, and the honourable member for Capricornia ( Mr Gray), who is very well informed about armaments and matters of that kind, has also given some leadership in defence thinking for the benefit of the Government and this country. The honourable member for Leichhardt ( Mr Fulton), who represents a great area, including the Cape York Peninsula, has spoken recently, and so has the honourable member for Herbert( Mr Harding). All of these men are ex-servicemen with experience. There is only one electorate above the 23rd parallel which is represented by a member other than a member of the Opposition. The great western coast of Australia is also represented by a member of the Labour Party. I refer to the honourable member for Kalgoorlie ( Mr Collard). Is it any wonder that thcy speak with some feeling about these matters when so much money has been poured into defence and we have so little to show for it after the length of time for which this Government has been in office? Not only has the north been neglected. No one on the other side of the House would dissent from my contention that it is very difficult to find a defence installation in the north at any place above the 23rd parallel. It is equally difficult to find any defence installation on the west coast, and it is also difficult to find one in the Territory of Papua and New Guinea. I have before me a cutting from the Sydney ""Sun"" of 23rd March 1964 which refers to the State Congress of the Territory Returned Servicemen's League which was held at Lae. The report saidThe Congress passed a resolution demanding that "" urgent consideration be given to the lack of preparedness in the Territory on defence means, especially in view of recent Indonesian attacks on surveyors on our border "". It also asked that a bigger defence vote be granted by the Australian Government to the Territory. Delegates said that the Territory was a ""neglected "" area as far as defence was concerned. able members like the honourable member 1 have been to the Territory and I know scandal of the sale of the "" Hobart"" a few the position pretty well. I know that the years ago, when huge amounts of money Government has come to think of the need were poured down the drain. I remember to provide airstrips and accompanying the honourable member for Grayndler exposfacilities in the Territory.

Then we have the ""Sydney"", which used to be an aircraft Then there are some problems in conshort time ago when an officer of the Citizen Military Forces made a statement about like an expert in these matters. But one deficiencies of uniforms and equipment. An who should know is the former Minister article which appeared in the Sydney"" Sun"" for the Army( Sir John Cramer). of 6th May 1964 saidThe officer, attached to the 1st Lancers at Parramatta, was commenting on an Army statement that a 1,000 per cent, boost in C.M.F. recruitment was needed to reach the June target of 31,750 . . . disgruntled because winter uniforms had to last for eight years. I do not suppose that this kind of statement will help to induce people to volunteer for the reserve forces. The honourable member for Calare( Mr England) said that this legislation would represent a great boost to thc Army's morale but I think we must give due weight to statements such as the one I have referred to. The newspaper report went onHe said recruits and permanent staff were disgruntled because winter uniforms had to last for eight years, boots for fourAnd mind you, they are subject to pretty tough wear during Army manoeuvresand two pairs of woollen Army socks had to be worn for four years before new ones were issued. Honourable members opposite seem to be expressing disbelief, but it is not I wbo make these statements. Anyone can read this article, which appeared in the Sydney"" Sun "". The article continuedThe officer claimed that advertisements advocating "" wonderful, modern training methods "" were "" a lot of tripe "". He said equipment at most units culties accrue. How much notice would this was so antiquated that recruits often had received belter training during their time as school cadets. ""As an example, our unit is a special Centurion tank unit. We've got one rank, the rest are 1942 armoured cars which go when thcy feel like it. . . ."" I would certainly hope that some morale boost would be availab'e fo the C.M.F., but a situation such as I have outlined does not reflect credit on this Government. This afternoon there was som: controversy concerning the time it would take to get Centurion tanks from Puckapunyal to th; north. The honourable member for Capricornia had contended that it would Ukc some considerable time to mova these tanks, which represent probably the most substantial and vital part of the Australian Army's striking force. In the event of strategic operational manoeuvres being necessary we would be relying to a considerable extent on these tanks. What is the position? Let me not speculate about this, because 1 do not even claim to be anything Mr Clyde CameronI doubt that. Mr L. R. JOHNSON -Not because of his Army experience-h e was an air raid He said recruits and permanent staff were warden-bu t because he served as Minister for the Army. In answer to a question he said it would take 10 to 15 days to move these tanks from Adelaide to Perth and 14 to 21 days to move them to Darwin. I do not know whether this is exactly as the honourable member for Capricornia put it, but I think it bears out the point that he was trying to make. These statements are denied by honourable members opposite, but they did not originate with the honourable member for Capricornia; they came from the former Minister for the Army. It is also important for us to realise how long it would take to move these tanks fully loaded from Melbourne to the places I now name. It would take 2 days 10 hours to move them to Sydney, 4 days 11 hours to Brisbane, 2 days 3 hours to Adelaide, 12 days 21 hours to Darwin and 7 days 18 hours to Perth. This is the Government's express service of the transportation of Centurion tanks. Of course, if these tanks have to eo by road, it has already been established that they g;t b-ggel dowi on our bridges which are not wide enough to accommodate them, and all kinds of diffiGovernment want from an enemy of its intentions fo wage a war in Australia? Is it to be 15 days or 21 days notice? Why are not these tanks strategically placed around the Auslralian countryside and in the places where you would expect attacks to occur? Why are they not located in some of the Australian Territories where they might have to be used? These are questions which honourable members opposite might well be prepared to answer. Another matter which I think should be looked at when you are talking about the incentives to people to join the Army is the allowance paid to Australian soldiers who leave thc Australian mainland. If an Australian soldier goes to Borneo, he receives a zone allowance of £105 a year. If he goes to New Guinea, this allowance is £165 a year. In Darwin he receives £140 a year. If he is stationed at Woomera. he receives an aUowance of £100 a year. This allowance, to my way of thinking, should be reviewed if the Government is looking for ways of boosting the morale of Army personnel. that allowance if it were in power? Mr L. R. JOHNSON -Of course it would. When we think of the Army it is also important to think about ammunition. It was a startling revelation a short time ago that half a million pounds worth of ammunition is produced each year in this country which is not serviceable. This inforwhich it seems there is need for Government mation was obtained by one of my colleagues in another place. Senator McClelland. Something is radically wrong here. This is just another one of the reasons not propose to cover so extensively. But why we are not getting value for our money. The Minister in charge of this particular matter would do well to provide some kind of explanation for this wastage of ammunition. The personnel of the Army is being increased. I understand from the figures made available that, in the very near future, Australia will have as many men in the Army as it had at the time of Federation in 1901. The officialfigurefor Army membership at that time was 27,353. The Minister for the Army might be good enough to tell me the figure now and indicate the extent to which it exceeds the number we had in 1901. I am not one who has vigorously contended that the reaching of higherfiguresis necessary. The Government has done that. Having contended that, the Government has a much bigger responsibility to bring about better results. I ask the Minister for the Army who is sitting at the table what has happened about national service training. Surely we have the right to consider this measure which is designed to provide a reserve force in connection with the Government's plans concerning national service training. The Minister for the Army has been in favour of national service training for years and years. He did not deviate from that policy until he became Minister for the Army. The first speech he made after taking his seat on the front bench was one which indicated there was a great deal of uncertainty about his attitude on this matter. MrL . R. JOHNSON I do not have to be in favour of it. It is honourable members opposite who support the Government. There is a great deal of vacillation and a great deal of uncertainty on this subject. If a selective training scheme is to be introduced, we would like to know just who are the limited number of people who will be selected. Will selections be made from the universities or trads unions, or from the ranks of boilermakers and building apprentices, amongst others, who are so necessary and who are so greatly needed in Australia today? These are matters on menibers to be vocal. I have moved into an area which I did the general position is that after spending a figure in the vicinity of £3,000 million on defence over the 15 years it has been in office the Government finds that our defences have reached this very sorry state of affairs, and, on the eve of yet another election, there is to be a desperate, fairly dramatic, last minute effort to give the impression to the Australian people that the Government is really concerned with defence. As I have indicated in the short time available to me, there are these vulnerable issues about which this Government should give some account of itself. The north of Australia i5 still defenceless, and it does not seem to be likely that the provision before the House at the present time is going to reflect any more credit on the Government than the very unsatisfactory performance it has given over the last 15 years it has been in office. I think you would agree, Mr Speaker, that during the course of this debate many constructive speeches have been made, and not all of them on this side of the House. I think that one would acknowledge some of the constructive criticism that has come from the Opposition side even though one would repudiate' and show some contempt for the left wing disruptive tactics of some honourable members on the opposite side. I want to try to be constructive in this matter. The Bill before us is a step forward, but is ita step straight forward or is it perhaps a little askew? I would like to examine this quesdon. Perhaps it is not necessary to examine whether this Bill goes far enough,",74,Speaker Mr Tion Supported The Bill And Considered That

125,Mr Wentworth (Mackellar) [8.27].,"because the Goverament itself has said that the Bill does not go far enough and has itself proposed a later review of defence which the Prime Minister( Sir Robert Menzies) tells us will take place in the coming few days. It is necessary in these defence matters that we plan not only to meet the present situation, but also to meet the situation as best we can foresee it some years ahead. The plans which we undertake now, although they have to have some relevance to any possible emergency which could come almost out of the blue overnight, are nevertheless plans which must mature for a year or two, or perhaps even longer. We should be providing, not just against the present situation, but also against the situation as we foresee it might be, shall I say, in 1967 or 1968? There are changed circumstances in our Australian area. They are circumstances which, unhappily, seem as though they are changing even faster. Four factors must be taken into consideration. The first is the emergence of new powers with conventional weapons in our theatre of the world. It is not very long ago that we and our allies would have considered ourselves completely and beyond any doubt dominant in this theatre. Today we are probably still in a position of dominance. But it would be an optimist who would bank on this position of dominance continuing year after year. We are not in the same position as regards conventional weapons as we have been throughout our history. Secondly, there is the Communist thrust coming southwards. Let us take what comfort we can, if any comfort is to be taken, in putting out some brush fire war in the from the alleged split between the Soviet lands to our north. For that purpose we and Chinese Communists. That split at this may need only small forces, but we may present moment seems to be in the process need them quickly. of healing. But even though we take from that split the maximum comfort, our Comfor our holding position in the countries munist enemies are still driving south to our north. This is what we have in a towards Australia. Australia is one of their minor way at the moment. We have troops targets. They are extending their political stationed in Malaysia. influence, unhappily throughout Indonesia, our nearest neighbour. They are extending their territorial influence in South East Asia. in the conventional The third factor of which we have to and thus cement to us our one remaining take account is that the newly elected British powerful ally, the United States. Honourable Government has announced that it proposes members must remember that the reliance to liquidate Britain's nuclear deterrent. That that hitherto we very rightly have been able means that in this area, instead of being to place upon Great Britain in this area is protected by two nuclear umbrellas-the British and the American-w e now have only one. It is a very sound umbrella, but it is not as good as two umbrellas. Furthermore, if the British Government carries out its election policy, it will find that, like King Lear, it has given away more than it thought it did and that it is unable to retain the authority, even in its own sphere, that it had previously. Unfortunately, we have to contend with a situation in which there will be an immensely weakened Great Britain, if the Labour Government carries out its announced plan. The fourth changed factor is that China has taken the first step towards emergence as a nuclear power. China is not a nuclear power at the moment. The threat is years away. It may be argued how many years away the threat is, but it is still years away. Nevertheless, China, which is an aggressive power, has taken the first step along the road. Here we have the four changed factorsthe shift of conventional power, the Communist thrust, Great Britain's liquidation of its nuclear deterrent, and mainland Communist China's acquisition of nuclear power. Those factors pose many questions for us. But tonight I want to speak of only one of them; that is the influence that they might have upon Army manpower which, I suppose, is the main subject of the measures before us. Why do we need a conventional Army, an Army conventionally armed? In these changed circumstances I can distinguish five needs for such an Army. First, we may need it to help to engage Secondly, we may need it as garrison In the third place we may need a conventional Army in order to play our part defence of this area now immensely diminished, or will be immensely diminished if the British Labour Government carries out its election policy. In order to keep our alliances firm, we must be prepared to contribute our part to the purposes of the alliances. If we want American soldiers to fight a conventional war for the defence of our Australian frontier, we must be prepared to use Australian soldiers to help the United States to hold the more distant line which keeps conflict out of Australian territory. In the fourth place, we may need conventional forces to defend our own Australian bases. Hitherto, with the very small exception of the months preceding the Battle of thc Coral Sea, we have always considered our Australian bases secure and inviolable. We have to get out of that habit of thinking in the new and much worse world in which we arc now placed. In the fifth place we may need our conventional forces for something even worse than the defence of our Australian bases; that is to preserve the structure and identity of the Australian people in time of attack. We have seen chaos develop in countries which did not have that kind of strength, a strength that we do not have now. We may need to be a people under arms if we are to survive. This is not a pretty picture. But any Government that fails to face it is failing in its duty to the Australian people. I am trying to analyse this matter as coldly and logically as I possibly can. What do we need for these purposes, in the form of conventional forces? TonightI am confining my remarks to this one aspect of defence. First, obviously, we need formations in being; that is, formationsperhaps not very numerous-whic h can be moved into action without delay, which do not need mobilisation. Secondly, we need formations in reserve, obviously, we will not keep the whole of our manpower, our formations, actually in being. But we need in reserve not just trained men but formations which, with only a few weeks' delay, can be made mobile and moved into action. In the third place we need a pool of trained men, not necessarily mobilised into formations, for reinforcement purposes. It is an unhappy fact that if formations are committed to war there will be casualties, and reinforcements are necessary to make them good. That requires a pool of trained manpower, although not necessarily in formations. In the fourth place we may need the machinery for general mobilisation of the whole of our Australian manpower. These things cannot be achieved all at once. That is obvious. We must tackle this step by step. The first steps are not necessarily the same as the final drive that we need to create. We do not run our motor cars on the self starter, but sometimes we need to use the self starter to get the engine going. So the first steps that we take may not be entirely the same as the final situation that we want to achieve. But when we take these first steps we must be sure that they do not get in the way of succeeding steps that we will have to take towards the creation of the force which we will need and which we must create before many years pass. Obviously, the first thing that we have to do is create an instructional corps which at some future stage will be able to handle a big intake of men for training. There is no need for me to elaborate that point. I have only to refer to the speech made in Hobart recently by the Minister for the Army (Dr. Forbes). He said thenI believe that he must have been speaking the truth-that we could not now take in men for training because that would disrupt our operational forces. This is how this speech was reported. He said that his advisors had spoken against bringing in large drafts now because that would impair the efficiency of our operational forces. The House must remember that we are now passing through a period where our semi-trained reserves are changing. Until fairly recently we had quite big reserves of manpower from the last war which would have been available to us. These men are now getting into the age group where they will not be of great use to us. We have to create immediately, without delay, an instructional corps to handle the new intake that is to come. As the Minister for the Army has said, we cannot handle this intake now. If we cannot handle it now, is it not obvious that unless we make great changes we could not handle it under the stress of war, when our present formations would be committed for operational purposes? This, surely, is obvious. Therefore, whatever else is done, without breaching the integrity of the operational forces an instructional corps must be created and this must be put in hand immediately. To some extent men for this corps could be got from volunteers and to some extent from over-age people who would not be available for operational duty. But whatever this corps entails, even if in the first stages-thi s thing must grow stage by stage-w e have to start with a small core to train the instructional corps, we must put this in hand, even if it means some small diminution of our operational strength in the next few months. Every month's delay in the formation of this corps is a crime against Australia. Next, we must expand the Australian Regular Army on a voluntary basis as fast as it is possible to do so. This can be done while the Australian Instructional Corps is going forward. Of course, we must encourage the Citizen Military Forces and the parallel concept of an emergency force which is proposed in the Bill before the House. That is a good and a valuable consonant. Then, looking ahead at the people who will be available to us in 1968 and 1969 -the y are young now-w e should be expanding our system of school cadet corps as soon as possible. This can be done without interfering with the other operations of the Army. There is no excuse for the present position where schools that want to expand their cadet corps are not allowed to do so. This is a quite intolerable thing which I am sure the Minister is in the process of changing. It is something which is so clear that I do not want to stress it any further. Those are the four steps that we must take immediately, here and now. Let me add to them perhaps a fifth step which is not quite co-ordinate. I refer to the preparation of the necessary register of manpower. I put this on one side because, although it is something that should be done and should be done immediately, it is not perhaps in the Minister's Department. Once we get this sort of plan under way we must then proceed to the second stage. We will need to conscript manpower in the young age groups. I do not see that we should be satisfied with a draft of less than rotation through both the Instructional Corps 20,000 a year-it may have to be moreand the length of service should not be less than two years. That means in point of fact that we would have a conscripted force of 40,000-that is, two years' intake -and every year, starting from three or four years from now, we would have an outgoing of 20,000 trained men available for some kind of reserve. There should be proper privileges for these men-heav y deferred pay, war service homes privileges, educational privileges, employment preferences and the other privileges which are given for the United States draft. I do not suggest for one moment that we should endeavour to penalise these people, but I do suggest that we must have them to build up A.R.A. numbers. Perhaps it will be said that we would not be able to deal with 20,000 in the first year. That may well be; but provided that the target is there and that the approach to it is as quick as is practicable, no complaint can be made. However, if the target is set too low or the progress towards it is too slow, then not only complaint but protest should be made in this House and elsewhere. The time has come to stopfiddlingwith this job. I have dealt with the first step of the second stage. Another step of the second stage should be to strip down the C.M.F. to an operational role which means, of course, cutting out from it all those people who are over-age or would be in reserved occupations during a war. The people who came out of compulsory training, and of course they would be attested for overseas service, could, if they wanted to so volunteer, join the C.M.F. I am sure that they would provide a ready force of volunteers to keep up the C.M.F. strength. Or if they do not volunteer for the C.M.F. they could go on to the trained reserve. The C.M.F. should be stripped down and made into operational formations on a local and territorial basis, with particular emphasis on the possibility of establishing units in country centres. This is to be encouraged. I will not have time to go into detailed measures, but the C.M.F. must be made a vital part of the scheme and, together with the remnants of the emergency force which is now being created, it must be the reserve of officers. There is no reason why from the enlarged Australian Regular Army in those future years there could not be some small and the C.M.F. so that, without breaching the integrity of the formation, we could make an army which could operate in a unified fashion. L*t me say that it might be a good thing if for training purposes, and more for training than for operational reasons, a number of these formations of the Regular Army were posted to northern stations. I think there is a great deal to be said for this. Of course, there is nothing to be said for dissipating our operational strength. Posting to northern stations would have to be done in accordance with a reasonable plan. It is no good spreading the butter very thin over a lot of bread, but there is, I believe, a case to be made out of putting some of our operational regular forces north in the future, when we have built up our present Regular Army and have an additional 40,000 people undergoing compulsory training every two years. I see no reason why this force in the north should not be used for some useful works. There are plenty of roads to be built; there are aerodromes to be constructed; there are irrigation and other works to be put in hand; and there seems to be no reason why a force which it is necessary to hold as an operational force should have to waste all its manpower without doing some useful work. We must, however, put our defence plans into operation without delay. Time runs against us and we must save all the time we can. Action should start now-it should start tomorrow-o n the Instructional Corps and the national register. I hope that both these projects will form part of the defence review which the Prime Minister has promised and which is to be undertaken, as I have said, within the next few days. Some of the matters I have suggested are not pleasant, but our situation is not pleasant. We may as well look the reality in the face. I do not for one moment suggest that all we have to do is to carry out these reforms on the Army manpower side. I have tried tonight to concentrate in a constructive way on this feature of what we have to do. If there is to be world disarmament with sanctions, well and good; nobody would be more for it than I . But unilateral disarmament is suicide for a people and those who advocate it are not being loyal to their responsibilities in this Parliament. I thank the House for having listened to me. [8.52] I think everybody will agree with a difference of 50 per cent, between the the statement of the honourable member for estimates-is it any wonder that we are Mackellar ( Mr Wentworth) that Australia's in such a hopeless and shocking defence state of defence does not present a very pretty picture. I wholeheartedly agree with him; it does not. The defence situation in Australia today presents a very tragic picture. It is a situation against which the people should protest in the most eloquent way possible, and on 5th December-no t very long from now-the y will have their opportunity to say what they think of the pitiful defence situation into which the Government has allowed the country to lapse after 15 solid years in office, with control of both Houses of the Parliament. There is no excuse for the situation in which we now find ourselves. The Government cannot offer one single reason for the existence of this situation, except its own apathy, indolence and refusal to face facts. It is good that the people will have the opportunity to weigh the views expressed by the honourable members for Mackellar, Chisholm( Sir Wilfrid Kent Hughes) and La Trobe( Mr Jess) against the views expressed by the Ministers who still sit back smugly content in the fond belief that all is well; that nothing needs to be done and that we are quite well protected with our present day equivalent of the antiquated Wirraway-the Canberra bomber. Let us have a look at the performance of the Canberra bomber before we go any further. This may not be generally known, but the people of Australia ought to know that our front line bomber, the Canberra, has a range of only 900 miles and can carry a bomb load of only 4,000 lb. lbs. That is 50 per cent, higher than the last official estimate that the Government gave of the carrying capacity of the Canberra bomber. This brings me to the point that we never know which Minister to believe, when we are given information about our defence preparedness. We do not know whether to believe the Minister for Air( Mr Howson), who says that the Canberra bomber will carry 6,000 lbs., or his predecessor, who said it will carry only 4,000 lbs.

128,Mr Clyde Cameron,"Well, 6,000position? But let us assume that the bomb load of the Canberra bomber is 6,000 lbs., or 50 per cent, more than the estimate of the previous Minister for Air. I want to compare the performance of the Canberra bomber with that of the Russian Badger bomber or TU16. The Badger has a range of 4,000 miles, compared with the range of 900 miles of the Canberra, and a bomb load of 7,000 lbs. compared with the bomb load of the Canberra of 4,000 lbs. or even 6,000 lbs., if we take the estimate given by the Minister for Air by way of interjection. The range of the Badger is more than four times greater than the range of the Canberra. The honourable member for Mackellar has told the Parliament that we really have only one thing to fear and that is Communism in Asia. I want him to reflect a little upon this subject of Communism, because before we deal with a complaint we ought to try to find out the cause of the complaint. It is far better to discover and eradicate the cause than to be content with merely tinkerflourishes is removed. Until we remove the ing with the effects. Communism in Asia does not come spontaneously to the Asian people. Communism in any Moslem country does not come easily to the Moslems. Communism in any country is a last resort grasped by a people desperate and determined to change the existing system. These people are so desperate that they say: "" AnyEuropean people are coming to an end, thing would be better than the rotten, corrupt and unjust system that we now have. Anything would be better than the degradation and poverty that is our lot under the present government."" If the honourable member for Mackellar and others like him really want to deal with Communism, let them grapple with the causes of Communism and, by removing the causes, so remove Communism for all time. I want to quote from a statement made in the House of Commons on 17th July of this year by the present Minister for Defence, Mr Denis Healey. He is reputed to be a right wing member of the party, honourable member had better relate his and I hope that this will please the honorremarks to the subject matter of the Bills. able member for Mackellar and make him more receptive to the views of the right honourable gentleman. Mr Denis Healey Mr Speaker.

He said that the conflicts arise from the political instability which was the inevitable consequence of the changes now sweeping the continents of Asia, Africa and even Latin America. Many of these had nothing to do with Communism. He said that they arise in some cases out of the legacy of imperialism and in other cases out of local power politics. He went on to say that this was certainly true of the conflict between Algeria and Morocco and the conflict in Ruanda between the Hutu and the Watutsi. It was true also of the conflict between the communities on Cyprus, and of tbe conflict between India and Pakistan over Kashmir. He said that Communism was not a major factor in any of these conflicts. Sir, it is true that Communism always takes every opportunity to exploit instability in any country. It is our job to see that the instability on which Communism feeds and political, economic, social and other forms of instability and injustice in the Asian countries, we will never succeed in defeating Communism. Communism will continue to grow and flourish. We have to face the fact that imperialism, colonialism and exploitation of the Asian people by the and the sooner we realise that, the quicker we might reach the stage when we can put forward an effective and permanent answer to the onrush of Communism in the Asian countries. There was no spontaneous liking for Communism by the Asian people.

130,Mr Clyde Cameron,"I am sorry,we have to accept your ruling. 1 am glad in a way, however, that you stopped me, Sir, because otherwise I might have been prevented from quoting what was said in the House of Representatives, in another debate on the subject of defence, by none other than the honourable member for La Trobe( Mr Jess), an honourable and gallant member of this Parliament who has a magnificent record in war and who is the son of a gentleman who also had a magnificent record in war. When one gets two men, father and son, endowed with both brains and bravery, it is a combination worth quoting. Let me quote to the Parliament and to the people of Australia-and let the people remember this on 5th December-wha t one of the most qualified men on the Government side has said about the defence of this country. He criticised the then Minister for Defence( Mr Townley) for seeing no difference in the defence situation in 1962 from the defence situation in 1959-60. He said that that Minister for Defence saw no difference in the situation in 1957. If the honourable member were making his speech tonight he could say that the present Minister for Defence (Senator Paltridge) sees no difference now from what he saw in 1962. On 25th October 1962, the honourable member for La Trobe saidHave we adequate defence preparedness and strength to meet the opposing forces in such an eventuality? He was referring to the possibility of meeting the forces of Indonesia. He said emphaticallyThe answer, in my opinion, is no. Remember, this was said by a Liberal member; not some Labour member, not some Communist, not some ratbag whose views can be disregarded, but one of the most responsible members of the Government side. The statement appears on page 1956 of ""Hansard"" of 25th October 1962, almost two years ago to the day. Then the honourable member went on to say-and I want honourable members to note this, because this is what a member of tlie Government side said about the Government's defence effortHave we comparative superiority of equipment? To balance the enemy's greater manpower. Have we comparative superiority in manpower or equipment? The answer to both questions must be no. We have no heavy guns, no guided missiles. Our Navy is not strong enough, our Air Force is not strong enough, and the numbers of our servicemen are most emphatically too few. This, I say again, was a statement by the Liberal member for La Trobe. He could have said more about our Navy, more about our Air Force, and he could have said much more about our Army than he did. The fact is that most of our admirals spend the greater part of their time parading around in their dress uniforms at cocktail parties. They are fighting all their naval engagements at cocktail parties, and some of them wear strange ear whiskers-mutto n chops. I think it is about time we cleaned out three quarters of the generals, admirals and air marshals in our defence forces and got a team of men who are less concerned with showing off to the ladies at cocktail parties and a little more concerned with getting this country's defences ready to protect us against a foreign invasion, should one come. ment. not finished yet; I am only coming to the best part of it. We have in this country defences which this Government has built up over 15 long dreary years by spending at the rate of £200 million a year of the taxpayers* money. We have one radar unit. Radar is one of the most important means of defence which it is possible to have in a defence system, but we have only one radar system, and it works only eight hours a day. It does not work on public holidays. It does not work after 5 p.m. or after the pubs close. It does not start until 9 a.m. It works a 40 hour week on a roster system. It shuts down at night and on Saturdays and Sundays. Anyone would think that the enemy intends to give us 24 hours notice and that when it does attack it will not attack at night, on a Sunday, on a public holiday or, above all, after the pubs close. This is the conceptthe thinking-that this Government exhibits on the question of defence. Let me remind the Parliament of another incident, and this relates to the effectiveness of our Air Force. Who will ever forget the occasion when a Tiger Moth ran amok at the Sydney airport. The authorities could not get it down, and as they thought it might be a danger to civilian aircraft a call went out for the Roj'al Australian Air Force to shoot it down. The Tiger Moth",83,Speaker Mr Tion Supported The Bill And Considered That
131,Mr Robinson,That is a shameful state,84,Speaker Mr Tion Supported The Bill And Considered That
132,Mr Clyde Cameron,"I s it? I havewas not manned. The Royal Australian Air Force, in all its full regalia and with all its dignity, took to the air and for almost an hour shot at this Tiger Moth. It did not get the Tiger Moth, which of it own accord fell into the sea when it ran out of petrol. This is the defence system that this country has. This is not funny. Government members ought not to be laughing at this tragic situation. They have no reason to laugh, yet on the hustings on 5th December they will have the hide to go before the people and pretend that they have done everything they can for the defence of this country. How much longer are we going to put up with this shilly-shallying on the part of the Government-thi s wicked waste of money, this wicked waste of the taxpayers' money?

He is not one this pathetic and indolent Government is who has had what we would regard as a allowed to continue in charge of the defence very responsible record in the field of of Australia.

134,Mr Clyde Cameron,"It was saidand of the Senate have resigned, been defeated or passed away. So perhaps about 150 of the present members of the Parliament have not been privileged to hear remarks on this subject made by the late Mr Eddie Ward, who was the previous member for East Sydney and who knew the honourable member for Mackellar particularly well and was well versed in his record in World War II . Mr Ward told the Parliament something of the rather irresponsible behaviour of the honourable member for Mackellar in the difficult and dangerous period of that war. The honourable member was at that time in the defence forces. He did not lack bravery. Let nobody suggest that he lacked bravery and that he did not want to fight. He did want to fight, and it was not his fault that him away to the Blue Mountains. he was not in the most dangerous area of combat during the war. The reason why he was not there cannot be ascribed to a lack of bravery. There were other reasons, but I shall not go into them now. I propose only to discuss the incident that led finally to his dismissal from the Army. It has been said that the honourable membe quite practicable about this. HereI ber was cashiered out of the Army. I think he has rejected that suggestion on two or three occasions. He was at least dismissed from the Army. The reason was that, in order to show that the defences of Australia in war time were not as good as he believed they ought to be, he set out to kidnap Sir Thomas Blarney, who was then Commander-in-Chief of the Australian Military Forces. I see that honourable memthousands of pounds to replace. The honbers are laughing. Everybody but the honororable member said: ""We are at war and able member laughed, too, when he set out on this rather harebrained scheme. All the heads of the defence forces laughed when the honourable member set out to show that the Commander-in-Chief of the Australian Military Forces, then General Sir Thomas Blarney, but later a Field Marshal, could be kidnapped, taken to the Blue Mountains and kepi on ice until the honourable member cht-se to release him. In short, the honourable member set out to do what was regarded as being impossible. Although lie warned the heads of the defence force* and of the Department of Defence whfft he intended to do, the fact remains that he succeeded in his mission. I am informed that he dressed his commandos as tramway men. They proceeded to a place in Sydney where tram crews changed shifts. The military commanders, knowing that a raid was to be made, were in readiness. They were waiting for commandos to arrive headed by the honourable member. The military commanders, laughing about the idea, concluded, when nothing was seen of the raiders, that they were not coming. The military men saw the tramway workers change shifts. The next thing those military men knew was that they were looking down the barrels of the guns of the honourable member's commandos, who, as I have said, were dressed as tramway men. So the honourable member and his troops took the post. They succeeded in making the Commander-in-Chief of the Australian Military Forces a prisoner and whisking One must be envious of the genius of the honourable member for Mackellar as exhibited in this episode. But he was not content with this. He wanted to show that any foreign force could land on our shores and blow up roads, bridges and all kinds of establishments. He wanted to come to the real reason why he was kicked out of the Army. In order to prove the practicability of what he envisaged, the honourable member decided to demonstrate that an enemy could have blown up a bridge on the Cronulla railway line. He succeeeded in making the demonstration in the most practical manner by actually blowing up the bridge, which cost some we have to teach the armed forces a lesson by hook or by crook, regardless of the expense"". Whether one can take much notice of what thc honourable member says about defence these days is a debatable point. He has a series of complaints about our defence. He says, first, that we need formations in being. We have not those formations. He says, secondly, that we need formations in reserve. We do not have them. He says, thirdly, that we need a pool of trained men for reinforcement purposes. We have not that pool of trained men for reinforcements. This is important, because the honourable member's plan will require a lot of reinforcements. He would begin by undertaking the simple task of denuclearising China. He will need quite is that by hook or by crook we must get a few reinforcements for that-probabl y at into a war before he is too old to enjoy it. least one million men.

He complains that we they have nothing with which to fight a have not enough trained men to provide war. Some honourable members opposite, such reinforcements. He says fourthly, who know they will not be personally inthat we need the machinery for general volved in a war, are doing their level best mobilisation of the whole of our manpower. to get Australia into another war, which In this, he is perhaps getting closer to could be the last war anybody will fight. what the Government's future policy will They have nothing with which to protect be. He says, fifthly, that we need an in this country or with which to fight a war, structional corps to handle the intake of but they are doing their level best to get recruits. The honourable member says, sixthly, that if we cannot get the men voluntarily we have to envisage the use of conscription. I am glad to see that he apparently approves my stating his view on that matter. He says that we need to conscript into the Army no fewer than 10,000 young men eaoh year and that they must serve for two years. So, after four years, we shall have trained 40,000 men in this way. That is all very well. The trouble with conscription is this: We all have our liberty and our freedom. We all have our love of democratic principles and of the British freedoms that we enjoy. But some have more than that. Some have enormous investments totalling millions of pounds. If the conscription proposed by the honourable member follows the pattern that his predecessrs have always implemented, we shall find that those who are conscripted into the forces will not be the sons of the rich and powerful members of this community. They will be the sons of working men who do not know members of Parliament to whom they can appeal for help in keeping their sons out of the forces or influential members in the government of the day who can pull strings to see that young men are kept out of the forces. We should not talk about conscription as though war is absolutely inevitable. The best defence experts are those who can evolve some method of preventing war, not those who think war is inevitable. Nobody could question the bravery of the honourable member for Mackellar. He was probably the most disappointed man in Australia when he could not get behind a machine gun and shoot at somebody wearing a red beret. If he could have done that he would have been happy.

I want peace. I advocate policies that will keep the Australian people peaceful and free. I wish to refer briefly to a few matters covered by the Bill.

139,Mr Sinclair (New England) [9.23],"to be a member of a House in which one of the leading spokesmen for the Opposition could make a vindictive attack on the serving omcers of the Australian armed forces. He alleged that they had nothing better to do than attend cocktail parties and enjoy the frivolities of life. I was one of the memfor by not having continually to re-equip bers of the Government Parties Defence Committee who attended the exercise "" Long Shot"". Taking part in the exercise were quite a number of men of whom any Australian could justifiably be proud. Many of the officers who served in theatres of war and who have served in the Services since the war ended would have been only too proud to have served with the men I saw taking part in exercise "" Long Shot"". These are the men whom the honourable member for Hindmarsh has attacked tonight. These are the senior officers who determine the effectiveness of our armed forces. These are the men who very effectively displayed in exercise "" Long Shot"" something of the preparedness of the Australian Army, Navy and Air Force. I do not want to stray beyond the bounds of this Bill. I do not want to go into the ambit of political and strategic defence possibilities, because I , like many other honourable members, am looking forward to the defence review which I hope will be announced in the next fortnight. I think we should examine the legislation now before us to see to what extent it achieves modifications in our present state of preparedness. FirstI would like to mention the gratuity payments that are to be made to members of the Emergency Reserve. In his second-reading speech in another place the Minister for Defence (Senator Paltridge) said that members of the Emergency Reserve would be paid a special bounty of £100 for the first year of service, rising by £25 each year to £175 in the fourth and subsequent years. I think a similar gratuity could well be paid to members of the Citizen Military Forces. I know that members of the C.M.F. are not taxed on their pay and that they enjoy other incentives, but they still give of their valued time. They still sacrifice time that would otherwise be spent in leisure activities or in work. I think we should give them further incentives to spend their time in training. One such incentive is a financial incentive. I understand that it costs about £100 to equip a member of the C.M.F. If it costs so much surely it it worthwhile encouraging some stability within the C.M.F. We know of the rate of turnover in the C.M.F. and if we could get men to stay longer in the force any incentive given to them would be more than compensated newly enrolled personnel. I come now to the provisions in the legislation relating to re-employment of men. One of the problems as far as the C.M.F. personnel and members of the Emergency Reserve are concerned is that these people must leave their employers* businesses. The honourable member for Calare( Mr England) referred to this matter and said that he was concerned that small shopkeepers, farmers and other employers might be unduly penalised if their employees joined the force. The legislation provides for penalities to be imposed on employers who do not re-employ former employees who have served in the Emergency Reserve for a period, but the penalties are not very severe. One of the problems associated with this matter is that we are providing a penalty; we are not providing an incentive. Employers should be offered something to induce them to encourage their employees to join the Emergency Reserve. You do not induce employers to encourage their employees to join the armed forces by threatening them with penalties, as you are in this instance. I think there is a case here for giving employers some tax incentive to induce them to encourage their employees to join the Reserve. If this were done the employer may feel that any loss of production that he suffers is offset to some extent by his taxation concession. I know that it would be hard to assess a reasonable tax concession, but having regard to the loss of production suffered by an employer as a result of his employee leaving him, I think some proportionate concession could be worked out to encourage employers to allow their men to go away. I should like to refer now to the provisions relating to superannuation of men who join the Emergency Reserve. Proposed new section 132 (7.) provides that if a man is absent in the Emergency Reserve for a period of time and is re-employed later by his employer, provided that within one month of the expiration of the period of absence on defence service he makes to his superannuation fund or its equivalent, the contribution he would have been required (o make if he had not been absent during that period, he is entitled to continue within honourable member for Indi( Mr Holten) the ambit of the fund. I think this is a very fair provision, but one aspect of it which concerns is the wording "" within one month pf the expiration of the period of absence "". It seems to me that it would be more rational to make it within one month of his re-employment. No doubt, if a man has been serving overseas, as it is envisaged he could well do during his period of defence service, then, when he comes back home he is quite likely to want to spend a week or a month with his family. He might want to go to the beach or anywhere else before returning to employment. Therefore, I think that there is a case for some variation of this provision. I should like the Minister to look at this point and see whether it is possible to amend the bill to the wording that I have suggested. Another aspect that concerns me is the of this country. fact that there is no mention of any payment into the superannuation fund on behalf of the employer. As honourable members will know from the debate on the measure that passed through the House yesterday, most superannuation schemes provide for payment not only by the employee but also by the employer. These moneys are contributed to a fund which earns interest, and out of which superannuation benefits are paid. If a man has been away on north. I cannot accept the opinion of the emergency service, provision is made for honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr the payment of his contributions, but there Clyde Cameron) who, as I understand his is no provision for the payment of the argument, sees in the instability of South employer's contribution. I suggest that this East Asia, no reason to fear the expansion might well be paid by the Commonwealth of Communism. As I understand his arguGovernment. I do not see that there is any ment, he sees no problems for the future cause to penalise the employer but no more safety of Australia arising from the inroads do I see that there is a cause to prejudice being made into South East Asia by Comthe benefits to which the employee might munism. He quoted Mr Denis Healey as otherwise be entitled if the superannuation having said that political instability resultcontributions had run their normal course. ing from the exercise of power politics For that reason I think there is a case creates conditions in which Communism for some reconsideration by the Minister thrives. Surely the honourable member does for the Army (Dr. Forbes). Perhaps when not deny that these conditions exist in our he is gazetting the regulations providing for near north today. Surely he does not deny the special bounties he could include prothat this is the situation which necessitates vision for superannuation payments by the the review that is presently being made of Commonwealth Government on behalf of our armed forces. I feel that this assessthe employer upon the return of thc ment has been rightly seen by the honoremployee from emergency service. There are many things related to the Emergency Reserve and the Citizen Military Force that should be considered, and I was very glad indeed to hear the refer this afternoon to the payment of a subsidy on rifle ammunition. I know that, unfortunately, with the re-equipment of our armed forces, this is something which is going out of date, but I feel that from the men in the bush who in the past have belonged to rifle associations, we have had some of the most valuable recruits into the armed forces in times of national emergency. I think that a tremendous amount can be achieved in the future through rifle clubs in training men adequately, sufficiently, wisely and efficiently to use arms. I suggest there is a very sound case for continued contributions by the Commonwealth Government towards the provision of .303 ammunition so that rifle clubs may continue to play a very effective part in providing these men for possible future recruitment into the armed forces There are many aspects of defence that one could cover. I do not wish to canvass them all. I hope that they will be covered in the defence review which will be submitted, I hope, in the near future. The honourable member for Mackellar ( Mr Wentworth) has made a very accurate assessment of the tactical situation in the able member for Mackellar as being related mainly to the spread of militant Communism in our near north. As I understand the argument, this was the point of difference between the honourable member for Hindmarsh and the honourable member for Mackellar. It is this problem of the spread of militant Communism that constitutes our biggest hurdle in the future. As the Prime Minister rightly saidThe choice remains today as It has stood for soldiers who have been trained, who have years. We can have either the peace of defended served for a period and become experienced, freedom or the peace of submission. I , for one, prefer the peace of defended freedom. Army) [9.36],-in reply-The honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr No matter how big the Regular army Clyde Cameron), as usual, reduced what had been, generally speaking, a most constructive and useful debate, to a farce. The honourable member for New England( Mr Sinclair) restored it to its former level. The debate has ranged over a wide field. My colleagues, the other Service Ministers and I , have found many of the contributions in the wider field most valuable; but, in closing the debate, I do not intend to canvass those wider considerations. I would, however, like to mention one or two things which were raised specifically in relation to the Bill by honourable members. In general terms, it has been said by many honourable members, helpfully on this side of the House but destructively on the other side of the House, that the measures which are to be implemented as a result of this Bill are not a complete answer to what they see our defence problems to be. My reply to that is that they are not intended to be the complete answer. They were never intended to be the complete answer. It was never intended that this Bill would in any way represent the Government's answer to the current assessment of defence problems. Nor is it intended to be a substitute for other measures which may emerge from the defence review. But the major provisions contained in this legislation are important in their own right; they are measures which needed to be undertaken and which should be undertaken irrespective of anything else that we may do. In effect, they are measures which increase our capacity to respond to a situation that we may face. They increase our overall defence potential. However big a Regular Army we have, we will stiU have need for something like the Regular Army Emergency Reserve. There are always gaps to be filled in the Army. There is always a requirement for more reinforcements. There is always a need, particularly in a country like this, to make the most economical use of whatever manpower is available. To take regular and re-use their services in a time in which we require manpower quickly, seems to me the most effective way of using Australia's scarcest resources-manpower . becomes we will always need the Citizen Military Forces or something like them. As I have said before, the Army does not consist simply of the Australian Regular Army. In a great deal of the discussion one hears on this subject it appears to be assumed that our Army consists only of the Regular Army. We have one Army, which comprises a relatively small and readily available section, which is the Regular Army, and comprises also the Citizen Military Forces. The two together make up the AustraUan Army, and we refer to tbe two combined as the Australian Army. The role of the A.R.A. is to provide a readily available force. The role of the C.M.F. is to provide follow-up units. The advantage of this concept of the C.M.F. being available in times of defence emergency is that it gives the concept of one army consisting of a readily avaUable section and follow-up units real meaning in today's situation, in this period when the situation to our north appears almost uniformly grey instead of in sharply defined blacks and whites. This concept is important, therefore, irrespective of the effect on the C.M.F. in terms of manpower. The honourable member for Yarra (Dr. J. F. Cairns) tried to suggest earUer that the only criterion one can adopt in judging this measure is the effect it may have on the size of the C.M.F. The measure is important irrespective of this consideration because it gives the concept of the C.M.F. as a follow-up force in this one army real meaning in today's situation. We are optimistic, however, and we hope that by giving the C.M.F. a real sense of purpose, unlike anything it has ever had before, we",87,Speaker Mr Tion Supported The Bill And Considered That
140,Dr. Forbes (Barker,"Minister for thewill succeed not only in increasing the numbers of the C.M.F. but also in inducing people in the C.M.F. to serve for longer periods. The honourable member for Batman( Mr be amended and he found that there did Benson) raised a number of questions concerning service in the Regular Army Emergency Reserve and the C.M.F. He asked me whether 1 would do my best to provide a satisfactory answer to the questions he asked. He wanted to know the situation regarding medical and dental treatment for members of the Emergency Reserve and the C.M.F. The answer is that provisions relating to pay, medical and dental treatment and hospitalisation will be found in the regulations that will be made under the Act. But, in brief, members of the Regular Army Emergency Reserve, the Regular Army Reserve and the C.M.F. when called out for full time service will be treated in exactly the same way as members of the A.R.A. If members of the Emergency Reserve or the Regular Army Reserve or the C.M.F. serve overseas they will have exactly the same cover under the Repatriation Act as members of the Australian Regular Army. To deal with another point raised by the honourable gentleman: If members of these bodies on full time duty are killed or injured in Australia they will be covered under the CommonweaUh Employees' Compensation Act in the same way as members of the A.R.A. Any member who is absent from duty due to illness or injury can remain hospitalised-thi s was the point raised by the honourable member for Batman-for six months on full pay. But where the injury or illness is attributable to service the period is 12 months. In special cases, such as those in which skin or bone grafts are involved, the period may be extended for a further six months. The last point raised by the honourable member concerned widows of members of the Emergency Reserve, the Regular Army Reserve or the C.M.F. on full time service. They will have the same benefits as widows of members of the Australian Regular Army. The only difference between them and widows of members of the A.R.A. is that the latter widows will have the additional benefits provided under the Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Act for which members of the A.R.A. contribute and members of the other three bodies do not. The honourable member for La Trobe( Mr Jess) raised the question of officers' resignations. He said that he had studied the terms of section 17 as it is proposed to not appear to be very much difference between the situation that had existed previously and the situation that will exist. As I said in my second reading speech, I believe that there will be a considerable difference. Although an officer will not be given an absolute right to resign at willand obviously this right cannot be granted having regard to the nature of service in the forces-the new provisions will give a great deal more certainty to officers in the Regular Army in particular. I am led to that conclusion by the terms of the Military Board instruction that it is proposed to issue following the enactment of this legislation. This instruction will give an interpretation of the new section 17 to the officer corps in the Army. For the benefit of the honourable member and the HouseI would like to read a section of this proposed instruction. It readsIn determining the advice it That is, the Boardwill tender to the Governor General or in making its decision, as appropriate, the Military Board will be guided by the expectation that officers appointed to permanent commissions will have sought such commissions with the intention of making the Army their career and that short service commissioned omcers will normally complete the period of their engagement. Then follows the important partIt is not the desire of the Military Board to hold officers unwillingly in the Service, and every application to resign will receive sympathetic consideration on its merits. The Board has the duty however to maintain the Army at a high level of efficiency having regard to its operational needs which must be paramount. In such circumstances that operational needs would be seriously prejudiced the Board will not recommend acceptance of resignations until the services of the officers concerned can be spared. I emphasise the words "" can be spared "". It has been suggested that one of the effects of the current resignation policy of the Board is that officers are committed to a period of servitude for life. This has never been so and it is quite obviously not so under this Military Board interpretation of the new section 17 of the Act. The honourable member for Calare( Mr England) raised the matter of adrninistrative problems which could be caused by the multiplication, of forces in the Army. One can admit that this is a problem, but I think think that the answer to this question lies that if the honourable member looks at proposed section 49 he will find that the provision that members of the Reserve forces will in most cases be to all intents and purposes regarded as members of the Regular Army Supplement when called up for full time service will clear away many of the difficulties that he envisages through World War. This is not so. The people who the multiplication of these forces. The honourable member also asked what was the Regular Army Supplement and whether it was a new thing. The Regular Army Supplement is a new name for a body that has existed since 1948 and which until now has been known as the Australian Regular Special Reserve. This never was a reserve in the true sense of the word because be an experienced soldier. The Emergency all members of this body served during their period on the Regular Army Special Reserve as full time members of the Army. With the possibility of confusion with the new Regular Army Emergency Reserve, the opportunity was taken quite recently to change its name to a more appropriate one, the Regular Army Supplement which, briefly, is divided into a number of parts. One part comprises soldiers ineligible for service in the Australian Regular Army because of age and/or a temporary medical classification. Another part is comprised of soldiers enlisted for a special task of unknown duration. By far the largest part of this Supplement is comprised of soldiers in all respects elegible for enlistment in the A.R.A. but initially for three years only. The honourable member also asked whether and agreed to. present members of the C.M.F. have all given an undertaking for overseas service. The answer to that question is "" Yes "". A specific question raised by honourable members in relation to this particular Bill was mentioned by the honourable member for Hughes( Mr L. R. Johnson). Before answering the point he made, I would like to say how much I deprecate the gratuitous insults he levelled at one of thefinestbody of troops in the world, the Pacific Islands Regiment. AllI hope is that some day that regiment finds the honourable member on a dark night. The honourable member for Hughes in a very constructive and responsible moment asked why could not we enlist less experienced men into the Regular Army Emergency Reserve at this stage. I in tbe purpose of the Reserve. We must have people with a considerable body of training behind them. In his remarks, the honourable member for Hughes almost gave the impression that the people who are to be enlisted in the Regular Army Emergency Reserve are people who served in the Second enlist in the Regular Army Emergency Reserve could be quite young soldiers. A soldier who, for instance, enlisted at thc age of 17 and left the Army at the end of his first six years engagement at which time he would be 23, would be a well trained and experienced soldier. In order to fulfil the intentions for which the Emergency Reserve is designed, the person enlisting must Reserve is not a body to take in inexperienced people and to train them. Finally* the honourable member for New England raised the question of the employers' contributions. I would like to inform the honourable member that this matter was carefully considered by the Government and a deliberate decision was made to include the clause in the Bill as it is actually included. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. In Committee. Clauses1 to 7-by leave-take n together, Clause 8. Section ten of the Principal Act is repealed and the following sections are inserted in its stead:"" 10c -(I. ) The Governor General may delegate to the Military Board or to an officer of the Military Forces any of the powers to appoint and promote omcers of the Military Forces conferred upon him by sections ten and ten B of this Act. ""(2.) A delegation under this section may be made applicable to appointments or promotions of officers(a) to specified ranks; (b) in a specified part of the Military Forces; or (c) to ranks of a specified kind. t Army) [9.55] I moveOmit sub-section (2.) of proposed section 10c, lieutenant-commander in the Navy or a insert the following sub-section:"" ' (2.)

I of officers to specified ranks or to ranks of a specified kind and either in the Military Forces would suggest that the Minister look into generally or in a specified part of the Military this matter. Forces."". This is a simple amendment designed to clarify the intention of the proposed section 10c. Strictly interpreted, it appears that sub-section (2.) of the proposed section 10c would enable the Governor General to delegate power to make appointments or promotions of the nature indicated by paragraph (a), paragraph (b), or paragraph (c), but would not, as originally drafted, enable the delegation of power to make appointments or promotions of a nature indicated by more than one of those paragraphs in combination. For example, under proposed section 10c as it appears in the BiU, the Governor General would not have been enabled to delegate his power to make appointment, say, to the rank of lieutenant in the Regular Army Supplement-that is, to a specified rank in a specified part of the Military Forces. Again, the power to promote might be delegated but the delegation would have been restricted to the power to promote to, say, the ranks of lieutenant and temporary captain in the Citizen Military Forces. It was the intention that authority be given for the making of delegations of this nature and, accordingly, the sub-section has been refrained to make the intention quite clear. would like the Minister for the Army to explain a little more clearly, if possible, the amendment which he has just introduced. As the Minister knows, members of the Citizen Military Forces are paid only what js called the ""on promotion"" rate. That is the minimum rate for the particular rank held, no matter how long the rank has been held. Is it proposed to adopt the same policy for the Regular Army Emergency Reserve, or is it intended to encourage suitably qualified members of the Citizen Military Forces to join the Regular Army Emergency Reserve by allowing them seniority in the Reserve equivalent to the seniority that they held in the C.M.F.? I think the Minister understands that an Military Forces could have been a captain in the Army, respectively, for X Dr. Forbes -You refer to seniority pay? what I mean. These persons receive seniority pay. In the C.M.F., that does not apply. I think this matter is something which is worthwhile looking into because, as I understand it, the main idea of this Bill is to put this Regular Army Emergency Reserve on a smilar footing to that of the permanent forces. If this is the case, I think the Minister will Teadily understand the point I have made and bring these conditions into line with those that apply in the permanent forces. The Minister for Defence (Senator Paltridge) speaking in another place when this Bill was originated spoke of protecting the rights of men joining this Reserve. He saidAn important part of the Defence Bill which will apply to the three Services is that part which deals with the safeguarding of the civil employment rights of members of the Reserves and Citizen Forces. The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN ( Mr Failes) -Order! Is the honourable member referring to a debate in another place? clause 8? to clause 8. The rights of these people should be safeguarded.

151,Dr. Forbes (Barker,"Minister for thewere committed to serve overseas only in time of war. Tbeir conditions will be changed considerably now in respect of a time of defence emergency. That is why we believe it is important that they be given this consideration. I point out from a practical point of come into effect from the date on which view that the Minister for Defence (Senator this Bill receives the royal assent-requirin g Paltridge) gave notice of the proposed commanding officers to arrange for the changes in the conditions governing service personal notification of the changes to each in the C.M.F. in June last, and that the member of their units. A record is to be Government is not aware of any protests kept of compliance with this direction. from members of the C.M.F. concerning Because of variations in local circumstances, these changes. Indeed, the changes appear a common procedure cannot be adopted to have met with universal approval. Memfor all units, but each member of the bers of the C.M.F. are all active members C.M.F. will be contacted personally and of units and, therefore, are in constant notified within the 30 days laid down in touch with their units. That is one thing the legislation. that we can say with certainty under these conditions. It is possible, therefore, to undertake that the changed conditions of service will be brought to the notice of each serving member of the C.M.F. The position under the Bill as it stands is that members of the C.M.F. can opt out within 30 days of the Bill becoming law, and that except in time of war or defence emergency they can claim their discharge under clause 20 of the Bill by giving three months' notice. As anybody who has been associated with the C.M.F. will know, members are seldom required to serve for those three months. In most circumstances they can be discharged on application. So the two year engagement of a member of the C.M.F. means very little. If any member of the C.M.F., through ignorance, fails to exercise his right to opt out, his case can be dealt with on its merits. There is little doubt that, if a member failed to exercise his option, he could take his discharge almost immediately. In any event, members are engaged for periods of two years at a time. Therefore, at the end of that term they are discharged unless at that time or earlier they elect to re-engage. Summarising the position, I say that soldiers are given the right to opt out; but, in any event, they have, in effect, the right to re-enlist by eleoting to re-engage at the end of their terms. That being the position, port-by leave-adopted . it is quite unrealistic to require each member of the C.M.F. to sign a piece of paper indicating that he is willing to serve under the changed conditions. That would involve the processing of about 27,630 pieces of leave-rea d a third time. paper and would create an unnecessary and unacceptable administrative burden. In case any honourable members are worried about this matter, I would add that directions already have been issued from Army Headquarters to the commands-to Question resolved in the negative. Clause agreed to. Mr Temporary Chairman, on a possible provision. It may not be possible to move such a motion within the framework of this Bill, but the Opposition desires that a new provision be added to provide for the extension of all benefits under the Repatriation Act to members of the Citizen Military Forces for all disabilities incurred on service in Australia.

The existing bounty provision expired on 30th September 1964. The Minister said that the reason for the extension of the bounty provisions, which I think have been running for about two years, is that the Tariff Board, which has before it a reference in respect of the copper and brass strip industry, has not had sufficient time to complete its investigations. We have been informed that unforeseen complications, largely due to fluctuations in the price of copper on world markets, have necessarily delayed the Tariff Board in its investigation into whether the bounty should be extended for a substantial period. This Bill, if enacted, will extend the existing bounty provisions for a period of six months until 31st March 1965, unless for some reason it is found that the bounty can be terminated at an earlier date.

159,Mr Pollard (Lalor) [10.18],"Th etermination can be implemented by a proclamation issued under the Act. The copper and brass strip industry is of substantial importance to Australia. I understand that, in the main, copper and brass, in sheet, strip and foil forms, are used in interna] combustion engines or in association with other types of power plant. In his second reading speech, the Minister for Housing said that copper and brass strip is used in heat exchanger units of the types used with internal combustion engines. I have some idea of what such a heat exchanger unit is, but I am not sure that my idea is correct. I think the Parliament should be given a more explicit and more easily understood description in a second reading speech. Possibly, if we read the report of the Tariff Board we will find a clearer description of a heat exchanger unit of the type used with internal combustion engines. I ask the Minister to give a simple explanation of a heat exchanger unit. member is right. would heat water and the water would pass mean.

A farmer with the practical knowledge and studious habits of the honourable member for Wakefield ( Mr Kelly) would know almost instantly or would reach a fairly shrewd conclusion. In passing, I express the hope that somebody, somewhere, at some time, will take note of what I have said. It is quite true that we get remarkably good reports from the Tariff Board from time to time, but these reports seldom reach the general public. They are seen only by people who are immediately associated with the industry concerned. The general public should be told and should have included in ""Hansard"" some concise explanation of these technical expressions. Let me give another illustration. In Tariff Board reports and indeed in the second reading speeches of The ordinary members of the public have in future, without the elaboration being unduly tedious.

Housing) [10.28] -in replyI am a simple and ordinary fellow, like the honourable member for Lalor( Mr Pollard). We probably have this in common, although as a politician he may be older and much trickier than I am. He has asked for an explanation of the expression "" heat exchanger units of the types used with internal combustion engines"". I must admit that I speak subject to correction by greater authority but I understand that this expression means a radiator. As I understand the process, in most cases the heat of an internal combustion engine is transferred to water, which it then passes through ihe radiator. Copper being an extremely good conductor, the heat of the water is exchanged with the coolness of the air. The intervention of copper is necessary, because it is not easy to exchange the cool of the air with the heat of the water unless the water is suitably contained. The water, having been cooled in that process, goes back to the internal combustion engine where it takes on further heat, a further exchange ensues and the process continues. I hope that this will prove to be a satisfactory explanation. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Message from the Governor General recommending appropriation announced.

The matter that I should like to bring before this Parliament now relates to the Boeing 727 aircraft which have recently arrived in Australia from America, one for Trans-Australia Airlines and the other for Ansett-A.N.A. On Tuesday of this week a question was asked by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Calwell) of the Prime Minister( Sir Robert Menzies) about the customs duty to be paid on these aircraft. The Prime Minister replied that he did not know anything about the matter but that he would probably look into it. Last Thursday, 21st October, in the Senate, Senator O'Byrne also asked a question of the Minister for Civil Aviation (Senator Henty) about the customs duty. member will put himself out of order.

174,Mr Devine,"Very good, Mrthis matter was being considered. May I ask what is to be considered? If customs duty is due on these aircraft it should be paid irrespective of who is involved. I now say that Ansett has refused to pay this customs duty on his plane and has informed the Government that he has no intention of paying it. He let the Government know that if his aircraft did not fly in Australia then, under the Airlines Agreement Act T.A.A. could not fly its aircraft, and consequently both aircraft would have to stay on the tarmac. T.A.A. had forwarded a cheque to the Department of Customs and Excise for the duty on its aircraft. When Ansett told the Government that he was not going to pay the customs duty, the Department refunded the cheque to T.A.A. Why should preference once again be given to Ansett? If his company is permitted, without challenge, not to pay, why should not other industries such as General Motors-Holden's Pty. Ltd., Broken Hill Pty. Co. Ltd., Blue Metal Industries, W. D. & H. O. Wills (Aust.) Ltd., and small enterprises have the same concession? Why should this Government be the fairy godmother to Ansett? At the present time subsidies worth about £300,000 annually are paid to his organisation. The customs duty that has been waived amounts to £225,000. Another Boeing 727 for Ansett is due in about a week or so, and before June of next year a third Boeing 727 will be landed here for him. The non-payment of customs duty will mean that in this financial year almost £750,000 will have been returned to Ansett-A.N.A., making the total subsidy for thefinancialyear over £1 million. If the Government allows this to go on it will be a public scandal which should be stopped. People in the streets are talking. for permission to transport goods by air They are asking questions. They want to know what hold the Ansett organisation has over the Government. Recently, after an adverse ruling of the High Court, Ansett waved his wand and' this Government introduced airline regulations to take over intraassist other industries without giving the state air routes against the wishes of State Governments and against the will of the people who had expressed their rejection of the principle at a referendum. When a government does this for one industry, or for the facelessfinancierswho support this Government, it is natural that people will exchange innuendoes. Recently, when R. W. Miller and Co. Pty. Ltd. was attempting to enter the oil tanker trade on the Australian coast and to give employment to Australian seamen under Australian conditions in opposition to the oil cartels, all manner of obstacles were thrown in its path. By whom? We do not know; only the Government, its supporters or someone instructing the Government knows. Miller was not allowed to import tankers free of duty. He was made to put up hugefinancialbonds as an earnest that he would build tankers in Australia. I wonder what would have happened if the ""golden colt"" had thought of importing tankers. Would he have had the same barriers to overcome? Earlier this year T.A.A. wanted to operate three special Viscount aircraft between Adelaide and Perth. Mr Ansett objected to TA.A.'s proposal and on 4th July he sent a telegram objecting to theflights.The result was another victory to Ansett; no flights. Honourable members should note that here we have a private enterprise company objecting to a Government enterprise expanding a service which would benefit the country. In Austraha today ciyil aviation is not controlled by the Government but by one man, Reg Ansett, who has been favourably treated by this Government for many years by means of its financial support. He controls not only his own company, but under the Airlines Agreement Act, he has a large say about what T.A.A. can do. If T.A.A. wanted to change the cream in its coffee and Ansett objected there would be no change. The Interstate Parcel Express Co. Ltd. is another Australian company running in competition with Ansett Industries. It has made representations to the Government between States, but up to the present time its request has been rejected. Why? Because the Government does not like to see Ansett facing any competition. I feel that it is up to this Government to do something to major share of its support to one industry. The financial documents of the Ansett interests should be produced in this Parliament and should be laid on the table of the House for members to peruse so that they can see whether fhe subsidies which are paid to Ansett Transport Industries Ltd. are warranted. There ought also to be a royal commission into favours which are being channelled through Ansett to great companies which return favours by way of large contributions to the funds of the Liberal Party. During the time that I have been in this House, whatever other feelings I may have shown I have not complained about anything that may be said about me by any honourable member opposite, and I do not want to disturb that reputation in any way. However, I want to refer to two speeches that were made in this House last night, one coming from the honourable member for Oxley( Mr Hayden) and the other, which I heard, coming from the honourable member for Yarra (Dr. J. F. Cairns). I promptly describe both speeches as representing a conspicuous combination of humbug, wicked falsehood and character daubing. Is the honourable member in order in discussing during the debate on the motion for the adjournment of the House this evening speeches made during the debate on the motion for the adjournment of the House yesterday? -The honourable member for Moreton is in order. In fact, I think, he was invited to do what he is doing. benefit of one of the new young pretenders who rose last night, I described what had been said as character daubing. In all these three fields-humbug, falsehood and character daubing-bot h the honourable member for Oxley and the honourable member for Yarra are skilled and experienced practitioners. It is not concern for the survival of my own character that prompts me to speak this evening. I am so bold as to say that, in any company in this country, I will put my character against that of the honourable member for Yarra and that of the honourable member for Oxley. The gravamen of the charge made by these two individuals last evening was that I had had some unwholesome association with an organisation known as the Australian League of Rights and its Director, Mr E. D. Butler. I want to make three points quite clearly so that even the petrified minds of these two honourable members may be able to comprehend them. First, I have never been a member of this organisation. Secondly, I am not a member of it. Thirdly, this much vaunted association that both of them so trenchantly purported to describe to the House last evening can be spelt out by activities in three fields. I have given papers to two public seminars organised by the Australian League of Rights. One related to Communism. I venture to say that I would present similar papers before any audience arranged by the honourable member for Yarra. But I think that some controversy would be aroused if I presented such papers before any audience gathered by him. The second way in which I was associated with the League of Rights was in the presentation of a paper about the Commonwealth of Nations. The third field of activity related to a public subscription that was opened to enable me to go to England to undertake a lecture campaign. That is the full extent of my association with the League. I hope that the two honourable members, even with the sense of their extreme limitations, can understand that. The more substantial charge that was levelled at me so recklessly and so infamously by these two honourable gentlemen was that I had been associated with antiSemitic activities. I repudiate this charge in the plainest of language, Sir, and say to all in this House and outside it that I dissociate myself completely from any thought of engaging in anti-Semitic activities. Let us look at tbe curious methods that were employed by these two ex-policemen opposite-poo r samples of police forces, I am bound to say. For my part, rather than submit to their methods, I would submit happily to the charming of a voluntary confession out of me by the honourable member for Hunter( Mr James). Let us look at an example of the statements made last night by the honourable member for Oxley. Referring to me, he said. . . one statement that he made in connection with the partition of Israel, and which strongly supported the views of these anti-Semitic people . . . This is the sort of thing that is done under the general kind of umbrella statement:",98,Adjournment

Apart from that aspect I was very impressed with the honourable member's speech. graphs showing the honourable member for Who said that? It was said by the former Leader of Her Majesty's Opposition in this Parliament, the Rt. Hon. Dr. H. V. Evatt. Will the honourable member for Oxley now say that the former right honourable member for Barton had anti-Semitic views? The honourable member exhibits a curious logic. Let us now move to the European Common Market issue, which was the second matter raised by the honourable gentleman. He has concluded that, because I happened to agree with the views of an organisation concerning the Common Market, I agree with all its views. May I remind him that, one evening, in this chamber, the honourable member for Yarra walked across the floor, in the full gaze of every member present, and congratulated me on my statement of my views on the Common Market. May the Lord protect me should the day ever come when I agree with all the views of the honourable member for Yarra. But let me take the honourable member for Oxley a little further and tell him that two Labour Ministers in the new United Kingdom Government, the Rt. Hon. Barbara Castle and the Rt. Hon. Douglas Jay, shared platforms with me. On this side of the table, now pouring a glass of water, I see the South Australian clown, the honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr Clyde Cameron). Let me tell him that I want no fluoride at all. Mr Clyde Cameron Mr Speaker, I take a point of order. I ask that this unprovoked and unjustified slur be withdrawn. member for Moreton must not reflect on another honourable member. member to withdraw the remark that he made. Mr Clyde Cameron -May I suggest Oxley in company with odd and peculiar individuals taking part in a peace march in Queensland, but I would not deduce from this that he is necessarily deeply involved. I now pass to the honourable member for Yarra, Mr Speaker. I simply say that the statements that he made last evening overwhelmingly force me to conclude that his mind is completely ingrown. He has a sense of justice similar to that of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Whitlam), which I shall reveal. I shall do so hurriedly, because time is short. When the Deputy Leader of the Opposition was in Brisbane a few weeks ago, he described me as being on the extreme right wing of the Liberal Party of Australia. When he was asked about the honourable member for Yarra, he said: "" He is not on the left wing of the Australian Labour Party. I dislike the terms ' left wing' and ' right wing' when it comes to the Labour Party."" The Deputy Leader of the Opposition, of course, suffers from the delusion that he thinks he is part of the fauna of Australia. I am not prepared to concede that he is, but I am prepared to concede that I believe he is one of Australia's most accomplished bower birds. With deference to Macaulay and to Horatius and his band, let me simply say of my friend, the Deputy Leader of the OppositionGough Whitlam of the ALP. A mighty oath he swore, That the great Sydney Peace Front Should suffer wrong no more. With Cairns and Uren he swore it, And named his time to fight; He sought a left wing diadem In House of Reps at 8 p.m. On an October night. Through all the Labour left wing Went up the cry of ""peace"", (Surely within their own ranks There's need for war to cease) "" Uren and Cairns and Whitlam Will be our dauntless three To stand together and not shrink To fight for comrades red and pink Against Ming's powers that be"".",100,Adjournment

Shame on the false right wingers Who left him so bereft That Whitlam of the ALP. Must march towards the Left. Speaker, I hope that before the House adjourns this evening one of the Ministers present will answer the very serious charge made by the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Devine). I think everybody will recognise that it is a most serious charge which amounts to saying that the Commonwealth is prepared to forgo in the interests of Mr Ansett what should be just taxation on behalf of the Australian people. I wish to discuss this evening a quite serious matter that has been brought to my notice. In a few days we shall be considering legislation designed to prevent tax evasion. I wish to raise tonight another form of evasion relating to customs duty which has been brought to my notice. It takes two particular forms. First, in respect of goods imported into Australia an activity is going on whereby invoices are made out for a lower cost than that actually charged. Evidence has been provided to me indicating that this has happened. In that case ad valorem duty is being forfeited because the Department of Customs and Excise is not able to trace this kind of evasion. I have seen the invoices. One goes to the Customs authorities and the other goes to the importing firm. In each of the cases presented to me the goods coming from the suppliers overseas through an overseas agent have been quoted at a particular price-sa y £129 a ton for paper-bu t when the invoice goes through the Australian Customs the goods are quoted at about £100 a ton. In this way the goods attract a lesser amount of duty than should be charged. The second kind of evasion is in respect of dumpjng duty. In this case the reverse procedure takes place. The invoice coming through fhe Customs authorities shows the price to be higher than the price actually charged by the overseas suppliers. Our dumping laws provide that if a price is charged below a certain figure, the item will attract dumping duty. For instance, if the normal price is quoted as £100 a ton for the supply of paper-thi s is the commodity about which I have been toldand a price lower than £100 a ton is charged, the goods attract dumping duty. But this is what happens. Privately the price quoted to the firm is £90 a ton but £100 a ton is the price shown on the invoice that is presented to the Customs AU merchandise imported into Australia must be accompanied by an invoice to which is attached a declaration in these termsI declare that no different invoice of the goods mentioned in the said invoice has been or will be furnished to anyone; and that no arrangement or understanding affecting the purchase price of the said goods has been or will be made or entered into between the said exporter and purchaser, or by anyone on behalf of either of them, either by way of discount, rebate, compensation or in any manner whatever other than as fully shown on this invoice. The practice going on in the first case avoids ad valorem duty by quoting less than the actual price charged. In the second case the price shown on the official invoice is higher than the price actually charged, simply because the actual price charged would attract dumping duty. I hope that the Customs authorities will be able to look into this matter and that it will attract the attention of the Government. I am told by informed people in the sphere of activity about which I am speaking that it would not be particularly difficult for the Customs authorities to check up on the costing done within the importing firms. It is suggested to me that a proper check on the buyer's costing calculations will immediately show such irregularities. Where a buyer has been charged a higher price it will appear that he sells at cost or at a loss. Where a lower price occurs his theoretical profit is much higher than the actual profit on which his costing is based. It must be kept in mind that the practice of falsifying Customs invoices can be effective only if the supplier is prepared to declare the wrong prices. I am told that overseas manufacturers generally will not do this. The overseas manufacturers will not participate in this nefarious device, but on the other hand many overseas merchandising offices, sometimes agents of the particular importing firm in Australia, collaborate in this task of defrauding Australia of customs duty.",101,Adjournment
185,Mr Reynolds (Barton) [10.49],"Mr authorities.Another device in this field is to describe the article in an inaccurate way. The particular case I have in mind concerns paper imported from China. The original invoice made out in China shows that the weight of the paper is 28 grammes per square metre. The invoice made out in Amsterdam, in this case for the agent handling the importation, for exactly the same paper of the identical order shows a weight of 32 grammes per square metre. I know that this matter is a little technical but the point is that there is a simple reason for this discrepancy. Chinese greaseproof paper below 32 grammes per square metre weight is subject to a dumping duty calculated on the normal value of £A154 8s. a ton. The dumping duty works out at about £A25 a ton to be paid in addition to the ordinary ad valorem duty of 15 per cent. However, if you invoice thc paper as 32 grammes, which is not, instead of at some lower weight, you do not pay any dumping duty at all. The duplicate invoices for this paper are in my possession but I cannot make their details public. On one invoice the paper is shown as weighing 32 grammes per square metre. The other invoice describes thc paper as weighing 28 grammes per square metre. I am told that the paper is subsequently sold, after importation, as paper having a weight of 28 grammes per square metre. This whole situation is loaded. I am told by the people who should know that this practice is defrauding the Australian Customs of thousands of pounds a year. I was attracted to this situation first by a Tariff Board report dealing with aluminium ingots. The report is dated 3rd April 1964 and statesThe local industry claimed, in support of its request for the imposition of quantitative restrictionsQuantitative restrictions would get over this problemthat overseas aluminium producers were prepared to accept a lower return for aluminium than that indicated by the published prices. This, it was stated, could be achieved by the overseas producer using various devices, such as payment of agent's commission and customs duty (if any). The applicantsThat is, the applicants before the Boardwere, however, unable to supply evidence of any specific instance where this had been dune in reonly a week or two ago. For the edification spect of imports into Australia. I know that it is difficult to obtain this kind of evidence. However, having brought this matter to the notice of the Government I hope that it will arouse the Customs authorities and that in respect of the paper industry they might make more searching inquiries into the devices I have referred to, which amount to downright evasion of customs duties. Also, the evasion of dumping duty is undermining the Australian tariff policy. the record should be put straight in respect of the statement by the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Devine) in relation to the importation of aircraft. He was correct when he said that additional duty of l i per cent, has to be paid under the Australia-United Kingdom Trade Agreement if aircraft similar to those being imported from countries other than the United Kingdom are obtainable from the United Kingdom. The honourable member said that Trans-Australia Airlines had paid the additional duty of l i per cent, but that Ansett-A.N.A. had refused to pay it. That allegation is incorrect. The only way in which these companies can obtain a refund of any duty which may be payable is the way prescribed by clause 449 (a) (ii) of the Agreement. I want to make it quite clear that both Ansett-A.N.A. and Trans-Australia Airlines would be called upon to pay the same amount of duty. Both companies have lodged security to the satisfaction of the Collector of Customs for the payment of duty on these aircraft if that should be required. It is quite erroneous to say that Ansett-A.N.A. has refused to pay the duty. There has been no question of having to pay it. No money has passed between Ansett-A.N.A. or Trans-Australia Airlines and the Collector of Customs. Both companies have entered into the usual form of security agreement and if duty is payable the Collector of Customs will have authority to call the money up. This is just the normal procedure. There is no question whatever of favouritism towards one airline as against another. Repeatedly we see attempts made in this House to decry the private enterprise airline, Ansett-A.N.A. My comments with relation to those attempts went on record of the honourable member for East Sydney",102,Adjournment
186,Mr Aston (Phillip) [10.58],"I think( Mr Devine), who is interjecting, I shall repeat what I said earlier, because apparently he did not understand it. No money whatsoever has to be paid at this stage. Security arrangements have been entered into with the Collector of Customs by both companies. paid. I do not want to waste the time of the House any longer. I merely wanted to put the matter straight because of this constant campaign on the part of many honourable members opposite who wish to malign Ansett-A.N.A. As I have said before, their Socialistic programme is opposed to any private enterprise, especially in the transport field. Their aim is to foster T.A.A. I have noticed that in his comments about other air routes, the honourable member for East Sydney, also has used fallacious arguments about preference being given to Ansett-A.N.A. I do not want to go into these matters now. I hope that I have been able to explain to the honourable member for East Sydney and other honourable members that it is completely false to argue that preference is shown towards one airline as against another in relation to duty on aircraft coming into this country. The only reason why a decision has not been given as to whether duty is payable or not in this case is because the planes arrived here sooner than expected. Negotiations are still being carried on between the Collector of Customs here and the United Kingdom Government. There is no question of money being paid at this stage, and both companies have entered into security arrangements with the Collector of Customs. to raise a matter relating to hospital and medical benefit funds. On 14th October last, I asked the Minister for Repatriation ( Mr Earlier this year the Hospital Contributions Swartz), who was representing the Minister for Health (Senator Wade) the following questions upon notice1. Is it a fact that approval has been sought by fund could meet the financial commitments and granted to hospital and medical benefit funds for an increase in members' contributions? 2. If so, (a) what increase was (i) requested and (ii) approved, (b) on what date is it intended that the increase will take effect and (c) what extra beneiits are. to be granted to contributors following the increases? On 22nd October, the Minister furnished the following replyApproval has not been sought by hospital and medical benefit funds for an increase in members' contributions. But between 14th October and 22nd October-o n 21st October-the following article appeared in the Sydney"" Sun ""The Hp: You'll Pay 2s. More. An expert panel today began assessing how much more the public should pay to, and receive from, the medical benefit funds. The panel, the Commonwealth Health Insurance Council, will submit firm recommendations to the Government at the end of the week. The proposals are expected to feature: An increase of 2s. a week contribution for family group insurers. An increase of 2s. in the medical benefit rebate now made by funds. The conference is attended by representatives of the Commonwealth, leading medical and hospital benefit organisations and the Australian Medical Association. The Federal Director-General of Health, Dr. Refshauge, is chairman. The council, set up under the National Health Act, advises the Government, on matters affecting the national health insurance schemes. It is expected to make public its recommendations to the Government shortly after the conference. The Government is in a mood to accept "" reasonable"" increases in contribution rates by subscribers and moderate increases in benefits. An increased contribution of 2s. a week would cost the family contributor on the ""4s. table"" another £5 a year. The 81 medical benefit funds operating throughout Australia would gain £12 million a year by the 2s. rise-enablin g them to pay increased rebates. At the moment, of an average surgery consultation fee of 25s. charged by doctors, the Commonwealth pays 8s., the funds 10s. and the patient 7s. It is understood the council will recommend a fund increased benefit to 12s. The council is expected to recommend a ls. a week contribution increase by single insurers, bringing their weekly rate to 3s. Fund applied to the Commonwealth for approval to increase its medical benefits tables. But the Minister for Health, Senator Wade, said he would defer approval until he was satisfied the involved. At this time it was well known that the Commonwealth was moving to avoid a ""pay-out war* among the funds in a race to attract contributors.

The dogs have been barking some considerable time now that this matter was under consideration by the Government, that the funds were seeking an increase and that approval would surely be given. I now ask the Minister .representing the Minister for Health: What is the actual posiI cannot see any justification at all for any tion? Is the answer I received a misleading answer given to indicate that there was nothing doing at all in Government circles? If the answer was given for that purpose it is completely destroyed by the article that cal attention. I suggest also that it is very appeared in the Sydney"" Sun"" of 21st October 1964, which clearly states that an increase in subscriptions is under consideraa Senate election is pending. I think the tion by the Government. Is the public to be asked to pay more? If so, what extra benefits, if any, are to be granted, or are people to be insured only to cover the present benefits? When all is said and done, as is stated in this article, there are more than 80 of these funds. In this Parliament from time to time honourable members on this side have indicated the tremendous overlap in the functions of the funds, and the great costs of administration as compared with more efficient organisations. Furthermore, they have indicated that people are lucky to get £70 out of £100 charged for a big operation, and that they are paying approximately 33i per cent, of their medical costs despite the contributions they make. I ask the Minister tonight to say clearly whether or not subscribers will have to pay more, what benefits are to be given, and above all else, why an answer was given to me indicating that the matter was not under consideration when it is quite certain from the article that I have read that it is at this very moment being discussed, and that an increase has probably already been approved. I suggest that the Government is delaying and answer on this matter until after the forthcoming Senate election, and I suggest that for political reasons the Government is not making public thc fact that as soon as the Senate election is over people will be called upon to pay increased contributions for whatever medical benefits are available. If it were not for the Senate election this imposition would probably have already been made. I ask the Minister, thereof this matter which is of so much importance to many Australians today. I cannot see any justification at all for any rise in subscription. I think that medical funds should give a complete coverage of medical expenses as is done by hospital funds in the case of hospitalisation. increase being made in contributions, particularly at a time when the benefits being paid are not by any means what should be granted to meet the costs of medistrange that public announcements of these matters should be delayed simply because people are entitled to know just what is happening in the Department of Health in respect of applications that have been lodged. It can never be said that the Hospitals Contribution Fund has not made application for the payment of certain additional benefits to people, because that happened some months ago and it is public property that the Government held the matter up. So at least to that extent the answer given to me has not been accurate. I would like the Minister representing the Minister for Health to clear the position up tonight and let the people know whether there is to be another imposition. I suggest it is not fair, reasonable or just to delay making announcements on this important subject simply because a Senate election is pending. I suggest also that the Minister look again at the answer that was given to me, which appeared to be misleading in the extreme and not in accordance with the facts. for Repatriation) [11.11] -The honourable member for Grayndler ( Mr Daly) has referred to an answer that I gave to him recently to a question on notice. The information provided in that answer is quite correct. It was correct at the time and is still correct. The honourable member was probably in the House yesterday when a question without notice was asked of me by the honourable member for McMillan( Mr Buchanan) on the same subject. I said",104,Talks On Medical Fund Rise
190,Mr Swartz (Darling Downs,"Ministe rin reply at that time that the question whether there will be any consideration by the Government of increased benefits or increased rates will come up for consideration after a report has been submitted to me, as Acting Minister, by the Commonwealth Health Insurance Council. I said at the time that the Council met only a few days ago and that it considered certain matters. It will now consolidate its thoughts and submit a report, in this case to the Acting Minister. From that point the Acting Minister will consider the Council's submissions and later discuss them with the Government. That is the procedure that has always been followed and will be followed in the future. It will be followed in these circumstances. There is no other information I can provide at this stage, except that no submission has yet been made to the Government. When it is received it will be considered. thank the honourable member for Moreton( Mr Killen) for doing me the courtesy of writing a lay in my honour. I have commissioned my laureate, the honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr Clyde Cameron) to write another ballad in honour of the honourable member for Moreton and to read it during a debate on the adjournment motion, as he did when he composed his first ballad on this subject iu May 1962. The honourable member for Moreton apparently did me this honour because a week ago tonight I referred to the antiSemitic overtones of the question he asked about Mr Sachs, a visitor to this country who was sufficiently impeccable to be cleared by the Security Service for this visit. The honourable member's association with Australia's leading anti-Semite, Mr of Representatives on August 6, 19S8. Asserting Eric Butler, and the papers and organisation -the Australian League of Rightsfor which Mr Butler is responsible, were referred to by me on that occasion and also earlier this year by my colleague, the honourable member for Hughes( Mr L. R. Johnson), in one of the forays of the honourable member for Moreton on the subject of fluoridation. My concern was aroused about the honourable gentleman's activities and associations with Mr Butler by an article in the winter issue this year of "" Dissent"". I have not checked the publications but I shall quote from this articleDenis James Killen, the energetic and vocal volumes are not on the table.

Butler, The Story of Twenty Years of Character Assassination, Melbourne, 1960, p i ) From the day Killen arrived in Canberra, he emerged as the favourite politician of the two journals controlled by Butler-the League of Rights* monthly Intelligence Survey (IS) and the social credit fortnightly New Times (NT). His maiden speech attacking peaceful co-existence was described as ""one of the most realistic yet heard in Canberra"" (IS, Feb. 1956). Subsequently, these two papers have republished scores of Killen's ""brilliant"" and ""courageous"" speeches, most of them originally delivered in the House of Representatives. Exceptions include an address given in St. George's Cathedral, Brisbane (IS, April '62). I would think that this means St. George's Cathedral, Perth. bane.

To begin with, let us look at the fierce anti-Israeli speech which he delivered in the House that the Arab States were terrified of ""Zionist aggression"", he recommended a multilateral agreement among the USA, the UK, Israel and the Arab countries "" to ensure that there will be no manifestation of the Messianic movement of Zionism"". He continued: "" I believe that the creation of Israel was a folly"". On the following day he went further and said Israel was to blame for ""The whole of the trouble in the Middle East"". Near the beginning of the speech ha remarked: "" I would be disturbed if anyone levelled at me the charge of anti-Semitism"". Butler reserved high praise for Killen's ""courageous address"" (NT, 29/8/58). Honourable gentlemen can check these quotations from "" Hansard"".

Jim Killen was date was their two-man League of Rights mission in direct touch with me on this issue and his to the United Kingdom in 1962 to fight against address in the Federal Parliament resulted in Britain's proposed entry into the European the switchboard of the A.B.C. in Sydney and Common Market. Previously Killen had addressed Melbourne being jammed with callers wanting a number of League of Rights meetings on this to contact him. One Federal Cabinet Minister subject (IS, July 61; NT, 11/8/61). In reply to was also in touch with me on the issue and Arthur Calwell's charge that he was associating our material reached the Cabinet room. We with a ""semi-fascist"" group, Killen stated: ""The gained a number of new and influential allies Australian League of Rights aims at preserving from this campaign. I can report that the British integrity and sovereignty"" (Canberra local Zionists were most concerned and enTimes, 14/6/62). The two-man mission lasted just deavoured to try and counteract it."" During the previous year Killen had come out as an open Butlerite, although he has never formally belonged to the League of Rights. He had intended to be present at the llth New Times Annual Dinner in Melbourne during September 1957, but illness intervened. On this occasion, following the recital of messages from such internationally famous anti-Semites as Britain's A. K. Chesterton ( Sir Oswald Mosley's lieutenant in the 1930's) and Canada's Ron Gostick, the following telegram from Killen was read: "" I would like you to know you have my very best wishes . . . Your kindness has given a little more determination to a very young man"" (NT, 4.10.57). Killen was also unable to attend the Annual Dinner in the following year and again had to content himself with a telegram: "" Your encouragement to me greatly appreciated. Possibly never in history has there been such a need for the qualities of integrity and loyalty to basic principles to be upheld"" (NT, 26.9.58). Two months later, Butler greeted Killen's re-election at the Federal Elections: "" We confidently expect that Mr Killen's standing and influence will be substantially greater in the new Parliament"" (NT, 5.12.58). Killen was able to be present at the joint New Times Annual Dinner and Social Credit Seminar in 1959, where he presented the main discussion paper. Butler introduced bim to the audience as ""a man of integrity and courage . . . a militant Christian (who) is playing a major role in the struggle against totalitarianism both at home and abroad"" (NT, 2.10.59). The seminar paper was published by the League of Rights in 1960 under the impressive title, This is the Challenge! An Examination of the Theory, Strategy, Tactics and Propaganda of International Communism. The honourable member for Moreton was not able to go to the next couple of dinners. But, in 1962, at the last minute, he was prevented from attending the dinnerAs partial compensation, the assembled guests heard one of his taped speeches together with a characteristic message of greetings: "" Keep up the over four months. Mr Butler had to return through the United States to establish contacts with the John Birch Society, and the honourable member for Moreton returned to do his work in this chamberAbout the same time, the League of Rights published three pamphlets by Killen relating to the Common Market, (1) ""The Suppressed Truth about the European Common Market"", (2) ""The Common Market Threat to the Commonwealth "", and (3) "" In the Commonwealth Cause"". The publication of "" In the Commonwealth Cause"" was subsequently described as one of "" the highlights"" of the League's "" achievements"" in 1963 (NT, 24/1/64). Mr Speaker, I have been unable to check with Mr Butler's pamphlets and periodicals which are quoted as the authority for all the extracts to which I have referred from the "" Dissent"" article. AllI can say is that on much more tenuous evidence, the Attorney-General( Mr Snedden) would describe the honourable member for Moreton as a Fascist and antiSemite.

Did a tripartite mission drawn from employers' organisations, the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the Department of Labour and National Service visit the Territory of Papua and New Guinea in September and October 1960? 2. Did the members unanimously recommend that a similar tripartite mission should visit the Territory two years later? 3. What steps have been taken to carry out this recommendation? able member's questions are as follows1. Yes. 2. The primary objective of the mission was to enable its members, and through them thenorganisations, to become better informed on existing and prospective labour problems in the Territory. On its return the mission prepared a report of its observations in the course of which it expressed the belief that there would be a merit in two particular questions-the growth of industrial organisations and industrial relations machinery-bein g re-examined by a similar mission in about two years' time. 3. The question of a further tripartite mission is one for the organisations themselves to consider in the first instance. Homes Savings Grants. (Question No. 673.) Mr L. R.

These arise naturally in the ordinary Victoria course of business and necessarily include many references to Head Office and policy instructions from that Office. To facilitate administration, a departmental handbook setting out the uniform procedures and policies to be observed by officers in processing applications for the homes savings grant has, of course, been compiled, and it is amended from time to time in the light of experience and to clarify particular procedures.

It is not the policy to disclose details gration, upon noticeof persons whose applications for a visa to enter Australia have been refused. Apart from policy considerations, it would be impractical to maintain such details. Applications for visas may be made to any Australian Government or British consular post overseas, each of which has authority by delegation to determine applications without reference to Australia. Naturally, many hundreds of applications would be involved, and details are not necessarily recorded of unsuccessful applications. 3. Applications by Australians for visas to visit countries overseas must be made to the consular authorities of the countries concerned.
