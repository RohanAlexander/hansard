I hope they all have, and I shall content myself now with -quoting a few of the outstanding figures, -and with asking honourable members to --consider them in the light of what has £aksn place within the last few years. For the seven months from July, 1933, 4o January, 1934, imports to Australia were valued at £34,204,000, while for the corresponding period of 1934-35 they amounted to £43,618,000, an increase of £9,414,000.' Our exports for those periods -were £57,878,000 and £45,470,000. respecto avert disaster. The Minister for Trade tively, representing a decrease in the walne of our exports of £12,4!08,000. Thus, for wool during last year had made funds -oar trade balance went to the bad during .that period to the amount of £21,822,000. That reveals a most serious state of .affairs, and one that cannot be treated lightly. '3?he Government seems quite com.placent about it, however, and the Minis--ter for Trade and Customs( Mr White), -who acted as spokesman for the Government when attention was drawn to 4he matter a few weeks ago, said that the position would adjust itself automatically. volume of our exports has not declined ""What factor does he expect to work automatically? It has been suggested that, (by the manipulation of the rate of exichange, the trade balance can be made to adjust itself, but that remedy cannot be xelied upon, as recent history shows. .J?or many years, prior to 1930, there had Iheen an excess of imports over exports -with the result that, for seven sucessive -yeaTS, there had been an adverse trade ^balance, a condition of affairs that was fostered by the policy of overseas borrowing. This went on until January, 1929, when our credit was stopped in London, and loans then being floated were left almost entirely in the hands of the undercan be corrected. writers. Imports still continued to flow into the country in excess of exports. Frequent rises in the exchange rate took place until finally it reached the level «f 30 per cent., but, despite that, it was vernment to keep that matter outside the found necessary to take drastic tariff action in order to save the country from bankruptcy. flow of imports was checked, the trade balance was corrected, and funds were accumulated with which to meet our overseas commitments. The rate of exchange fell to 25 per cent., and it would the' Commonwealth Bank pegged it at that figure in order to help our exporting industries. That was done with the consent of the government of the day, and haa been continued with the consent and approval of successive governments. In normal times the exchange rate is regarded as a means for adjusting trade balances, but in the abnormal conditions which prevailed in 1929-30, it was found to be quite inadequate for this purpose; nor would the lack of purchasing power have operated in time and Customs said that improved prices available overseas for the purchase of imports, but events have shown that excessive importing can continue without any such encouragement, traders being prepared to lodge funds here for the purpose in the hope of something turning up. Since the Lyons Government has been in office there have been frequent reductions of import duties, resulting in an ever-increasing volume of imports. The although their value has, and there is nothing in the suggestion that the trouble is due to import restrictions. We cannot by our own act raise the price of wool or other export commodities, but we can control imports. In 1927 I warned the Government of the day that the situation was becoming alarming, and two years later I was leader of a government which took charge during the crisis. Since the present Government has been in office, I have issued further warnings, and the reply has been that, with the help of the'exchange rate, our adverse trade balance It is claimed by the Lyons Government that the Commonwealth Bank is free to fix the rate of exchange, and we were informed that it is the policy of the Gorealm of politics. Technically, it is outside, but, in fact, it is not free from the Eventually the excessiva effects of political action. In the last Parliament the Government sponsored an amendment to the Customs Act in order to provido that, when an increase took place in the rate of exchange, import duties should be automatically reduced. Therefore, if the Commonwealth Bank increased the exchange rate for the purpose of adjusting our trade balance, its action could be off-set by the automatic decline of import duties. ing Treasurer to prove that that statement is incorrect. claimed, in justification of the complacent attitude of the Government, that the increases which have taken place in importations are a sign of prosperity and increased employment because, in tbe main, they represent tools of trade, machinery for industry, and raw material for manufactures. That statement might convince people who do not read the list of importations. It is true that some of the increases of importations can be accounted for under these headings, but not the whole of them. Por instance, apparel, attire and textiles, which by no stretch of the imagination can be said to be raw materials, but much of which could be manufactured in Australia, show an increase for the first seven months of 1934-35 to £9,466,000 from £7,524,000 for the corresponding period of the previous year. The value of importations of paints and varnishes during the same period rose from £193,000 to £285,000, or an increase of £92,000; tobacco, which can be grown and manufactured in Australia, rose from £284,000 to £676,000, an increase of £392,000; china, crockery and household ware, the manufacture of which could be undertaken on a larger scale in Australia, rose from £643,000 to £851,000, a rise of £208,000. If , under this heading, there are included some things which cannot be manufactured in Australia who will say that they represent tools of trade and raw materials? The value of imports of jewellery and fancy goods during the same period rose from £471,000 to £648,000, an increase of £177,000. Under this heading, there may be many items which are not produced in Australia, but they are luxuries, and we do not need to import them if we cannot pay for them. The value of imports of motor bodies and parts rose from £25,000 to £104,000, an increase of £79,000. The honourable member for Adelaide( Mr Stacey) should be interested in the increase under that beading. Foodstuffs of animal origin, including potted and concentrated meats, rose from £505,000 to £734,000, an increase of £229,000. I submit that fully one-half of the increases are in respect of items which could be produced or manufactured in Australia; many more are in respect of items which It is further we do not need if we are unable to pay for them with exports. A proper analysis of these increases would probably show that their manufacture in this country would give employment to another 10,000 persons. It take9 time for an alteration of the tariff to have any beneficial effects, and so this Government has enjoyed the benefits of the increased tariff imposed by the Labour Government. By reason of the duties we imposed our opponents were able to claim before the electors that 60,000 workers have been employed in factories since the Lyons' Government came into office. As it takes time for tariff increases to have effect, so also does it take time for decreases to have effect, and the full effect of the decreases made in the tariff schedule by this ^Government are not vet apparent. What will be the position when their effect is being fully experienced ? To ward off criticism, the Government points to the reserves in London, saying that our overseas financial position is sound. I do not want to do anything to injure the credit of our country. When I issued a warning in 1927, 1 was charged by the present Acting Prime Minister (Dr. Earle Page) with raising a cry that would destroy Australia's cTedit. But one cannot remain silent when the obvious facts show that the country's credit is to be destroyed. It is difficult to check exactly what our London funds are, but it has been stated that the reserves amount to £68,000,000, after allowing for certain adjustments. The accumulation of London funds is due in the main to the drastic tariff action of the Scullin Government and the consequent scaling down of imports, which gave us a credit trade balance. But we must not be lulled.",29,Overseas Trade Balance Formal Motion For Adjournment
11,Mr Caset,That is not so.,31,Overseas Trade Balance Formal Motion For Adjournment
12,Mr Scullin,"I challenge the Actinto a false sense of security. Before the advent of the Bruce-Page Government, the accumulated funds in London were more than double the present amount. Immediately before the depression; we had a very large credit there, mainly as a result of loans raised overseas. But these funds dwindled away as soon as 'the crisis came, and our credit was stopped. So we had to fall back on the drastic policy of prohibitions. That policy has been criticized; I was leader of the Government that introduced it, and I say that it is undesirable that there should be drastic and sudden changes in tariff duties such as were forced upon us in 1930. We should try to avoid such a desperate expedient, but if we had not resorted to it at that time Australia would have had -no alternative but to default. It is true that we have credit funds in London which under present conditions, not allowing for droughts or restriction of exports, will last for approximately two years. At the end of that time we shall be again facing the dangers that were imminent five years ago. But we must take into account droughts and restriction of exports. Something may be said of invisible exports due to the revival of gold-mining, but I remind honourable members that this year we shall witness a tremendous exodus of tourists from Australia who will spend abroad millions of pounds; this expenditure is equivalent to an invisible import. The money taken out of the country by these people will offset any funds which come to us .through overseas investment in Australian mining. I ask honourable members to take warning from the failure of our last conversion loan in London, a failure due, in my opinion, very largely to the fact that our trade balance is not sufficient to meet our obligations, and pay for imports. We have to find nearly £30,000,000 overseas for interest and services in addition to paying for imports. It is estimated that this year we will fall short by £18,000,000 to £20,000,000. This is a grave prospect. I ask the House to remember January, 1929, when our credit was stopped. It took years to recover; only when a favorable trade balance was assured, did our position improve. Drastic and sudden restrictions are undesirable. Take time by the forelock and avoid the necessity for such action. When the latest reductions of the tariff take full effect the position will become more serious. I urge honourable members to take note of this position, and insist on keeping the Parliament in session so that the trade balance and other grave problems may be immediately grappled with. gentleman has exhausted his time. Minister-Cowper) [9.45] -The eloquent speech made by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Scullin) has disclosed the fact that the lessons of the depression have made no impression on his mind. He made a speech in this House seven or eight years ago, in which he said that all our troubles were due to low tariffs, and to the fact that Australia had an adverse trade balance. Yet the country which today is suffering worse from the world depression and unemployment is the United States of America, which has had a vast favorable trade balance, and has maintained an almost prohibitive tariff for many years. It is quite obvious that a favorable balance of trade is not the saveall that the right honourable gentleman suggested. Unfortunately, there are other factors involved. He recited a list of imports which he said could be made here. For instance, he said that we are importing millions of pounds worth of textiles, but I remind him that during the two years for which he was Leader of the Government he did nothing to initiate the cotton textile industry in this . country; he merely imposed a revenue duty of 5 per cent., and that rate applies to-day. The right honourable gentleman made no attempt to increase the protection, and' it is idle for him to say now that we are importing millions of pounds worth of, not woollen textiles, but cotton textiles, which have never been made in this country. The right honourable gentleman referred to the importation of paints and varnishes. Included in the figures he mentioned are £19,000 worth of gums and resins, and £63,000 worth of linseed oil which have been imported for the purpose of making paint in this country. These are the raw materials of an important industry. If honourable members will",31,Overseas Trade Balance Formal Motion For Adjournment
13,Mr Speaker,The right honourable,32,Overseas Trade Balance Formal Motion For Adjournment
14,Dr. Earle Page (Acting Prime,"examine the list of imports they will find amongst them many luxury items, including motor cars. What did the right honourable gentleman do to prevent the importation of motor cars? leave the duty as it was imposed by the Bruce-Page Government ? Of the increase in the value of imports, £1,200,000 reprewent out of office, to 453,200 at the? sents motor cars, but £450,000 worth of iron and steel sheets and bars were brought into this country for the manufacture of motor bodies; these raw materials are not manufactured in .Australia. Is it not a fact that we are able to give a tremendous amount of employment by bringing to this country partly form the raw material of manufactures? Tbe right honourable gentleman went on to say that exchange should now be superimposed on the tariff as a protective measure. The Government which he led declared that it had raised duties up to 100 per cent, on everything that mattered in this country, so that no more protection was needed. But, during the period when that Government was in power, what was the position in regard to the exchange rate? Eor most of the time when these high duties were in operation, and when probably more than two-thirds of the tariff schedules brought down by that Government were tabled, the exchange rate was not more than 6 or 7 per cent., and the Scullin, Government thought that was ample protection. The protection which is now being given, in accordance with the recommendations of the Tariff Board, is that to which the local manufacturers are. entitled to enable them to carry on their industries. The Tariff Board itself states that the high exchange rate gives an additional protection, and that its effect is to bring into being a number of uneconomic or an excessive number of competing industries which prevent the economic industries from properly establishing themselves, the result being the collapse of useful industries with increased unemployment and loss of capital. According to the right honourable gentleman, because of the present trend of the trade balance, Australia is drifting to step was officially justified on the doubledestruction.

Although we have heard from the Leader of the Opposition a tale of ruin, people are being put back into work, and production is on the increase. The iron and steel industry is now proposing to export goods t'o other countries, as well assupplying the Australian market. Theright honourable gentleman said that the proper thing to do would be to revert to his tariff policy; but I point out that similar policies put into operation in* other parts of the world constitute the main causes of the present dislocation and contraction of world trade. Let me quote the non-partisan opinion of that noted! economist, Professor D. B. Copland, who, in his book, Australia in tKe World Crisis, at page 32, statesThe second step in correcting the external) position was to increase, early in 1930, thealready heavy import duties, and to imposeprohibitionl on some luxury imports. Thisground of checking imports and providing; I draw attention to the employment. Thati t was a. false step is -capable of ready demonstration. Higher tariffs at the moment merely served to sustain high prices in protected industry, and thus to -support the level of costs for export industry, trade. which added to the rapidly-growing difficulties -of export producers. -clumsy and tardy method of reducing imports. The theory behind the tariff policy of the -moment was indeed wholly fallacious. Kt should also be remembered that during that period, because of the inaction of the Scullin Government, the exchange did .not move, as it should have done, in the interests of Australian exporters, and the tariff policy of that Government was 'loading costs against them. Thus we can «ee that a scissors-like action of keeping 4he exchange rate down and at the same time raising the tariff was destroying Australian prosperity and reducing employment. The right honourable gentleman remarked that during this financial year 4here is a trend towards an adverse trade -balance. As a matter of fact, the balance in respect of our commodity figures is aiot yet adverse, but there is a tendency in that direction. It is true that imports as compared with exports are going up; but it is futile to base criticism of the present position on figures for only part -of the financial year. at the figures from season to season, recognizing that throughout Australian -history there has been a definite lag in the adjustment of import values to export values. The exports, of course, pay for the imports. This lag is shown by a study of the figures for the last six or -seven years. It is also wrong merely to -estimate credits by reference to visible *xports. The right honourable gentleman -discounted the taking into consideration of invisible exports on the ground that there were equal set-offs against them, yet he -did not adduce any proof in support of his contention. Unquestionably the whole -of tbe facts of the case must be taken into -consideration. It is quite a travesty of She facts to suggest that government Action, unless it is of a violent and revolutionary character, is at any time a material factor in influencing comparatively short-term fluctuations in the value of our external trade. It .i^.fc^rue that violent and revolutionary action may 3>ring about results, but even the very wiolent action by the Scullin Government in imposing embargoes on imports was limited to a small percentage of our total It was, moreover, a No such violent action has been taken by the present Government. It cannot be shown that any action by the Lyons Administration, from its inception up to the present time, has had an adverse effect on Australian trade. An examination of imports and exports for the last six or seven years discloses a very definite lag in the movement of imports following changes in exports. ""While the value of our exports dropped in the first year of the depression from £138,000,000 to £98,000,000, our imports, which stood in the previous year at £143,000,000, fell to only £132,000,000. They were being paid for by the exports in previous years. be left out of consideration. money, if we examine the position year by year, and decade by decade, it will be found that when we have enjoyed extremely good seasons, and high prices for our exports, we have also had heavy imports in the succeeding year. ""With the larger imports there was a ""We must look greater degree of employment and comfort, and an expansion of local industries. There is a simple explanation of the lag in imports. It takes time for the reduced export value of goods to affect traders and manufacturers. If an examination be made of the position since 193031, it will be seen that exactly the same situation that we now face occurred in previous years. Exports and imports were both at a low level in 1930-31 and 193132. In 1932-33 and 1933-34 that wonderfully spectacular jump which occurred in the price of wool added nearly £13,000,000 to the value of Australian exports. That waB due, not to something done by the Government, but to the increased price of a primary product of Australia. The result of that increased price was that we were able to buy more goods overseas, and that our financial year closed with a credit balance of £12,000,000. The figures for the eight months of the present financial year show a credit balance in respect of the items of exports and imports that I have mentioned of something",32,Overseas Trade Balance Formal Motion For Adjournment
15,Mr Scullin,Loan money must not,34,Overseas Trade Balance Formal Motion For Adjournment
16,Dr. Earle Page,"Apart from loanlike £8,600,000. If the present volume of trade continues, the final figures for the year will show exports of merchandise and silver to he £82,500,090, and of gold production £6,500,000, making a total of £89,000,000; and our imports will show at £70,000,000, giving us a credit of £19,000,000. That will be the result of our trading if we are able to sell all of our wool and wheat. But even if we cannot sell all our wool and wheat overseas this year, we shall still have them for sale in the subsequent year, and will be able to build up credits overseas from the proceeds. One of the results of last year's high price of wool is the very big increase of imports that is noticeable at present. The Leader of the Opposition has said that we are in a desperate position, and that the position of our London funds gives cause for serious alarm. But what is the position of oui London funds? Since 1931 the London funds of the trading banks and the banking department of the Commonwealth Bank have increased by nearly £30,000,000 sterling. At the end of June, 1934, the total amount of our London funds was approximately £50,000,000 sterling. As was stated earlier to-night by the Acting. Treasurer ( Mr Casey), it was in these circumstances that the chairman of directors of the Commonwealth Bank issued his warning in regard to exchange. These reserves are undoubtedly ample to meet any adverse movement in the current year. I wish to refer for a moment to the nature of the imports into Australia during this year. The Leader of the Opposition has suggested that a tremendous quantity of additional material has come into Australia during the last eight or nine months. The position is that, although there has been an increase of £9,500,000 sterling in the value of our imports for the seven months of the financial year to the end of January, luxury goods and revenue items account for £4,500,000 of that amount, raw material, material partly manufactured, and capital goods, such as machinery and the like, which appear on our tariff schedule as duty free, and were actually admitted duty free under departmental by-law by the Scullin Government, account Dr. Earle Page. for another £2,000,000, while other goods, not competitive with Australian goods, account for £750,000. Goods imported under protective duties account for only £2,000,000 of the increase of £9,500,000. These figures surely show how, little danger there is to our protective system in consequence of the imports that have occurred in the last few months. £2,000,000 represents extra goods. able members also that the increased demand for raw materials and capital goods not produced in Australia has not caused any displacement of Australian goods, or reduced the volume of employment in this country. On the contrary, it has provided additional employment in many of our main industries, with the result that the volume of unemployment has been reduced. The Government recognizes that in times like these it must watch the position closely; but it does not consider that there is any need for panic. One way to improve the prosperity of Australia is to secure a larger market for its products in other countries, and an attempt is being made to do that. member's time has expired. -The Acting Prime Minister (Dr. Earle Page) in his introductory remarks in reply to the speech of the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Scullin) suggested that that right honourable gentleman had learned nothing from the depression, and that for that reason his accusations could be regarded as being based on inexperience and lack of knowledge of the existing circumstances. If it may be said that the Leader of the Opposition has learned nothing from the depression, it may also be said that the Acting Prime Minister has learned nothing from his previous experience as Treasurer of the Commonwealth.

Reman caused the depression, but I am directing attention to certain factors which had an important bearing on the economic and financial position of Australia at that time. If the Bruce-Page Government had adopted a long-range policy during those prosperous years, as the present Government professes to be doing in the matter of agriculture by planning for the future, the country would not have been compelled to face the serious situation in which it was when the Labour Government assumed office. During unguarded moments, some honourable members opposite pay tribute to the Scullin Government for the way in which it met the situation; but at ether times they contend that there was no necessity to prohibit the importation of a large number of commodities which were then being imported, and for which we could not pay. I believe that the present High Commissioner, in his speeches at Ottawa, endorsed the Scullin Government's tariff policy. Bhould, at least, be generous enough to admit that the circumstances in 19-29-30 were sueh as have been outlined by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Scullin). His generosity reached the stage of fair1 ness only in his concluding remarks, when he admitted that the position is serious, that it must be watched closely, and that circumstances may arise to call for action. This motion has been moved because the circumstances are serious, and the position must be watched closely. We have information to-day which was not available to the House when attention was drawn to the position overseas by the present Leader of the Opposition in 1927. The statistics which the Acting Prime Minister has quoted do not alter facts or disprove that our trade balance has reached an alarming point. Although he may quote lists of commodities imported to assist our secondary industries, the fact remains that our trade balance has reached a'stage at which it should be carefully handled. Attention should be directed to these facts, particularly as our opportunities will he limited owing to the short period during which the House is likely to remain in Mr Bnaxley. quotedfiguresshowing the extent to which liable figures concerning unemployment are not those supplied by statisticians, but those based on the census.

At that time he said "" These proposals are not in any way associated with the Government's protective policy "". He also said "" This is an emergency measure; it proposes emergency action"", but he now suggests that these prohibitions and surcharges should be continued five years later. As leader of the Federal Labour party he should be interested in the unemployment figures, yet during the regime of his government prohibitions and surcharges were imposed in order to adjust the then adverse trade balance. The present Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Forde), who was Minister for Trade and Customs in the Scullin Government, said over and over again that employment could be increased only by imposing higher duties, but this, Government believes in pursuing a reasonable tariff policy, and by that means produty and imposed primage on tea. The viding employment. In the metals industry of New South Wales, including BrokenH ill , concerning which the Labour party should be intensely interested, the number employed during the height of prosperity in 1927 was 18,071, whereas in 1932 it had decreased to 8,400. 'The number employed in that industry is now 18,436, or higher than it was in 1927. The number em-, ployed in factories, in New South Wales, exclusive of all others, in 1932 was 126,300, but in 1934 it was 153,000. Those in New South Wales who were previously out of work, but who are now employed will not be impressed by the eloquence of the Leader of the Opposition. TheG eneral reduction of unemployment in few South Wales during the regime of the Lyons Government has been 33 per cent., while the value of production in that State has increased by £4,473,000. In Victoria the position is equally satisrequired for Australian manufactures. factory. The right honourable gentleman would like us to believe that this Government is displacing men in industry. Nothing could be further from the truth. Increased purchases this year are the aftermath of high wool prices. For instance, the imports of motor cars, chasses and parts for the seven months period referred to by the Leader of the Opposition totalled £2,528,000 as against £1,315,000 for the corresponding period of the previous year, an increase of £1,213,000. These chasses, I would remind honourable members, are imported duty free from Great Britain, and at a high rate of duty from foreign countries, and their importation gives a considerable amount of work to motor body builders in Australia, as well as to manufacturers of batteries, tyres, and motor parts. Would the right honourable gentleman deny this additional work to Australians engaged in those industries? bodies ? gentleman will hear all about motor bodies when the report »f the Tariff Board is presented. A great many of the imports about which he complains are revenue and luxury items. The Scullin Government increased the Lyons Government removed the primage and reduced the duty, with the result that there is now more tea consumed in Australia. Would the right honourable gentleman and his friends deny this very necessary commodity to the people of Australia, and particularly the working classes ? duce only about one quarter of the annual consumption. Although there is a great deal of tobacco grown in this country, we are not producing largely of the leaf'required for cigars and cigarettes. Consequently, an increase in importation and consumption of tobacco means that purchasing power is returning to some people who, for so long, were out of employment. The Lyons Government, in furtherance of its policy to rehabilitate industry, also removed the primage on raw materials This had the effect of giving a definite stimulus to industry, and bringing down costs of production and increasing efficiency. There have been increased importations of copra, fibres, gums and resins, linseed, hessian and jute piece goods, cotton and linen piece goods; all of these are raw materials for manufacturers, or capital goods of a class not made in Australia.",37,Tariff Aids In The Depression Distress Greater Without Protected Industries

No one will,, however, deny that the situation, has to be watched. On this point the right honourable gentleman misquoted me when alluding to a statement which I had made recently. He gave the impression that I had informed the press that this was a matter which would automatically adjust itself. omitted to mention that I had first spoken a warning about the trade position, and had said that this matter would have to be watched from year to year. At the present time we anticipate an approximate favorable trade balance of £18,000,000 this year. Our commitments abroad for interest, exchange and other charges are about £26,000,000, so there may be a shortage. If , however, we were to build up excess funds on the other side the exchange rate would drop, whereas if we have a shortage it will move forward. At the moment there is no great advantage in having a large surplus of funds in London. The essential consideration is that all our people shall get into employment as quickly as possible, and that our industries, both primary and secondary, shall prosper. The Government will, in future, as it has in the past, watch carefully the financial situation. I deprecate the attempt by the honourable member for West Sydney( Mr as the Leader of the Country party, who Beasley) to vilify the Acting Prime Minister (Dr. Earle Page), who was Treasurer in the Bruce-Page Administration. The honourable member referred to him in terms that were most uncomplimentary, and were wholly undeserved. The Acting Prime Minister was responsible, in an earlier administration, for the establishment of the Loan Council, which prevented the then Premier of New South Wales, Mr Lang, from carrying out a financial policy which would have Opposition has a very important bearing wrecked the Commonwealth. Further, as to the effect on the at a loss to understand why so much unemployment situation of the increased hostility is being displayed by Ministers importations disclosed in the latest and their supporters to this very timely figures available, I would remind warning of the dangers ahead for the the House that, although the imCommonwealth if the trade position is Afr. White. portations of machinery duty fTee under customs by-laws have increased, their effect is to assist the mining and other industries. The list of importations of other capital goods not manufactured in Australia includes sheepshearing machines which increased in value by £11,000, and iron, steel and tinned plates for the canning industry, which increased by £146,000. He exhausted his time. I regret that the right honourable the Prime Minister( Mr Lyons) and his three Ministers, as well as the Parliamentary Under-Secretary for Employment ( Mr Stewart), who, with a retinue of about fourteen public officials, are on the high seas, were not here this evening to hear the convincing speech made by the right honourable the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Scullin). Had the Prime Minister been present he would, no doubt, have made some attempt to reply to the charges formulated by my leader. Unlike the Acting Prime Minister (Dr. Earle Page) he would not have airily evaded the issues involved. It was quite apparent that the Acting Prime Minister was exceedingly uncomfortable while the Leader of the Opposition was speaking, because only a few months ago when we were on the hustings he warned the people of the dangers ahead if the Lyons Government were returned to power. The right honourable gentleman, was the greatest protagonist of independent political action in Australia said, in effect, that it would be calamitous if the Lyons Government were returned to office. So rapid have been the changes in the views of Ministerialists, that now the right honourable gentleman is leading that Government!

45,Mr Forde (Capricornia) [10.25],"allowed to drift as it has been drifting during tbe last few months. The Leader of the Opposition very rightly pointed to the increase of £9,400,000 in imports, and the decline in the value of Australian exports by £12,400,000 for the seven months period ended on the 31st January of this year compared with a similar period ended 31st January, 1934. A drift in the trade position of '£21,000,000 in that short period cannot be lightly disregarded Tbe Acting Prime Minister to-night made the same ranting speech that we heard from him when the Leader of the Opposition discussed a similar danger in 1927. Mr Bruce, who was then Prime Minister, treated the matter very lightly, suggesting that there was nothing to worry about, and that it was not necessary to take any drastic action. We who heard him on that occasion have lived to read the very eloquent speech which he delivered more recently, as Resident Minister in London. The Journal, issued by the London Chamber of Commerce for January, 1933, contains the following report of the speech delivered by Mr Bruce on the 2nd December, 1932 :For the year ended 30th June, 1930, there wag an adverse trade balance of £34,000,000, but as a result of the steps taken, by the end of June, 1932, this had been completely wiped out and Australia had a favorable trade balance of over £30,000,000. These figures show what a tremendous task had been accomplished . . . Faced with the heavy fall in the value of its export trade and the necesthan operate in industry in this country. sity for providing some £30,000,000 for interest overseas, Australia had ruthlessly to cut down imports and the curtailment effected was from £131,000,000 in 1929-30, to £44,000,000 in 1931-32. This curtailment was effected by prohibitions or embargoes, surcharges and very heavy increases in all customs duties . . . No other course was open to the Commonwealth if it were to meet its external obligations. That was a frank admission by the former Prime Minister, but the right honourable gentleman did not give credit to _ the Scullin Government for having had the courage to put into operation a policy which pulled Australia out of its difficulties. The Acting Prime Minister, who a few years ago was well described as the "" tragic Treasurer "", refused to apply the necessary correction to the trade [2] balance although there was ample evidence of grave financial difficulties before the Bruce-Page Government was removed from office. The honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Beasley) to-night mentioned the interview which the chairman of the Commonwealth Bank Board had with the Scullin Ministry upon its accession to office. His statement that the preceding administration had disregarded the advice given by the bank board was absolutely true. Sir Robert Gibson said that something would have to be done immediately. Instead of reverting to the old system of large importations even when overseas prices rise we should be making the great bulk of the goods we require locally, thereby keeping down imports and providing employment in Australia. But instead of doing that the Minister for Trade and Customs boasts of alterations he has made in tariff duties. It is true that since the Ottawa agreement he has reduced duties on over 1,500 items and sub-items of the tariff. The boasted Ottawa agreement which was to be such a tremendous boon to Australian industry has been a ""washout "", and even its champions, who, a few years ago, said it was going to save the dairying and beef industries are ashamed to talk about it to-day. It has subjected the Australian manufacturer to unfair competition with the British manufacturer who pays much lower wages and works his employees much longer hours Clauses9 to 14 of the Ottawa agreement provide that the Tariff Board must take cognizance of certain facts, and give the British manufacturers equal opportunity on the Australian market with the Australian manufacturers who are giving employment to our people. The Minister for Trade and Customs dealt a staggering blow to the cotton industry. He has vacillated a great deal and changed his policy in regard to the industry a dozen times. He has faced large deputations of cotton-, spinners who employ hundreds of our people and who could give employment to many more hundreds if it were not for the destructive policy of this Government in meddling with these tariff duties at tlie behestof importing; interests-..

How are we to face this problem if we continue the policy of tearing down the tariff wall ? What is the policy of this Government? It is explained by half a dozen voices. The honourable member for Calare( Mr Thorby), one of the members of the Government, speaking recently in Sydney at the Hotel Carlton before members of the Constitutional Association, said that "" in the interests of Australia's overseas trade, artificially bolstered up industries would have to be sacrificed'."" The right honourable the Prime Minister disagreed with his colleague. He said that Mr Thorby's views did not represent the views of the Government. In 'fact he gave his colleague a public rebuke. What are the views of the Acting Leader of the Government on this matter? Does he sup^ port Mr Thorby or the United Australia party which secured a large vote in the great industrial centres of Australia by saying that it stood for a protectionist policy? Professor Copland has been quoted to-night. Certain extracts were read from a report made by Professor Copland over five years ago. I will now quote from a more recent article written by Professor Copland which was published in the Melbourne Herald, of the 7 th March, 1935, in which the writer said, "" Clearly at the moment we are importing beyond our capacity to absorb imports."" moment."" that. columns in length, but the portion of it to which I am referring deals specifically -with imports. Professor Copland stressed the point that at the moment we are importing beyond our capacity to absorb imports. He added that export prices in sterling are still more than 50 per cent, below their 1928 level, and that although the volume of exports pes aentr.^w r.ecei-ve; more than; 30jer.. cent. less, income from our exportsthan, we: did before the depression.. In. reply to the statement that to-day there, are 117,000 morepeople employed in secondary industry, I claim that that improvement has been due to the. policy followed by the Scullin Government, and not by thedestructive policy of this Government, which is placing in jeopardy the great labour-employing secondary industries. member's time has expired. [10.35} -The Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Forde) asked a little heatedly why hostility should be shown by honourable members on this side of the House when replying to the speech of the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Scullin). I would refer him to the Statement made by the right honourable gentleman when he disclaimed any desire to do violence to the interests of the country by bringing down a motion of this nature. The ex-parte and rather biased statements made by the Leader of the Opposition were such that it is necessary in the interests of this country to offset against them facts that are expressive of the true position of the Commonwealth. Replying to a statement made' by me earlier in the evening, he said that I was incorrect in saying that the Commonwealth Bank Board was in control of the exchange rate. The right honourable gentleman attempted to bear out his argument by pointing out that there was an automatic adjustment of certain protective tariff rates in accordance with variations in the exchange. At that point I ventured to interject, but the right honourable gentleman persisted in his statement. The Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr White) answered the right honourable gentleman by pointing out that the automatic variation of duties applies only when the exchange is reduced, and then in a way to benefit Australian industry. The Minister further explained that the adjustment did not apply when the. exchange rose.

50,Mr Casey (Corio,"Acting Treasurer)complete control of the exchange rate. The subject of this debate calls for an examination of, first, the trade balance, and then the balance of payments. On the figures for the first six months of this year the trade balance is in our favour to the amount of just under £5,000,000. The estimate, and it can only be. an estimate, for the twelve months, is that on trade both ways, plus merchandise gold, there may be a positive balance in our favour of £19,000,000. overseas debt. that point. Coming now to the balance of payments, taking into account all payments overseas in both directions, and including interest and sinking fund charges, which annually absorb about £26,000,000 sterling overseas, we estimate there was in London approximately that we may be down by from £10,000,000 to £12,000,000. That is assuming that there will not be a big carry-over of unsold wool or wheat. If there should be, possible to keep on building up London the total amount will be increased. These figures ' are necessarily only estimates. For the first six months of the year, paynecessity to keep London funds. ments for our exports are usually comparatively low. only an estimate? months are. months of actual facts. honourable gentleman said, honourable members on his side proceeded to draw certain conclusions concerning the trade balance, and the balance of payments for the full twelve months. I am impelled to reinforce certain remarks of the Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr White) by saying that early in the last financial year, and in the financial year which preearly in the year, and was proved catasceded it, the right honourable gentleman attempted to draw from the figures then available inferences as to what would be the position at the end of the twelve months. Imports come in remarkably evenly throughout tbe year, but the money for exports is received very largely to cause the slightest alarm. In support in the second half of the year. Consequently, the figures for the first six months do not give a true picture, and therefore it is most unwise to draw from them conclusions as to what the position will be at the end of the twelve months. a comparison between the figures for the first seven months of this year and those for a similar period last year ? we are concerned with is the balance at the end of the twelve months. Australia is dependent very greatly upon seasons and prices, and for that reason a fairly large balance is maintained in London to act as a shock absorber, in order to meet situations such as that which now exists. As the right honourable the Leader of the Government has said, there has been since 1931 a building up of London funds to an amount of approximately £30,000,000. We know that, on the 30th June last, £50,000,000, apart altogether from the note issue reserve, to meet periods of adverse trading conditions. It is imfunds year after year. If that were to happen automatically, there would be no made to pay any debts overseas? in London, after the trading balance is complete, are made good from the balance of funds in London. have a little over? funds have been largely built up since this Government came into office. It is very unwise to attempt to draw conclusions from the figures for six months, seven months, or even eight months. On two previous occasions, the right honourable gentleman drew such deductions trophically wrong. No attempt has been made to argue that there is any real possibility of our having a favorable trade balance in the present financial year; but I do say that any adversity in our balance of payments is not such as of that contention I refer the right honourable gentleman to the statement of the Chairman of the Commonwealth Bank",41,Tariff Aids In The Depression Distress Greater Without Protected Industries

'The right honourable gentleman mentioned textiles. Honourable members of the Opposition frequently refer to textiles in such a way as to lead one to believe that they represent woollen textiles. woollens represent a minute proportion of the textiles that come into this country. textiles have increased by nearly 100 per cent. scopically small to a figure slightly less microscopically small. The quantity of woollen textiles imported is infinitesimal compared with the quantity manufactured in this country. It would not have been out of place had the Leader of the Opposition referred to textiles by their proper description; that is, textiles decaying and tottering. that are not manufactured in this country. towelling? and even jute textiles. Textiles could with advantage be more categorically expressed in our tariff schedule. As I suggested earlier, it is necessary for statements to be made from this side of the House putting the trade position in a rather more balanced way than that in which it was put by the Leader of the Opposition. I have only a few observations to make on the subject now before the House. It seems to me that the arguments advanced from both sides may be aptly described as tweedledum and tweedledee. A wordy battle, similar to that indulged in by a number of lawyers, has been waged, but little of a convincing nature has emerged to indicate what is likely to rectify the economic position not only of our own country, but also of the world generally. We have had high protection to the point of prohibition, with negligible results of a favorable character. Unemployment has increased, and the burden of economic woe has been more severely felt by the worker. Low tariffs, approaching to free trade, have had exactly the same result. Like the tides on the sea shore, the trade balance has ebbed and flowed, first becoming a little. better and then a little worse. The budgetary position improves slightly to-day, and becomes less favorable to-morrow. The operation of the existing system reminds one of a dog chasing its tail. There is an old saying that figures do not lie, but liars can figure. Figures are used in different ways in an endeavour to illustrate this or that side of the question, but the fact remains that in Australia and the world generally the economic position of the people is becoming worse as time goe3 on. There are greater thinkers and economists of higher standing than Professor Copland, who to my mind writes and speaks as he is paid to do, in the interests of a system that he is trying to bolster up, a system which he knows is In spite of high or low tariffs, in spite of adverse trade balances between one country and another, the world generally has yet to pass through the most gruelling period of the depression. The evils that confront us, the economic ills that affect Australia and the world to-day, are due not to either high or low 'tariffs, but simply to the conflicting and hopelessly chaotic conditions that have been brought about by the capitalistic system under which we live. In all discussions of this kind we are like the ostrich, which when in danger buries its head in the sand; we are afraid to face the issue, but try to persuade ourselves that a solution of our problems can be found in discussions such as this. In every discussion in this Parliament we merely beg the question unless we are prepared to have an organized system of society under a managed economy, whereby the forces of nature will be used in the interests of all the people instead of with the object of profiting a few. We must be prepared to harness the machine and use it for the benefit, instead",42,Tariff Aids In The Depression Distress Greater Without Protected Industries

71,Mr Lazzarini (Werriwa)) [10.45].,"of for the degradation, of the race. I listened more in distress of mind than with interest to members of this National Parliament indulging in what I can only term a game of make-believe-try ing to make one another believe that in this or that way we shall solve our problems. Had we the intelligence which we should possess as members of this Parliament we should know that our problems will not be solved in that way. I hope that this Parliament will set itself to deal with the economic problems confronting this country, although while the present Government remain in office that may perhaps be only a pious hope. We should, however, get to grips with the economic problems with a view to establishing Australia on a sounder footing. I repeat that all that is happening in the world is that the financiers l if t the burden a little to-day only to squeeze a little harder to-morrow. The position of the world is as hopeless as is an attempt to get rid of a dent in a rubber ball; we remove one dent only to make another. If one country becomes a little more prosperous another gets deeper in trouble. There is a continual see-sawing from one nation to another, and the people are gulled into the belief that some day relief will be afforded. In respect of human values, Australia is in a worse position to-day than at any time previously. We hear a great deal of the relief of unemployment, but what is the position? should be ashamed to describe as employment the conditions under which many in our midst are called upon to work. Fathers and mothers of Australian children are forced to live under conditions which are disgraceful; capitalism and the money powers must get their pound of flesh, come weal or woe. The Arbitration Court and the powers of the Commonwealth are used to destroy and tear up wage conditions and arbitration awards; men are put to work on great constructional undertakings at dole rates of pay. If such things continue, the whole of our people will before long be reduced to the same low standard. This discussion has made very little impression on me, other than to depress me. In this game of make-believe we try to persuade ourselves, as well as the people who sent us here, that along the lines advocated by some honourable members will Australia's problems be solved and this country rehabilitated, whereas any one who analyses the position intelligently must know that none of these expedients can possibly put Australia on an even keel.

Raymond Poineare and M. Louis Barthou. THE AUSTRALIAN WAR MEMORIAL. Prime Minister) [11.8] I move That the House do now adjourn. His Majesty the King has been graciously pleased to accede to the request of the Board of Management of the Australian War Memorial, conveyed through the Government of the Commonwealth of Australia, for permission to have a portrait Mahoney, G. W . of himself painted for inclusion in the Makin, N . J. 0. memorial. A commission for painting Martens, G. W. the portrait was entrusted to John A. A. Riordan, D. Berrie, R.C.A., and the work has now Rosevear, J. S. been completed. The picture is a threeScullin, J. H . quarter length portrait of His Majesty Ward, E. J. in the service uniform of Field-Marshal. In proposing to the Government that a Tellers : portrait of His Majesty should be Lawson, George acquired, the War Memorial Board suggested that not only would this be an appropriate act on the occasion of the McCall, W. V. jubilee of the King's reign but that it was also desirable that a portrait of the King, McEwen, J. who wisely guided the Empire through the Nairn, W. M . difficult years of the war, should be hung Page, Dr. Earle in the National Memorial. With these Parkhill, Archdale views the Government agreed and the Paterson, T. High Commissioner was requested to Prowse, J. H . inquire if His Majesty would consent to a Stacey, F. H . portrait being painted. Street, G. A. The Government has been informed that the King has shown a personal inTellers : terest in the proposal and expressed the . Gardner, S. L . .wish to be painted in the uniform of the Thompson, V. C. Commander-in-Chief of the British Army. That was the uniform in which the King Lyons, J. A. waB seen by the Australians when His Menzies, R. G. Majesty visited them on the battle-fields Fisken, A. C. W. in France, and in military hospitals, and when they attended investitures at Buckingham Palace. His Majesty's choice was therefore most appropriate. The portrait is expected to arrive in Australia a few weeks hence. It will be hung in the War Memorial which is now being erected in Canberra. The War Memorial Board believes that there are throughout Australia many public bodies and private citizens who would like, on the occasion of the jubilee, to acquire a recent portrait of His Majesty. In accordance with powers conferred by the Australian War Memorial Act the board will therefore arrange for facsimile colour reproductions to be made. The distribution of the reproductions will provide employment for returned soldiers, portion of the proceeds will be donated by the board to the Returned Sailors and Soldiers' Imperial League of Australia's distress funds which the board has been assisting during the last six years, and the remainder will be used to further the aims and objects of the War Memorial itself. #",44,Tariff Aids In The Depression Distress Greater Without Protected Industries

74,Dr. Earle Page (Cowper,"ActingThe board has received from the press requests for photographs for reproduction. It realizes the desirability of making photographs available not only to those who have made such requests, but to all editors who wish to reproduce the portrait. The board will therefore issue an authorized photograph of the portrait to the press for this purpose, as soon as this can be done without affecting the distribution of the colour reproductions the board will have made. The board will be grateful if any newspaper which may receive an unauthorized photograph of the portrait or of the reproduction the board is publishing, will refrain from using it, as the board believes that such use would adversely affect the distribution of the colour reproduction, and thereby prejudice the attainment of the objects the board has in view. putThat the question be now put.

76,"Gardner, S. L. Mr James Asked The Acting Treasurer,",". 5. Sid tlii? Commonwealth Hank finance the building of that railway by the creation of a credit for the Federal Government; if so, how much was thus ""created""? able member's questions are as follows:1. The capital cost of the railway to 30th June, 1934, was £8,000,000, of which £1,340,000 was provided from revenue, and the balance of £0,000,000 from Works Loan Fund, vide loan expenditure statement on page 88 of budget papers 1934-35. 2. Approximately £5,300,000 was borrowed from the Notes Fund, and the balance of £1,360,000 was borrowed partly from other Commonwealth trust funds and partly from the puhlic. 3. Yes. The position is somewhat complex, hut may be explained thus. When the note issue was handed over to the Commonwealth Bank in 1020, the total accumulated interest, amounting to £7,780,000 derived from investment of the funds, was retained by the Commonwealth, and applied to the redemption of debt. It is not the practice to allocate debt redemptions lo specific items of loan expenditure, vide page 89 of budget papers, which shows the. total amount of loan expenditure on various works, and, at the foot, shows a deduction ot redemptions in one amount. For the purpose of this question, however, it may be regarded that, of the total of £5,300,000 borrowed from the Notes Fund, the proportion redeemed out of earnings retained by the Commonwealth was approximately £3,428,000. On this basis the existing debt is £3,232,000, of which £1,872,000 is due to the Note Issue Department of the Commonwealth Bank, and the balance is due on account of other borrowings partly from the public and partly from the Commonwealth trust funds. 4. The interest is paid partly to the Commonwealth Bank for credit of the Notes Fund, partly to the Revenue Account of the Commonwealth in respect of investment of trust funds, and partly to the public. 5.
