In view of the facts and the general and specific protests made, w ill the Government consider the use of some locality other than Centennial Park as the site for the proposed exhibition? orahle follow:1. Tht Commonwealth Government has expressed its willingness to co-operate w i th the States in the establishment and management of an Empire Exhibition in Australia in 1930, and Centennial Park, Sydney, has been proposed as'a suitable site. 2. I have no information on this point. 3. A ceremony i u connection with the establishment of the Commonwealth was held in ' Centennial Park on the date mentioned. 4. No advice has been received by me from the councils named that such resolutions have been passed by them. 5. Whether the exhibition will be proceeded with depends very largely upon the attitude of the Government of New South Wales.

The donors of the grant seemed quite content that operations be carried out in this way. Suddenly the stream of gold ceased to run. Instead came an intimation that the State was to be punished for not letting contracts for the work, and must bear the cost itself of all tlie work carried out after tlie 16th January and up to the 31st October.

I have to in for m the honourable member that the only practical precaution which it is considered can be taken if the flight is to proceed is to solicit the aid of the mercantile marine, and it is suggested that those acting for Captain Kingsford Smith should communicate with the shipping companies Avhich may have ships in the vicinity of the route to be followed, and request them to direct tlieir vessels to keep a look-out for the aeroplane, and to render assistance if required. If the date of the departure of the aeroplane and f u l l details as to the flight are furnished to the department as soon as they are known, the question of ance in the direction suggested w ill be considered. It . is pointed out, however, that owing to the great expanse of ocean to be crossed and the very limited number of ships of the Royal Australian Navy that could possibly be made available, it is doubtful whether adequate assistance could be rendered.

Economy was his watchword, finance the special sphere for whicli his God-given talents fitted him. He has been in office for four and a half years.

We all are acquainted with those phrases, but for some considerable time Parliament has not exercised any control of the finances. We now have before us what he said ought to be done. Let us look at what he has done, so that he may be judged by his works. He cannot complain that he has not had ample opportunity to give In those strenuous clays, effect to the principles which he said ought to govern the financial policy of In recapitulation of the great the Commonwealth. If he had any doctrines which he wished to apply, he has been in a position to apply them altogether unparalleled, for never before has a Commonwealth Treasurer had a more overwhelming majority, nor a party which gave him such unwavering supWe stabilized the sugar port. I shall outline the position whicli existed when the honourable gentleman emerged from the vasty deep and took his present place in this Parliament. The position which evoked so much hostile, bitter and persistent criticism from They rest upon him may be summed up as follows:-In They were fashioned in the 1921-22 the Commonwealth revenue toThey talled £64,800,000, ancl its expenditure £65,100,000. Customs, excise, ancl direct taxation was £49,600,000. The total amount of taxation per capita was £9 0s. 4d. The gross public debt of the Commonwealth was £416,000,000, and the debt per capita £74 14s. 6d The net public debt was £340,000,000. The number of civil servants employed in tbe Commonwealth was 24,759. now examine the figures for 1922-23, during which the honourable gentleman was in office for four and a half months. He can, therefore, hardly claim credit for the financial position that was outlined in the budget for that year. The Commonwealth revenue in 1922-23 was £63,700,000, the taxation-customs , excise, and direct-£49,800,000 , equal to £8 17s. Id. per capita, the customs and excise taxation accounting for £5 16s. Sd., and the direct taxation, for £3 0s. 5d. of that sum. there had been a steady decrease in tbe per capita taxation during the years 1.920-21, 1921-22, ancl 1922-23, the ' figures having been-1920-21 , £9 13s. 9cl.; 1921-22, £9 0s. 4d.; 1922-23, £S 17s. l d . was ""excessive"" and ""crippling inThis tendency on the part of the last Government to reduce taxation had escaped the honourable gentleman's notice. One may ransack his speeches in vain for the faintest indication that he was aware of this highly significant fact. In 1922-23 risen from £64,700,000 in 1922-28 to the gross Commonwealth public debt was £410,966,316, or £72 5s. 2d. per capita. The net Commonwealth public debt was £335,370,000. The civil servants in the employ of the Commonwealth Government at the end of 1922 numbered 24,-59. Broadly, that was the position when the honourable member for Cowper assumed office as Treasurer. reminded the committee of what were his ideas of sound finance. He ""\vas animated by a passionate desire to effect economy and reduce taxation. He and his party has come into Parliament to act as a brake on the prodigal extravagance of the Ministry of which the present Prime Minister was Treasurer. reduce that taxation which was "" extremely embarrassing to industry,"" which compelled men to borrow in order to pay their assessments, which was a permanent burden, and which "" must become increasingly oppressive under the certain conditions of lower prices."" honourable gentleman said, ""Under these circumstances one would expect in a budget evidence of the most careful estimate of our governmental income, the' most prudent handling of public funds,"" and so on. Four years have rolled by, We shall ancl the present position is as follows: -Commonwealt h revenue, £78,100,000: expenditure, £75,500,000; taxation-cus toms, excise, ancl direct-£5S.?00.000 , or £9 13s. l d . per capita. The Treasurer has raised in customs, excise, and direct taxation a total of £18,360,000 above the level of 1921-22. During the period £64,700,000; the expenditure 1923-24 to 1926-27 he has enjoyed a total revenue £25,710,000 above' that of 1921-22, and has wiped out the accumulated surplus of £7,420,000 whicli existed on the 30th June, 1923. The gross public debt of the Commonwealth It is to be noted that is now £461,067,742, or £75 9s. Id. per capita', and the net public debt is £340,000,000. Contrasting tbefigures,we find that the revenue derived from taxation, which, according to tlie Treasurer, dustry,"" and ""compelling unfortunate taxpayers to borrow money""; which "" withdrew capital from that fund out of which all enterprises are firnnced,"" has £78,100,000 in 1926-27. Through the honourable gentleman's "" indefatigable efforts and careful handling of the finances "" the expenditure has risen from £63,700,000 to £75,500,000. The taxation -which in 1922-23 reached the ""excessive "" amount of £49,800,000 has grown to £58,900,000, the growth per capita having been from £S 17s. Id. to £9 13s. Id. I have The receipts from customs and excise increased from £32,800,000 to £43,500,000, or from £5 16s. Sd. per capita to „ £7 2s. 6£d. per capita. It is proper 'to observe that direct taxation has fallen from £17,000,000 to £15,400,000. or from £3 0s. 5d. to £2 10s. 6-kl. per capita, a net increase of 16s. per capita in four years. The gross public debt which, He was to on the 30th June, 1923, was £410.996.316 was in 1926-27 £461,067,742. The public debt of the States ancl the Commonwealth in 1922-23 was £961.874.957, and in 1926-27 £1,102,402,502. The net Commonwealth debt, after deducting from the gross debt all As the moneys repayable to the Treasury, unexpended loan monevs in hand, and sinking fund, was in 1922-23, £335,370,000, and in 1926-27, £340,000,000. The Treasurer, by taking the 1921-22 figures instead of those for 1922-23, endoing, because his record for that year has deavoured to prove that the increase in the neit debt of the Oommonwealth amounted to only £970,000. But he is not entitled to do this. His 1922-23 budget was made up when he had been in office only four and a half months. We are now able to review his administration over a period of four and a half years. When we consider what he has done in that period to increase our liabilities, and to add to the crushing load of taxation of which he then spoke, we see how little the improved position at the 30th June, 1923, could be attributable to him.' In those four and a half years the net debt of tbe Commonwealth has increased by £5,600,000. revenue derived from customs and excise last year was £18,360,000 more than in 1921-22. That is above the level which the honourable gentleman, before assuming office, declared to be "" excessive,"" and "" embarrassing to industry."" the has £25,710,000 in excess of that for 1921-22. Notwithstanding the increased revenue, the accumulated surplus of £7,420,000 which existed at the 30th June, 1923, has almost disappeared during his administration. It is true that the Treasurer has in hand the sum of £2,921,494; but that amount has been allocated for defence and other purposes. Had there been no surplus, the expenditure would have come from revenue or loan moneys. During the last four years the Treasurer has spent £38,730,000 in excess of the average expenditure which he criticized so harshly in 1921. His average expenditure exceeds by over £9,000,000 per annum tbe expenditure which on the 6th July, 1922, he characterized as grossly extravagant. 1923-24 the honourable gentleman did make a show of economy. The honourable member for Henty( Mr Gullett) suggested that at that time his conscience was pricking him. I do not know about that; but during that period it is true that the national debt was reduced slightly. The ordinary transactions of the year 1923-24 resulted in a surplus of £2,753,000. The accumulated surplus wus then £10,000,000,. Evidently the Treasurer soon because weary in well31 r. Hughes. not been repeated. Taxation has increased, expenditure grown, the public debt swollen, and the accumulated surplus vanished. Notwithstanding that he has enjoyed a revenue approximately £24,000,000 greater than that of 1921-22, the Treasurer has increased the Commonwealth net debt by £5,600,000. During the last three years the expenditure has averaged about £13,000,000 more per annum than that which the Treasurer criticized so harshly in 1921. Notwithstanding the fact that the Treasurer has applied the sum of £4,900,000 out of the accumulated surplus of £10,000,000 to the reduction The of the public debt, our net debt at the 30th June was greater than ever it was previously. And when allowance has been made for the sum of £2,500,000 set aside for naval construction and defence purposes, it is still true that the During Treasurer has spent £12,000,000 per same period the Treasurer annum over and above the 1921-22 level. enjoyed a total revenue of The Treasurer in 1922 accused the present Prime Minister of juggling with the loan estimates. What is his own record ? From the foundation of the Commonwealth to the 30th June, 1923, the expenditure by the Commonwealth on additions, new works, buildings, &c, amounted to £67,933,591. During the five years ended tlie 30th June, 1923, the Government which I had the'honour to lead, spent £27,900,000 on the same account. In four years the present Administration has spent £33,200,000 in similar directions, and for the current financial year a further expenditure of £8,400,000 is contemplated, making a total of over £41,600,000 for five years. That is the record of a Treasurer with a passion for economy! Of the £27,900,000 spent During by the Hughes Government in four years on additions, new works, buildings, &c, the sum of £17,200,000 represented loan money. The present Government has already spent £27,240,000 out of loan, and of the £8,400,000 proposed to be spent this year £8,100,000 represents loan money. The total loan expenditure for the last five years amounts to £35,340,000. I remind honourable members that the Treasurer who has spent this money is the same gentleman who, in 1923, said that "" there should be prudent handling of public funds, most skilful planning and discretion in the programme of public works,"" that we should have greater regard to our circumstances, and reduce position is so cause even the most optimistic among us to pause. In 1921 the honourable gentleman said that he would reduce the army of civil servants then existing. Yet during his term the number of Commonwealth puplic servants has increased from 24,759 to 27,039. He who advocated reduced taxation has increased it : the gentleman whose watchword was economy has been guilty of lavish expenditure without precedent in the history of this country. It is true that the war debt has been reduced; but in view of the large sums of money which passed through his hands the Treasurer should not have found that task difficult. Buti f he has reduced the war debt he has increased our total indebtedness. bably be told that the amount by which the public debt has been increased has been used in the development of Australia. No doubt he has some reason to .advance for what he has done, but it will go hard with him when we ask him to point to the evidences of development which have followed from this vast aud prodigal expenditure by one whose watchword was ' economy. He spoke of the Government which preceded him as having juggled with the loan estimates. Yet the loan estimates of that Government were "" trifles light as a i r "" compared with his OAvn. His persistent charge against us Avas that Ave set forth the public accounts in a way Avhich no one could understand, and this charge he laid against the present Prime Minister who Avill, no doubt, heap coals of fire on his colleague's head, by saying that he himself Avas right in 1921-22, and that his orable gentleman credit for the finances colleague is right now. If the Prime Minister does that, no one can accuse him of lack of versatility. The Treasurer has increased the.public debt, increased taxation, increased expenditure. He has spent lavishly and has saved nothing. He has done all those things which he declared ought not to be done, and he has not done those things Avhich he declared ought to be done. Passing in review the last four and a half years, Avhat is the great outstanding fact that leaps to our eyes? It .13 the unfavorable .balpublic expenditure. The ance of trade. The position is so serious as to serious, so menacing, that eveu the most thoughtless are compelled to pay some attention to it. In 1921 the present Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Pratten) made a speech which I commend to the notice of the Treasurer even at this late hour. In that speech he saidI desire to direct attention to tbe very great importance of legislating as far as possible in the direction of encouraging a favorable balance of trade, because our total indebtedness to Great Britain means an annual interest bill of approximately £20,000,000 which has to be sent out of the country. Since then things have gone to the bad, steadily and rapidly. It is interesting to note Avhat was the position in regard to the trade of this country before the We shall prohonorable gentleman took office. In .1909-10 there Avas an excess of exports over imports of 13.5 million pounds. In 1910-11, that excess Avas 12.5 millions; in 1911-12, one million, and in 1912-13, 1.3 million pounds. The total excess of exports for the four years Avas 28.3 million pounds. Putting aside the period betAveen 1914 and 1918, Ave arrive at the year 1918-19, Avhen the excess of exports Avas 11.6 million pounds. In 1919-20 the excess of exports Avas 50.9 millions, but in 1920-21, there Avas an excess of imports of 31.7 millions. In 1921-22, there Avas again an excess of exports, of 24.8 millions. The total excess of exports during the four years 1918-19 to 1921-22, inclusive, amounted to 55.6 million pounds. In 1922-23 there Avas an excess of imports of 13.9 million pounds for AA'hich my Government must take the responsibility if Ave are to deny the honof 1922-23. That leaA-es a total excess of exports for five years of £41,000,000. Now Ave come to the record of the period during Avhich the honourable member for Cowper has been Treasurer. In 1923-24 there Avas an excess of imports over exports of 21.2 million pounds. In 1924-2o there Avas an excessof exports of 4.S million pounds. In 192-5-26 the excess of imports over exports Avas3 million pounds, and for 1926-27 the excess of imports was 19.9 millions, that is total ance for 1927-28 of £4S,000,000, includexcess of imports over exports for the four ing the £39,000,000 already accumulated years 1923-24 to 1926-27, the period during the past five years. If Ave add the during whicli the honourable gentleman money sent overseas to pay interest on has held office, of 39.3 million pounds, our indebtedness, Ave see that a sum so that during the regime of this Treaof £73,000,000 has to be raised either surer, not only has taxation increased by fresh loans or in some other Avay. from £S 17s.

But his successor will have to foot the bill. There are also other proposals which the last Administration in its wildest and most optimistic moments would never have dared to. suggest. There, for example, is the proposal to construct the BedH ill to Port Augusta railway. ""When the Treasurer decides that a thing needs doing he not only finds reasons for it, but also gets experts to bring forward evidence ancl opinions against which our lay ancl uninformed minds vainly dash. When I was Prime Minister, and brought the greatest railway experts in the world from America ancl England to report upon the third-rail project, they said it was absurd, and could not be used. Yet the Treasurer has found experts who say that the third rail is possible, and, therethat we were hamstringing industry. His fore, the Government is going on with the 'project. The railway from RedH ill to Port Augusta is to cost £1,000,000. Then there is the unification of our railway gauges. I remember the Treasurer standing in his place and opposing, with his coherts, the unification of gauges. At that, time. I committed myself to the venture. enough to believe that transport is the life of the community, and that traffic should flow smoothly throughout the continent. I believed that we could not have an up-to-date transport service without the unification of railway gauges. The Treasurer, who denounced that project, has now become a convert to it. And he has begun the good work, and is well on the way to spending millions of poundsnear at home. I do not censure him for accepting, although tardily, the gospel that I preached so earnestly and vainly in the days gone by; but it will cost millions of pounds to unify the gauges. We arc committed to the scheme, and no matter what befalls the taxpayers must find the money. legions of commissions. I have no doubt that they are doing their work magnificently; but they all cost money. The Treasurer assumed office to reduce the. army of public servants. That army has increased, although I do not say per capita. Melbourne is having a Health Week for the purpose of killing flies. There should be a Health Week in this country to enable the people to rise ancl swat these commissions. No one can deny that the net result of the Treasurer's tenure of oflice has been to enormously increase the burden on the people of this country. Financially, and economically, the Commonwealth is worse off to-day through his mismanagement of the finances. Its burdens have enormously increased, and industry has been grievously crippled*. The honourable gentleman has deliberately drawn £1.1,000,000 of customs revenue-a n increase from £49,000,000 to £60,000,000 from tbe fund which, as he said earlier, supplies the means whereby industry is carried on and encouraged. By excessive taxation he takes the capital which should be available for enterprise, and thus prevents expansion of industry. And he who has done this warned us little finger is thicker than his predecessor's loins. He has gone about this business in no half-hearted way. He would teach the people of Australia to talk about economy-teac h them what extravagance is! He says, "" We have a Loan Council."" I was foolish What is the record of Australia under this magnificent institution, the Loan Council, which he has formed? Do not all men take colour from their environment? The honourable member himselfhas set a pace of wild ancl reckless extravagance to the State governments which in the past have not beeu models of prudence and economy. Can he point to any evidence of economy as the result of the Loan Council? When he himself is spending millions, how can he preach economy to the States? How has the RedH ill to Port Augusta railway agreement been reached? How does any agreement with the States for expenditure come about? I do not say that, in their private capacity, the people of this Then there are country are spending too much money, but I maintain that the curse of the present age is a tendency to extravagance. Our concern should be, can we afford these things? The answer to that question is to be found in the per capita production of Australia. If we can produce enough, for my part, the honourable member can go on bis Avay; but not if production is falling-the able member has given some indication that it is-or if prices are going to fall, as the honourable member says they will -and upon a fair review of world conditions, it seems to me that the time has come when a readjustment of price levels may be expected. What will be our position when prices fall ? With an excess of imports-£39,000,000 in four years, and estimated to reach £48,000,000 next year-and borrow, where shall Ave be if the bottom falls out of the primary industries of Australia ? We have been very fortunate; for years Ave have not had a general drought; but Avhat Avould be our position if a drought befell us? It is very much more important than Avhether the honourable member has been extravagant or not, to ask ourselves Avhat is going to happen if prices fall? We have a burden of debt Avhich cannot be removed. Par from making an effort to reduce taxation or expenditure, the Treasurer has managed to fix firmly upon our limbs for ever burdens added to those which in 1921-22 he declared Avere crushing the A ery life out of industry. He Avho was r such a persistent critic of the previous government, came into office because he managed to persuade the people that, as a result of his occupancy of office, there would be a reduction of taxation and expenditure, and the finances of the country would be placed upon' a sound footing. I ask him now to plead before the bar of public opinion, and advance some reason Avhy he should not be condemned for having committed every sin that he decried Avhen he himself occupied a position on these benches analogous to that held by me to-day. I have already said that the annual revenue during the four and a half years in which the honourable member has been Treasurer has mounted up to £78,100,000. Avhen there Avere seven months of peace and five months of war, and when the Government was dealing Avith those tremendous problems Avhich were involved in the repatriation and return of our men from the front, the expenditure under the heading of defence Avas £86,979,000. In 1926-27, it Avas £35,000,000, or approximately £50,000,000 Mr Hughes. less thau it Avas in 1919; and honorit is estimated that for the current financial year the expenditure on defence will be £38,000,000, or £48,000,000 less than it Avas in 1919. The Treasurer has the tremendous advantage of a diminution in the burden of defence. It was a burden Avhich Avas inescapable AA'hen our men were returning in tens of thousands from the war, and in a year Avhich included five months of actual warfare. having to borrow and ment, and not. tbe Treasurer, alone is responsible. cap fits, Avear it. If I single out the Treasurer for criticism, surely he cannot be offended, because it Avas to me he addressed his many instructive criticisms. My former distinguished colleague, Avho is TIOAV at the head of the Government, escaped them. His Avithers are unwrung. Speaking in the Senate on the 1924-25 budget, Senator Greene said:Making due allowance for a reduced expenditure on the war, tlie annual recurring 1 expenditure, although a good deal of it is not shown in the (igures presented to us in the budget, is to-day considerably greater than it has ever been: a i i d ' when the other test is applied, that of combining expenditure from revenue with expenditure from loan, while still making due allowance for a reduced expenditure on war, there is a vastly greater annual recurring expenditure to-day than we have ever previously had. If the honourable senator could then claim that the Government had not effected a reduction in expenditure in the only year the Treasurer made any attempt to economize, I wonder what he would say to-day. We have the record of the Treasurer before us, his homilies, his code of ethics, and his performances. Never since the Avorld began was there a greater gulf between promise and performance than is here made evident. The honourable gentleman has sailed for many years in placid seas. It was my lot to steer the barque of State through In 1919, greatly troubled Avaters. Then the clouds of war were dark, and conditions abnormal; but the Treasurer is a sailor in summer seas. He is now experiencing his first gale, a mere storm in a teacup, a little criticism from isolated members of his OAVII party. He is not greatly concerned. He has behind him a secure majority. But let him throw his mind back to the circumstances under",26,Budget 1927 2s

48,Mr Hughes,"Let him whom thewhich the previous Government carried on the affairs of this country, and, indeed, that it is not always the Nationalist secof this House. Parliament was then the custodian of the public purse. The majority behind the Government was uncertain. The honourable member came to restore that which already existed. Never in the history of the Commonwealth has this Parliament had less control of the public purse than it has at this day. ' That brings me to Some observations made the other day by the honourable niem/ ber for Warringah ("" Mr Parkhill). The honourable member seemed astounded and somewhat displeased because some honourable members had ventured to make any reflections whatsoever upon the Government. He reminded the House, as .did the honourable member for Dalley( Mr The members of the Nationalist party Theodore) a moment ago, that the sins of the Treasurer are not solely his own, but must be borne by the whole administration. So be it. But the honourable member went into the Ministry to impress on Ministers his ideas of what a Government should do. cepted the honourable member's doctrine, or he has accepted theirs. ""But,"" the honourable member for Warringah says, "" the proper place to discuss these things is in the party room."" In what room may I ask? Are they to be discussed in the party room of a party of twelve, of whom seven form a majority, and-of that seven four are Ministers and one a whip, while others are well provided for ? Isi t in that room that the affairs of Australia are to be discussed, and the destinies of the Commonwealth decided? If so, they cannot be discussed or decided by the Nationalist members of the committee. discussed only by that happy few, that band of brothers in the Country party to whom the world has been so very kind. The Government is a government of two sections, each retaining its individuality, and struggling determinedly against all attempts at a merger. We still have the Country party. I do not ^ ally object to. having what these gentlemen, or five of them, decide to push down my throat. We must remember that the policy of the Government is determined by discussion among its component Ministers. We have had it clearly demonstrated tion of the Government that decides the policy of the Cabinet. Sometimes the few override the many and the Country party gets its way. Honourable members must recollect vividly those stirring incidents which occurred during the debate on the per capita payments. The Nationalist party was so far from seeing the light according to the Treasurer that it had in its platform a plank providing that the per capita payments were not to be interfered with without the consent of the States. From what happened, perhaps the honourable member for Warringah may gather some information and some consolation. I may remind him of what took place. were compelled to vote against a plank of their own platform, a plank on which they had pledged themselves to their constituents--that is, if they were elected upon that platform, as I was-simpl y because the honourable the Treasurer and Either Ministers have acthe other three ministers of the Country party, with two others, had decided that they must do so. How can such a position as that be discussed in the party room? Yet will it be contended that in such circumstances the proper course for honourable members is to remain silent? Is ^he platform of the party nothing? What are party conferences for? The call goes forth from Dan to Beersheba for the party oi gauizations to crystallize their views and to set out what should be the guiding principles of their members-the y do so, and these principles are put into a platform. When it is They can be proposed that such principles should be thrown to the winds, are those who were elected to support them expected not to say a word? PerhapsI am as well able as any honourable member to speak upon the obligations that a man owes to his party. All my life I have been a party man, and no half-hearted one at that. Por years, with object to that. But I most emphaticmy eyes open, I belonged to the Labour party, in which I bound myself to vote upon the planks of its platform, and upon the fate of a government, as the majority in caucus ' might decide. I knew then where I stood. I had the chance to Lave the platform fixed to suit myself, and I did what I could to get it so fixed, that it might operate in the direction I thought desirable. I understood perfectly that I could remain in that party only so long as I complied with the obligations I had contracted. I was bound to support the platform, but on all everything else I was free. I speak, of course, of the Labour party as it was iu my time and not as it is to-day. free men, and express our real opinions. I understood that the difference between the present Labour party and the Nationalist party was that one was bound and the other free. I remember saying that on the platform, when I was supporting the candidature of the honourable member for Warringah, I said, speaking of the Labour party, "" What are these men ? They are bound, and have not a soul of their own. They are bound to do what the caucus and people outside tell them to do."" The honourable member then agreed \vith» me. I! shall not here venture to dogmatize upon what are the duties of a man to his country and his party except to observe that, when the interest of country and party clash, I have always considered it to be my duty to support country before party. I remind the honourable member, and all who think with him, that when I took the step which severed my connection with the Labour party-and country-when I disregarded caucus and ventilated my individual views, not in some dark subterranean chamber, but on the public platforms of this country, the honourable member and all his friends rent the Heavens with loud acclamations. They said, ""It is a great thing that this man has done. He has stood for his country, and has thrown over his party."" recent case. when Mr Loughlin, South Wales Parliament, took similar action, the honourable member for Warringah and bis friends applauded. So that the honourable member cannot, with consistency, say that in all circumstances we should sit like sheep, and. offer butcher. running headlong on to the .rocks; when Ave see that on every hand the Mr Hughes. people of the country are disturbed, alarmed, angered at the policy of the honourable gentleman, and groaning under the crushing burden of taxation, demand that their burdens shall be lightened, are Ave to remain silent ? Is there to be no time Avhen the shackles of party are to be throAvn aside, and one's duty to one's country done? If we call ourselves free, let us, Avhen the need arises, speak as As for me, AvhenI see a Avrong thing done, I speak and demand redress. The public expect me to speak. It is nothing to me Avhether the public condones anything that the honourable member for Warringah does or fails to do. All my life I have spoken AvhenI have seen that things Avere not right. The' honourable member for Warringah preaches the new and strange' doctrine that we should not discuss these things publicly. Those of us Avho have been members of this Parliament for some years remember hoAV, in season and out of season, the present Treasurer denounced the last Government. On votes of censure Avhich Avere more than mere formal expressions of opinion; at times when the existence of the Government Avas in jeopardy, the honourable gentleman, not once but many times, gathered his cohorts and opposed the Government. The Treasurer and other Ministers now sitting on the Treasury it made some stir in this bench have even denounced me in the middle of an election, campaign. The honourable member for Warringah cannot deny that. But UOAV Ave are to be silent; and by our silence support, that Avhich Ave believe to be dangerous to the Avelfare of the Commonwealth. Honourable members have heard my indictment of the Treasurer's mismanagement of the finances. Aud to lake a still more Does he deny the truth of it? Only the other day He cannot. Here and there I may have of the New done the honourable gentleman an injustice, but in the main my indictment is true, and cannot be challenged. The Treasurer assumed "" office with the expressed intentionof reducing taxation. He has increased it . He came here to reduce expenditure, to act as a our throats to the brake on extravagance. The honourable When Ave see the party gentleman has been the most extravagant Treasurer in the history of this country. He came here to set an example to lesser men, yet Le has been tbe cbief sinner. That is incontrovertible. And now we are told that such things must not be mentioned. What was the chief indictment Against Mr Lang? That he was a Red? Good. I denounced him. That he was extravagant ? I denounced him for that too. But contrast his extravagance with that of the honourable the Treasurer. I think it is ""level money on the field."" Yet we are told that we must speak about his delinquencies with bated breath. If we are free to speak, why did the honourable member for Warringah denounce the honourable member for Henty and rayself? the right honourable gentleman, who had not then spoken. fect understanding on this matter. As I have intimated, when I belonged to the Labour party I was bound by its platform, and I was quite aware of, and honoured my obligations. When a Government goes to the country on a definite platform and asks for support on that policy, those who are elected on the government party ticket are bound to support the issues upon which it is elected. But honourable members retain the right to criticise gross see foreign commodities coming unrestrictedly into the country, our public debt mounting up, and sheer catastrophe in sight, is it not our duty to utter a word of warning and criticism? And there are other matters too that call for strong comment. Government brought in a Commonwealth Savings Bank Bill, and many days were taken"" up in its discussion. My attitude to the bill was perfectly clear. I was in favour of the housing section of the scheme, but I denounced the attempt to dismember the Commonwealth Bank. I asked the Treasurer had he any mandate from the people for his action, and' he could not claim that he had. party was committed to the measure, and voted for the dismemberment of the bank. I voted against it. The honourable member for Warringah said that I was wrong in denouncing the Treasurer. . But what are the facts? The other day while the bill was before the Senate we listened to T«31 a most humiliating recantation from the Treasurer. It was claimed, when the bill was before this House, that the provision for the division of the two branches of the bank was absolutely necessary. Then the Treasurer comes along and tells us, although not actually in these words, that the dismemberment of the Commonwealth Bank is not necessary. I suggest that, had the honourable gentleman not made his statement, the cat would have been out of the bag, and there would have been trouble. We are told we ought to discuss these things in the party room. But what is the policy of the Government on the CommonI did not denounce wealth Bank? What is to be the attitude of a man like myself who opposed its dismemberment, and finally has to listen to a speech by the Treasurer, in which he said, in effect, "" You were quite right. We. are not going on with the measure in its original form."" I am not to be told what are my duties as a member of this House and a representative of the people, for I know them very well and these many years have diligently performed them. Whenever something is proposed which I believe to be against the interests of the people, I shall let honourable members know where I stand in regard to it. mismanagement. When we I shall not detain tlie committee much longer. I have shown that financially and industrially the Commonwealth is worse off to-day than it, was when the Treasurer took office. He has increased the national debt, made heavier the burden of taxation, and set the pace in Recently the a race of extravagance the like of which this country has never previously known. That is his record. For denouncing it I have been censored; but I am. content to stand or fall by anything 1 have said. If the honourable gentleman has a good defence, let him make it. He will find that I shall listen to him as patiently as he has listened to me, and if he can convince me that I have done him The an injustice I shall be jirepared to withdraw my charges, and to crown him with tliat garland which, to the mind of his admirers, he so richly deserves. It has been said of some of us that we are not fit to. tie his shoe strings. It is not his feet, but his head with which I find fault. I admit the goodness of his intentions;",28,Budget 1927 2s

50,Mr Hughes,"Let us have a perbut, we nil. know whither loads the pathway so paved. I say emphatically that upon a fair review of the honourable gentleman's management of the finances of this country it is clear beyond doubt that we are rushing headlong to a financial and industrial hell. ter and Minister for External Affairs) [4.57] -In the course of this debate many criticisms have been levelled against the Government's financial proposals, but up to the present we have had no suggestion from critics as to the remedy for the lamentable state of affairs which they depict and deplore. Dalley( Mr Theodore), when asked for his remedy, said that it was not usual for the physician to prescribe until he had been called in ; but it is extremely unlikely, in view of his. record, that that honourable member will ever be called in to prescribe for any financial ills that may overtake the Commonwealth. It would be extremely unwise to seek his aid, seeing that he has made an absolute failure of the things which he has touched. Most of the statements concerning the Government's financial proposals have been general in character. The right honourable gentleman who has just resumed his seat made a number of generalizations. I listened carefully to what he had to say. The only definite statement which he made in support, of his criticism of the budget was that more expenditure was budgeted for by the Government during 1927-28 than during the year when the Treasurer took office. Similar statements were made with regard to the per capita payments It is desirable, therefore, that we should examine a little more closely the Government's, financial proposals. It. is not sufficient merely to make is laying down the course for the Gogeneral statements. Weshould analyse the expenditure and ascertain its relation to the loan position, the per capita payments, and other commitments. Up to the present, this has not been done. I recognize, as the right honourable gentleman frankly confessed, that he was having a tilt at the Treasurer, and I believe that on other occasions the Treasurer has had a tilt at the right honourable gentleman. I take exception, 'however, to the right honourable member's statement that when a few years ago the Treasurer, as a private member, attacked the Government of the day, he confined his attention to' the Prime Minister of that time. ""When I bad the good fortune to be associated in a government with the right honourable member for North Sydney, I distinctly remember many spirited attacks by the present Treasurer upon me and upon the financial proposals whicli I had the honour to submit; but T can assure honourable-members. I bear no grudge against the honourable gentleman, who is now my colleague. I wish to make it perfectly clear that The honourable member for it is of no use for honourable members to say that in criticizing the budget they are directing their shafts against the Treasurer, because the budget sets out the policy, not of the Treasurer, but of the Government. L take full responsibility for the proposals contained in the budget, and I do not appreciate the suggestions which have been made that the Treasurer alone is responsible for the budget. Consequently, I decline to accept the offer of loyalty which the honourable member for Henty( Mr Gullett) was good enough to make. He indicated that he was prepared to support the Prime Minister, but certainly would not support tbe Treasurer. May I remind him that this is a composite Government? I am not prepared to accept loyalty to me personally as the Leader of the Government, unless it is tendered to the Government us a whole. I . wish it to be clearly understood that the Government is responsible for the budget proposals, and thut it will take the full responsibility for them. Let me also make it plain that I do not like the suggestion that the Treasurer vernment to follow. I venture to say that I have a few ideas of my own on matters of policy and particularly regarding the vital question' of the financial position of the country, and that 1 would not be dragooned by any member of the Cabinet into adopting a course of which I did not approve. The right honourable member for North Sydney suggested that I was somewhat reluctantly forced to agree to the",31,Budget 1927 2s
51,Mr Bruce (Flinders,"Prime Miniswithdrawal of the per capita payments. On that point I may assure honourable members that I was chiefly responsible for that item in the Government's policy, because I was convinced that it was necesliberality of treatment accorded by the sary to take action to stabilize the financial relations of the Commonwealth and the States. May I add that the arrangement which now I belive has been consummated, is a complete vindication of the Government's policy. The charge of extravagance has been levelled against the Government. I propose, in an analysis of the budget figures, also educational and training facilito show that not only is the Government not extravagant, but that it has reduced public expenditure to the minimum, having due regard to the carrying out of the policy which has been endorsed by the people of Australia. It is time this was done in order to set the position clearly before the people. The figures which I propose to analyze are to be found on pages 6 and 7 of the budget papers. The total expenditure, exclusive of excriticism of the Government's proposals penditure for business undertakings, for territories 'of the Commonwealth, and for payments to or for the States, is £50,855,434, set out under several headings. The first covers war and repatriation services, for which an amount of £29,613,158 is provided. Of that total £20,750,000 represents interest and sinking fund upon our war indebtedness. I do not think that any honourable member would suggest the repudiation of our obligations to the bond-holders of Australian securities, or a diminution in the contribution to the sinking fund in respect of the dead weight Avar debt of the Commonwealth. It may be said that the sinking fund payments are very highperhaps extravagant in relation to the funding of £92,000,000 of Avar debt oAving to the British Government, being on the basis of £1 Is. Sd. per cent. That, hoAvever, Avas a definite arrangement made with the British Government, and I think we are entitled to feel a little proud that increase in the maximum individual penof the allied countries Australia was the first to face its Avar' indebtedness in this Avay, and even before Britain made arrangements to fund its debt to America. Another item is £7,694,000 for the provision of war pensions. under that heading has been expanding in recent years. My colleague ( Sir Neville Howse, AVIIO is administering tha Eepatriation Act, informs me that Ave shail not reach the peak period of this expenditure until 1930. This increase in expenditure is due to the Government to Australian soldiers and their dependants, and is explained'in part by the special provision made recently for the children of ex-service men. I feel sure that no honourable member Avould suggest a reduction in that expenditure by one farthing. The next item is £875,534 to cover the provision for hospitals, and ties for the children of men Avho lost their lives in the Avar. No honourable member would suggest that the total expenditure under Avar and repatriation services, should be reduced. Certainly the GoA-ernment cannot be accused of extravagance under that heading. The next broad heading under which the expenditure is set out is ""Defence, £4,713,000."" I haAe heard a good deal of r for the defence of Australia, but generally it has been to the effect that too little money has been provided for the purpose. I do not say that that attitude is adopted by honourable members opposite, but I am sure that no honourable member Avho supports the Government Avould agree to the reduction of the proposed defence vote. I ' am convinced that an overwhelming bodv of public opinion throughout the Commoirwealth is favorable to the adoption of an adequate defence policy; consequently, this figure cannot be reduced. The next division of the expenditure is made under the heading of "" Special appropriations other than war and repatriation."" The amount im*olved is £12,851,330. The main item in this total is £9,400,000 for invalid and old-age pensions. Our expenditure has increased to this figure since 1923-24, Avhen it stood at £6,500,000, OAving principally to au sion to £1 per week, and a general liberalizing of the conditions. Is any honourable member of tbe committee prepared to take upon himself the responsibility of advocating a departure from this generous Expenditure treatment of the infirm and aged persons in our community? I hardly think so. Public opinion throughout the Commonwealth is favorable to the provision of adequate old-age and invalid pensions, and the Government has, of necessity, to find the money to make the payments. Under the same general heading provision is made for the expenditure of the sum of £1,395,000 in respect of interest and sinking fund on our indebtedness other than war. This is a charge which at present we cannot avoid, although by the wise and prudent expenditure of loan moneys in the future Ave may prevent the total from groAving. is being provided to pay interest upon transferred property taken over from the States, and I am sure that uo honourable member Av.il I suggest that Ave should repuvided to stimulate it? And Avhat Avould diate this obligation. A total of £426,000 is accounted for by special appropriations made pursuant to A-arious acts of Parliament, and is money for which the Government of the day is compelled to budget. It includes money for tbe payment of salaries to judges aud members of various boards and commissions. Possibly honourable members may consider that the time has arrived for a reversal of our policy in respect of some of these appointments, hut even that criticism cannot affect expenditure to which Ave are already pledged. The Government is quite prepared to listen to constructive criticism in relation to a subof such items as these, to point ject of this description. There are several items uncier the heading of ""Special appropriations,"" which I will describe as doubtful. Eor instance, an amount of \l ji j; ,1 ! ; :| be of the opinion that something should 1 ,' suggest that the basis of the payments should be changed; but, generally speaki' suggested creased expenditure. of the doubtful class are the Avine export bounty, £250,000; the iron and steel bounty, £295,000; aud the bounty on cotton and cotton yarn, £150,000. If the Government Avere to ask honourable members to discontinue these payments to-morrow, Avould they be Avilling to do so? I think it could be said that even the honourable gentlemen Avho ha»-e adversely criticized our financial proposals ilr. Bruce. Avould not be prepared to take that specific step to decrease expenditure. What would be said by honourable members representing Queensland interests if we were to suggest that the cotton bounty should be discontinued? And Avhat Avould be said on behalf of those who are interested in the manufacture of cotton goods in Australia if a similar proposal Avere to be made in respect of the bounty on cotton yarn? Would honourable memThe sum of £260,000 bers Avho believe that the development of the iron and steel industry is vital to our national greatness agree to a proposal to Avipe out the bounty that has been probe said if Ave Avere to suggest that the Avine export bounty should be abolished? It appears, therefore, that there is no item, even among the doubtful ones that T have enumerated, in which we could make any extensiAe saving. r The proposed vote of £313,623 for "" Miscellaneous services"" is the next heading. This money is needed to meet our expenses in respect to the visit of the Duke and Duchess of York, our membership of the League of Nations, and obligations of a minor character. It may be possible, by a close' scrutiny out Avhere economies could have been effected, but I assure honourable members that the Government has already done everything possible to reduce £675,000 is provided for the payment of the expenditure under this heading. As maternity alloAvances. While a feAv people a matter of fact, the item offers very in the community advocate the complete little scope for reduction, for the figures abandonment of our maternity allowance shown in this year's Estimates are lower legislation, the great majority appear to than any corresponding total in the last five years, aud less by £200,000 than j be clone to make it more effective. They those of last year. An amount of £284,049 is provided for "" Additions new works ancl buildings."" The criticism that ing, the neAv basis that have been has been offered respecting this proposed Avould involve an invote is that it is not large enough. Other items The remaining item Avhich is included in the total of £50,S55,000 is £3,079,774 to meet the ordinary departmental expenditure, and no honourable member has indicated a Avay to reduce it. A government is directly responsible for the ordinary expenditure upon departments, and by considering its provision in this connection one is able to form an accurate opinion as to whether a budget has been carefully pruned or is extravagant. Five years ago the expenditure upon departments amounted to £2,910,720, so that there has not been very much increase since then. ""Wheni t is .remembered that ^. ment are embraced in the expenditure of this £3,079,000, and that the ramifications and obligations of governments are much greater under modern conditions than formerly, I think it w ill be agreed that the Cabinet should be congratulated upon having kept this figure so low. I have now covered all the items which r make the total of £50,855,000, and I again invite honourable members to indicate a single'direction in which a substantial reduction could be made. 1 shall now analyse the expenditure under the heading "" Business TJndertak* to be spent upon the services conducted by the Postmaster-General's department. The expenditure, for this purpose in 1923-24 was £9,273,000. Our critics, looking at that figure and the amount proposed for this year, have said that the increase is outrageous, and they have all taken it into account when criticizing our general * financial policy. But what is the situation ? Although the expenditure has in creased largely the revenue has also increased; and every year this great business enterprise has shown a small margin of revenue in excess of expenditure. Let nte remind honourable members that this is ,the largest business enterprise in the Commonwealth, find thatas it expands the community benefits. In setting out its accounts provision is made for the whole of the interest due on borrowed money, and for a sinking fund of 30s. per cent, which will redeem tlie loans in 30 years. In the circumstances I do not think that honourable members have shown great ' ' right honourable member for North Sydney, like some other honourable members, had a good deal to say about the * loan expenditure on postal services, and ) them from the inception of federation to 1922, with tbe amount since expended, in discussing this subject one needs to be aware of all the facts. Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton) referred the other night t.o the amount that had been spent from loan on business undertakings in connection with the Postmaster-General's department, and he discussed the subject on public platforms the whole of the activities of the Governduring the last election campaign. I could never understand why he did so; but it suited me admirably. Prom the inception of federation, in 1901, u n t i l I had the honour to become Treasurer of the Government led by the right honourable member for North Sydney, the expenditure out of loan money on postal services amounted to about £2,500,000. The remainder of the expenditure that was incurred on capital works was provided out of reveuue. I sent a questionnaire to all the countries throughout the civilized world in which post office services were operating, irrespective of ings."" Provision is made for £12,223,353 whether they were privately or publicly controlled, asking them to state how money was provided for capital works of this description. In pructicalhy every case the work was carried out with loan money, and to redeem the asset during its lifetime sinking funds were established. Tbe right honourable member for North Sydney knows that that policy was introduced in Australia by his own Government. In 1922 it was decided to formulate a policy for the expenditure of £9,750,000 on postal undertakings over a period of three years in order to bring the services up to something like the desired standard; but expenditure at that rate had not been sufficient to meet the needs or the public. The demand for additional services grew faster than they could be given. In all expanding business enterprises it is the custom to borrow money for developmental purposes, and to provide for the redemption of the debt by means of sinking funds. If a private organization had been conducting our wisdom in assailing the Government for postal services and it had followed its expenditure in this direction. The that policy it would have been congratulated upon its effective administration. Surely the Government is entitled to similar commendation. great increase that has occurred in our The operations of the Postmaster-General's Department are expected to show he compared the amount expended upon a surplus of £167,647 for this year, but the railways, the other big business undertaking of the Commonwealth, show for the same period a defiThe cit of £395,225, leaving a' debit balance of £227,578 to be charged against the general Consolidated Revenue. the transcontinental railway is partly responsible; but although it is not yet able to pay anything towards the interest on capital expenditure, it has reached that stage when the revenue slightly exceeds the running costs. I hope that the position will continue to improve. The Government is quite prepared to reduce expenditure where possible, but the eastwest railway is a vital artery of the Commonwealth, and interference with it would be a serious blunder. The Central Australia railway from Oodnadatta to Alice Springs also shows a deficit, but for that this Government is not responsible; it is merely honoring a solemn obligation, accepted by the Commonwealth when the Northern Territory was taken over from South Australia. If because of the present financial circumstances and the difficulty in raising loan money, South Australia ^agreed to the postponement of that expenditure, the Commonwealth Government would be prepared to acquiesce. Amongst other obligatory expenditure is that upon the Murray River Waters scheme. I hope that there will be a conference between representatives of the Commonwealth and of the States concerned, to decide to what extent the complete scheme should be proceeded with, and whether because of the financial circumstances of the moment it would not be desirable to temporarily curtail the proposed expenditure by not proceeding with a portion of the scheme at the present time. The' territories for which the Commonwealth is responsible involve a deficit of £446,215, the greater portion of which has been caused by the Northern tory. The development of this vast estate is a problem that has tried the wealth Government since it was taken over from South Australia. I hope that after full investigation the Development and. Migration Commission will evolve a scheme under which the rate of progress will be more rapid than in the past;but until we are able to find a solution of what -has proved a most difficult problem, we cannot hope for the complete disappearance of this obligation. The last large item of expenditure from Consolidated Revenue is an amount of £11,147,912 for payments to the States: The expenditure for the current year is based on the finanMr Brvoe. For that deficit cial agreement between the Commonwealth and the States. Recent discussions in Parliament have shown that the overwhelming majority of honourable members are determined that the States shall get fair and equitable treatment, and I am certain that this Parliament would not tolerate any reduction of those payments. The first of them is a contribution of £7,584,912 towards the interest on State debts. My recent observations of the temper of this Parliament convince me that any proposal to offer the States less than the equivalent of the per capita grants which have been, withdrawn would be strenuously resisted. Another obligation is the contribution of £885,000 towards the sinking fund for the redemption of State debts. The right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes), said that the Government is by that payment placing an intolerable burden ou the Australian people. But I suggest that an adequate sinking fund for the redemption of State debts is desirable and necessary. The contributions towards it must be made by the Commonwealth or the States, and as the money will come out of the pockets of the same people in either case, it makes no 1 difference to them whether it is paid from taxation levied by the Commonwealth or from taxation levied by the States. In stead of placing on the shoulders of the Australian people an intolerable burden, that cannot be shifted,for 58 years, twe are ensuring the establishment of a fund which will strengthen Australia's credit abroad, and the contributions towards it Terriwill be more than counterbalanced by the better conditions upon which we shall be able to borrow in future. The other resources of every Commonform of Commonwealth assistance to the States is the special payment of £378,000 to Tasmania, and £300,000 to Western Australia. These special payments have been approved by this Parliament, ancl are generally endorsed by the people as a just and equitable method of recognizing the special circumstances of those two States. The Commonwealth's obligations in regard to +hese various payments to the States is unavoidable, and an honourable member who did not oppose them when they were before the House, cannot now condemn them as indications of the Government's extravagance, unless he is prepared to vote for their reduction. The £2,000,000 provided for federal aid roads is payable under the policy approved by Parliament for the gradual construction of a great * . posed that scheme, but their views did not prevail. The policy was criticized also by certain people outside Parliament, but the overwhelming majority of this House and the people recognized that transport f Expenditure upon the unification and extension of railways is too tremendous to be faced at the present time, and because the people recognize the influence that the internal combustion engine has had upon the problem of transport, they * assist the States in the making and improvement of roads. I have recently toured the States of Queensland and Western Australia, and everywhere I went the Government's policy was recognized as one that would greatly facilitate the development of Australia.

Some honourable members opthis special taxation; but all motorists are agreed that good roads mean economy of petrol consumption, less wear and tear of cars and tires, and other benefits which repay them amply for the special impost they pay. is the most vital need of Australia. We have heard a great deal about the growth of Commonwealth expenditure from £64,195,000, in 1921-22, to. £75,S1'1,000 last, year, an increase of £11,616,000. The honourable gentleman, who quoted those figures to the House, asked whether there was any need to look endorse the Government's proposal to for further evidence of the extravagance of the Government. That charge I propose to analyse. The following table shows a comparison of the expenditure of 1921-22 with the estimated expenditure for 1927-28, under the broad headings under which the receipts and expenditure of the Commonwealth are set out on pages 6, 7, 8 and 9 of the budget papers:1921-22. 1927-28 -Increase: Estimate Decrease. 31,337,000 29,613,000 -1,724,000 . . . . 3,899,000 4.713,000 -814,000 3,290,000 9,400,000 -4,110,000 403,000 1,655,000 -1,252,000 30,000 742,000 -712,000 1,207,000 1,054,000 -153,000 2,911,000 3,080,000 -169,000 331,000 314,000 -17,000 1,563,000 284,000 -1,279,000 46,971,000 50,855,000 -3,884,000 9,179,000 12,223,000 -3,044,000 .. .. 624,000 970,000 -346,000 386,000 615,000 -229,000 6,814,000 7,585,000 -771,000 .. 885,000 -885,000 221,000 678,000 -457,000 2,000,000 -2,000,000 7,035,000 11,148,000 -4,113,000 64,195,000 75,811,000 11,616,000 An examination of those figures will show how false a basis has been taken for the conclusions which have been drawn. in the expenditure occurred in respect to old-age pensions, £4,110,000; the post office, £3,044,000; and payments to the States, £4,113,000. Does any discredit attach to the Government for those increases? Does not every honourable member of this House agree with the liberalization of the old-age aud invalid pensions, which has resulted in the increased expenditure? use as a weapon against the Government an expenditure which has been enthusiastically supported by the critic who would have been prepared to turn the Government out of office if it had not incurred it? Does not every honourable member of this House endorse the policy of expanding the post office, and the facilities which it provides to the people? Is it quite fair to use this figure to attack the Government, without pointing out that the whole of the increase in the expenditure has been compensated for by an increase in the revenue, and that every member of this Parliament has pressed for the expansion which has caused the increased expenditure, and has endorsed every action of the Government with regard to it ? I should have thought that our critics would have paused in their stride to commend and welcome the increase in the activities of this great public utility. There are also the payments to the States, which £771,000. from any new financial arrangements with the States, that increased expenditure would have been necessary because of our greater population. Those payments are based on the rate of 25s. per capita. I have already dealt with the item, contribution to sinking funds, which represents an increase of £885,000. Special payments to Western Australia and Tasmania account for an increase of £457,000, the amount in 1921-22 being £221,000, as compared with £678,000 estimated for 1927-28. It is true that the expenses of the Commonwealth have increased to that extent, but the burden upon the taxpayers has not been made any heavier. Had the money not been Mr Hriifin. raised aud expended by the Commonwealth, the States of Western Australia and Tasmania would have had to obtain The greatest increases it otherwise. The argument that Commonwealth expenditure has increased in that direction, therefore, falls to the ground. We now come to the debt of the Commonwealth, about which so much has been said. The gross debt of the Commonwealth in 1922, was £416,070,000. From that sum must be deducted debts amounting to £51,230,000 incurred on be1 Isi t fair to half of the States, leaving the net debt for Oommonwealth purposes £364,840,000. In 1923 the gross debt was £410,996,000, which, after allowing £52,487,000 for debts incurred on behalf of the States, left a net Commonwealth debt of £358,509,000. For 1924 the < figures were respectively £415,600,000, £53,636,000, and £361,964,000, and for 1927, £461,067,000, £94,456,000 and £366,611,000. It will be seen that the debts incurred by the Commonwealth on behalf of the States increased from £51,230,000 in 1922 to £94,456,000 in 1927, a difference of £4.3,226,000. The net debt of the Commonwealth during chat period has increased by £1,771,000. that the Treasurer has been in office, the net debt has increased by over £5,000,000. seem so anxious to blame the present -< Treasurer for what has taken 2>lace during his term of oflice, I may justly claim have increased by the credit for the net Commonwealth debt I point out that, apart having decreased front £364.840,000 in 1922 to £35S,509,000 in 1923j during my term of office as Treasurer. Honourable members cannot have it both ways. But, I shall meet them on their own ground and commence with 1926, since which time the net debt of the Commonwealth has increased by about £8,000,000. Did honourable members who criticized that increase believe tliat in this young developing country, with all its obligations, our national debt would have decreased t during that period ? If they did, they were uuduly optimistic. Side by side with that increase of £3,000,000 in our national debt, the dead-weight debt of the Commonwealth has been reduced by over £36,000,000.

I remind honourable members of the effect of a reduction of the bank rate in England by one half per cent. lating almost anything else could' have had. A reduction of direct taxation has the same effect. There is another angle from which this question must be considered. Supposing this suggestion for increasing direct taxation were given effect. we wiped out borrowing, and raised all the money required by direct taxation, the finances of the States would be seriously affected. Until the war the Commonwealth did uot invade the field of direct taxation at all, except in one instance. The field of direct taxation was left to the States, because the Commonwealth was given the power to levy customs and excise. The exigencies of the war drove us into the field of direct taxation; but if we stay there we will limit the field making a total for the Commonwealth of left to the States, the only one from which they can raise the revenue they require. The question of revenue duties is one to which, we should give serious consideration. It seems to be suggested that the Commonwealth Government has no desire to reduce revenue duties. As a matter of fact we would be only too pleased to do it.to the full extent of our capacity, provided we were still able to meet onr liabilities. Eor the year 1925-26 the total, revenue derived from customs and excise was £39,198,878. Of this sum £11,358,989 was collected in respect of excise, while the balance was protective and revenue duty. Two year3 ilr. Uruoe. ago the Government did reduce revenueIt has an immediate repercusduties by £750,000, and we hope to go further in that direction, but our great objective must be to stimulate trade and industry, and to provide additional employment. How far do revenue duties and excise go towards achieving those ends? Excise is practically confined to One narcotics and spirits, and I do not think a reduction there would help industry The crippling much. The Government is quite prepared to admit that it is desirable to reduce I not revenue duties as far as possible, but it believes that direct taxation should also be reduced to a minimum. It is suggested that in Australia we are going too far in the imposition of indricet taxation, aud that in this respect our position is quite different from that of other countries. The estimated revenue of Great Britain for the year 1927-28 from customs and That had a greater stimuexcise amounts to £257,880,000. That is effect on industry than revenue from indirect taxation and is practically all derived from revenue imports. Eor the same period the revenue from direct taxation is estimated at £432,900,000, making the total revenue from taxation, direct and indirect, If £670,780,000. . Therefore, the revenue from indirect taxation is 37 per cent., nf the total revenue, and that from direct taxes 63 per cent. In Australia we cannot obtain figures Inter than those for 1925-26, because of the difficulty in obtaining the records from the States. The customs duties for that year were £27,839,889. Excise revenue was £11,358,989, and the total revenue from indirect taxation was £39,198,878. That from direct taxation was £15,174,127, £54,373,005. Direct taxation by the States gave £23,452,704, so that the total taxation, direct and indirect, for the Commonwealth and the States amounted to £77,S35,709. Working out the respective percentages on the basis recently adopted by the Customs Department of excise and revenue duties being £24,228,402 and other taxation, Commonwealth and State, both protective and direct, at £53,607,307, we find that revenue duties comprise 31 per cent, of the taxation collected, while protective and direct taxation comprises 69 per cent. Omitting protective duties, the figures would be, revenue duties 39 per cent., and direct taxes 61 per cent. be seen that Australia is levying direct conjunction with the expansion in and indirect taxation in practically the population, finally turned an adverse same proportions as exist in Great trade balance into a favorable one.

Most people would say that the While an attempt to concisely trace such statement of the present economic relations of the United States with the world would be equally serviceable Vith the United States, as probably with most countries, a mere statement of merchandise imports and exports is entirely inadequate as a measure of total international transactions.

There are, of course, many 'items in which America was on the other hand a creditor. The total of all items, visible and invisible, gives a balance of payments unfavorable to the United States by approximately $500,000,000. This is not a situation peculiar to 1920.

The possibility of future development is sometimes a more accurate gauge of a country's position. The Government is giving the fullest possible consideration to this matter. I have here some figures and statements from the Acting Commonwealth Statistician, but I do not propose .to give them at this stage, because they are not final. Assuming for a moment that what has been said by many members of this committee is true, and. that tbe position really is unsatisfactory, the remedies that are being suggested are, however, somewhat various, and there is no general to how the situation is to be met. There has been much condemnation of the Government, but the remedies suggested have varied extraordinarily. It has been suggested that the Treasurer alone is responsible for the financial position of this country.. Of course, that suggestion is absurd. Although the administration of our finances is very important, that alone, if improperly managed, could not have brought about tbe position which honourable gentlemen say is existing in Australia to-day. There must be other causes, and one has been suggested by the Opposition. 31 r. Hnioe. Honourable members opposite contend for present purposes. that our tariff protection is utterly inadequate, and can easily be evaded. Their remedy is to raise the tariff wall until it becomes one almost of prohibition. That policy seems to receive support from certain honourable members. MightI suggest to those who have spoken of our' trade balance, that the remedy cannot be Immigrants' remittances and found in merely stopping certain imports, if at the same time Ave stop the whole of our exports, because that Avill place us in a worse position than Ave are in to-day. ' A prohibition tariff must have the effect of hampering our export trade.

Another .. 509.000.000 school of thought suggests that the problem is perfectly simple to solve: that Ave should cease borrowing overseas, Avhich practice, they contend, is ruining Australia. If -Australia ceased suddenly its overseas borrowings, a A-ery serious crisis would arise in '' this country. ""We cannot look to this community to provide us Avith all the moneys that are required by the Federal and State Governments for legitimate and necessary developmental activities. The only effect of obtaining from the Australian loan -< market all our financial requirements Avould be to hamper private enterprise and legitimate borroAving for developmental purposes. If this country is to develop rapidly we must borrow from overseas. To retard deAelopment by refraining from r assisting it, in accordance Avith the inv opinion in this House as crease ofpopulation, must haye a detrimental effect upon private enterprise. Honourable members opposite have been unanimous in their criticism of the Government, and they are perfectly convinced that, it is at fault for not providing remedies for what they contend is * mal-administration. The Government has done everything Avithin its power to 1 solve the present and future problems of Australia, and it Avill undoubtedly be in a better position to improve its financial position when the people have been taught to realize the immensity of our problems and the sane course that the Ministry has pursued in endeavouring to solve them. The Leader of the Opposition has moved to reduce the first item of the Estimates by £1, and by so doing has endeavoured to censure the Government. He says that the Labour party will not rest until the tariff has been increased sufficiently to prevent a continuous flow of imports into Australia. I suggest that it would be more useful to place the facts before the people, than for honourable members opposite to spend the whole of their time trying to comfort the people with the promise that when they obtain oflice the tariff will be increased and all our disabilities gradually disappear. I submit that an additional tariff barrier would not develop Australian industry, but would certainly be a means of encouraging inefficiency and of maintaining conditions under which men could demand hours and wages that were not economically sound. There is a much greater obligation resting on the Opposition than that of moving practically a vote of censure against the Government, and that is to take its courage in both hands and truly encourage the people of Australia to look to it for guidance. The people are rapidly learning that there is something wrong with the policy of the Opposition, and that any reduction of hours or increase in wages would be more than industry could bear, and would eventually bring Australia to disaster. This national Parliament must try to teach the people that the future safety of Australia rests upon our efficiency, the improvement of our methods, the existence of a. spirit of co-operation among the community, and a determination to fully utilize our advantages. We must get rid of the idea, that we can solve our problems by act of Parliament. reach a stage of great prosperity only as a result of individual effort. Silling suspended from 6.1U to 8 p.m. the Loan Council, the jSlational Debt Sinking Eund Commission, and the contemplated financial .agreement with the States, I propose to summarize briefly the criticism that, has been offered to the Government's financial proposals. This criticism has been mainly directed towards statements of facts, which give an entirely wrong impression until they are properly analysed and the actual circumstances are pointed out. There is no unanimity among the critics of the Government as to the course to he pursued to straighten out what they suggest is a financial tangle. Some advocate the raising of the tariff, or even the adoption of a system of protection amounting to prohibition; others advocate a reduction of the tariff and a move towards free trade; still others suggest that Australia should cease from borrowing. Tho honourable member for Henty( Mr Gullett) gave some very sound advice on the need for curbing our extravagant tendencies. He posed as the aj>ostle of practically no expenditure beyond the most limited amounts. Surely the honourable member has forgotten some of his outbursts of the past! have seen the folly of them. must have a grim recollection of what I am about to refer to, because he is already on the stool of repentance-before I have uttered a word. Most of us remember a series of articles that the distinguished member wrote and a few of the slogans which he coined. The advice he tendered to Australia was to spend £50,000,000 bravely. When he criticized the budget of 1922, he said that we would never solve the problems of Australia by a cheese-paring system of economy. He outlined a scheme for having 16,000 farms per annum, and in one of his brighter moments said that we would probably do the whole job over a few years for £100,000,000. Australia can it would pay. I know now that it would not. to take too serious a view of the very spirited criticism uttered by an honourable member who changes his opinions so rapidly. made for the difference between a journalist'and a politician. alter cases, and possibly we ought not to be too hard upon the honourable member",39,Comparison Of Estimated Expenditoris 1927 28 With 1921 22

68,Mr Bruce,"Altered circumstancesfor Henty for his past outbursts; but with this past behind him, I do not think we should take too serious a view of his recent criticism of the Government's financial policy. I speak of the honourable member only to demonstrate the fact that, while we have a great number of critics of the Government, there is no coordination of ideas among them in regard to any remedy that might be applied to the present situation. critics has put forward a solution for the financial tangle to which they have referred. Ministers have been attacked with a boldness which always characterizes a budget debate, but those who have attacked the Government have apparently no recollection of the extent to which they themselves have been responsible for the expenditure which they criticize. To-day, for the first time,. I have heard criticism of the Loan Council, and the suggestion that its creation has not benefited Australia. stood that in financial, commercial, and industrial circles it is generally recognized that it would be of great benefit to Australia to have -co-ordination between the Commonwealth and the States in respect of financial transactions. the results of the last few years must have demonstrated how desirable it is to have a Loan Council, and that element of co-ordination between the Commonwealth and the States. The Loan Council was formed in 1924, when, for the first time, we got all the States into line and the cut-throat competition which had been going on between all the States for their loan requirements ceased. We had seen at the end'of 1923 a necessitous State setting the pace for all the States as to what they would have to pay for their loan money, with the result that some of them had to pay as much as 6^ per cent, interest. could be avoided by co-ordination and the formation of a Loan Council. I have no desire to delay the committee with examples of the work done by that council, but I want to remind honourable members of at least one instance in which it has operated with considerable advantage to Australia. When in 1924 the conversion of the Gratuity War Loan, as it was known, had to he effected, the States left Mr Rrvce. the market to the Commonwealth, and unquestionably on that conversion we paid from i to § per cent, less interest than we should have had to pay had there been no Loan Council in existence and no co-operation in financial matters between the Commonwealth and the States. Since the council had been in existence it has handled conversions and new loans amounting to £140,000,000, Not one of the and the rate of interest for conversions and new borrowings has always been better than it would have been j f there had been no Loan Council. In December last the Commonwealth carried through a conversion operation of £25,000,000 at 5£ pei' cent, at par. New South Wales was not in the Loan Council at the time, but was observing the decisions of the council as to the rate of interest to be paid in Australia. In June of the present year, however, the necessities of the Treasurer of New South. Wales, which was still outside the council, were so great I have always underthat for the first time there was a departure from the basis of interest agreed upon by the Loan Council, and as a result of the Government of that State offering to pay 5£ per cent, for money, the Commonwealth's conversion loan for Surely £36,000,000 next month will have to be effected at 5J per cent, at £98 10s. instead of at par. That is merely one example of the effect of the States and the Commonwealth fighting one another for the loan money that is available. We must all recognize, I think, that the Loan Council has a very beneficial effect upou the public finances of the Commonwealth and the States. The idea is embodied in the financial agreement which is now being submitted to the States for their consideration. Another financial reform effected by the present Government, and also embodied in the agreement, is the placing of the We could easily see how that sinking fund upon the basis of a sinking fund plus a redemption fund. When I delivered my budget in 1922 I foreshadowed a proposal for the creation of a sinking fund on that basis.. In 1923 effect was given to that proposal, and, to-day the whole of the debt of the Commonwealth is covered by a sinking fund of 10s. per cent., which combines all the advantages of a sinking fund as well as a redemption fund. The advantage of a sinking fund is that it operates on the basis of compound interest. Its disadvantage is that it leads to the accumulation of a tremendous amount of stock in the hands of the trustees of the National Debt Sinking, Fund. It was felt that such great accumulations in Australia, with its limited financial market, would, after a lapse of years, lead to a national debt sinking fund that would completely dominate the financial position here. In order to get over that difficulty the Government also applied the principles of a redemption fund so that the amount of 10s. per cent, on the debt is employed for the resumption of that amount of debt, but the debt is kept alive, interest continues to be paid upon it, and a sinking fund has to be provided iu respect of the total amount of the del^t. I think we can claim that that is one of the best methods ever devised for the redemption of a national debt. The system will now be applied to the whole of the debts of Australia, Commonwealth and State, past and future. I shall have an ppporunity to deal with the financial agreement with the States sit very much greater length when a bill is introduced to ratify the agreement. In the meantime I remind the committee that the agreement itself is probably the biggest step forward we have yet taken with regard to the finances of tbe Commonwealth of Australia. The necessity for something of the sort must be plain to any one who has considered the situation. We cannot cease t.o borrow. We need borrowed money to develop Australia. There is nothing vicious in borrowing. Many people seem to think that by ceasing to borrow we in some way do something so commendable that words almost fail to express proper admiration for it. It is absurd for a young country like this to think of ceasing surer, who has borne the brunt of those to borrow. We need tremendous sums of borrowed money, but in the expenditure of it we must see that it is .employed for reproductive purposes and for (.increasing the absorption power of new citizens. Granted that we have to borrow, surely i i is better that in our borrowing there should be co-ordination and co-operation between the Commonwealth and the States rather than that rates and conditions should be governed by the position of the weakest State in the group. That would have been the position but for tbe formation of the Loan Council. I have just given an example of what happened with New South Wales, outside the Loan Council, offering terms in Australia which depreciated the whole credit, of the Commonwealth and the States. That position would have been accentuated until we ceased to be first class borrowers, or until, possibly, no one would have lent us money except on absolutely outrageous terms. The financial agreement, when put into operation will get over all those difficulties. It will provide for co-operation between the Commonwealth and the States and for a sinking fund for every single penny of debt in Australia. It will enhance our credit aud make available great sums of money that can be utilized for supporting our own loans. If it is wisely administered it will mean that whenever we are issuing loans in Australia, New York, or London, we shall get the most favorable terms it is possible to obtain. That agreement is a great advance in Australian finance. The sinking fund has placed the whole of our finances on a new, a more definite, aud a more satisfactory basis. The Loan Council is ensuring the co-operation that is so necessary and vital to Australia in its public finance. It has really been suggested in this debate that the present Government has doue nothing. I suggest that tbe present Government has rendered great service to Australia in connection with the whole of its finances, and that we shall reap inestimable benefit from what has been done in the last three or four years. I very much deprecate, not so much the attacks on the Government-becaus e that is what governments, apparently, are for-bu t the attacks on an individual member of the Government, the Treaattacks, and who has rendered such yeoman service to the Commonwealth. Auy policy that we pursue must be based on tbe development of Australia and the increase of our population. Before such a policy can be successfully achieved, certain great fundamental facts must be taken very carefully into account. We must develop our primary and our secondary industries, but it is no use doing that unless we have markets for their products. by means of tariff protection to build up our secondary industries and to secure, within our own country, a market for their products. A similar condition of affairs applies to our primary industries, but they have so grown, and their exportable surplus is so great, that we have to find a market overseas for the great bulk of what they produce. We have made great progress towards securing preferences iu Great Britain. I am convinced that the whole atmosphere in Great Britain is so changed that the preferences which we obtained in 1923 will be enlarged as they have been, slightly, that greater facilities will be given to us moment or two ago. The right honorin the British market than we have ever before enjoyed. We must recognize that with these facilities our future depends on the augmenting of our population and the increase of our production; that we must set ourselves determinedly to the task of making our manufactures, behind our tariff so efficient as to stay the flow of imports at prean examination of all''the elements that sent coming into Australia. We must become so efficient in our primary industries that the stimulated production that must necessarily follow will be readily saleable in the markets of the world. If that is done the present problems associated with adverse trade balances will disappear, and AustraliaWill be on the highway to the solution/of its financial problems. I suggest that much of the criticism that has been'directed towards the financial proposals of tbe Government has been absolutely unwarranted; that those proposals are such as should commend themselves to honourable members, and that the committee will not entertain the amendment submitted by the Leader of the Opposition. is not by ambitious design on my part, but merely by the hand of chance, that I have the honour to follow, this evening, the two distinguished debaters, who, on the other and same side of the chambeV, have been so enthusiastically rending each other's political vitals for the edification of the country, and the instruction of this Parliament. Indeed, I grant that my part in this debate apWe have endeavoured pears a little superfluous, since as the discussion has proceeded it has become more and more evident that there is adequate material for mutual destruction on the Government side of the House. This budget has excited more violent opposition, and especially opposition from honourable members in the Government ranks, than 1ms any other of which I bave had experience during a lengthy political career. Take, for instance, the honourable member for Henty( Mr Gullett), to whom the Prime Minister, having come into the fortunate possession of certain documentary evidence during the dinner since that year and adjournment, made feeling reference a able the Prime Minister complained of a lack of defiuiteness in the criticism of honourable members. The honourable member for Henty declared that his Treasurer (Dr. Earle Page) was the most tragic Treasurer of whom he ever had knowledge. Is that not sufficiently definite ? Does it call for make for 'true tragedy as distinct from comedy, both of which we have had in liberal measure from honourable members opposite during this debate? I , also, have a word or two of kindly advice to offer to the honourable member for Henty. As a distinguished anti-militarist,' I remind' him that it is a mark of chivalry to make one's attack from the front, rather than from the rear. I warn the honourable member that, as a comparatively new member of this Parliament, hemust not expect to institute a new basis of responsible Government in Australia. When the honourable member finds himself in difficulty with his Government, hemust not seek to salve his conscience by declaring his undying loyalty to one section of the Government, and his immutable antipathy to the other section. Weall know that the Prime Minister and. the Treasurer are political twins, "" equal in all things,"" and that when oneis hurt in his honour the other also is hurt, according to the varying degree of"" sensitiveness which each possesses. The honorable member for Henty must remember that iu the Prime Minister and! the Treasurer we have twin tragedians..",43,Comparison Of Estimated Expenditoris 1927 28 With 1921 22
69,Mr Brennan (Batman) [8.19],"I tand that it is unbecoming of him to manifest, as he has done, loyalty to the one and not to the other. It is impossible for the honourable member thus to rid himself of this element of tragedy which attaches to the Government which, he supports. To a certain, if not to the fullest extent, it must be taken as proving that the honourable member himself is also a little tragic in sitting behind and so loyally supporting these twin tragedians who rule the House. I cannot help thinking that the honourable member-anc l this is peculiarly relevant to a discussion on this budget-is a candidate for the Ministry. always observed, and I feel sure that you have too, Mr Chairman, that there is only one satisfactory method to dea.l with a destructive critic who sits behind you, and that is to bring him forward and accommodate him with a seat alongside of you. I suggest that a knowledge of that fact, gathered perhaps in his journalistic experience aud wide reading, has prompted the honourable member' in his criticism. trust that the honourable member will not impute motives. motives. I am examining history and prognosticating the future in the light of the past. I should like to conclude this highly important feature of the budget discussion with the recommendation that, if the honourable member thinks that an obstacle exists by reason of the fact that the Ministry is already fully manned, he should again draw upon his reading and recall the history of the Borgia's. If the honourable member has not a knowledge of the Borgias, he w ill . at least be able to obtain some useful information from the honourable member for Wilmot( Mr Atkinson), and from one or two others who were members of this Ministry, and who have now gravitated to the more peaceful atmosphere of the back benches, where they adopt the role of true blue supporters of the Government. I point out also'how successful this course of action has proved in the past in silencing criticism. The honourable member for Wimmera( Mr Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Stewart) referred to it the other evening, and illustrated his reference by drawing attention to present occupants of the Ministerial bench. The honourable member pointed to some one-time members of the one-time Country party now in fhe Government, and mentioned that they had withdrawn from the party. There they are: the Ministei' for Markets and Migration ( Mr Paterson), the Minister for Works and Railways( Mr Hill) son). I ask if, except in a dovecote, one has ever seen such complete placidity as that which characterizes the attitude of those distinguished and now comfortably disposed members of the one-time. I have Country party towards tlie men in the Nationalist Government which, with tooth aud claw, they so long assaultedlong enough indeed to secure their places in the Ministry. Now a word about the right honourable gentleman who leads the Government. This is a day on which riglit honourable gentlemen bave held the stage. I come in later, as a humble representative of the rank and file. It is curious, but true, that the'Prime Minister invariably approaches his subject more in sorrow than in anger. He conveys the impression that he is really summing up, in a. perfectly calm and judicial frame of mind, in an atmosphere of perfect fairness to both parties, the actual position. He assumes the attitude of one who stands aloof and views the proceedings from afar; that he exists in a clearer, if not a perfectly pellucid atmosphere. He has, in high measure, the art which conceal? art, and it was that art which he applied when he came at last into this budget discussion. I am bound to say that the right honourable gentleman was a long time in coming. He was urgently wanted, and I suggest that he must, from his rooms, have sensed the smell of blood and scorched hair, emanating from the contest raging amongst his supporters in this chamber. Doubtless, on more than one occasion, the Treasurer sent an SOS to the right honourable gentleman saying "" Never did the Duke of Wellington pray more for night and-Blucher than I for the adjournment and the Prime Minister.'"" At last he came. He came when the Scullin) had pointed out that Australia",46,Comparison Of Estimated Expenditoris 1927 28 With 1921 22

72,And The Postmaster,"General( Mr Gibwas faced with an extremely grave financial position. And although the budget, with its apologies and evasions had been delivered, and although a succession of highly destructive speeches concerning it had been made by honourable members on this and the other side, not one word did the Leader of the Goveniment utter in defence, extenuation, or excuse. IfI were judging the debate and assessing points for manner and matter, I should have no hesitation in allotting the Prime Minister full points for manner; but when it came to matter, I should be forced on a full and fair analysis to say that he carried us not one inch further than wo were when he commenced his speech. He adopted the very familiar, and indeed, the quite out-worn device of producing a copy of the Estimates throwing them down on the table aud saying, in effect, "" Now, gentlemen, let ine have your Wliich of these various items shall we -cut down, and in what way ?"" Turning to honourable members on this side he asked, ""Is it to be old-age pensions? Does any honourable member on the Opposition benches declare for a reduction in respect of old-age pensions ?"" And we were silent. gentleman turned to his own side and said, "" What about defence ? I know that some members of the Opposition wish the Government to cut down the defence vote; but do you, my friends, the supporters of the Government, desire me to reduce the defence estimates? Have you not read the reports of distinguished experts who have declared that the defence vote must be increased instead of being reduced? What is your pleasure, gentlemen ? Are you not all more or less generals, major-generals, colonels, or omcers of some other high and exalted rank? Do you wish the defence vote to be interfered with ? Of course, we cannot cut down the defence vote."" Then the right honourable gentleman appealed again to honourable members on this side who wish to see something done in the way of social reform, and asked, "" What about the maternity allowance? Do you wish that to be cut down ?"" Naturally, members of the Opposition were silent, and the right honourable gentleman turned once again to his own side and mentioned certain nonMr Brennan. paying railway proposals, wine bounties, and other schemes for the expenditure of public money on a large scale, and said, "" Gentlemen, which of these items would you wish to see cut down?"" Members of his own side being 'silent, the right honourable gentleman yet again appealed to this side of the committee, and we, too, were silent when met by this very familiar device. But, after all, there are two answers to the right honourable gentleman's questions. One is that the responsibility for the present unsatisfactory position of the Commonwealth does not rest upon the Opposition at all events. We may, I think, look to the Government to guide lis as to the best way to put it right. That clearly is not the duty of the Opposition. The responsibility rests upon the and the budget papers, Government, because the facts are within its knowledge. It is not sufficient for the Prime Minister to turn to us and say, pleasure. "" Here are a certatin number of millions of pounds for the payment of old-age pensions. Would you have the Government cut down that vote ?"" To that question we might with perfect justice say that if we had the details of the administrative expenditure, even in respect of old-age pensions, we could bring about a subThen the right honourable stantial reduction without affecting the amount paid to old-age pensioners themselves. I tell the right honourable gentleman, or I hope he will be told with my compliments, that if he will hand over the Estimates to the Labour party here and nowj we will cut off a few millions before we go home to-night, and re-submit them to him for his consideration. That is a fair offer. Further, these questions remain unanswered: Is there real danger in our swelling and enormous public debt? Is there real danger and folly in our rapidly-increasing and at present almost overwhelming adverse trade balance? Is there danger or folly in charging public security with the cost of the artificial immigration system, which goes hand in hand with the policy that is responsible for increasing unemployment among native-born Australians? To none of these questions has the right honourable gentleman supplied an answer. He has told us that our adverse trade balance, though it is a very complicated matter and difficult to understand, and undeniably unsatisfactory, is no worse than that of Germany, America, Canada, or many other countries. I have neither the time nor the inclination to consider the position in Germany, Canada, or America for the purpose of showing where the fallacy of the right honourable. gentleman's argument lies. The fact that our adverse trade balance has been mounting continuously and alarmingly in recent years is a problem for which this Government should have some solution, and in respect of which members of the Opposition have suggested, if not a solution, at least a number of palliatives. No solution or suggestion has come from the right honourable gentleman himself. I regret that the Treasurer (Dr. Earle Page) is not at the table at the moment. I understand that he must have a rest sometimes, and I have no doubt that he has good cause to need it. I had intended originally to congratulate him upon a number of things, including his genial complacency and optimism in relation to the financial position of the Commonwealth, and also upon the fact that, politically, he has lived long enough to present his fifth budget, and the first to be delivered in this Parliament at Canberra. heard the honourable member for Wimmera( Mr Stewart) congratulate him a few nights ago-the congratulations of the executioner to. his victim-and so T hesitate now to add anything by way of congratulations to the honourable gentleman. Probably it would be better if I extended him my sympathy; if I condoled with him upon the fact that the ghosts of his previous utterances, have been recalled from the vasty deep of Hansard; if I condoled with him upon his recantation, and upon the difference between Phillip drunk and Phillip sober. But, after all, I shall not press my sympathy upon him, because sympathy reminds us of sorrow. ThereI leave it. Coming to the budget itself, it will be difficult for me to quote figures whicli have not been mentioned in this debate. If I quote certain figures, it is only in order that my devoted constituents, who search the pages of Hansard, may read the views of their inconspicuous representative in this chamber, detached altogether from the views expressed by other members. A gentleman named Democritus, who lived 2,500 years ago, and who I regret to say has since died, once observed that truth was to be found at the bottom of a well. Thereupon some foolish people went looking in the bottom of a well for truth, but in vain. Of course, what Democritus meant to convey was that truth is exceedingly difficult, to find, and a well, being a very awkward place to search, might with advantage be regarded as its repository. I know from experience tliat truth is difficult to fiud in a budget speech. One thing that is certain is that the financial position of the Oommonwealth, instead of going forward, is going backward. The Commonwealth public debt, the cost of departments, the burden of taxation, are all showing an alarming increase. Faeilis descensus Avemi. SinceI am not permitted to speak in a foreign tongue in this chamber, I hasten to add that the popular translation of the phrase is, "" The descent to hell is easy."" As far as I can see, the financial position of Australia is going from bad to worse so rapidly that the situation is somewhat kaleidoscopic. It changes so rapidly from day But I to day that it is almost impossible to quote figures which are in complete agreement with those previously given. We are entitled, however, to look to the Treasurer for finality in thisrespect. The public debt of the States at the end of 1926 and of the Commonwealth at the end of 1927 together amounted to £1,016,623,752. In the previous year it was £990,612,419, so that the increase, in round figures, was £25,981,000. The Commonwealth debt in 1926 Avas £458,443,351, At tbe end of June, 1927, the Commonwealth's gross debt had advanced to £461,067,742, an increase in twelve months of £2,624,391. The net debt, as disclosed by the budget speech, stood at the end of June, 1926, at £33S,841,476, and twelve months later it had increased to £340,978,952. At the 30th June, 1923, our debt overseas stood at £lll,045,000j and in Australia £247,464,000, making an aggregate of £358,509,000. Corresponding figures at the 30th June, 1927, Avere £139,474,000, £227,137,000, and £366,611,000, outside loans increasing and local loans falling with a net increase of £8,000,000. net increase in our total, indebtedness in the period was, therefore, over £8,000,000. > There has also been an increase in departmental expenditure. The expenses of the Prime Minister's Department, for instance, have increased by £54,766, which is said to be due to the cost of the Development and Migration Commission; the expenditure of the Customs Department has increased by £14,565, due to what the Treasurer euphemistically called ""our swelling volume of business""; and the cost of Parliament has increased £16,981, due to the transfer of its operations to this beautiful but expensive young city of Canberra. There are certain phases of the public debt which I wish to discuss. Our war debt now stands at £296,905,370; our debt on behalf of the States is £94,456,237; on behalf of the Federal Capital Commission, £2,024,022; and in respect £67,682,113. In the light of what I have said it sounds ironical for me to quote the following words from the Treasurer's budget speech It is surely a most gratifying feature of our finances that we were able to effect this substantial reduction last financial year in our war debt. The Treasurer pointed out that the reduction in our war debt was £7,640,987. Such a reduction would be gratifying if there had been no inflation of other debts, but no useful purpose is served by reducing the war debt and increasing our otlier public debts in the manner indicated. Treasurer, in the practice of the profession in which he was, and, I trust, still is eminent, was accustomed to consult the pharmacopceia for inspiration; but it appears to me that of late he has deserted that reliable authority and sought inspiration from such genial literary giants as Thackeray and Trollope, both of whom, in the world of fiction, show, in the most entertaining way, how it is possible to live on nothing a year. The method by which it is done is to give a bill,and when that bill becomes due to give another at an increased rate of interest. I am reminded, also, of a character created, by Mr Rrcnnan. another classical literary authority, Dickens. He has given us the picture of The Micawber, who, whenever he signed a promissory note, which was not infrequently, said, "" Thank God that's settled."" That is precisely the method which the Treasurer is pursuing in conducting the financial affairs of this country. In discussing our war debt, I have no desire to draw the memory of the dead into the controversy. I have no wish to detract from the honour due to their memory, or the honour due to those on this as well as the other side of the committee, who played their part in doing what they conceived to be their duty in actively participating in the war. I have my own views on that subject. The war debt is a matter for the living, ancl especially for the public trustees of the nation's finances to consider. The debt was incurred in the heat of passion when judgment was suspended, and racial hatred took possession of people's minds. . I doubt whether those who created this debt ever intended that of Commonwealth works, it should be paid. By a system of juggling loans, conversions, bonuses, and reconversions, Capital through all the turmoil remains secure in its profits, and Labour remains assured of its burdens. present generation will become dust and ashes and leave to those who had no voice in the creation of the debt the eventual underwriting and settling of it. If it is true that example may be useful for that which it warns us to avoid, as well as for that which it suggests should be followed, perhaps the war debt might well I have no doubt that the remain a perpetual monument of the high treason against humanity of which the white races of the world were guilty. To-day I can speak of the united white races of the world, for did not Dr. Stresemann embrace M . Briand, and are not German migrants, whom we were once assured would never again set foot upon Australian shores, coming amongst us? We-were told that no Australian would ever again shake a hand that was tainted with the remotest relationship°to a German, and Mr Lloyd George won his post-war election upon the cry "" the Kaiser must be hanged."" But these people are now united. We",47,Comparison Of Estimated Expenditoris 1927 28 With 1921 22

Sof a r have we progressed towards peace, disarmament, and a better understanding of each other! Sometimes I pass for solace from my exacting labours in this chamber to fiction, and among my favourites is Mr John Galsworthy. The other day I read in a short story of his entitled "" Timber,"" a few introductory lines which I think should be recorded in Hansard, not for the purpose of improving Mr Galsworthy's reputation, but with the object of making hi m better known to Hansard readers. The extract is as follows:Sir Arthur Hirries, Baronet, of Hirriehugh, in a northern countryA purely fictitious character, but to be found in the flesh, in hundreds, in various parts of England, I am assuredcame to the decision to sell his timber in that state of mind-commo n during the warwhich may be called patrio-profiteoring. Like newspaper proprietors, writers on strategy, shipbuilders, owners of works, makers of arms, and the rest of the working classes at large, his mood was: "" Let me serve my country, and if thereby my profits are increased, let me put up with it, and invest in national bonds.""

I am pursuing this line of argument without any intention to make a case against the Treasurer, but for the purpose of showing where the Commonwealth Parliament, for which we are primaril y responsible, stands in respect of the total debts. If these works do not prove more permanent in character and more productive of revenue, than some of the Commonwealth works referred to later, they w ill prove a very unsubstantial security. MrA . GREEN -The States' expenditure upon public works has been wiser than that of the Commonwealth. Commonwealth is to become a mere money-raising and taxing machine. In respect of State debts it is to have no right of veto and very little if any, right to examine the proposed expenditure. ""When",50,Comparison Of Estimated Expenditoris 1927 28 With 1921 22

77,Mr Beennan,"A t any rate theI inquired of the Treasurer as to a likely source of detailed information upon this subject he referred me to the budget papers. I found therein general particulars as to the purpose of loans and redemptions, but there the information ended. There also, the control of this Parliaments ends. We have no particulars of the expenditure, and no guarantee rhat the loans are to be used for reproductive and developmental There is a juggling of finance between Oommonwealth and States. One authority is to have no say as to where rhe money comes from and the other is r.o have no say as to where it goes. But the States, like the Commonwealth, are sovereign. If we talk of the Australian Constitution, we at once disturb the selfcomplacency of some local authoritypossibly the Premier of a and even a Labour Premier. I have never heard of any one in authority in a local Parliament or in any subordinate body, admit that a job could be better done by somebody other than by the local or subordinate body. We call ourselves an Australian nation, but the truth is that we have no national policy in anything. We are merely seven competing and conflicting sections of people, each claiming, and none possessing, the power of a nation. We hear of our loan policy, but we have no national loan policy. 1 remember hearing the Treasurer, when he was being smitten hip aud thigh by the Leader of the Opposition, saying, for his justification and excuse, that Mr Lang had by his actions caused the price of money to rise, thus prejudicing Commonwealth borrowing. The Prime Minister offered the same defence to-night. That statement supports my contention that we have no national policy in regard to. loans, because if it is true-and I know it to be true, and not of Mr Lang in particular-the solvency of the Commonwealth is at the mercy of the States. We have no immigration policy. One State wants one thing, another State quite a different thing, and the Commonwealth still something different. We have no land policy because we have no land. PerhapsI overlook the Northern Territory and that little area of federal soil upon which I am privileged to speak to-night, but where Mr Brennan. we have land we have no people, and where we have people we have no land. We have no national railway policy. There are railways in each State, the property of the States, and all of varying gauges. "" When we come to a river and cannot get across, glory hallelujah!"" The march of science has revolutionized our material progress iu a variety of ways, but in government we still retaiu purposes. the outworn forms aud traditions of a hundred years ago. Three-quarters of a century ago the representative governing institution for the whole of Australia was in New South Wales, but from time to time various portions of Australia, feeling the need for local government, saw no better method of achieving it than by repeating and re-instituting a similar form of government. The consequence State, has been that in the name of sovereignty, blessed word! we have put ourselves in competition with each other, and we have remained in the leading strings of Great Britain. Soi t happens that, with a little over 6,000,000 people, we have thirteen Houses'of Parliament, seven executives, seven bodies of public servants, seven avenues of public patronage, seven British politicians gaining colonial experience in dignified sinecures, and seven Agents General running rival departments. The Treasurer, who is responsible for the solvency of the Commonwealth and for the analysis of its financial position as a. nation amongst nations, disposed of £94,000,000 of public indebtedness by a wave'of the hand and a statement that it is a debt in behalf of the States! To further examine this £94,000,000, it would be necessary at least to search through the budgets of' all the States, but I do not propose to attempt that virtually impossible task. The Constitution is in the melting pot. Those interested may inquire whether I propose financial to substitute for the federal union a basis of unification. I am not bound by phrases, but by facts, and one fact is that there is not in the civilized world a parallel for our position. Even in the United States of America, upon whose constitution that of the Commonwealth was founded, there is no nexus, no leading strings attaching that nation to any external country. Reducing my view to practical terms, local government, should be provided by local and authorities of equal power, and certainly not by authorities of superior power. Our present federal scheme makes for disunion and conflict rather than for union and strength; it makes for divided authority, the shelving of responsibilities, loss of national prestige, and, as we are learning to our sorrow, for d r if t and to £ 1 6 1 ; last year it was £165-highe r waste. As this debate has shown, Australia is corning perilously near to the time when she will require to account to herself and other nations and. declare whether she will in fact shoulder the burden that rests upon her, or shirk it . When the question is put to her in a sharp and direct way, w ill there be seven respondents, or only one? If there are to be seven will they speak with one voice, or will there be seven speakers, each trying to put the blame on the others? 'Returning to the budget, I think the Treasurer consoled himself with what offers little real consolation. Referring to the national debt in tbe budget speech he delivered on the 9th July, 1926, he said that as the population had increased by 481,855 in the four years preceding, therefore the net debt per head was less by £4 19s. 6d. than in 1922. In other words, whilst the debt was getting larger, the family also was increasing. The population test is a little illusory. Let me i l lustrate it in a simple way. A farmer owns property worth £3,000, upon which he has a mortgage of £1,500. His son, on coming of age, enters into partnership with h i m, and becavise of his industry, in the richest countries in the world. If the telligence, and enterprise, it is considered politic to increase the mortgage by £500. The debt per head of the partnership is reduced to £1,000, but the debt on the security is increased to £2,000, and is perilously near to the possibilities of the security. The position of Australia is very similar, and it is our problem and shame that although the public and private wealth of our people probably amounts to £3,000,000,000-upo n that point we cannot be certain, because there has been no recent investigation-in our day and generation we are making rapid headway towards the l i m it of our borrowing powers. I do not say that we have exceeded our credit. Our asset is too great, too resilient, too wonderful, for us yet to have subordinate authorities, not by done that. The question is not whether we have reached our limit , but whether we are racing towards it in our time, and intend to hand down to posterity a legacy of incompetence and waste. In 1923 the debt per head of the population was £157 ; by 1924 it had increased to £163: during the next year there was a slight decrease than ever before. So the slight source of consolation which the Treasurer had last year has this year disappeared. I emphasize that the per capita debt is not affected by au increase in the population. Honourable members opposite cannot console themselves w i th the reflection that a larger population justifies a higher debt per head of that population. The increase in population to which the Treasurer referred is due to either an excess of births over deaths or to the number of immigrants exceeding rhe number of emigrants. It is estimated that of the increase in population, 68.5 per cent. ' represents the excess of births over deaths, and 31.5 per cent, the excess of immigrants over emigrants. In connection with the immigration increase, the Treasurer accepts as a fact something which I challenge him to prove, namely, that an increase in population necessarily adds to a nation's wealth. If mere population is all that is required, the countries in which the population is densest would necessarily be the richest. But that is not so; China, India, and other densely populated countries, are f a r from being population of a country is industriously employed, its lands f u l l y used by suitable people, and its public revenue spent in reproductive works, then population means wealth; but an ill-considered "" wild-cat "" immigration policy, such as that for which this Government is responsible, is an invitation to financial disaster. If we take any considerable period, we find that there has always been a more or less constant factor of about 30,000 unemployed persons in Australia, belonging to organized trade unions though not necessarily the same persons. If to them we add the unorganized workers, such as f a r m workers and others who for various reasons do not belong to organized trade unions, but are from time to time unemployed, that number who has a personal knowledge of will be increased considerably. The conditions in Queensland-ove r the Statist's figures do uot disclose how far destinies of which State he presided for organized trades unionists have been dismany years with such skill and success placed by migrants. That would be an as to excite an extraordinary amount of interesting inquiry for that officer to unjealousy and unkind criticism from people dertake. Nor do we know how many living in his own and other States, who migrants are out of work, or in gaols, had not enjoyed the opportunities which hospitals, and asylums. The Treasurer flatters himself that ministration-point s out that, for the departmental expenditure is practically most part, the States have assets for their at a stand-still; but that is not so. In loans. I do not doubt that that is so. connection' with the Development and But what security has the Commonwealth ""Migration Commission alone there is an for its expenditure of £67,682,113 for estimated increased £34,776. Migration as at present concalled works are not works at all; others ducted therefore affects us adversely in are not reproductive, while still others four ways. First, there is the cost of are not. permanent. Some are in the bringing out the migrants, to which the nature of luxuries, while still others are Leader of the Opposition has already a class apart, as the half million invested drawn attention; secondly, immigration for some years without return in wireless has added to the number of unemployed, services which will produce no revenue. although we do not know to what A striking example of the kind of work extent it has done so; thirdly, it upon which this money is to be expended increases departmental expenditure in fourthly, there is the interest on the the name of works!

I wish now to refer to the debt on naval and military works, the manuof £67,682,113 in connection Commonwealth works. The honourable halls and naval bases, as well as in conmember for Dalley( Mr Theodore), nexion with other monuments of futility Mr Brennan.

Money is also to be spent with facture of munitions, the erection of drill and folly. Tbe Commonwealth offices in London and. Australia can only be regarded as luxuries in a time when we cannot afford them. I do not like to disturb the complacency of some of my friends by referring to the expenditure in connection with the Federal Capital; but I cannot refrain from saying that the development of the capital is proceeding upon lines which could hardly have beeu justified, even had there been no war. There seems to be a hectic desire to spend as much as possible in our i day and generation. This is a work whicli might justly have been left in large part to another generation. I believe in the Federal Capital; I make no complaint as to its situation or its institutions. I merely remind honourable members that after we decided to establish a. new capital Australia became engaged in a world war, and we did not foresee, and could not reasonably have foreseen, what would be the position of our finances in 1927. Therefore the pouring out of approximately £8,000,000 on the establishment of a new capital in the years immediately past cannot be justified. ""We have' our non-paying railways, as though Ave Avere looking for investments for surplus funds, bounties on luxuries like wine, Avhich represent the highwater mark of extravagance, and our neAv cruisers AA'hich, in my vieAv, are a Avanton is the position of this spendthrift Governprovocation to Avar.

I shall not use the expression, "" our approaching bankruptcy,"" because I am certain Aviser counsels will prevail; but if such counsels speculative purposes? The result of do not prevail, the course upon Avhich Ave are headed HOAV Avill certainly lead to bankruptcy. The construction of these cruisers by non-Australian Avorkers, and their building at the very time that Ave are sacrificing, to some interests outside Australia, ships Avhich are capable of carrying our produce, and also of rendering a useful defence service, reach the liigh-Avater mark of distorted statecraft.

The most they can be expected to do, as they Avill probably be spoiling for a fight, is to go to the Solomon Islands or to China, and help to create trouble Avhere they have no legitimate business. I do not propose to deal to auy extent Avith the subject of Australia's trade balance, mounting as it is by millions every month on the Avrong side; but the Government professes to be protectionist in its policy, and the Minister for Trade and Customs professes to be a very keen protectionist. I do not. set myself up t.o tie an enthusiastic advocate of high duties, but I recognize facts, and one fact is that every progressive nation must be something more than a tiller of the soil. Another point is that, apart from the economic question as to Avho bears the cost of protection, something may Avell be paid for equipping a progressive country with the technical knoAvledge and machinery associated Avith secondary industries. The third point to be remembered is that freedom of trade presupposes honest trading, the important fact being that you can remoA-e duties in a flash, as a safeguard against increases in manufacturers' prices, but you cannot establish, in the same space of time, new industries to protect the public against the importers' prices. But Avhat ment-thi s Government Avhich is keen in establishing a fictitious surplus, reducing one side of the scale by increasing the other, and recklessly applying borroAved money, and borrowed abroad at that, to all this is that no advantage comes to the people through the lower prices Avhich should be incidental to free trade, and there is no protection of Australian industries from competitive imports. As the Government is itself an impossible combination, born of mutual antagonism aud mistrust, so its fiscalism is of that mongrel character Avhose parentage cannot be traced to any established school of thought and Avhose illegitimate offspring is elephantiasis in finance, and unemployment in industry. No difficulty presents itself to me in ansAvering the question Avhether the Government can give satisfactory proof that it has added to the national security iu proportion to the increase in our indebtedness. on the Government. charged the onus, and therefore judgment must go against it. remedies, I remember that the honourable member for Wannon 'was a good deal worried last week hy some of my inquisitive friends on this side of the House who pressed him to state what remedy he would propose for the troubles he was dealing with, and, I may add, in my opinion, ably discussing. The feelings of Government supporters towards the honourable member for Wannon, who has beeu a somewhat candid critic of the Government, might be summed up in the words of the French philosopher that, there is something not altogether displeasing to us in the misfortunes of our best friends. The question is not alone, are we living within our income. The national income does not come out of some inexhaustible Pandora's box, nor from some "" rich uncle in Fiji."" It comes from ourselves in taxation. We spend the income ancl the important question arises : "" do we draw it from the soil, war was fought for the rich. If he had the only legitimate source, or do we draw it from the mortgage moneys?"" As to remedies, I would suggest one that seems to have a large measure of support from the other side of the House. It is this: Get rid of the Government. vernment which evades issues and dodges responsibilities, living from day to day and hoping that it will not live long enough to be found out, does not deserve support. My second suggestion is that we face the position in regard to the war ancl the war debt, for, after all, that is the main burden of the debt, although there are others. In regard to this, I would remind the House that when a man goes on a wild carousal on Saturday night in a country that is not a dry area, when he fights with everybody and spends his substance, ancl then comes before the bench on Monday morning to hear the dread sentence, "" £5 or fourteen days,"" he realizes if he has not the £5 in his pocket, that, when one goes on such a destructive carousal on one day, one cannot expect to tread the primrose path of dalliance on the next. That is the moral I want to apply to the Mr Brennan. war. It was a most unprecedented carousal; it was a period of waste of men The burden of proof rests and treasure; it was time lost; but ever It has not dissince then we have acted as if we had invested in the war and made money out As to of it. The debt is being left as a legacy to posterity, and everybody goes on his way rejoicing. Of course, there are sections of people in this country who might justly urge the repudiation of the debt altogether, on the ground that they were opposed to the continuation of this calamitous reckless business. But even they recognize that, if we are to remain an » organized community, we must all accept responsibility equally, and that the minority must bear the burden with the majority. There is also the section of the workers who themselves went cordially into the war. I refernot only to those who participated directly in the fighting; but also to those who were enthusiastic supporter's of it. Then there is the.class mainly and directly responsible-the owners of wealth, who fomented and continued the war. I am indebted to the honourable member for Henty for pointing out the other night that the only added that it was fought by the poor for the rich, his reference would have been complete. There are some who urge that we should reduce land taxation and income taxation. WhyA goshould we reduce taxation when our debts are unpaid, and are still mounting? When are we to make those sacrifices of which so much was heard during the war, and which were actually made bymany people in f u l l and overflowing measure? Surely the wealthy are not going to be shirkers, and worse than shirkers. When the promise was made of the last man and the last shilling, surely it meant that the last shilling or at and rate the first shilling was to come out of the pockets of those who were responsible for making this war, and for its continuation. If it meant anything at all, it meant that they were to pay for the war, at least in substantial part. Some of these old capitalists are going to ""their rewardI should not like to say what it is-leavin g their money tied up after them for their heirs and successors; and neither testator nor beneficiary has done anything to get rid of this terrible impost, -which the war has left behind. If we are to remain an organized community, and stop short of repudiation, I can see that the workers too .on to whom the burden will be passed w ill have to bear their share of taxation. In a word, what do I suggest should be done? I suggest that we should cease those wild-cat speculations in human freight known"" as subsidized immigration schemes. spending of public money in private enterprises, in a half-baked policy of socialism, by socialists who are socialists with other people's money and individualists with their own. .give the fullest measure of encouragement to the increased production of commodities for whicli there are unlimited markets, and for this purpose should break down all land monopoly and open up all natural opportunities for people qualified to exploit them, by increasing, instead of reducing, that class of taxation which falls on land monopolists who hoard the national asset and withhold it from qualified and natural possessors. These are a few suggestions by way of remedies out of many that might be made to meet the present serious situation, and to show that I have no difficulty in cordially supporting the amendmentThat the item be reduced by £1, in order to cannot take out of an industry more draw attention to our adverse trade balance, the inadequate protection afforded tc Australian industries, and the increase of unemcould easily be added the other economic ployment, and to direct the Government to remodel its financial policy to bring it into accord witb the economic necessities of the Commonwealth. honourable member for Batman( Mr .Brennan) says that truth is to be found at the bottom of a well. Knowing that the honourable gentleman has been a deep searcher after truth, and that he has had wonderful facilities for the study of those economic truths which have ruled the world for many centuries, I cannot understand how he can give his fealty and loyalty to a party which believes in the nationalization of all industries, and now desires that Australia should indulge in a.tariff war against the rest of the world. The honourable member for Warringah ( MrP a r k h ill) has expressed the rather Startling opinion that matters affecting the fate of the Government, and all matters of policy, should be threshed ont in the party room, and that in the chamber every honourable member should give general approval to any proposal brought forward by the Government he is supporting. I wish it to be clearly understood that, while I give my support to the Government, I regard myself as having f u l l liberty to discuss any matter that may come up for discussion in this We should cease the chamber, and the principles involved in it, and to vote for or against it as I agree with or dissent from it . It is monstrous to imagine for one moment that every supporter of the Government We should is bound by its every act and deed, ancl I am satisfied that no Government-mor e particularly the present-woul d desire that. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton) has moved this amendmentThat the item be reduced by £1, in order to draw attention to our adverse trade balance, the inadequate protection afforded to Australian industries, Mid the increase of unemployment, and to direct the Government to remodel its financial policy to bring it into accord with the economic necessities of the Commonwealth. I was pleased to hear the Prime Minister make reference to-day to the economic truth uttered a few days ago by an arbitration judge in Queensland, that you than you put into it . To that troth truth, that when the cost of production becomes greater than the value of the article produced, production must cease. That is the position to which we are d r if t ing in Australia. By parliamentary in terference, and by all sorts of socialistic experiments, we are trying to take more out of industry than industry is producing; and we are making the cost of production, particularly in primary industries, greater than the value of the commodity produced. In the circumstances, is it any wonder that we have so much unemployment in Australia? In dealing with the adverse trade balance, the Prime Minister forgot to mention, in comparing the Commonwealth w i th other countries, that we are a debtor country. sight of that fact.",51,Comparison Of Estimated Expenditoris 1927 28 With 1921 22

I want ro show the committee how unreliable figures can be, and how they can be made to prove almost anything. The Prime Minister referred to the fact that since 1923 the increase in old-age pensions had amounted to about £4,000,000. I might easily have pointed out that whereas in 1921 the amount spent out of revenue on new works and buildings was £2',5'1S,000, we spent only £216,000 on new works and buildings out of revenue last year. out going into details, there is not the slightest doubt that there is extravagance in administration in Australia. That extravagance has permeated the community. It is the duty of the Government to discourage it, more particularly in a season like the present. exception of Western Australia, Australia has had anything but a good harvest. There is a possibility of a lower price for wheat, the wool clip will not be as large as it was last year, and heavy losses have been incurred in sheep and cattle. It is undoubtedly the duty of every government in Australia to exercise the greatest care and economy in the expenditure of public funds. There has been one indication of sanity. All the leading economists of Australia, big bankers, and men associated with big enterprises, have for the past eight or ten months been urging the necessity for. economy, and a limitation of borrowing; and I am pleased that the Prime Minister, realizing this, has announced that further investigation will be made in connection with the cost of the Murray river water scheme. Parliament was originally told. that., this scheme would cost £4.660,000, but only a few days ago we were told that the estimated cost of the work is now £14,000,000. I do not remember any bill being introduced to authorize an increase in the cost of the scheme. With many of these Government works one knows how lightly estimates are exceeded, and we should know if this expenditure can be justified. The Prime Minister says that the Loan Council will lead to better results in the obtaining of loan money, but I hope that it will do more than that. Of course, it is impossible for the Commonwealth to exercise control over sovereign States, but it is to be hoped that in the near future there will be a reduction in borrowing. A sudden stoppage, or'even a sudden and drastic diminution of borrowing would undoubtedly create unemployment, which no one wishes to see; but since the war we have been 'borrowing a great deal more money than was justified, and a great deal of the money so borrowed has been extravagantly expended. I agree witb the Leader of the .Opposition in his Withreference to the adverse trade balance, and to the unemployment we have in Australia, and I am fully in agreement with him when he thinks that the Government should be directed to remodel its financial policy to bring it into accord with the economic necessities of the CommonWith the wealth. If the honourable member will do his best to help the Government to bring its financial policy into accord with the economic necessities of the Commonwealth, great good will be done. It is the economic conditions of to-day that are causing unemployment, and bringing financial trouble upon us. Sir David Gordon on his return from the Economic Conference saidAs a people in occupation of a young country, we have had our fair share of difficulties, and have not shirked facing them. There is no need to be apprehensive of the problems which call our attention. The first thing to do is to admit them-that would be a display of courage; then understand themthat would be a wisdom; then, apply the remedies; that would be patriotism and statesmanship of the highest order. No one has a greater knowledge of the recuperative value of the land of Australia than myself, more faith in the possibilities of its future or less faith in the socialistic doctrines which have",57,Comparison Of Estimated Expenditoris 1927 28 With 1921 22

It would not be a bad thing if we could at one fell swoop wipe the whole of the socialistic legislation off the statute-books of Australia. It has done too much harm to our country. I agree with the Leader of the Opposition that we have been overborrowing, but I do not know whether he urges a sudden cessation of borrowing, which, as I have already said, would cause a great deal of destitution and misery and immediate unemployment. Buti f borrosving continues how can we keep imports out of the country? borrowing large sums of money, and we know perfectly well that the bulk of it comes to us in the shape of goods. If we continue borrowing how are we to stop those goods from coming in, and, if goods do come in, are we going to increase their cost to such an extent that the man who cannot pass it on will suffer severely. I hope that the effect of the Loan Council that has been established will be to reduce borrowing. hope that, in the future, the Government will refrain from borrowing money outside of the United Kingdom. We have borrowed very large sums of money from the United States of America, and if that policy continues, the time may come when that country will put the screw upon us, and compel us to make reciprocal treaties with it. It is a dangerous policy to borrow large sums outside of the British Empire, and it may have an effect that will be detrimental to Australia. The Leader of the Opposition, and nearly every other honourable member opposite, stated that we must increase duties. ber admits that we have to do something. achieved by the indiscriminate' imposition of additional duties. Even the honourable member for Richmond( Mr R. Green) suggested that we should .place an embargo on all imports and exports coming into Australia. whom the gods wish to destroy they first make mad."" tralian Industries Protection League broadcasting views like thisDuring the three and three-quarter years ending on 3ist Marcli, 1927, Australia, financially retrograded to the extent of over £117""000,000. Instead of abating, official statistics showed that the momentum of Australia's financial d r if t was accelerating, the Commonwealth's excess of imports for the first nine months of the current financial year beiug almost £13,000,000, as compared with a total of £19,320,235 for the preceding 30 months. Tlieir remedy is That in these circumstances a necessity exists to pass a law inhibiting importations except under licence. Honourable members opposite would build a tariff wall around Australia akin to the great wall of China. They are always preaching peace, yet they are always desiring a trade war against other countries. The Australian Industries Protection League seeks to have it provided that nothing shall come into the country except under licence granted by the Minister for Trade and Customs. Just imagine sensible, sane people adopting that attitude in a country like this, with the wealth that we have had, and with the potential resources that we still have! What sort of madness are we coming to? The customs and excise I also duties this year amounted to £44,800,000, representing an indirect tax of £7 2s. 6-Jd. per head of our population. I have pointed out before, and I do so again, that the burden does not stop with the duty. All imports coming into Australia carry a 20 per cent, profit to the importer and a 33-J per cent, for the retailer. Making allowance for the handling by the retailer and wholesaler of a large proportion of the £350,000,000 of Australian manufactures, the tariff has cost Australia from £150,000,000 to £180,000,000 per annum. We know that the Government must impose custom duties, but the question is whether it has not gone beyond a reasonable point. I have never in this chamber advocated free trade, but I cannot support this indiscriminate protectionist policy, because of the corruption associated with it. With an unrestricted protectionist nolicy we should find industrialists approaching members who represent industrial areas Truly, "" Those ancl urging, "" If you put extra duties on such and such an item it will be of Then we have the Ausadvantage to this big firm, which will then be able to do something to your electors' advantage.""

86,Mr Gregory,"No good will beto have a duty placed ou primary products, and he would have to say, "" Yes, I will do that,"" merely because it would make his seat more secure. And so the demands would go on interminably. It is difficult enough at the present time, when a manufacturer desires to import machinery to carry on his work more efficiently and cheaply to get that machinery brought in at a reasonable rate of duty. I know from personal experience how difficult it is to obtain the necessary permit from the Minister. The primary producers have to pay double, and sometimes treble what the machinery costs in its country of origin. here an invoice for Belgian underclothing, on which item the duty amounts to 600 per cent, of the cost of manufacture. I also have a letter from the Geelong Chamber of Commerce that apneared in the Argus, dealing with hosiery, and complaining about the heavy imposition of duties in Australia. It readsFor underwear, it was mentioned, the factory price was 9s. a dozen. The Australian duty was equal to 15s. a dozen, making the Australian price, exclusive of freight and .the more important men in Australia: overhead charges, 24s. a dozen. Woollen underwear cost ISs. a dozen at the factory, and the Australian duty was 36s. a dozen. The duty on hosiery costing 8s. a dozen was 10s. a dozen. And yet we hear requests for increased duty on those items! Surely if our industries are carried on efficiently, they should be able to compete with the products of other countries of the world, provided that a reasonable rate of duty is imposed on the imported articles. Some time ago Mr Sutcliffe, the eminent economist stated that, assuming that wages are 25 per cent, lower in Great Britain than in Australia, the difference in the cost of a woollen article Avhen completed would be only 5 per cent, more in Australia than in Great Britain. When increased duties are demanded, emphasis is always laid on the fact that wages in Australia are liigher than in other countries, except the Dinted States of America. The Tariff Board should give careful consideration to the actual value of the article for which increased duties are asked. I have shown that British hosiery pays a duty of over 100 per cent. The people want these commodities. What right have we to give such high protection to one section of the comAlr. Gregory. munity? Parliament should treat all sections of the people alike. Surely honourable members will agree that ""the most important people in Australia are those who are engaged in primary production. If Parliament pursues its present course, and approves of legislation which will have the effect of destroying our primary industries, it will not be long before there will be grass growing in the streets of our capital cities. Do honourable members recall the anxiety that was felt in New South Wales, Victoria, and SouthI have Australian in July and August last when, owing to the absence of rain, there were grave fears as to the harvest? During my last election campaign, I was asked whether I considered that £8 a month was a fair wage t.o pay British seamen. I told the questioner that it was none of my business or his. The British shipowners and seamen should settle their disputes iu their own way and Avithout the interference of a feAV bolshevists. I then asked him Avhom be considered Avere the Avorkmen on our Avharves or the workmen on our farms, and further what Avages he Avas paying to the men employed on his farm. There was a burst of laughter folloAving my query, and the questioner hurriedly left the hall. I ascertained afterwards that he was paying his Avorkmen 35s. a week. Clearly we cannot afford to pay men engaged in our primary industries the same rate of wages, and give them the conditions enjoyed by Avorkmen in secondary industries, because our primary products have to be sold at Avorld's parity. Notwithstanding the difficulties under Avhich primary producers are carrying on, honourable members on both sides are asking for still higher duties for secondary industries. Already the high cost of production is strangling industry in this country. It has been responsible for the closing down of the Mount Morgan mine in Queensland. I remember reading these startling headlines published in the Melbourne "" Herald"" following the decision of the directors to close the mine:"" Mount Morgan Mine Closed Down. £15,000,000 worth of ore abandoned."" Will any one suggest that, if that mine Avere in America, it Avould not continue in production, notwithstanding the higher wages paid in that country? Much the same thing has happened in my own State. There has been enormous expenditure on railways, water supply and other facilities in Kalgoorlie, and beyears, that the wheat belt in Western Auscause of the increased cost of production, ranging up to 10s: a ton, many mines have been obliged to work on only the highest grade ore available. I do not say that we should get back to the old conditions of employment in either mining or primary products. I admit that we want better conditions. Mount Morgan mine made no provision for a rainy day. member knows that after the company had lost about £500,000, the Queensland Government came to its assistance and subsidized it to the extent of about £300,000. People who invest their money iu mining operations are not philanthropists. If a mine is not paying dividends it has to close. Not long ago the management of the Newnes shale oil deposits closed down because of the high cost of production, and a large number of men was thrown out of employment Western Australia the estimated ore bodies total approximately 1,000,000 tons, and the values range from 32s. to 34s. a ton. That miue, like many others, cannot be put into production because of special awards made by the Arbitration Court. All through Queensland there are big mineral deposits which, uncier more favorable conditions, would give employment to thousands of people. It has been estimated that one person emmanufacturers abroad. I refer honorployed in the various forms of primary production gives direct or indirect employment to eight or nine others. It will be seen, therefore, that if 1,000 persons engaged in primary production are thrown out of work, eight or nine times that number in other industries suffer also. It; should be our duty to safeguard, in every possible way, the position of our primary producers. In a recent issue of the Sydney Morning Herald, there appears an article headed "" Laud Romance,"" describing the development which has taken place in recent years in Western Australia. When I was Minister for Mines there in 1911 the area of land regarded as safe from an agricultural point of view, was somewhat limited; but so remarkable has been the progress during the -last fifteen or twenty tralia is as great as the whole of the State of Victoria. Some of it is magnificent country, but a considerable area is second and third class land which, provided the cost of production cau be kept to a reasonable level, will prove profitable, ancl carry a large population. Our producing costs are the highest in the world, and we are farthest from the world's markets, so we are justified in urging that everything possible shall be done to reduce costs. If the price of wheat were to fall seriously, there would be a clamour throughout Australia, not only from the farmers, but also from the thinking people in the cities, who at present, support the imposition of high duties. I am sure that honourable members who support that policy would, in those circumstances, find themselves in grave danger of losing their seats. A Melbourne manufacturer, named Sewell, in an interview which was In the Lancefield mine in published in the Argus not long aeo, pointed out that rivets which he needed in his works could be landed for £15 per ton from Great Britain, whereas the raw material for them cost him as much as that in Australia. When the 1920 tariff schedule was under consideration in this Parliament I had numerous letters from manufacturers to the same effect. It cannot be expected that in such circumstances we can compete with able members to the volume published under the title From Silver to Steel, which outlines the history of the BrokenH ill Proprietary Company. It is pointed out in that work that the company sent expert engineers all over the world in order to obtain the most efficient plant available. Its machinery was set up adjacent to the coal mines of Newcastle when coal was 9s. per ton-to-da y it is 26s. per ton in consequence of our existing fiscal policy-and the company had marvellously rich iron ore, probably the richest in the world, for it yielded from 66 per cent, to 68 per cent, to draw upon,",59,Comparison Of Estimated Expenditoris 1927 28 With 1921 22

The general manager of the company on his return from a recent visit to the United States of America, stated that the Newcastle establishment of his company was still equal to any in America, and the efficiency of the workmen there was as high. Why is it, in these circumstances, that the comland, so that the lot of the houseAvife pany is not able to compete with iron and steel manufacturers in other parts of the world ? Many years ago Mr Hoskins established an iron and steel foundry at Lithgow, 70 miles from the seaboard, and although he had practically no tariff protection-unti l 1920, our tariff was to all intents and purposes free trade-h e died a millionaire. His plant was at least '25 per cent, less effective than that enforceable against every section of the which the BrokenH ill Proprietary Company is at present operating.

If some assistance is required to stimulate these key industries, let it be granted by way of a bounty, so that rhe people may know what; they are paying. I am as anxious as any man to build up these industries within the Commonwealth, for I think that we should not be without them. If Mr Hoskins could make a success of his undertakings years ago Avithout auy considerable tariff protection, Ave should find out Avhat is preventing the BrokenH ill Proprietary Company from succeeding to-day. I advise honourable members to read the report of the exceptionally fine lecture Avhich Mr Julius delivered in Hobart in 1925, in Avhich he pointed out that the great necessity of the CommonA\ealth was cheap r poAver. The Postmaster-General( Mr shipping is dislocated in Melbourne and Gibson) gave me 'some interesting information the other day Avhen he said, in reply to a question, that it was costing his department alone £134,000 a year more to obtain its supplies of copper Avire from Port Kembla than to purchase them in Great Britain. prove of the heavy expenditure Avhich is 3fr.

One of the greatest difficulties that Ave haA'e to face is the obstructionist tactics adopted by the members of trade unions.

These dislocations have been particularly prevalent on the seaboard, and for that reason the Prime Minister has been urged, time after time, to suspend the coastal sections of the NaAugation Act. At present there is a dearth of fodder in the eastern States, and a surplus of it in Western Australia, but in spite of the adverse balance of trade against Western Australia of betAveen £7,000,0000 and £8,000,000 a year, the people in that distant State are preA^ented from taking advantage of their favorable position to reduce the trade balance, for members of labour unions will not Avork the cargo that is offering.

The report of the Economic Conference continuedThe conference regards us a vital economic question the increase of agricultural production, and, with this in view, the placing of agriculture on an equal footing with industry, by enabling those engaged in agriculture to attain a satisfactory standard of living, and a normal return for their labour and on their capital. That supports the remarks I made some time ago regarding the greatly increased cost of primary production, and the need for giving greater consideration to the requirements of the primary producers. Think of the failure of the wheat harvests in portions of the eastern States; the losses of the viticulturists in the Murray Valley on account of frosts; the damage done to the apple orchards of Western Australia by the thrip pest, and the losses sustained by the pastoral industry in Queensland. the people who take the risk of engaging suffer these tribulations, pay tribute to another section of the community? The final decisions of the Economic Conference may be summarized in this way1. That tariff walls must be reduced in the interests of the world, as well as in the interests of each particular nation. 2. That primary production must be freed from the shackles that add to production costs. 3. That private enterprise should not be interfered with by socialistic activities. 4. That no nation in modern civilization can be self-contained and make progress. 5. That national efficiency must be increased in all countries to improve the material welfare of the*people in all countries.

I do not approve of many of the things done by this Government. The sugar embargo is one of them. member remove the embargo? I condemn the Government for ever having imposed it . It was imposed in order to build up the sugar industry by the employment of white labour. In his report for 1926-27, the Queensland Auditor-General shows that, whereas in 1925-26 Queensland produced 503,000 tons of sugar, the production in 1926-27 dropped to 401,000 tons.

From -the point of view of defence alone, more population is necessary. greater our population the greater will be the home market for our produce, and the greater w ill be our wealth. In view of the huge debt incurred by the war, and the heavy expenses of government, increased production is essential. Unfortunately, instead of increasing, our production is decreasing.

Labour cannot get more out of an industry than it puts into it. Before labour can get high wages, it must create the wealth necessary to provide them. Production cannot be carried on at a loss.

If we. cannot compete successfully, industry cannot be carried on.

The ultimate aim of some of the railway workers is to get control of the railways system completely into their own hands, hut I shall deal with that later. been affirmed ou several occasions that the productive output of the people of Australia has increased since 1911, but while that may be correct so far as money values ure concerned, it must be remembered that the purchasing power of money bas decreased greatly during that period, and an estimate based on money values alone would he fictitious and incorrect. Taking the value of our production based on the index number of 1,000 in 1911, the index number for 1925 is 1880. Ou the same basis, the index number for wages for the same period is 1887, and the cost of living 1785, so that the material increase in the value of our production during the past fourteen years is small, indeed. duction per head is concerned, there is a small but actual diminution which augurs badly for the future prosperity of our people; when we remember that in the intervening period the States alone bave borrowed £440,000,000, that power schemes at enormous costs have heen initiated, that science and new inventions have revolutionized industry both primary and secondary, that the annual interest bill has increased by approximately £44,000.000, and that taxation has increased' from £18,500,000 in 1911 to £74,500,000 in 1.925. It becomes apparent to the meanest intellect that all is far from well, that we are living wholly on our capital and upon borrowed money, and that a day of reckoning for our carelessness, procrastination and extravagance cannot be far off. Only a little while ago Mr Swinburne, an old protectionist and a man who has the confidence of every member of the Ministry, pointed out that the cost of,protection in Australia was the highest in the world, and he wondered that the interests of the primary producer apparently excited so little concern abong the members of the Commonwealth Parliament. He pointed out that mines had closed down, and that millers were constantly asking for further duties to prevent foreign timber from coming into the country.' Many of our goods have to be sent away in cases, and we know the attitude which the Minister of Customs adopted only a little while ago in regard to the export of wine in casks. It has adjourned. HOUR OF MEETING. That the House at its rising adjourn until 11 a.'ni. to-morrow. House meets at 11 o'clock to-morrow morning, I should like to know whether we are to have an all-night sitting, or if the Px ime Minister will undertake to adjourn the House at a reasonable hour. Long sittings are fairly severe, and it is not altogether fair to honourable members on an important debate like the budget to expect them to speak at a late hour at night. ter and Minister for External Affairs) [1.1.1] I have discussed to-morrow's sitting hour with the Leader of the Opposition, and am afraid that I cannot give the honourable member for Perth the assurance he desires.
