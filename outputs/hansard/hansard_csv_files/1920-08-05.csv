I ask the Treasurer, therepriety of enabling the proper authorities to make payments to dependants who establish, a good claim, whether the person entitled in the first instance applies for the gratuity or not ? a very difficult one, and the whole matter is under consideration. If a way can be found to do what the honourable member wishes, I shall take care that ib is followed. I have the fullest sympathy with dependants who are in the unfortunate condition to which, he refers. MAP OF AUSTRALIA. through the courtesy of the President of the Senate, I was allowed to hang a series of maps in the Queen's Hall, one of whioh in particular attracted a good deal of attention. I ask the Treasurer if he will favourably consider my request that a sum' of money be placed on the Estimates to enable copies of that map to be sent to various parts of Australia, to show what great unoccupied areas we have in the north of this continent ? which the honourable member refers is a very striking one, and I should say that its circulation in this country would do a great deal of good. If the cost would .not be too much, I shall be glad to put a small sum on the Estimates for the purpose desired. POST OFFICE STOEES EMPLOYEES. asked the Postmaster-General, upon notice1.

(NEW SOUTH WALES) HOSPITAL: Question-That Mr Deputy Speaker do now leave the chair, and the House resolve itself into Committee of Supplyproposed. ' » orable members will probably recall that, last Priday week, I endeavoured to ventilate a grievance in this Chamber regarding the non-delivery of mails to the hospital in Wellington, New South Wales. Upon thab occasion, an exhibition of Christian charity was given by tbe honorwho called attention to the state of the House at a time when numbers of honourable members had just departed in order to catch their trains, the result being that the House was counted out, and I was unable to place my complaint before the Minister concerned. However, I now avail myself of the opportunity to place the following facts before the Postmaster General:-The Wellington district hospital is situated just outside of the postal boundary, although it is within the municipal boundary. For the reason that the In all cases .where Germans hospital is not inside the postal bounds, the Department refuses to deliver mails thereto. The consequence is that when the night nurse comes off duty at 7 a.m. she has to walk down to the post-office in the town, collect the hospital mails, and carry them back to that institution, so that it is often 11 a.m. before she can retire. ment be made whereby the mails shall be delivered at some point on the postal A . C. MORLEY. an exception might well be made to the (for Dr. .MALONEY) general rule.

30,Mr Lavelle,"T h is is a case wherehonorable member would advocate an extension of their hours on duty, or would favour the maintenance of their present twelve-hour shifts, if those periods could be reduced. It is unfortunate, to say tbe least, that after a nurse bas completed twelve hours on night duty, she should be required to undertake a walk in order to collect mails, and take them back to the hospital. outside the postal boundary? In an opposite direction from the hospital, mails are delivered by the Postal Department to Chinese and others, who, although they are within the postal boundary, are actually further from the post-office itself than is the hospital. This position is aggravated by the fact that to deliver mails to tbese Chinese and other residents, a road has to be traversed which is at any time bad, and in winter is almost impassable, whereas the road leading to the hospital is an excellent gravel construction practically to tlie doors of the institution. Altogether, I emphasize that this is a case where an exception should be made to the general practice of the Post and Telegraph Department. There are several other hospitals in New South Wales to which practically the same facts are applicable. Honourable members know ' that it has been the practice, wherever possible, to build hospitals at a reasonable distance from the centre of a town. This hospital is in a very nice situation, but simply beshown to those who fell on foreign battlecause it is outside the postal area the mails cannot be delivered to it. It is time that the Department made an exception in this case. If it did so it would give satisfaction to everybody, and would be put to no additional expense. staff at the hospital numbers ten, including the matron and a domestici staff of four, and there is a daily average of twenty patients. further investigation by tbe Department, which, I hope, will decide to deliver the mails at the hospital. 1 am interested in this matter, because for dicate that anybody was buried there. two years I was a member of the hospital committee.' This grievance was constantly before the committee, and has been the subject of negotiation with the Postal Department for a long time. agree with everything said by the honourable member for Calare( Mr Lavelle) except his estimate of the distance of the hospital from the postal boundary. I should say .that the distance is not more than 300 yards. The postal authorities might very well take a generous view of this case. The delivery of mails to the hospital would entail at the most' twenty minutes of the letter carrier's time in travelling beyond the postal boundary. I hope that the Postal Department will eventually see the reasonableness of this claim. there between the boundary and the hospital? last house on the hospital road is within the postal area. All that would be entailed by the granting of this request would be that the letter carrier would have to walk 300 or 400 yards beyond the boundary in order to deliver mails to the hospital; then he would return direct to the post office. Eveni f the. distance be 600 yards, as stated by the honourable member for Calare, I still strongly support the claim. [2.54] I again direct the attention of the Defence Department to the neglect of soldiers' graves in some Australian cemeteries. A little time ago I asked whether something could not be done to show the same respect to the soldier buried in his own country as is being fields. I cannot but feel that the matter has not been presented to the Department as clearly as it should be, otherwise some definite action would have been taken. RecentlyI was asked by a committee that The has been connected with the celebration of ANZAC Day to visit a big metropolitan cemetery to see what has been done there. The committee showed me a number of The case warrants graves that were entirely unmarked. They told me that when they first interested themselves in this matter some graves were being walked over by the general public because there was nothing to inThey showed me some that, owing to the kindness of the cemetery authorities, had been decently turfed, but were still unmarked. In one very pathetic case the I widow of a deceased soldier had placed upon the grave some little mark bearing",21,Commission On Basic Boundary

Amongst the graves shown to me was one of a soldier who died a few days after having taken part in the landing at' Gallipoli. I claim that these soldiers are entitled to the same mark of respect from the Department that the Australian people aroprove of being shown to the soldiers buried overseas. I am informed that these are not exceptional cases, and as *tbe years go by there will be increasing difficulty in identifying the graves. Therefore, the matter is urgent, and should be attended to forthwith. I bope that my remarks will be brought to the attention of tbe Minister for Defence, and that either the Department itself will undertake to erect some mark over the graves of soldiers buried in Australia, or, alternatively, that those who will undertake the supervision of the work shall be provided with the same design of cross or memorial as is being used on tbe graves of soldiers buried abroad. I urge that the same memorial be used in Australia as overseas, so that all graves thus marked by the Government shall bear the one form of recognition. Question resolved in the negative. Debate resumed from 4th August (vide That this Bil l be now read a second time. something is not done to effect a cure, I the first place I desire to put myself right in danger of being destroyed. in respect of an interjection I made yesterday when the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Tudor) was speaking. I said that the Bill would practically do away with the Arbitration Court. meant was, that the machinery provided by this Bill, being so much better than that of the Arbitration Court, would be used so frequently that the Arbitration Court itself would fall into disuse. The Leader of the Opposition seemed to think that I suggested that this Bill would wipe the Court out of legal existence. supported by the honourable member for Nepean( Mr Bowden). orable member for Kennedy that he is mistaken. The honourable member for Nepean had the same idea as I am now expressing, namely, that the machinery of this Bill will be used so frequently that there will be little use for the Court, machinery for destroying an award of the Arbitration Court. a way provide means for the variation of an award, but that is not to destroy the Court, which will still exist. I . mention this, because the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Tudor) seemed to think that, in my opinion, the Bill would wipe out the Court itself. However, I am sure this measure has not been introduced too soon. I do not look on it as by any means a panacea for industrial unrest, but it is a step in tlie right direction; and if I cannot get exactly what I desire from the Government, I must be satisfied with what is offered. you? take the best I can get at the present time, and I regard the Bill, I say, as a move in the direction in which some good can be achieved. No one can deny the serious position that industrial affairs have reached, not only in the Commonwealth, buJt all over the world. The position is not improving, but getting worse; the ill-feeling between the employing and employed sections of the community is becoming more intense and bitter, and if am afraid that the whole social fabric is a better one. and other cranks of that sort, may have WhatI desires of the kind just expressed, but they will not find sensible unionists to agree with them -The unionises and working men generally are, individually, men of fair common sense, and do not approve of these extreme and silly propositions. All they desire is a fair chance-to be in a position where they can feel they are getting fair treatment, and a just share of the product of their labour. The loss of money in wages in Australia during the last few years through numerous strikesa loss that can never be made up-is another fact that shows the time has arrived",22,Commission On Basic Boundary

46,Mr Atkinson,"Some Bolsheviks,when some serious step should be taken to find a remedy. I do not know that the Bill could go much further than it does, seeing the constitutional limits imposed on this Parliament in matiters industrial. I should have liked to see some attempt made to recognise that great aud most important section of the community, the general public, who are so seriously affected by strikes. As industrial affairs have developed of laJte years we find three parties concerned-the employers, the employees, and the general public-the last of whom suffer indirectly from strikes more than, perhaps, do the main parties to the disputes. It is the public who have to find the money for carrying on the proposedtribunals, which we all hone are going to improve matters; and in devising machinery to avert these industrial conflicts the general public must be contemplated. A strike in the coal-mining trade in a little time paralyzes the whole community by practically stopping all work; and, as I say, the public must be more considered than they have been in the past when legislation of this kind is under discussion. Why are so many people in the community anxious to go on strike t all waiting to hear; tell us. ous reasons advanced, some of which, I suppose, are correct. Some honourable members assert that industrial unrest is chiefly caused by the high cost of living; and I think there is a good deal in that idea. During the last fifteen vears or so wages have been raised considerably, but the cost of living has risen in a greater ratio. A workman may receive much more money for his week's work than he did ten or twelve years ago, but he finds that, owing to the increase in prices, he is now really worse off. That, to my mind, is a very serious position, which must lead the worker to believe that his prospects are anything but what they should be; he feels, not only that he is being debarred from the good things of life, but, what, perhaps, hurts him much more, that he is not in a position to do what he would desire for his growing family. If we can remedy that state of affairs we shall have done a great deal. power to fix the purchasing power of the wages awarded-. [136] price fixing and other devices, but they do not seem to work with much success. We have been asked by the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) to treat this Bill in a non-party spirit, and I hope honourable members will accept that invitation. We may look, I think, for some valuable suggestions from honourable members opposite for improving this measure, seeing that amongst them are many representatives of Labour organizations, who have spent much of their lives studying these industrial problems, from one point of view, at any rate, if not from all. Such members may be able to propose amendments to clauses which, in their opinion, are not far-reaching enough; and all such suggestions will, I have no doubt, receive fair consideration from the Government and from members generally on this side. Our object is to provide a measure that will keep the wheels of industry going round, so that production, which is now so necessary, may be pushed to its furthest legitimate limits. I can understand people going on strike for some big. principle, but I cannot understand the stoppage of work for causes which of late years have underlain a great many, of these conflicts.' An industry provides a man and his family with his bread and butter and the employers with the means of subsistence; and to cease production is to "" k ill the goose with the golden egg"" for all concerned. One cause of the failure of the .Conciliation and Arbitration Act is to be found in the fact that the machinery of arbitration cannot be set going until a position is created that practically amounts to a strike, and I do not. know why provision has not long since been made whereby a notification of a claim may be submitted for adjudication, work being allowed to proceed in the meantime without interruption, and the award when delivered being made retrospective to the date of the submission of. the claim. Such a provision would have saved the workers millions of pounds in the shape of wages, a loss which they will never be able to overtake. The Bill does not actually abolish the Arbitration Court, but so far as I am concerned, that tribunal could cease to exist to-morrow. member haa good reason for allowing it to go out of existence.",23,Industrial Peace Bill Second Reading

I cannot see where this measure is likely to provide an opportunity for a bogus organization to secure representation upon a tribunal and so displace a genuine union. W h y should there be such a suspicion? Suppose that some body of employers attempted to secure the appointment upon a tribunal of representatives of employees some of whom were not members of a properly registered labour organization. W h at would be the use of any decision given by such a tribunal 1 gained. the concurrence of and satisfies the great body of employees concerned-wh o would be trade unionists in every instance -the result will be n i l . More harm than good will be done. I cannot perceive the danger, but if the honourable member for Yarra( Mr Tudor) can suggest some safeguard, can propose an improvement to the Bill which would, actually tend towards the settlement of industrial unrest, then that would be a matter of such consequence that honourable generally would feel bound to go a long way in the direction of supporting h i m . B y tbe establishment of advisory councils, which would present recommendations to special tribunals, which, in their t u r n, would make awards, a very much more speedy settlement of trouble should be secured than by the present method of approaching the Arbitration Court. Under the provisions of this B ill the parties engaged in various industries will meet around a table, man to man. It stands to reason that any decision arrived at by such a process will afford greater satisfaction and last longer than an award of the Arbitration Court. only be instilled into the minds of the workers that an award given by a tribunal appointed under this measure must 'be the fairest thing to all sides-bein g the outcome of a round-table conferenceI feel sure that 90 per cent, of employees would be content.

I take the view that, in the light of a recent decision from the Chair, discussion upon this B ill is disorderly. There is already a Pederal Statute which deals with the subject of industrial unrest. The Federal Arbitration Court is an outcome of that Statute. There are more than forty cases now awaiting settlement by the Arbitration Court; and these are sub judice. AU the causes of industrial unrest which will have the attention of the Courti n its consideration of those for t y cases are being actually Nothing would be ventilated in this Chamber throughout Unless an award meets w it h the present debate. I am of opinion that it is not in order to introduce a Bill dealing w i th the subject of industrial unrest while the whole matter is sub judice. The recent decision of the Chair to which I have just alluded had to do w i th the Jerger case. decision for the day. as an attack upon' the Chair. I remembers spectfully remind Mr Deputy Speaker that when the honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Ryan) was recently prevented from discussing the guilt of Father Jerger honourable members were informed that the reason for such ruling was that the case of the reverend father was sub judice. That case, as a matter of fact, concerned the right of the Government to deport Father Jerger, and it was not a matter of his guilt or otherwise. I regard the present discussion as being out of order, .for the reason that there is already an Act of Parliament in force for the prevention of industrial disputes. Yet you, Mr Deputy Speaker, If it could are permitting the debate to proceed, despite the fact that there are more than forty cases before the Arbitration Court involving industrial unrest, which are at present sub judice.

Despite the fact that the matter of industrial unrest is sub judice, honourable members are being permitted to discuss a measure specifically introduced for the purpose of settling and preventing indust r i a l unrest Of course, I consider the recent decision of the Chair to be a silly one. The honourable member must withdraw that remark. it is not just what I wanted to say. But , in the light of that decision, I strongly hold the view that the present debate is out of order. I am quite prepared to give a ruling forthwith. my case. orable member has stated it . I rule that the B ill under discussion is properly before the House, and, therefore, that the debate can proceed. my intention to dissent from your ruling . B ill , although it represents a step in the right direction, will not provide a panacea for industrial unrest. trouble is so deep-seated that the measure is not likely to reach down to its roots. Human nature, with all its faults, is involved. Unless we can change the hearts of the people I do not see that legislation will achieve much. change the system which is responsible for it all ? see of effecting a radical, and, therefore, sufficient change, would be to bring in some system of co-operation, profit-sharing, or co-partnership. stitution I doubt whether the Pederal Parliament could to-day take steps in that direction; but the State Parliaments could do much to inaugurate such a system. made to feel that he is getting a fair proportion of the product of his labour I do not see that there can be any real cure for industrial unrest. The trouble with many people is that they hold the view As a result of the rethat the workers should have all the profits. they produce. / cult to estimate what proportion of a product represented the share of the employee actually engaged in producing it . silly as to t r y to estimate the share of an individual employee in the product of an industry. to be given all he produces, what suggestion has the' honourable member for I withdraw. Perhaps arriving at an estimate of his share ? honourable member take a course in economics; then he will find out. are to be examined it will be found that there are some workers who will secure mighty little as their share. TheB u t I wish to state man. who is engaged in a "" go-slow "" .policy will reap small benefit. However, there is a reasonable course which might be followed. If a system were inaugurated whereby the workers received a proper wage and a fair share of surplus profits from an industry there would be a different state of affairs. Employees would find it to their interest to make I fear that this the industry in which they were engaged a paying one. They would not tolerate, waste or loafing, for example. They The would put their brains as well as their hands into the task of making the industry prosperous, for the reason that the more profitable the business became the greater would be the sum divided. If employees could be persuaded to take up shares in an industry, instead of requirwhy not ing all cash payment for their services, there would be many more workers in the land who would be conscious of the rights of both sides. They would not take long to learn the difficulties of management, as well as the troubles of wage-earning. In time to come there should be no reaUnder the Conson why the workers themselves, by making a beginning along the line of securing shares in an industry, should, not qualify to become directors. They would accumulate so many shares Until the working man can be that they would become directors, and men of natural ability and practical experience who had worked their way up from the lowest rung of the ladder to the highest would be valuable colleagues for the men who supplied the brains required -",27,Industrial Peace Bill Second Reading

126,Mr Considine,"Of course, thedestruction of society if he found himself transformed into a useful member of the community, producing wealth with the rest of the workers; that, to him, would certainly mean the destruction of the existing order. But the honourable member for ""Wilmot( Mr Atkinson) mentioned people who "" go slow,"" or who will not work. body of ""going slow."" The honourable member knows well that there are two classes of idler in societythe one with the ragged pants and dilapidated condition generally, who is supposed to frequent the parks; and the other with the belltopper and a big waistcoat, who does not do anything useful. are not on this side of the House. whether that is so or not; but, if they are before the honourable member for Wilmot not on this side, at any rate, it must be because those here are ""going slow on the job."" We all know that society today creates an incentive to those who ""go slow'' or will not work. I have no fault to find, and I never had, with the brain-worker or the manual labourer. All those who contribute to the wealth of society by brains or muscle are workers, whether they be managers or "" pick-andshovel'' men. Other honourable members, with the honourable member for Wilmot, in approaching a question of this kind ask, ""How can a Judge, who knows nothing about the industry concerned, or the working conditions, and so forth, be able to determine the questions placed before him ?"" The honourable member for Wilmot practically held up such a Judge to ridicule, and as incompetent to decide regardingworking conditions in any dispute. I agree with tbe honourable m'ember that a Judge of the Arbitration Court, or any other individual who has no experience of the conditions under which men and women work, whether in the mines, factories, or fields, is incompetent to judge in such matters. Whether we call it an Arbitration Court, a Wages Board, a tribunal, or by any other name, it amounts to the same thing; there are so many representatives of the employers, and so many representatives of the employees, and then the gentleman, whether be-wigged or not, who knows nothing about the working conditions, and does not want to have any closer acquaintance with them, tries to strike the happy medium. ence. in favour of the employer. Honourable members talk about equal representation, but there never has been equal representation, so far as the employees are concerned, on any Board or in any Arbitration Court. By his social position and environment, the chairman of such a tribunal is, consciously or unconsciously, biased on the side of the employers, and not on the side of the employees. 1 a chairman is not fairly guided by the evidence ? evidence in any such, matter was placed and myself, we should each come to a totally different conclusion. the honourable member has done. The honourable member talked about his having studied political economists, whom he lauded, and then showed that the whole science of economics has been wasted on him, for he spoke of the wickedness of talking about the class struggle or class consciousness. The merest political tyro recognises that the interests of the employer and the employed, however much we may camouflage the fact, can never be in common. down Australia, and I know better than that. walked up and down the earth, and will bear out what I say. The honourable member for Grampians ( Mr Jowett), . the honourable member for Wilmot( Mr Atkinson), and others know that the basic factor of our system is production for profit, and when an employer hires a man, or a number of men, he does so to make profit; and to say that the interests of the profit-maker and the interests of the people out of whom the profit is made are identical is sheer nonsense. a little profit to average his losses.",30,Industrial Peace Bill Second Reading

139,Mr Atkinson,"The employer wantsmember put it very aptly when he said that out of his employment the working man makes his bread and butter and the employer makes his subsistence, and that to strike was to "" kill the goose that lays the golden egg."" Quite so; but the working people to-day in Britain, for instance, and in other countries, are taking a different stand. When the railways were taken over by the British Government during the war, the taxpayer was loaded up with £2,000,000 in order to make up the deficit in the .railway dividends; but now the employees have obtained a 50 per cent, share ih the management of the railways! fares and freights have been doubled against the general community. sult of the country making up the deficit in the dividends for the honourable member's friends. management. the same with regard to the .railways, and in France with regard to the postal services; throughout the world to-day the intelligenlt workers are demanding, not an extra Is. a day, but a share, and an increasing share, in the control of industry. way for them to get it? member suggested profit-sharing, and some more ""bird-lime"" of that sort. way. one. me yet. if the honourable member is unable to grasp the point. I am showing that the workers to-day are making use of both their industrial organization and their political organization; and the goal they are aiming at is the control of the factory, the workshop, the mine, and every cJther source of wealth, in order to democratize them. T h y do not wish to live, at the present day, in a state akin to the serfdom of feudalism, under which men were tied to the land. To-day in most countries the worker is just as much tied to Ithe factory, the workshop, and the mine as was his fellow-worker tied to the land in the feudal times. It is true that to-day the worker does not wear his master's collar, but if some honourable members opposite had their way he would wear it. The working class to-day are striving more and more consciously, as they begin to understand the position, for a greater share in the control of industry; and until the workers, who are industrially and politically organized, secure that control we can never have industrial rest. _^ "" control"" of industry at BrokenH ill for twelve months? people have lost control. friends who ""walk up and down the earth""? suspension of ' activities at present because ithe BrokenH ill people have determined that the right of the employer to poison men in five years with lead is out of date in a place like Australia-; they have decided that they will no longer allow their children to suffer, as the Commonwealth Sta'tistician has proved they do suffer, by showing that the infantile death-rate at that place is greater than in other centres of population in the Commonwealth. That deathrate, according to the medical testimony, is directly traceable to parents working in the lead industry ; and that is one reason why they decline to allow the employers the righit to send them to the cemetery at express speed. Any honourable member can make himself acquainted with the facts if he studies the cases put forward by the men's representatives from time to time. However, that is beside the question, and only said in reply to the interjections of the honourable member for Grampians. The fact remains that in no country in the world can there be industrial peace while the existing system continues.

Such catechism as I have indicated isonly imposed on the "" under-dog."" society to-day who determine how the other class may approach the Courts' and wholay down the procedure to be observed in those Courts. I shall never recommend the working classes of this country to degrade themselves in the Arbitration Court or before Wages Boards by allowing themselves to be weighed as so many machines, so that an estimate may be made as to how much coal and oil, as it were, is necessary to keep them, in good condition in order to make them available for further production. Honourable members have talked about varying awards in different parts of the Commonwealth. They say that an award may be made in Tasmania which may differ from an. award made in Queensland, but on what, basis will these awards, be made? How will the wages in one State differ from those in another? I suppose the difference will be based, OH the cost of living. But the working classes of this country will refuse to allow themselves any longer to be weighed on the basis of how much it will cost, to. keep an average family going in good, order and condition, so that the members of it may turn up at work on Monday morning, and continue at. work until midday on Saturday, with probably a little extra thrown in in order to secure the continuation of the species, and' insure that thefuture employerwill not go short of labour. ber has not quite grasped what I was driving at. honourable member was arguing' on the fixing of wages on the basis, of the cost of living, whereas-1 claim that, the working classes of this country will no longer permit their wages to be fixed on that basis..

Mr. CONSIDINE--The honourable member was arguing'in favour of the continuation of the existing system of paying people on the basis of a living wagej but that wage is not determined; by those who have .to live on it. a living wage. determined by those who have'to live 6n it, but by a man who is receiving about £2,500 per year, and has not the slightest intention of living under basic wage conditions. When it is a question'of'''giving a pension to Sir Samuel Griffith or some other person, who has occupied a prominent position in this country, no attempt is made to. ask questions on the basis of how little a man can exist on ; no, attempt is made to fix the, pension on the, basis of a living wage. Yet a living wage is considered good enough for the working classes, and personally I consider it is good enough for them so long as they are content, to put up with it . Some honourable members talk a great deal about the agitator. They say that he is a vicious individual who goes about stirring up. industrial unrest, strife, and discon'l among various sections of the communitj;.

I agree with Ella Wheeler Wilcox when she wroteFrom the discontent of men the world's best progress springs; So feed the flame from God which came, until you mount on wings. The whole course of human history has proved the truth qf those words. Industrial evolution, in common with social evolution, has shown that it is from the discontented men the world's progress has sprung, and we have industrial unrest to-dav because of the discontent of the working classes with the existing social system. The process through which society is now going is merely the birth pangs of the new social order. The world is in a process of reconstruction^ and the sooner men and women who claim to represent the various shades of thought and different interests in the community recognise that it is useless to tinker about with such trivial matters as Bills of this description and realize that a change is coining, whether they like it or not, the better it will be for the world at large. It rests with the honourable member for Grampians ( Mr Jowett), and others like him, whether the change is to be brought about by force or not, or whether recognising that it will come they will facilitate its arrival in order to involve the community in as little trouble as possible. .the honourable member and his lady friend. believe in industrial unrest, and encourage, it, as much as possible. member knows full well that I am striving to remove the causes of industrial unrest. BecauseI realize that these causes are inherent in the existing economic system, I . am advocating the alteration of that system, and I am advising the workers of this country to take over the means of wealth production and utilize them for the f?ood of the community at large. I would put the honourable member and his friends on exactly the same level in society as the workers, to produce co-operatively for the good of society as a whole. When society reconstructs itself on the basis of the socialization of industry, then, and then only, will the causes of industrial unrest vanish.. Honourable members talk about the third party to industrial disputes, saying that the public as a third party ought to have its interests considered. Who is the third party to a dispute to-day ? If the miners are on strike the parties to the dispute are on the one hand the miners, plus the public, consisting of the rest of the workers in the community, and on the other hand the employers. It is absurd to talk about having a third party to a dispute. There are only two parties in society, the employers and the employed, the exploiters and' the exploited, and while these two parties remain in existence social unrest must continue. We are discussing a motion for the second reading of a Bill for securing industrial peace; but the honourable member for the Barrier( Mr Considine) has made it painfully clear that, no matter what our efforts may be, no matter what provision we may place upon the statute-book, there will not be industrial peace, so far as he is concerned-and I suppose there are many who think with him-unti l the whole of the economic conditions of the world have been changed, and our present social system is destroyed. If that were so, no legislation, however mature, could hope to be effective, and we should be wasting our time in discussing the Bill. Our experience of the Commonwealth arbitration laws, it seems to me and there are many thinking people of the same opinion-is that they have not been a. success. When arbitration was first proposed in Australia, we were told that it would bring about industrial peace, because it would provide an opportunity for the parties to disputes to come together, and by arbitration avert strikes; but that has not been tbe result. Tn the administration .of the Commonwealth arbitration laws many constitutional difficulties have arisen, and the trouble thus caused has been accentuated by the endeavour to bring before the Pederal Arbitration Court dispntes which could not be said, except by a great stretch of imagination, to extend beyond the limits of a State. Notwithstanding that there have been arbitration courts in most of the States, created by State legislation, the industrialists have insisted on going to the Federal Arbitration Court, which has been: more expenr sive and more difficult to approach than any of the State courts. When the Labour party was in power in Western Australia, it set up what it declared to be the best Arbitration Court in the",34,Industrial Peace Bill Second Reading

His report contained a long account of the industrial conditions prevailing among, the miners of Durham. It was pointed out that,, although there was no law regulating those conditions, a central council had been formed, on which there was an equal number of employers and employees, and that there were similarly-constituted district councils. A dispute was referred in the first instance to 1 a district council, and matters on which the district council could, .not agree were referred to the central council. 1 central council could not agree, its points of difference were referred to a Justice of the High Court of England', who was specially appointed by those connected with the mining industry of Durham, and on every occasion his decision was accepted ; so that there had not been a 1 strike or lockout in the industry for over twenty years.

My desire is that the Arbitration Act itself shall be brought before Parliament and amended, placing full and complete obligations on every party who appeals to it. There is no immediate hurry for 'this Bill. Had the proper course been pursued the Government would have given the industrialists an opportunity to thoroughly study the Bill and suggest the amendments which they think desirable. As that has no<t been done, we must make the best we can of the measure. No Bill can be framed that will assure-industrial peace. Various attempts to do so have failed. The Pederal Arbitration Court has given justice in many cases, hut it has clear from the definition clause, which never created that industrial peace for which the community longs. The State Wages Boards have similarly failed. No legislation that does not assure to the workers the full result of their labour will produce industrial peace. Only when the workers are given that reward shall we have continuity of employment, industrial peace, and, perhaps, a better state of society. One of the first steps to be taken is an investigation of the causes of industrial unrest, in order to discover the defects of Ithe present economic system.

The one improvement that this Bill proposes to make is that the cases, may be heard more speedily than at present. That is certainly some advantage. I am not condemning the Bill entirely, but I wish to point out the weaknesses in ,it. The honourable member for Wilmot( Mr Atkinson) said that the provisions of this Bill would be no menace to organized labour. The measure does attack organized labour, because it gives the same privileges to the non-unionist as to the unionist.

I am particularly pleased that it is sought to make this a non-party question, because if ever there was a time in history when useful industrial legislation was necessary it is to-day, and the only effective way to afford some relief is to keep the whole matter free from party influence. Otherwise, it will simply mean that whatever the G'overnment desire to provide in the Bill will be inserted, t whereas if we arefree to vote according to our conscience, there is a possibility of doing some good. At the same time, no matterwhat legislation we introduce, there can be no guarantee of industrial peace in the present state of society.

As to the appointment of the chairmen of the proposed bodies, while I have no desire to. cast any reflection on the Governor General, we cannot fail to see that those appointed will be men whose ideas are identical with those of the Government of the: day. If a chairman should be appointed whose sympathies' were with the worker,, and who gave him a. better deal than the Government approved, his tenure of office,. I predict, would not be a long one; These appointments ought not to be. made by theGovernor-General, and in any case they should be filled by men with a thorough knowledge of the working conditions,, and otherwise practically acquainted with, the industry. I have a strong objection to any man being appointed to adjudicate unless he possesaas those very necessary qualifications. Judges have, been appointed to Arbitration Courts who were ignorant of the actual conditions of the workers, with the result in many cases that they have, confined themselves to an investigation, as to the least amount the worker could possibly live: on,, and have decided accordingly. I sincerely hope that if amendr ments are moved from this side of the House in the direction of assisting, the workers, they will receive the wholehearted support of the Government and their supporters. I am in favour of taking every opportunity for improvingthe machinery for the settlement of industrial disputes, but in the past the Government have not shown any special, desire to amend the Arbitration Act in orderto give facilities to the unions to approach the Arbitration Court. If Ministers were really sincere in their endeavour to break down the existing prejudice against that tribunal, they had ample opportunity of displaying theirsincerity by amending the; Act. Almost all the provisions of In -the past a man the Bill before us to-day are to be found in the existing Conciliation and Arbitrar tion Act. The' measure certainly provides a few moire tribunals for the settle^ ment of disputes which should' relieve the congestion at the Arbitration Court, but their powers are so limited that it is quea:tionable whether they will succeed in giving us industrial peace. To, secure industrial peace we must have tribunals ih which the whole of the workerswill have confidence.

265,Mr Eiley (South Sydney) [5.35],"order that two laymen might be appointed to assist the President of the Court, one representing the employers and the other the employees. Furthermore, the elimination of lawyers from tlie Court would effect a great improvement. The appointment of practical men to assist the President would shorten the time occupied in hearing disputes very considerably, because technical matters would not require to be fully explained. require to hear all the evidence, although there were two assessors sitting with him with a practical knowledge of the points at issue. hearing of evidence the assessors could give great assistance to the President in matters of detail. If all the parties to industrial disputes leave thc Arbitration Court, and take their cases to tbe proposed Commonwealth Council, it will lead to just as much congestion as ever. In my opinion the .best course to adopt is to amend the Arbitration Act, and appoint two laymen to assist the Judge in the way I have suggested. early days of arbitration in New South Wales laymen assisted the President of the Arbitration Court, and in the first three years that Court did splendid work. The only trouble was that most of the employers doubted its jurisdiction, and so riddled it with Full Court decisions that it was rendered practically useless. However, it was able to do good work in making awards, because it was clothed with the power to call upon the employers who were parties to disputes to produce their books and disclose the capital invested in their businesses, and the profits mation as to the profits made by an inthey were making. Naturally the employers objected to a Court which sought to inquire into their profits and losses, and set themselves up against such methods of conducting inquiries, with the result I have already mentioned. However, unless the tribunals proposed to be created by this Bill are clothed with the power to inquire into thc profits of any industry, and distribute a large portion of the wealth made by it among the employees engaged in it, there will be discontent among the workers. Evidence of this nature may be taken in camera, as was done in New South Wales. I was a member of the New South Wales Arbitration Court, and I know that, although we exercised to the fullest our power to inquire into an industry's profits, we carried out our solemn obligation not to disclose to the public outside the position of any firm. an industry that is making no profits? the tribunal that an industry is not being carried on at a profit, and that it cannot possibly pay a living wage, it is better that it should not be in existence. position of the mining industry? knows the definition of a mine, that it is "" a hole in the ground surrounded by liars""; but we cannot ask fhe men engaged in a mine that is not paying to work for nothing. If an industry cannot pay a living wage we should not endeavour to keep it in existence, because the men engaged in it could be better employed iu more profitable operations. The Labour party welcome any machinery providing for the settleI n the ment of industrial disputes. Notwithstanding what the honourable member for Barrier( Mr Considine) has said, we stand for arbitration, and we are anxious to help the Government to pass legislation that will bring about the settlement of industrial disputes by that means. However, at the same time we ask the Government to pay some regard to what we say, and to any amendments we may put forward. We would like to have the words "" and profits"" inserted in the definition of ""industrial matter,"" thus enabling a Board to secure complete infordustry. No man .will mind what a Board may learn about his profits so long as it is prepared to give him a just return upon his capital, while seeing, at the same time, that every person engaged in the industry gets a fair return for his labour. member'believe that the amount of profit made affects the industrial peace in any industry? for in clause 7, sub-clause a.

274,Mr Maxwell,"Then that is providedpeace of that industry, a Board can have cognisance of them. Bill is already contained in our Conciliation and Anbitration Act, and the Arbitration Court has laid it down that it has not the power to investigate the profits of an industry. It is in order to make sure that a Board would have this power that I suggest the insertion of these words in this particular definition. There are other anomalies' in the Bill which will require attention. Any one without experience of brickmaking could easily inquire into the cost of making bricks. quired in brickmaking; it is merely a question of raising the clay, and that is mostly done by machinery. The number of bricks that can he turned! out each day can be easily estimated, and under the new process known as the Hoffman kiln, the burning does not require much skilled labour. But the point I wish to make is that any tribunal inquiring into the brickmaking industry with a view to fixing the wages of the employees should also have the power to fix the selling price of bricks. member suggest that we have the constitutional power to do so? the power to settle the conditions of labour, and they cannot be settled satisfactorily unless we are able to fix the selling price of commodities. A tribunal may fix the wages of employees.in the brickmaking industry on the present selling price of bricks, but when an award is given, up goes the price of the bricks, and the public begins to complain about the high cost. Wales Arbitration Court gave an award in the cement-making industry. It examined the pay-sheet of every man engaged in the industry, and knew exactly the cost of producing each bag of cement. In making its award it estimated that the extra cost of labour would amount to about 3d. per bag. But ithe employers immediately advertised that the price of their cement would ibe increased by 9d. per bag. because of the increased wages they had been called upon to pay. The Court, having based its award on the profits made in the industry, knew well that they would permit of an increase of wages being paid equal to about 3d. per bag of cement, but it had no control over the selling price of the commodity. This is a power the Court ought to have in order to protect the public from profiteering. A Court can ascertain quite accurately the average number of pairs of boots each person engaged in the boot making industry can turn out per day, and can also inquire into the cost of material and supervision, and make allowance for a fair amount of interest on capital invested, but it should also be empowered to fix the price of boots to the consumers. Thus, the interests of the There is not much labour reconsumers as well as those of the workers will be safeguarded. I think that the parties should be given the right to nominate the chairman of a Board. Of course, if they cannot agree among themselves, the Government should step in and make the appointment. I strongly urge the Government to consider the advisability of amending the Arbitration Act, and not let it get into the minds of the employees that this Bill has been brought down with a view to undermining that Act and getting rid of the President of the Arbitration Court. already announced the intention of the Government to amend the Act by inserting in it all the provisions which the I believe so.

I do not think that is its object. Had the Government desired to abolish that Courti t could have gone about its purpose in more direct fashion. Personally, though, I do not see how it will be possible for the two sets of tribunals to continue in operation side by side. I would have preferred that the Government should have first, introduced the Bill to amend the Arbitration Act. Hadi t been my task to introduce a measure aimed at the securing of industrial peace, I would have endeavoured, first, to call a conference of employers and employees to discuss the whole situation and suggest remedies.

During the recent election campaign, I said, when discussing the problem of industrial unrest, that representatives of labour and capital should be brought together. I held the view that they were bound to agree, along broad lines, upon some form of legislation in order to solve the great problem. And, if there were such agreement, it would be reasonable to expect that both sides would abide by the decisions of whatever tribunal might be that these will not he permanent bodies, created. Unless there is hearty good-will and co-operation outside, no industrial legislation can be expected to prove successful.

The honourable member, however, has since given indications in that direction. usually come in the shape of amendments in Committee? will be made in Committee. The main point of the criticism offered hy the Leader of the Opposition seemed to be that bogus organizations would be represented on the special tribunals. The same fear was expressed by other honourable members. I do not know what is meant by a bogus organization. One honorable member of the Opposition said emphatically that non-unionists were not entitled to any consideration. I am afraid that is the rock upon which we split. I claim to have as much sympathy as any honourable member with the working man, and I represent thousands of genuine workers. If they had not voted for me I would not be a member of this House. But while I do not deny that unionism should be encouraged, and that it has done a lot for the working man, I will not go so far as to say that if a man does not belong to a union he is not entitled to consideration by the Legislature. The method of appointing the chairmen of the tribunals is another point in regard to which objection was raised by critics of the Bill. I agree with the suggestion made by the honourable member for South Sydney( Mr Riley). It appears to me logical that the representaThe Prime Minister( Mr tives of employers and employees' should, if they are able to agree, appoint their own chairman. I can quite understand that a chairman appointed by any Government would be viewed with suspicion by one side or the other. If it is not possible for the members of the tribunal to agree as to a chairman, it would be better to leave the appointment to be made by a Judge of the Arbitration Court or some other independent person outside the Government. The Bill provides for the appointment of a Commonwealth Council, district councils, and special tribunals. I assume to the members of which fixed salaries will be paid. My idea is that the tribunals should be appointed to deal with any particular dispute, and immediately a settlement has been arrived at the tribunal should be disbanded. I see no necessity for the creation of permanent bodies. sary that, in addition to existing ""Wages Boards and the' Arbitration Court, there should be the three bodies proposed to be created by the Bill. One body on which employers and employees are equally I hope such suggestions represented should be sufficient to deal with any dispute. If this legislation is to be a success there must be a co-operation between employer and employee, and I understand that to be the desire of honourable members on both sides of the House. The necessity for such co-operation is recognised, particularly by the representatives of organized labour in the House. Of course I except the honourable member for Barrier( Mr Considine), who has advanced ideas as to the best",46,Industrial Peace Bill Second Reading

297,Mr Bell,"method of remedying industrial unrest. I totally disagree with his views, and' I do tioned by the honourable member for Macnot think he represents the opinion of organized labour. An imporant question is how the tribunals are to arrive at what is a fair wage. entitled to a f u l l reward for his labour. honest co-operation of those who repreSome honourable members claim that he is entitled to all that he produces, and that, indeed, the miner should own the mine. If that policy were adopted a certain section of labour in the community, the workers in a profitable mine, would enjoy great prosperity provided they would work; but I am afraid that hundreds of unprofitable mines would not be worked at all, many men would be thrown out of employment, and there would be an end to prospecting and development. If a fair wage is to be based on the profit earned in an industry we shall have in the one industry, and in the one district, different sets of wages. a handsome profit whilst another mine in the same State may return no more than a living wage. It would be difficult indeed to arrive at a fair wage on that basis. Sitting suspended from 6.S0 to 8 p.m. adjournment I was saying that it is difficult to understand how we are to adjust wages on the basis of the profits derived from each and every industry. I agree that the basis of the wage might be nrofits derived from any particular industry, such as mining, but it is obvious that, if we fix all wages on the basis of profits, we must have different rates of wages in different industries. I can think of nothing more likely to bring about dissatisfaction or instability than different rates of wages in different industries in one State, or in one locality. It has been said that the workman is entitled to the f u l l reward of his labour, but if we fix there has been no evidence of obstruction the wage on profits and on the cost of production in any primary industry, the price of many commodities must be in creased, and the cost of living soar higher and higher. If wages are on this basis it is inevitable that we must give the men in every industry the same chance. Not without'a great deal of knowledge of the primary industries I contend that, if the men who work in the dairying industry or on the farm were to get anything like the wage of £ 5 or £ 6 per week menquarie ( Mr Nicholls), butter would be 4s. per lb. every day of the year, and wheat would be much more than 7s. 8d. per bushel. Unquestionably the worker is I sincerely hope that we shall have the sent organized labour in framing this B ill , and amending it where necessary, so that it may be acceptable to both employer and employee. It has been said that no legislation will bring about permanent industrial peace, and on that, I think, we are all agreed. It is not expected, I take it , that this B ill w ill bring about the millennium in the industrial sphere, any more £han we can have universal peace through the agency of the League of Nations; while human nature remains what it is, there w ill be industrial disputes, and, I fear, wars, small or great, so long as this world lasts. This, however, .is no reason why we should not Obviously one mine may return frame legislation and devise machinery in an honest attempt to repair the shortcomings in our existing industrial conditions. The idea of the B ill is to. attain that end; and with the co-operation of those who are honestly desirous of giving the workman what is his due-givin g a fair deal to both employer and employed by bringing the two together-w e can expect to some extent to gain the end in view. I assure honourable members opposite that any amendment introduced, no matter by whom, which appears to me to b.e for the betterment of the measure, will have my support. As to the time allotted for the discussion of the B ill , a fortnight, as we know that period in parliamentary work, should be sufficient; but if , at the end of that time, it is found that there is still a desire to discuss certain amendments, and there is no evidence of a desire to obstruct MrC AHLTON -You will admit that so far? no evidence of a desire to obstruct; but if it is found at the end of the time allotted that there are amendments which need discussion, I , at any rate, will give my support to any proposal for its extension.

This is an inopportune time for the introduction of amending industrial legislation, 'because, as the Prime Minister announced to-day, a Bill is to be introduced very soon to provide for the calling together of a Convention to consider the amendment of the Constitution. sonally, I do not think that there is any need for such a Convention, but the Convention is to be held, and it will discuss, among other things, the control of industry. I believe that there will emerge from that discussion the view that has been expressed by Mr Holman, of New South Wales, and others, that industrial legislation should be entirely a Commonwealth power. stances, why patch up our arbitration, law in the manner proposed by this Bill1 It would be preferable to wait until' the Convention has met. A majority in this House evidently favours the idea of a Convention, and, therefore, why not wait until that body has stated its views on the subject of industrial legislation? Mr may hot obtain tbe approval of legal Justice Powers, the Deputy President of the Arbitration Court, has published a pamphlet of six pages, of which honourable members have received a copy, in -which he shows that the Commonwealth Arbitration Court has been a success, and that arbitration has not been the disastrous and awful failure in Australia that some persons have declared it to be. The Labour party is pledged . to the amendment of the Arbitration Act. We have not thrown arbitration overboard, but we wish to' have the Act amended to avoid the Serbonian bog of technicalities once spoken of by Mr not test the opinion of the present Court Justice Higgins. Arbitration Court for its short-comings, we should consider the constitutional limitations upon its powers. Mr Justice Powers mentions a few of them. Court has jurisdiction only for the settlement of industrial disputes extending beyond the limits of a State-it settle all disputes-and cent, of the disputes that have arisen are State disputes, with which it cannot deal. I think that the Court has done very Mr Fenton. Our well. In five years, according to Mr Justice Powers, 729 agreements between employers and employees have been filed in the Court in settlement of disputes of which the Court had cognisance, some of them being agreements with individual employers, and others being agreements with groups of employers. That was the work of the conciliation branch of the Court's activities. The Prime Minister has made a great deal of the fact that he is now introducing what has been Pertermed the round-table Conference; but I would remind the House that the roundtable Conference is already provided for in our arbitration law. Mr Justice Powers has been assisting Mr Justice Higgins in the Arbitration Court for a number of years, and he says that one of the first things they do when an InterState dispute arises is to try to bring the parties together and have the matters Under these circumin dispute discussed at a round-table Conference at which employers and employees are equally represented. Trouble has arisen because, owing to constitutional limitations, the Court cannot deal witb disputes which are wholly within a State. That, I understand, is the ruling of the High Court. WhatI am about to say gentlemen, but personally I think that we should not pay too much regard to a ruling of the High Court given six, seven, or ten years ago. To-day the personnel of the High Court is quite different from what it was then. Not one of the Justices who originally constituted the High Court is now on the Bench. Furthermore, times have changed, and I believe that many of the earlier decisions of the Court would be upset if the questions were brought before the Court as at present constituted. At any rate, there is no reason why we should Before blaming the on many questions. I think that it would be a good thing to passthe industrial legislation that we think needed, and try to enforce it with _ a view The to obtaining from the present High Court a decision as to its constitutionality. The Court has varied some of its earlier decannot cisions, and I see no reason why _ its at least 95 per opinion on certain constitutional questions should not be tested again. Mr Justice Powers saysWriters Have suggested American methods to settle industrial disputes. Some of them may be well worth adopting; but I think I am Rafo in saying that more lives bave been lost, and more property has been .destroyed, during one strike in the United States, and the suppression of it by the military-instea d of by compulsory arbitration-tha n we have lost during all the strikes in Australia since Captain Cook landed at Botany Bay in 1770. Honourable members are forced to express their opinions about this B i ll hurriedly, because the Prime Minister has given the order that its consideration must proceed quickly. My complaint is that we have not had sufficient time to consider it properly, and the speeches of some honourable members opposite have shown that they have not thoroughly studied its provisions. The old cry has been raised that it is a B i ll to be dealt with in Committee, and, that it can be amended there. During some of the speeches from this side, and particularly during the speech of the honourable member for Hunter( Mr Charlton), honourable members opposite appeared to endorse opinions which were being uttered, and stated that in Committee they would support amendments which would better the B ill . I hope that those honourable members will stick by their guns. It has happened too often that honourable members, after declaring themselves in favour of a certain course, have, when the whip has been cracked, gone back on their utterances, and voted contrary to them. The Prime Minister has said that this is not a party measure, but one to be framed in Committee. Personally, I do not expect any good results from it unless it can be amended almost out of existence. those who belong to the industrial unions of the country will seek relief under its provisions. If they do not, the measure will be an absolute and disastrous failure. The request for delay was a fair one, and had it been backed up by honourable members opposite, the Prime Minister would have been forced to yield, as he has yielded on other occasions, to the majority. I believe that all the amendments that will be proposed in Committee will be. reasonable, and have in view the improvement of the B ill , and I trust that they will be supported from all quarters. TheB ill is a bad one; but, if we can, let us make it a good one by amending its provisions, and inserting others, so that the measure may be acceptable to the unions. If this is not done, failure must result. has been said during the debate that this The position in France measure is probably one of the most i m portant that has been brought before the House, and any one who recognises the conditions of the world to-day must agree that the Bill calls for the earnest cooperation and assistance of every member -no t as a party measure, but as one on which the destinies of Australia may possibly depend. The problem of industrial unrest is world-wide. Any one who has been out of Australia recently knows that our 'industrial problems and troubles are small in comparison with those cf nearly every other part of the world. Early last year I visited Great Britain, the United States of America, France, and Canada. On my return I was surprised by what I heard said on public platforms and in private conversation, and by what I read in the press, concerning the conditions in Australia. The impression was abroad that this country was a seething cauldron of unrest, and that it might ""be better to seek some peaceful land where industrial conditions were more stable. There never was a more absurd impression. We have our industrial troubles; but, as I have said, compared with those of other countries, they are small. We possess a priceless asset in the fact that, generally speaking, Labour here is organized and controlled. Much has been said against trade unionism and. trade union acts with which I entirely disagree. There can be no better^ thing for industrial peace than the existence of good and efficient Labour organization, provided that Labour takes its responsiI question whether bilities seriously, and sees that its organizations are controlled by the best minds in the industry, and by men who trul y represent the orderly, decent worker whom we all know. recognising the unions in this measure ? should berecognised, though whether they are or are not may be open to question. But if by the recognition of unions you ask me to drive into outer darkness the man who does not belong to a union, I shall not do it .

305,Mr Bruce,"I think that theyterrible to-day. There is no more potent force for the creation of industrial trouble than an enormous increase iu the cost of living. The people of Australia have been subjected to a heavy increase in the cost of living, but, compared with what Prance has had to undergo, our experiences are nothing at all. The cost of living in Prance has advanced nearly 300 per cent. In Australia, the increase is estimated to be nearly 60 per cent. From enjoying the privilege of being one of the cheapest countries in the world in which ,to live, France to-day has the unenviable reputation of being one of tbe most expensive. This fact has reacted heavily upon the people, and France is seething with industrial unrest. It will take the best brains of the Republic, and the united efforts of all parties, to .steer France through her troubles. In Great Britain, a similar .condition of affairs exists. The cost of living is '.estimated to have .risen about 150 per cent. To-day, the British people .are grappling, not -only with that problem, but with another, with which the people -o£ Australia, happily, are not faced. Prior to the war, the .great majority of the working people were treated like dogs. They never had -'a fair chance, and those who were on top saw to it that they did not get a fair chance. Naturally, to-day, as 'the workers are finding themselves upon a ""basis where there is time to think and opportunity ifor making comparisons, 'they are dwelling upon the injustices to which they were subjected not long ago. The attitude of the working masses of England is going to provide a very difficult problem.; indeed, .so difficult will that problem pTove that it will only be by extraordinary efforts that a solution is likely to be found. The efforts already being made to .solve the problems of peace, however, are only comparable with those of the British people to solve the problems of war; and honourable members are aware of the nature of those tremendous and successful efforts. As for the conditions in America, it is almost impossible to dwell xipon the situation. I -.saw a good deal of what was going <on in the United States. America to-day may be compared 'with. Vesuvius; that is ito say, there is not a .state of active eruption, but >such a condiMr Bruce. n tion may break out at any hour. The industrial unrest and tbe general attitude of labour towards capital constitute a grave menace. Turning attention to the situation in Australia, we find that our troubles .are very loudly proclaimed; but that is where our safety lies. There is a great deal of noise surrounding our troubles, for labour here has a voice and makes itself emphatically heard. In the voicing of labour's troubles, however, our salvation may be found. While .our troubles are considerably less than those of other people, we must nevertheless make a determined effort to solve them; and, if we can do so, we will have placed ourselves well ahead of any other country in the world. It has been mentioned in -the course of this debate,, I .think, -that there is .a specific sum of £5 OOO,0O0 waita ing to be invested in Australia, hut that, owing to Australia's terrible industrial situation, that amount of capital will not be coming here. Such a /statement is immediately challenged by the suggestion, ""Where 'else would that money 'go for investment ?"" There is no better place than Australia to take it. But here another ifac't arises Tor consideration. The world does not know what we know about Australian industrial conditions. We have never inaugurated adequate propaganda in London to counteract the derogatory statements made and published regarding this country. One never sees .any reference to Australia in 'fhe London press unless it has to do with .droughts or '.strikes, or other such calamities. Surely, with our resources, there :should be something of a different character .in the ""London newspapers by way of presenting Australian news.' 'There '.should be something done in the matter of presenting to the people of ""England a it-rue statement regarding prevailing conditions in the Commonwealth. 'This Bill represents an effort, made in all seriousness, to help regulate '.the relations existing between employer and -employee, and to contribute towards industrial peace. But the effort was inaugurated under unfavorable conditions. There has been a suggestion from honourable members opposite that there should be delay in order that the proposals conitained :in the Bill mayfeefully and carefully considered. I 'do not share 'in thai view. T i e Prime. Minister( Mr Hughes) has mad©, an effort' tobringtogether the two. classes chiefly concerned'; but his activities have proved abortive.

The Government, by the grace of God, had the good' sense to take organized Labour into, their confidence and to. explain the whole situation. They asked for cooperation and willing assistance. And it . is",52,Industrial Peace Bill Second Reading
306,Mr Mahony,"That is r i g h t ; limit tlieto be said to the credit of leaders of organized Labouri n the Old Country that they rose to the opportunity afforded them and played their part in a way that will ever reflect credit upon those who had the handling of British Labouri n those early days of the conflict. Labour leaders agreed to forego many of the rights that had been fought for for many years and had been secured only with the greatest difficulty. They agreed to the dilution of labour. That was the first great point, and, probably, it involved a principle which had been placed by true unionists on the very highest pinnacle of their beliefs. The leaders agreed to the employment of women and boys in the stead of skilled labour. They agreed to the number of boys in proportion to skilled labour being increased; they agreed to a working week of seven days, and to the institution of unlimited hours of work. In exchange for these great concessions, however, they demanded a pledge, which was given, that those privileges which they were forgoing were to be withheld for only so long as the war continued. A f t e r a time the realization became acute that, as the war drew to its conclusion, tremendous problems would have to be dealt with if that pledge was to be honoured. A committee was appointed, with the Deputy Speaker of the House of Commons as its chairman. That body is known as the Whitley Committee. A f t e r months of deliberation, itreported, in March of 1917, upon what it considered the best means of honouring the pledge and of bringing about, for the first time in the history of Great Britain, true industrial peace. The Committee's recommendations were, I believe, wonderfully wise and prudent -bodies which the Committee suggested They were' accepted by all classes in Great Britain. me forcibly, and that is with regard to the spirit with which the Whitley Committee approached its task. T should like to read to honourable members a paragraph from the preface to the recommendationsof the CommitteeThis said that failure to utilize existing opits portunities for securing a permanent improvement in the relations between employers and employed might involve the nation in grave industrial difficulties at the end of the war, and proposed the establishment in each of the main industries of the country of an organization representative of employers and workpeople, having as its object the regular consideration and determination of matters Mr Bruce. affecting the progress and well-being of the trade from the point of view of all those engaged in it-as far as that might be consistent with the general interest of the community. That was the basis upon which the Committee worked, and I shall indicate to' The the House briefly their recommendations. A t first sight 1 thought that this B ill reproduced the Whitley Committee's scheme, but I find that it is considerably different.' The underlying principle in the Whitley Committee's report was the fact that they recognised that industrial troubles generally start fro m some very small beginning, and in order to avoid the genesis of trouble they started their scheme with a works committee to operate directly in every big establishment in which the scheme is adopted. Then there is the district committee, which deals with questions affecting the whole district, such as a coal-mining district like that represented by the honton). Above both those organizations, there is a national council, which deals with the problems on a national basis and considers all great questions arising in any trade. But I would emphasize the point that the Whitley Committee recommended that each council or works committee should deal with only one trade; that each trade should have its own complete organization. I shall indicate some of the other recommendations, because I think that if we can realize what was the considered opinion of the best' brains in England, after many months of investigation and study of this problem, we may derive some help in arriving at the solution of a very similar difficulty in Australia. The powers given to the should be created for each trade are very One point has struck wide. It is contemplated that the various works committees and district councils shall not only deal with questions of labour, hours, and payment, but also assist in bringing about greater efficiency. The-committee's plan was based on the principle that each industry must have owni organization running righ t through the industry, from' the earliest point at which troubles might arise, on to a national council which would deal with the problems of an industry as a whole. The principles of the Whitley Committee's report have been adopted in a great number of industries in: Great Britain. The first industry to take up",54,Industrial Peace Bill Second Reading
307,Orable Member For Huniter ( Mr Charl,"the scheme was the pottery trade,' and amongst the others which followed were furniture-making, silver and gold, horological and allied trades, match-making, rubber manufacture, silk industry, baking, china clay, tramways, water works, woollen and worsted, electricity, bedstead making, boot and shoe manufacture, table making, carpet making, and many other trades. the first industry to adopt the Whitley Comimittee's report was the pottery trade, and I shall read to the House some of the objects set out in the memorandum of the national council for that industry. obvious is the advancement of pottery making, and the consideration of imeans whereby all manufacturers and operatives shall be brought within their respective associations. I quite agree that we should ever t r y to employ men who belong to industrial organizations, provided always that when they become members of a union they shall' take a live interest in its affairs and extraordinarily good care that it is controlled by the best men in it , and not by a clique of disgruntled and troublesome people who were never particularly keen on work. I would like to emphasize is that the Whitley system is not only going ito help the employer and the employed, but also the industry itself, because amongstthe other objects are(f) Improvement in conditions with a view ,to removing all danger to health in the industry. (g) The study of processes, the encouragement of research, and the full utilization of -their results. (h) The provision of facilities for the full consideration and utilization of 'inventions and improvements designed hy work-people, and for the adequate safeguarding of the rights of .the designers of such improvements. There is this other object to which I draw particular attention, because it has a bearing upon a point raised by the honton)-(j) The collection of full statistics on wages,' making and selling prices, and average' .percentages of profits on turnover; and on materials, markets, costs, &c., and the study and promotion of scientific and practical systems of costing to this end.

Thank God, there are few men like the honourable member opposite. member be favorable to embodying in this B ill the powers he has enumerated in'regard to-the collection of statistics? no objectionto it .

If the Commonwealth Council which this B ill proposes to create is comprised of decent men, there can be no possible harm in the information which the honourable member seeks being ;made available with a view to determining f a i r rates of wages and rewards for labour. But I think it is the view of'most decent people engaged in trade that there should be a l i m it to the number of these inquiries. They are an interference that is becoming an absolute menace to trade to-day.

323,Mr Mahony,"The honourable memberhonorable friend on the f r o n t benches opposite ? object of your speech is to prevent the industrialists from having a chance of debating the B ill . long and carefully-considered political career the honorable member has made a mistake. The first principle of the B ill is that there shall be a Commonwealth i Council, which, apparently, will perform the same duties as the National Councils under the Whitley scheme, save that in the latter scheme each national council is for one industry only. I think we shall have to consider the position that w ill arise under this B ill , for apparently the Commonwealth Council will have to consider matters affecting all industries in which questions may have to be determined on a national -basis. This council will have to deal with matters relating to all industries, covering a wider field than the Arbitration Court, with one, and even two, High Court Judges, has been able to cover without intolerable delay; but if it confines itself to wide questions of national importance it may be possible for it to do the necessary Work, operating in conjunction with the district councils and the special tribunals provided for. Thusi t is not likely to be overloaded, as is the case with the Arbitration Court. delay in regard to Arbitratio n Court proceedings is due to the fact that the Government have not appointed sufficient Judges? able members that the Arbitration Court has been hopelessly overloaded, though it has done a lot of valuable work, and obviously something must be done to relieve the present situation. I shall say something f u r t h e r about the Arbitration Courti n a few moments. benefit which one can imagine to be the outcome of the scheme for a national council will be that employer and employee w ill meet together and then come to quick decisions; but I am afraid this object will be defeated if men who are engaged, in a mining industry are called upon as members of the. council to deal w i th shipping troubles or any other disPeace Bill. 3335 putes in allied industries.

The district councils, which are provided for in clause 9, appear to be analogous to the district councils under the Whitley scheme, save that here also the same set of representatives would have to consider questions bearing upon different industries, while the Whitley district councils are for one industry only. The powers'of the district councils are very wide, and therefore the danger of overloading seems to be apparent. act as district councils. will really be the child of the special tribunal, and I think the position of this special tribunal might be cleared up.

He said that without unionism we cannot have arbitration. whether he would agree that under this measure recognition should be given only to recognised industrial unions, he said, "" I would not shut out into outer darkness those who d.o not choose to j o in a union.""

He said that one of the principal causes of industrial unrest in this country to-day is to be found in the increased cost of living. lecture of the evening. If u l l y expected it from him. I have heard it from h i m direction.. I content myself with this debefore. He would smite hip and thigh every one on this side or anywhere else who would dare to suggest that the large profits made in Plinders-lane might be quoted as a reason for any unrest. People who would make sucb a suggestion are, in the opinion of the honourable member, enemies of their country. He says that such a condition of affairs does not exist. I heard the honourable member say that before, and I make this definite statement now to h i m, and challenge h i m to contradict it . for Flinders is not here. 13 not here I cannot help that. He made the definite statement that there is nojustification for saying that because prices are manipulated in Flinders-lane, that that constitutes a reason for unrest in this country to-day. I tell the honourable member that I recently visited woollen mills at Geelong, and had a definite statement from a gentleman at the head of those mills that cloth was .being supplied through one end of Flinders-lane at 12s. a yard, and came out at the other end at 30s. a yard. honourable friend says as much as £2 a yard is charged by Flinders-lane for this cloth. But I am content to repeat the definite statement made to me by a gentleman at the head of the mills. £2 10s. a yard. satisfied with the statement made to me. The honourable member for Flinders told us that the profits of firms in Flinderslane never exceed 50 per cent. If the honourable member can prove that the difference betwen 12s.' and 30s. is only 50 per cent, he should be wearing tbe mantle of the Treasurer. It was rumoured that he was to be appointed Treasurer, and he certainly would be an The honourable member made excellent man for the position if he could so manipulate figures as to . make the difference between 12s. and 30s. only 50 per cent. An honourable member reminds me of another of the honourable Then he gave us his principal member's inconsistencies, but I have no intention of proceeding further in this finite statement from the head of one of the principal woollen mills in Victoria, which is an indication of how a commodity of this kind is manipulated when passing through Flinders-lane. It is b ut one out of many instances which I could -quote in answer to the statement of the honourable member for Flinders( Mr. Bruce), that Flinders-lane is a. place where nothing but innocence reigns, and where nothing is done which is capable of causing industrial unrest. NowI wish to say a few words in regard to the B ill itself. I cannot support it in its present state.. I have no enI f he thusiasm for it , and cannot conceive of any good coming out of it . In the-beginning we asked the Prime Minister( Mr' Hughes) to allow us time to consult with 1 those concerned outside, namely, the in dustrialists of this country; but he told' us that that could not be done, and that as those whorepresent organized labour would have every opportunity of putting their point of view, the necessity of consulting organized labour outside was not apparent.

382,B U T When He Was Asked Mr Parkermoloney,"I ' amorable member must not discuss that matter; it has already been decided by the House. said it , I withdraw it . The measure is a sham, pretending to give something when, as a matter of fact, it gives nothing. Judging by his own remarks, the Prime Minister, has lost no opportunity of ascertaining the views of those opposed to labour, and in this, as in other matters, I believe it is his principal concern to do that which is agreeable to the forces that keep him in power, while at the same time giving very little opportunitv to organized labour to put forward their point of view. I agree with one thing which the honourable member for Swan( Mr Prowse) has said this evening. The honourable member spoke as one represent, ing a country constituency, qnd told us of the wheat he grows; but I remind him that there are honourable members on this side of the House who are just as capable of speaking for those who grow wheat, and who possibly grow quite as good wheat as that grown by the honourable member. orable member was going to leave me alone for a while. the belief that where the interests of any section of the community are concerned all other sections should-have due notice of what is proposed, so that they may put forward their views. orable member object to my putting forward my views ? object to the honourable member putting forward his views, but to-night he put them forward in the form of a lecture to honourable members on this side of the House. There are here men quite as capable of speaking for the primary producers as is any honourable member sitting in the Corner. Furthermore, let me add that if honourable members in the Corner continue to vote and speak as they have been doing since they have come into this Parliament, they w ill not convince many producers outside that they have their interests at heart. The honourable member must address himself to the B ill . [138] now to another aspect of this matter.

Does he intend to conform to the rules of the House? be heaved out. I hold about to reply to the remarks of the honourable members for Dampier and Eden Monaro. I did not hear the latter honourable member speaking; but according to the report of his speech in the newspapers, he seemed to attribute all the industrial unrest in this counry to tbe goslow policy of the workmen. To a charge of that character, one whose duty I do not it is to have regard for the interests of the workmen of this country cannot tur n a deaf ear.

I ask honourable members to be more respectful to the Chair, and they will find that it w ill protect their They are only lowering the dignity of the House when honourable members seek to evade the. rulings bf the Chair. I have allowed more latitude during this discussion than I should have given, but I have done so in order that the fullest debate might be permitted. glad to have that assurance from the Chair. It is remarkable that honourable members who talk about the go-slow policy of the workers, which I absolutely challenge, shut their eyes to the go-slow policy of those who sent them here. Evidence was given before the Fair Profits Commission of Victoria on the 19th July by Mr Zwar, the managing director of a large tannery carrying on business at Preston and in other parts of Victoria, and he is reported to have saidTiie price of leather is regulated by the cost of replacement. That is to say, in fixing the price of a pair of boots, consideration would be given to the cost of replacing it. On the top of that definite statement, he went on to say* leather. . Yet, later on, he pointed out that the leading boot factories of Melbourne, because of the over-supply of leather, were working only about two and a-half days in each week. the men engaged in the boot trade had been giving effect to what the Prime Minister has urged-that is to say, they had been ""producing, producing, and producing,"" whicli, the right honourable gentleman says, alone will bring about the salvation of the world-a n oversupply of boots has resulted. getting boots any cheaper? No. But because of this over-supply, brought' about by the men who have accepted the advice of the Prime Minister to "" produce, produce, and produce,"" they have been obliged to remain idle for about I accept three days a week. Such is the go-slow policy practised by those who sendhere honourable members who supam port the Government; and, as a While I have the matter of t fact, the real go-slow policy which is killing industry in this country, and causing industrial unrest by forcing up prices, is that which is adopted by the very people who are the opponents of organized labour. does not suppose that Mr Zwar really made that statement. As a matter * of fact, quoted the words of the managing director, who said that there has been a terrific f a l l in the price of leather. Both he and other witnesses affirmed that the price of commodities was regulated by the cost I am of their replacement, so that if there has been a terrific, f a l l in the price of lea'ther we ought to be able to purchase boots at a reasonable price to-day, although, as a matter of fact, we are unable to do so. Upon the other hand, our boot factories are closing down. They are adopting the "" go-slow "" policy. this to ""do with the principles of ithe B ill ? the Treasurer was absent from the chamber the honourable member for Flinders( Mr Bruce) stated that the principal cause' of industrial unrest in Australia was the high cost of living.

In the first place, There has been a terrific fall in the price of it provides that tribunals shall be* appointed consisting of three representatives of the two parties to any dispute, and a chairman who, in the event of tbe parties being unable to agree upon his selection, will be the nominee of the Government. In other words, because This measure, therefore, offers no hope for the settlement of industrial disputes.

M . Chanter) I must ask the honourable member for Grampians to cease interjecting. very glad that you, sir, have at last observed the honourable member. been stated by honourable members opposite that the party to which I belong have offered no panacea for industrial unrest in those States in which Labour has been in power. that there was published, in yesterday's newspapers a complete answer to that statement. I propose to show, upon the authority of the Commonwealth Statistician, Mr Knibbs, that in the Statei n which a Labour Government has been in power for some time, there has been less industrial.turmoi l than has obtained elsewhere, for the simple reason that the cost of living has been cheaper and the. purchasing power of the sovereign greater. According to Mr Knibbs, the amounts necessary to purchase what would have cost £1 in thc various State capitals in 1911 were as follows:-Sydney, in December, 1919, 33s. I d . ; June, 1920, 36s. 5d.; Melbourne, in December, 1919, 31s. 4d.; June, 1920, 35s. 2d.; Adelaide, in December, 1919, 30s. Sd.; June, 1920, 35s.

How does the honourable member intend to make these figures applicable to the' Bill? tempting to show that the cost of living influences industrial unrest. According to Mr Knibbs, the amount necessary to purchase what would have cost £1 in 191.1 in Hobart was 32s. 2d. in December, 1919, .and 35s. 8d.' in June, 1920. came? now to the one State of the Commonwealth in which a Labour Govern[138]2 ment has been in powerI refer to Queensland -There the amount necesIts chairman sary to purchase what would have cost £ 1 in 1911 was 30s. lOd. in December, There is nothing in tbe B ill 1919, and 33s. in June, 1920. fact that a Nationalist Government, had It is because we are hopebeen in power there. that whe.n he is electioneering, the TreaThe Government have really surer tells the electors quite the opposite. However, the figures which I have quoted are. not mine but those of Mr Knibbs, the Commonwealth Statistician.

It has other States the Nationalists have been in power all the time, but the cost of living has not been reduced. In the one State in which Nationalists and Labourites have been in power, the cost May I remind them of living has been cheaper than it has beem in the Statesi n which Nationalists have been in office all the time. Let us take, the, decrease in the purchasing power of the sovereign between December, 1919, and June, 1920. In Sydney that decrease was. 3s. 4d -ther e was a Labour Government in power in New' South Wales during that time-in Melbourne it was 4s. 10d., in Adelaide 3s. 5d. and in Brisbane. 2s. 2d. Bothi n Queensland and New. South Wales during the past six months the cost' of living has been reduced to a greater extent than it has been in any other State.. I have no faith whatever in this measure. The only real remedy for industrial unrest is to abolish the cause of it by dealing with the profiteers of this country. The only way of doing that is to place upon the Treasury Benches a Labour Government similar to those which have done such effective work in some of the States.
