The very fact that we now have, within that saine week, the opportunity in this chamber to consider some of the elements of that report in greater detail than would have been available to us in the main chamber attests, probably as well as anything, to the very effective way in which the Main Committee has operated since its introduction last year. That was one of the main changes which came about in the procedures of the House of Representatives, following the Procedure Committee's About time report, which was tabled by Dr Blewett, my predecessor as the chair of this committee, in October 1993. The present report which the Procedure Committee has had tabled in the House of Representatives is the third report of the Procedure Committee to the 37th parliament. In view of the wide ranging nature of the proposals in the first report, the committee felt very strongly that, after a settling-in period, the new procedures should be reviewed to see how they were working and whether any modifications needed to be built into them, whether any of them should have in effect been withdrawn from operation, and whether they should have been supplemented in any way. In November last year, the Procedure Committee wrote to all members and to anyone who was involved in the About time inquiry, seeking their comments on the new procedures, and the committee is very much indebted to all of those who made submissions. The Time for review report follows a similar structure to the About time report, to enable readers to refer from one report to the other more easily. I want to pay a special compliment and provide special thanks to Robyn Webber and James Rees. Robyn acted as the secretary of the committee, and James assisted her and assisted the committee, and they both continue to do that. I not only want to refer especially to the professional interest which both Robyn and James have in questions of procedure because of their vocational involvement in those areas, but I also want to emphasise the personal interest which they have, quite apart from their professional responsibilities. Their knowledge of some of the more technical intricacies of procedures was of great value to the committee in advising us, and their drafting skills were of exceptional importance and of very great value to the committee in being able to bring forward this report. SoI proffer thanks to both Robyn and James for their assistance, cooperation and contribution. Unquestionably, the introduction of the Main Committee would have been the most important consideration in that initial report, and it has been outstandingly successful. Members have related to it very well, as it is a much more intimate chamber than the main chamber. There probably would have been value in having this place referred to not as the Main",112,Matters Of Public Importance Be To Make Such A Reference In A Sense

327,Mr Robert Brown (Charlton) (10.00 A.m.),"The Procedure Committee's report,MC 2186 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 22 June 1995 Committee but as the Second Chamber. It was an objective of the Procedure Committee to seek to establish an alternative debating forum which would have a status equal, as closely as possible, to that of the main chamber. It has been called the Main Committee, and that title is almost certain to persist, but we should, as -ften as we can, think in terms of its being a second chamber to the main chamber, with a status as close as possible to the status of the main chamber. I also want to emphasise that the report is truly a bipartisan effort as far as the committee is concerned. I particularly want to thank the deputy chair of the committee, the member for Moncrieff ( Mrs Sullivan), who will be participating in this debate. When we are dealing with procedures of the parliament, which are obviously of great importance to how governments and oppositions perform in the parliament and how their performance is perceived-not only within this institution but in that wider institution the national community-it is often very difficult to come to a common position on some of the issues. In fact, that was often the case in reviewing that report and the new procedures. But I say to members of the opposition, and to my own colleagues, that the goodwill which they brought to that process reflected very great credit on their commitment to this institution and the important role they saw it fulfilling. It really was a very great pleasure to be involved in that exercise. As the statistics in the report indicate, the Main Committee has made it possible for the House of Representatives to consider legislation, reports and issues of various kinds in much more detail, and with much more time, so that members have had a significantly expanded opportunity to speak and to exafnine legislation and issues. The committee was also pleased with the level of support for the practice of referring bills to standing committees for inquiry and report. That process of having committees examine legislation and other important issues is one which has been very finely developed and very finely tuned as far as the Senate is concerned. But this has been the first occasion when a significant initiative of that kind has been undertaken in the House of Representatives. I believe it will develop and I think it should develop. We also gave consideration to the minister's second reading speech. One of the provisions of that earlier report was that instead of the second reading speech being made at the time the bill was introduced and the explanatory memorandum was tabled, it would be made immediately preceding the second reading debate. That had some values, but the disadvantages vastly outweighed them. It was done for the following reason. The explanatory memorandum is essentially a bureaucratic statement which summarises the legislation for members of parliament, who are not necessarily experts on the legal way in which legislation is often expressed. So the explanatory memorandum is essentially a product of the bureaucracy. The minister's second reading speech is a political product of the government and of the minister, and while ministers undoubtedly do depend upon their bureaucratic advisers to assist them in the construction of those second reading speeches, those speeches are theirs. They can introduce any sort of political comment that they want to-and they often do, and should be expected to. But then that speech is not there at the time the explanatory memorandum is tabled. legislation? memorandum, but also the minister's second reading speech. The Acts Interpretation Act has",115,Representatives Main Committee
328,Mr Lindsay,But do the courts have regard to the explanatory memorandum in interpreting,116,Representatives Main Committee
329,Mr Robert Brown,"Yes, they do, of course-and not only the explanatoryThursday, 22 June 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 2187 made that perfectly clear, so the explanatory memorandum also fulfils that legal purpose as well. The minister's second reading speech, in expressing the government's purposes behind the legislation as well, is an important matter as far as the courts are concerned. But, as I emphasise, the minister's second reading speech is a political statement, so the opposition should have access to the text of the second reading speech in advance of its leading speaker being expected to respond to it. There could be new elements introduced which are not necessarily reflected in the text of the bill or in the explanatory memorandum to which the shadow minister or the person leading for the opposition would need to respond. And since they need to respond, under these current new arrangements, immediately following the minister's second reading speech, they are often placed at a disadvantage. I do not believe that should be allowed to persist and we have suggested that we revert to the previous arrangement. We have also made reference to the consideration in detail stage. That is vastly superior to the situation which prevailed before-the old committee stage-which, to a large extent, not only in the way in which it was conducted but in the physical actions associated with it, was largely a historical anachronism. I understand that the origin of the old committee stage rested with the fact that the old House of Commons would traditionally refer legislation to expert groups which were not necessarily committees of the whole of the House of Commons and, in that context, the speaker of the House of Commons had a special responsibility to the Crown, not so much to the chamber .. As the committee consideration stage of the House of Commons developed, the speaker would vacate the chair, the chairman would sit in the chairman's seat, the symbol of the speaker's authority-the mace-would be taken off the table, placed under the table, and a committee of the whole House of Commons would then consider the legislation. We do not do that. The fact that those traditions have persisted, I suppose, reflects well on the traditionalists but is probably under attack by the iconoclasts, of which I am one. The committee has suggested that the consideration in detail stage be continued as it is at the present time. It has assisted a much more even, continuing flow of debate. The interchange in that consideration in detail stage has been much more effective in scrutinising, in detail, elements of the legislation. Each member now has an unlimited number of five-minute grabs during that consideration in detail stage, and I am not aware of any occasion when that opportunity provided for members has been abused-that is, where they have taken advantage of successive five minutes to make a second speech. I know, Mr Deputy Speaker, that if you were in the chamber and if you and your colleagues, including the speaker himself, were occupying the chair, you would not allow that to happen anyway. I have to pay credit as well to those people who have occupied the chair in order to ensure that those arrangements serve the purposes and serve the purposes in the way that they were intended. There is an expectation, as we have indicated as well, that ministers should attend the House and the Main Committee to oversee the passage of their legislation. I think generally that ministers have been very responsive to their responsibilities in connection with not only their portfolio responsibilities to the chamber but also their legislation, to members on both sides of the chamber and to this parliament as an institution. This was just a little, gentle and courteous reminder to ministers that they do have a responsibility to oversee their legislation and to ensure the passage of their legislation. They should be there to present the second MC 2188 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 22 June 1995 reading speech; they should be there to hear as much of the debate as they can; and they should be there to respond at the end in order to give the appropriate courtesies to those members on both sides of the House who participate. Question time is, and will continue to be, a very difficult area. It is not a question time. It is a gladiatorial time, an adversarial time and a theatrical time, but it is not a question time in which members of the opposition seek information. When members of the opposition ask a question they do not want an answer; their purpose in asking the question is to put the government under pressure and then, frequently, when the answer is given, the members of the opposition quite understandably complain because they say that answer is not relevant. On most occasions the claim that the answer is not relevant is based on their perception that the answer is not the answer they wanted their question to elicit. I would like members of the House of Representatives generally to give consideration to the nature of question time, to the purpose of question time. Questions on notice allow a minister to get expert advice from the bureaucracy and to.have the answers prepared. Senior advisers to the ministers and the ministers themselves will vet the answers before those answers go out. That is when members genuinely want information. Question time is not serving that purpose. Unlike the questions on notice procedure, which tends to deal with matters of detail and can be a lengthy process, there is a need for members of parliament to get answers to questions about current things, things that are happening today or things that happened yesterday. We need something like a question time. But we should have a question time which is a genuine question time where genuine issues are raised. We also need a true gladiatorial time. We need an opportunity for the government to be placed under pressure by the opposition, not by some artificial device of asking the questionMrs Sullivan-Ministerial statements. so; exactly. Perhaps we need something where the opposition person has, say, two minutes to make a statement and the minister has, say, four minutes to respond to it. That would provide the government and the opposition with a formal, identifiable opportunity to deal with those issues as they wish to. We, the government members, would then place the opposition under pressure because during our four minutes we would respond. With varying degrees of enthusiasm, we would respond. I hope that there is some creative thought about the whole nature of the adversarial role. I do not say that in a deprecating way: that role is an essential element of this institution. We have a government and we have an opposition, and the more vigorous, effective, competent, searching, scrutinising and challenging it is, the better this institution operates. This institution, above all others, is of fundamental importance to the whole nature of our democratic system. It has got to be made to operate. If there is something for which provision should be made, we should make provision for it in a formal, identifiable way. That provision is for a procedure where we can confront one another-government and opposition. That is what members of the community expect. That is why they come to question time. They do not come along to hear information being given; they come along to see gladiatorial combat. We even construct the House of Representatives like a Roman arena. Have you been to the Colosseum? Go and have a look at that chamber. That is what it is.

That is a civilised time for the parliament to finish. I know there are some younger members who come from long distances. They say, 'Look, if I am in Canberra, let's sit during the night and then we will sit for fewer days and I can get back home with my spouse and my kids.' I understand that. They have said that to me. IfI were a young fellow with a young family, I would want to spend more time at home as well. But I am an old fellow with kids who are off my hands and Joy does not worry very much where I am or for how long. It does not worry me very much and it does not worry Joy very much but it worries those members with young families. I understand that and I sympathise with it. If we are going to retain civilised hours, I do not know that there is any other alternative. I know that my colleague the deputy chair will be referring to those matters and I know that the member for Perth( Mr Stephen Smith) later on will be referring to them as well. All honourable members would have a vested interest in the fair and efficient working of the House, which this report honestly attempts to promote. The recommendations are designed to refine the operation of procedure which the House has already adopted. The committee has attempted to balance the interests of government, opposition and private members as best it can, in a bipartisan way. I do not expect that all recommendations will find favour with all honourable members but I hope to have the opportunity to hear their considered views today and in future debates on these matters. moment. As was mentioned by the previous speaker, the honourable member for Charlton( Mr Robert Brown)-who is also the Chairman of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Procedure-the Main Committee has been a success in terms of expanding the amount of time available for debate. However, I still feel some regret that this report is not being debated in the main chamber. Whilst in no way would I denigrate this chamber, the simple fact is that most honourable members have their television tuned to the main chamber, it is the chamber they will drop into in order to listen to speeches for a while, it is the one they tend to be more focused on. I suspect we would have more people involved in this debate today if it were taking place in the main chamber. Having said that, I would just like to refer, for the assistance of the honourable member for Charlton-who was not a member of the committee that did the About time report-to the reason this was called the Main Committee. It was because it was envisaged that it would meet in the main committee room, and that is actually stated in that report. That suggestion ran into difficulties because the main committee room is not the property of the House of Representatives. It is a part of Parliament House that is shared by the House of Representatives and the Senate. To set it up permanently as a chamber of the House of Representatives would have created difficulties.",118,Representatives Main Committee

332,Mrs Sullivan (Moncrieff) (Id.20 A.m.),"I am a bit divided in my feelings at theMC 2190 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 22 June 1995 As the honourable member spoke I had the thought, which I just float here for the first time, that perhaps we might consult with our colleagues and see whether there is an alternative name that they would like given to this chamber that might be a bit more appropriate. Given that we have done away with the committee stages of bills, I find it now rather confusing when I see on the House of Representatives blue that we are going to have a Main Committee report. This is not a committee, it does not in any way resemble a committee: it is part of the House of Representatives. Perhaps we ought to think, before we go very much further, about getting a more appropriate name for this chamber. However, I am limited to 15 minutes today-now 13 minutes-so I have to confine the subjects I am going to cover. The subjects I would like to touch on, if I get time, are question time, second reading speeches and cognate debates. The Chairman of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Procedure has already referred to the fact that question time is a thorny issue. In this report, at paragraph 6.4.4, there is some further discussion of this issue. It ought to be put on the record that when the committee invited all the members of the House of Representatives to comment on the changes to procedures that had followed the About time report, overwhelmingly their comments were concerned with question time; The committee did not actually invite the sorts of comments they made, which were recommendations about relevance, content of questions and answers and so on. These aspects were not touched on in the About time report and were therefore not really affected by the changes that the government ultimately made. As is pointed out in this report, the committee has taken on board this clear concern of honourable members of both sides and will be pursuing the issue. There are always difficulties on this subject and heaven knows the Procedure Committee has reported on it enough times, but the chairman and I are going to try to find a way around that so that we can get some better discussion of question time and a better resolution than we have to date. It has to be placed on the record, as the report does, that the changes that were made to question time following the About time report were not the changes that that report recommended. From time to time government ministers-particularly the new Deputy Prime Minister( Mr Beazley), as Leader of the Government in the House-have said, 'But the Procedures Committee recommended changes to question time.' And indeed we did. We recommended that there be an experiment with the roster on Mondays only, but that in no way resembles what the government ended up doing. The roster issue has to be addressed. It is noted in the report that the recommendation of the committee that there be consultation between government and opposition as to the composition of the roster has not appeared to me at the time to be to the great surprise of the Leader of the House, who seemed to be oblivious to the fact that he ought to be conSUlting. I do not think that the situation has much improved, but if we are to get a better feeling in the chamber and a better handling of business, it is important that consultation takes place. I do not agree with the member for Charlton that the House of Representatives ought to be an adversarial place. It will naturally be an adversarial place on occasions, but there has to be room for consensus too. The simple fact is that a lot of things are done by consensus, and we get unnecessary conflict because we approach the chamber in an adversarial way. IfI may be so bold-I know a number of my sisters would agree with me-there is a feeling that the nature of doing business here is excessively masculine. The ideas of combat,",119,Representatives Main Committee
333,Been Observed. This Has Been Raised By The Manager Of Opposition Business ( Mr Reith),"itThursday, 22 June 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 2191 adversaries and 'blood flowing', as the member for Charlton said, are now a little outdated. There is room for a more mature, and better rounded, human approach to the way governments and oppositions do their business. As I have said, the adversarial nature will express itself naturally from time to time; that is to be expected. I refer particularly to paragraphs 6.1.7, 6.2.10, 6.2.12 and 6.2.16 of the report, where it is pointed out that a stated aim of the roster, when it was introduced by the government and when it was considered by the committee-albeit. the committee made a different recommendation-was to involve more ministers. We have in the report some tables which show questions without notice to ministers, from 1992 to 1994. There is some consideration given to the fact that more junior ministers are being asked questions than previously. It might have been instructive if we had asked for one further table: a breakdown of the questions from government members to junior ministers, as opposed to questions from opposition members to junior ministers. The simple fact is that question time has, on occasions, been turned into a platform for ministerial statements, particularly by junior ministers. A breakdown of the questions asked of junior ministers would show that government members are far more likely to be asking the dorothy dixer of the junior minister. It is the junior minister who gets frustrated because he or she does not get the opportunity to speak very often. The junior minister gets up and gives a dorothy dix answer, which is really a ministerial statement. In our report, we tried to come to grips with the issue of ministerial statements, and we make some suggestions. I draw particular attention to paragraph 4.4.6, some subsequent paragraphs and the accompanying table 3. The question of the government moving away from giving ministerial statements has been debated in the House, particularly when we have debated Procedure Committee reports. I put on the record that in 1982-the last year of a Liberal government-there were 80 ministerial statements. In 1994, the most recent full parliamentary year, there were 16. The drop since 1983 has been very marked. A comparison of that figure with the increase in the length of time that individual answers have taken, together with the table showing the decline in the number of questions without notice, gives the story. Question time has been turned into a pseudo ministerial statement time. I am sure that the member for Charlton, as a former minister, has some sympathy for the problems of ministers. I do remember some of the answers he gave to questions even to this day; I cannot remember whether they were dorothy dixersto questions. His suggestion-which is not a suggestion of the committee and not one which it debated-is a good one. We ought to have a time when members can make brief statements addressed to a minister and when a minister can have a brief time for reply. Far be it from me to refer to the other chamber, but I have been removed from it for 101/2 years now, so I feel a little safer in referring to it these days than I did when I first transferred",120,Representatives Main Committee

337,Mrs Sullivan,"Turgid is not a word one would have applied to the answers he gaveMC 2192 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 22 June 1995 to the House of Representatives. The Senate has, over time, evolved a system of a better use of supplementary questions and also a system of taking note of answers. This latter system gives an opposition member-or a government member-the opportunity to make a comment on an answer to a question, but does not exclude the minister from making further comment himself or herself. I know that the House of Representatives never wants to look like it is taking any hints from the Senate, but the fact that that system has worked shows that the type of suggestion that the member for Charlton made might have some merit and might be quite workable. The other point I wanted to make in this context is that, whilst there is a stated desire by the government to involve ministers more in the chamber, when you look at their conduct when it comes to their bills, the direct opposite is happening. If ministers really wanted to be more involved in the chamber, they would involve themselves at the obvious stage-and that is the consideration of bills stage. The committee's report does address this subject. I refer members to page 4 and onwards and, in particular, to table 2 on page 11, which shows government bills introduced in 1994. It refers to participation of ministers and, in particular, to the second reading debate summing up. There are some ministers who give their own second reading speeches, who are there for at least some part of the debate and who reply to the debate. As a member, I appreciate that very much. However, those ministers-unfortunately-are very few in number. I have referred in the past to the fact that the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) is probably the worse example in this area that the parliament has. She comes into question time when she is on the roster and gives a long answer to a dorothy dixer-but gives very brief answers to opposition questions-and then she does not appear again all week. For her first few months here, she was only appearing to answer dorothy dixers. I think she thought it was actually bad luck if anybody else dared to ask her a question while she was there on the roster. AfterI had remarked on this a few times, she came in once and read a second reading speech. I remind you that this Minister for Human Services and Health is also the minister who is responsible for the status of women. She is yet to participate in a debate on any childcare bills which are introduced in her name in the House. That is left to her parliamentary secretary. That is disgraceful. Ministers cannot say they want a roster so that they can get a guernsey in question time and then not attend for their bills-something which is just as important as answering questions. There are three columns in table 2. One shows who presented the bills: the 'Minister from the responsible portfolio'; the 'Parliamentary Secretary from the responsible portfolio'; a 'Minister from another portfolio'; a 'Parliamentary Secretary from another portfolio'; or 'No Minister or Parliamentary Secretary'. Naturally, there is a blank in the column that is headed 'Second reading speech delivered by' under that last section called 'No minister or parliamentary secretary'. This is because second reading speeches on government bills cannot be given any way other than by a minister or parliamentary secretary. However, out of the 192 bills, 32 have been read by a parliamentary secretary who is not even in that portfolio. I do not mean to put them down, but parliamentary secretaries are very junior people in the hierarchy in terms of answerability to the public or to the government or to the parliament. Thursday, 22 June 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 2193 What is even worse is that the second reading debate is summed up on only 43 occasions out of 192 by a minister from the responsible portfolio. That does not mean the debate has been summed up by the minister responsible for that bill. It just means that it has been summed up by one of the ministers in that portfolio grouping. If one calculated the number of times the second reading speech was replied to by the minister who was actually responsible for that bill and its administration, the number would be found to be significantly lower than 43. The column which indicates that 24 second reading debates were summed up by a parliamentary secretary from another portfolio shows us that the person who answers a debate in summary has no status at all. Worst is that 65 second reading debates were not replied to or summed up by any minister or parliamentary secretary. They are issues that should concern us all, both government and opposition. WhilstI have run out of time to talk about the other issues, I appreciate this opportunity. (Time expired) Mrs Sullivan-Not like you! review follows on from About time. I am not sure what the third report is going to be: maybe 'A Time to ponder'. It is true that the first report made quite a number of radical changes. The chairman of the committee, the honourable member for Charlton( Mr Robert Brown) has acknowledged the secretariat's contribution and I would like to add my acknowledgment to his. I would like to acknowledge the honourable member's own contribution because these things can sometimes be intensely felt and debated and it could be said that we do not have wimps on the committee. I also acknowledge the contributions of the honourable member for Moncrieff ( Mrs Sullivan). One of the problems for procedure committees, particularly when the government has a majority in the House, as it is required to do to form a government, is that recommendations need to be made with a mind's eye actually intent on getting them through. Procedure committees do not serve parliamentarians, the people or the parliament as well as they might if their reports languish and gather dust. That has not happened. Although About Time was not implemented in the way the committee recommended, we should not necessarily see that as a failure. We should rather welcome the fact that the government has responded positively. I would like to talk about some of the changes in the review. I want to say that I have always been a keen advocate of the rostering of ministers. I know the opposition members, not necessarily members of the committee, make great capital of rostering because they say we have a part-time Prime Minister. My area of disappointment, I suppose, is that I always believe that rostering ministers would open up the ministerial ranks to some opposition fast bowling. Whilst the opposition actually got the scalp of the former honourable member for Canberra Ros Kelly, it has not subsequently demonstrated an understanding of tactics in question time to take advantage of it. I am not trying to score points. From my own perspective, I think the opposition has failed to realise the potential opportunities that I always believe rostering provided. As the honourable member for Charlton said, I think we should not shrink from the fact that question time is always going to be robust. It is going to be the gladiatorial contest. We also need to note some changes about question time. Before the prominence of TV, the press media, by and large, dictated the flavour of what occurred at question time.

339,Mr Price,"No; not like last night: I have actually got the call. This report Time forMC 2194 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 22 June 1995 sometimes broadcast it but to very limited audiences. TV now provides the lO-second or 60second grab. That is used as much to its advantage by the opposition as it is by the government. The point I am tryj,ng to make is a fairly simple one. As a traditionalist, I like to think that we are essentially parliamentarians in this place, as I know the member for Charlton and others do. We have to make the parliament relevant and we have to keep it current. We should value our traditions and nurture them but make them relevant to the current age. And that is why it is impossible to suggest that we can tum back the clock as far as the impact of TV on question time is concerned, and I would not seek to do it. I know the member for Moncrieff made a point about the limitations of ministerial statements. Let me say that I, for one, would welcome far more ministerial statements by the government. I do not think any government should shrink from being in a position to put its point of view to the people and to the parliament. But, if there has been a diminution of ministerial statements, I have to say that these things are often being done now outside the parliament to gain maximum impact, to make sure as many as possible of our fellow Australians come to understand what the statement is all about. A good example of that, which we discussed in the committee; was the Justice Statement, something delivered in Queensland. I am sure that, if the Attorney-General( Mr Lavarch) had delivered that statement in the House, it would not have made the same impact, and I commend the committee for recommending that, although a statement may have been made outside the parliament, we should have an opportunity to discuss it and dissect it. That is one of the areas where I suggest we should be more relevant. Mrs Sullivan-That actually happened with the Justice Statement. Mrs Sullivan-The Justice Statement. It was tabled. time in the Senate. The Senate has introduced something that we all thought would be absolutely ludicrous and unworkable and would completely limit ministers, and that was time limits on the questions being asked and time limits on the answers. If Senate ministers were sent a questionnaire, I think they would say that the system is working pretty well and in fact it has probably sharpened up ministerial answers. I wish I could say that I could imagine this happening in the lower house. I cannot envisage it at this time, but I do think it is something that we should keep in mind. The member for Moore( Mr Filing) had a particular interest in questions on notice and brought forward the suggestion of having a time limit on responses. The committee developed a method whereby members could rise in their places if questions had not been answered after 90 days and raise the matter with the Speaker and the Speaker would write to the relevant minister. I am very pleased to see that the committee has now recommended that that be brought back to 60 days. This is still a very generous period of time. I do not think it is at all arduous for ministers or departments. Ironically, Mr Deputy Speaker. I see that an interchange is going to take place herecomments.",123,Representatives Main Committee

As the chairman of the committee has accurately reported, we are leading much more sensible lives, finishing as we do at 8 o'clock instead of 11 o'clock or even much later, but I would like to make the observation that in the period of time that we are here we are much more frenetic about what we are doing. We seem to be going to more and more committee meetings at a greater pace, and perhaps missing some of them. I do not know about my colleagues, but I certainly confess that. So, if we are to take full advantage of these reduced sitting hours, it seems to me that we really need to look at our committee system. If there were one area that I would invite the Procedure Committee to look at, it would be the area of committees of the House. That is not because I think they are bad-I think we were behind the times in moving to a committee system and the committee system has accomplished a lot-but because I think that there are far too many committees. We run the risk of drowning or diminishing or executing our committees by overload. However, there are still areas where I would like to see the committee system taken to. For example, I still remain very much in favour of having joint House and Senate committees. Once again, I welcome the hours of sitting. Unfortunately, the Procedure Committee cannot deal with party committees, and there are obviously party committees that opposition members go to and government members go to. I make the plea that both are in need of reform and adjusting, in the way we have adjusted the hours of sitting. I also draw to the attention of the House, and particularly of my good friend the member for Charlton, the issue of legislation that goes into the House. Firstly, there is a lot of criticism. I know that the member for Moncrieff is saying, 'Isn't it dreadful that ministers aren't in the chamber all the time, looking to their business.' It remains a fact that much more legislation goes through the House of Representatives because the Senate does not agree to delegated legislation to the same extent as, say, the English system does. In other words, what is legislation in Australia would often be delegated legislation in England. So we have a much higher bill load than anywhere else. I think the key issue here is whether, on the important bills rather than the omnibus bills, the House and the Senate are giving legislation adequate consideration. Again in terms of keeping relevant with the times, the introduction of this Main Committee chamber is a bit of parliamentary microeconomic reform. It means that we do not have to have extra members or extra anything but this second chamber allows more people to participate than would otherwise be the case and it allows more legislation to go through than would otherwise be the case. I have always thought that you cannot inculcate the urgency or necessity for ministers to steer through their own legislation, and it is not always possible. Whilst legislation is an important aspect of their work, as the honourable member for Charlton will tell us, there are many other competing aspects that can prevent ministers being there. However, I think there is an element of pride in a minister taking an important bill through the House and I would be disappointed if that tradition was ever lost. It is also important to address the role of parliamentary secretaries. When they were first appointed under this government, similar to the earlier Fraser appointments, they were more like secretaries-answering bag loads of correspondence and attending functions-but I am",124,Representatives Main Committee

345,Mr Price,"That is right. On the hours of sitting, I must say that I was very much anMC 2196 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 22 June 1995 pleased to say that their role has now evolved to much more than that. Parliamentary secretaries still deal with a lot of the administrative matters but, by and large, most of them have a discrete portfolio area. Whilst that may be minor in the mainstream of the portfolio, it is still a portfolio area. In that regard, it is very hard to detect the difference between junior ministers and parliamentary secretaries other than that the parliamentary secretary must report to the cabinet minister, whereas junior ministers often do not have that same diligent requirement. Again, in a small way, I am pleased to be associated with what is a good report which will bring important reforms to the parliament. I am sure my colleagues are going to receive the report well, as they did the initial report. I commend those associated with it and particularly encourage our chairman to take on new and even bolder tasks for the Standing Committee on Procedure in the interests of the parliament and parliamentary reform. for review: Bills, questions and working hours, which resulted from an earlier report of the committee dealing with reforms that were considered to be important in trying to make the House work in a more effective way, and, in particular, ensuring that individual members have a better opportunity to represent their constituents and that, with the opening of the second chamber, the Main Committee, there are more opportunities than there have been in the past for members to participate in debate and make contributions. Honourable members may be aware that in the original report, which was tabled back in February 1994, the primary criticism made by a number of us was in relation to the Main Committee. We were concerned that the Main Committee would somehow be seen as causing a decline in respect for some of the debates. We had a feeling that we ought to have taken care in dealing with or bringing in a new committee that was going to be dealing with second reading debates on legislation, that this may cause those debates to be seen as second class because they were away from the main chamber. We were concerned, as I am sure the member for Moncrieff ( Mrs Sullivan) will agree, that there ought to be more sitting days to facilitate greater and lengthier debate, giving more opportunities for members to participate in debates on legislation. However, having been a critic in the first instance and having made a number of observations at the time of the tabling of the first report, I must say that I am now a fan of the Main Committee.

I commend the member for Wentworth on his interest in the procedures of the House and I look forward to hearing and reading his contributions to the workings of the committee. I am sure he will make a great contribution, obviously bringing from his background a new perspective to the workings of the House, not the least of which will be his great interest in the workings of similar legislatures around the region, of which he has great knowledge. I once again commend the staff of the secretariat of the committee because they have also been responsible for helping us to prepare what I consider to be an important and useful report that will assist in compelling, or perhaps influencing, the government to make the changes necessary to allow this process in. tae House of Representatives and the Main Chamber to evolve in a way that is going to allow for a greater movement of power back to the parliament-in the case of the workings of the House of Representatiyes-vis-a-vis the executive. I can see the member for Charlton nodding. I think we would all agree that in many ways the recent history of the House of Representatives has seen a decline 'iri the authority of the relative standings between the Executive and the parliament that needs to be stopped. The process needs to be reversed to allow the people's representatives to properly bring forward the views of their constituents and make sure they have an opportunity to influence the day-to-day events of the House of Representatives and indeed the parliament. There are a few observations I would like to make in relation to the workings of the House. The first is in relation to the explanatory memorandum, which was the 'subject of the recommendation that departments should take steps to improve the usefulness of explanatory memoranda to members and others seeking clarification on the nature, purpose and effect of legislation. We also recommended that, whenever possible, in the case of government bills, ministers should make an explanation to the House of any amendments or requests for amendments made by the Senate on which the Senate is seeking agreement of the House. In our deliberations I cited the case of the Training Guarantee Levy Bill where there was a conflict between the explanatory memorandum and the actual bill. That was very confusing for those people who are responsible in their own businesses or elsewhere for the administration of-or response to-the legislation. In this particular case, there was a difference in the way in which one calculated the training guarantee liability on the part of a business. In fact, the explanatory memorandum allowed for the inclusion of sick leave and long service leave whereas the actual bill excluded it. When the people at the particular business that contacted me about the matter made inquiries of the Taxation Office, which had the responsibility for administering the act, they were informed that the bill was right and the explanatory memorandum was wrong. Clearly, people relying on the explanatory memorandum for guidance as to how the act was supposed to work would have been thoroughly confused about the difference in the amounts applicable to employing more people. In this particular case, they told me that in their business they could have employed an extra person on the difference between the two interpretations of the explanatory memorandum and the bill itself. That is a very important point.",126,Representatives Main Committee
349,Mr Filin,"Who is present here today, that is, the member for Wentworth ( Mr Thomson).MC 2198 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 22 June 1995 The second important matter was raised by the member for Moncrieff. I commend her for her contribution as deputy chair. She has always taken a strong interest in the workings of parliament in the Senate and continues that role in the House of Representatives. She has been instrumental in making the recommendation that the standing orders be amended to enable a minister to move the second reading of a government bill immediately following the first reading and for debate then to be adjourned to a future day. The recommendation also seeks to make the second reading speech available for members so that they can not only interpret the legislation but also make their own contributions to the debate. It is thoroughly confusing if the second reading speech is not available, particularly if interpretations of legislation have already been made by the minister or if there is a policy, for example, on the interpretation of legislation which would cause debate or questions that would need to be clarified as to exactly how legislation would work. The member who spoke previously mentioned my own particular interest in questions on notice. As I am now an independent member I am more conscious of the fact that there are limited opportunities for ministers to be questioned by members of the House. I am particularly concerned that the questions on notice that are placed on the Notice Paper should be accorded the seriousness they deserve by those responsible for answering them. In previous times there have been extraordinary delays in the responses made by ministers to questions placed on the Notice Paper, to the extent that the process has been undermined. At the end of each question time, as we know, the minister, the Leader of the House or the Prime Minister-whoever is responsible-moves that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper, signifying how important as part of the process of questioning the questions on notice actually are. I think that we on the committee unanimously felt that it was absurd that often, in the case of questions on notice, not only were ministers not responding to them for up to years in the sitting of a particular parliament but, in some instances, never answered the questions before the parliament concluded. Therefore those questions fell over the end of the cliff. In the workings of the changes to the sessional orders that were recommended and introduced as a consequence of our previous report About time, we have seen a process whereby at the conclusion, where 90 days has passed and the question has not been responded to by a minister, members can stand up and ask the Speaker to write to the minister concerned requesting that an answer be given. I think that is a perfectly reasonable process. The difficulty is, of course, that 90 days is a long time and I am very pleased that the committee has decided to change that to 60 days. That will put additional pressure on to ministers to gee up their process of answering questions. As we all know, sometimes questions have an immediate effect or immediate importance and, after 90 days, they disappear into what the Leader of the House( Mr Beazley) often calls 'the ether'. That is a part of the process that individual members want to see reinforced and buttressed. Therefore, our recommendation that the 90 days be reduced to 60 days is a thoroughly useful one. In fact, at the conclusion of the question period on each sitting Thursday, it is recommended that the Speaker should make a report to the House listing those ministers to whom he or she has written pursuant to the standing order, any responses received, and those ministers who were reported in a previous report as having been written to and who have not responded, giving the date of the original letter. That report would be recorded in Hansard. That is a very important part of our processes. After all, in the final analysis, the only opportunity for members really to question the workings of government in a direct way is in Thursday, 22 June 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 2199 the question time period. I know that there is a recommendation there to bring question time to 2.30-another important move. I was a critic of the move to 3 o'clock in the first instance, because I believed that it would make it extraordinarily difficult for the media, particularly the electronic media on which the public relies so heavily for information, to actually report in a proper way, in a fair way, the question time period. Of course, because of the concertina effect between 3 o'clock and the ending of question time at half past four, the electronic media in particular often found it extraordinarily difficult to be able to deal with the tape and all the other video arrangements so that the public could be properly informed of what had gone on that day in question time. We obviously are concerned about the rostering system because the rostering system has led to instances where ministers are not present on particular days and a line of questioning has not been able to be followed by the opposition. If one were to see the parliamentary process as an adversarial one, then the question time period is the grinding edge of our democratic system. Clearly, if the members of the public are to retain any vestiges of confidence in their poiitical system, then they need to know that that particular process works. l know that many probably view it with some jaundice in that they see on television the noise, the commotion and the dynamics of it, but nonetheless that is the grinding edge of our political democratic system. As a consequence, it is important that it works properly. In the final analysis, it is important that the public see it working properly. Therefore, it is absolutely critical that the starting time of question time be moved to 2.30. If that is not the case, then we are going to see the continuation of the problem that question time will not be properly reported to the public because, as I said, it is so close to the deadlines for the electronic media on which most people rely for their daily information. The other aspect on question time is that members of the opposition and other members of the House who are wanting to question ministers about particular aspects of their portfolio are in a position to request the presence of a minister so that they can answer questions that happen to be pertinent to that particular day's events. In conclusion, the report is not everything we would like to see, and not everything I would like to see. There are a number of things that we have obviously had to compromise on to come to a determination in the committee. Nonetheless, I think this is an important adjunct to the About time report from last year from which those important changes were made. We would like to see enhanced opportunities for members to use the questioning process in a more incisive way. I am looking forward to seeing how the recommendations affect the government's view and whether in fact it responds in a way that is going to allow us to have that opportunity. As an independent member, I am anxious to see that the House works in a way that allows the people's representatives to be able to represent the views of the community, and to make sure that ministers are properly accountable for the administration of taxpayers' money. of the Standing Committee on Procedure, Time for review: Bills, questions and working hours, to chapter 9.2 on sitting hours, which is in the report on pages 31, 32 and 33.

I prefer the chairman on this occasion but not the committee. Let me make a point about the difficulties which the chairman has in respect of sitting hours. The chairman sits on a massively mal apportioned committee. This is a committee which is massively mal apportioned in terms of New South Wales, length of service of members and safety of seats. In other words, the views and the deliberations of this committee do not reflect those people throughout the parliament who live in outlying states, who occupy marginal seats and who are the newer or younger members of this parliament who are more likely .to have families with young children.

I know that all my comments will be joined by my friend and colleague the member for Forrest( Mr Prosser). With all the difficulties that Western Australian metropolitan members have, at least when we touch down at the airport we have a short drive home; when he touches down at the airport, he has an additional two hours drive to get to Bunbury. Let me look at the massively malapportioned committee in terms of safety of seats. I will not go through all the individual seat holders. The chairman, of course, has a margin of 17.2 per cent. I will not get down to the fine analysis as to how much of that is his personal vote and standing, but the average safety of the seats of the members is over 12 per cent. In terms of the membership of the committee, five members come from New South Wales, two from Queensland and one from Western Australia. independent member for Moore-that he has been obliged to retire from the committee to be replaced by another safe seat New South Wales member. I can understand the chairman's difficulties here. The massive malapportionment of seniority, safe seats and New South Wales is only going to be enhanced, although the member for Wentworth ( Mr Thomson) will, of course, bring some youthful aspirations and vigour to the deliberations of this committee. When one looks at length of service, the average tenure of committee members is over 10 years. This does not include the service which the member for Moncrieff ( Mrs Sullivan) had previously in the Senate.

357,I Note The Comments Of The Independent Member For Moore ( Mr Filing),"the very fineThursday, 22 June 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 2201 What is the starting point? It is prospective changes to sitting hours. As I have said, these are in section 9.2 of the committee's report. What brought about the current system? It was brought about by a view that the parliament was sitting too late into the night. When I first arrived in this place in May 1993, the schedule of sitting patterns and hours for the House was that we sat Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, then Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday. Invariably, we sat until 11.30 at night and, from memory, on Wednesday we got up at 8 o'clock. That was changed-I think sensibly-to the 8 o'clock close from Monday through to Wednesday, and a 6 o'clock close on Thursday. The rationale for that was that it was not sensible to sit those late hours. That was right. The price that was paid for that was that we sat Monday to Thursday, Monday to Thursday, on a fortnightly cycle. In other words, we sat an additional Monday throughout our entire sitting pattern. What effect did that have on Western Australian members? The effect was that they lost 10 Sundays per year in their electorate or with their families. Why is that the case? If members are required to arrive at the parliament on Monday, then they must leave Perth on a Sunday. The latest that members can leave Perth on a Sunday is effectively 5 o'clock, on a flight to Melbourne. That flight arrives in Melbourne at about 11 o'clock and then, courtesy of ministerial arrangements, the members catch a RAAF VIP flight to Canberra. They arrive in Canberra in theory at 12.30. Life being what it is, that is usually any time between 12.30 and 1.30 a.m. The consequence for the electorate and the families of those members from Western Australia is that they effectiveJy lose 10 Sunday afternoons per year. The original recommendation which saw those changes had the close of sitting at 8 o'clock on a Thursday. I made Neal Blewett's life such a misery that in the end the committee recommended that the parliament close at 6 o'clock on Thursday to at least give members from outlying states the chance to get home on a Thursday night. In that respect, I was grateful for the strong support I received from the member for Watson( Mr Leo McLeay) and the member for Banks( Mr Melham). Let us look at how that change has worked in practice. It has been the case-but more often not-that the 6 o'clock close enables members from Western Australia to get on a 6.30 plane to arrive in Western Australia at 11.30. From time to time, the 6 o'clock close on Thursday becomes an 8 0' clock close. In the course of recent months, that has occurred more often than not, either for the budget reply of the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Howard), or for his reply on the republican issue. So that opportunity is sometimes lost. If the parliament does not get up until 8 o'clock on a Thursday night, members from Western Australia cannot get home on Thursday night, and so they lose that opportunity. In the course of my suggestions to the committee at our informal session, I elaborated on my formal written submission which suggested that the parliament should close earlier on the Thursday evening. My basic submission was that modest adjustments to our closing time on Thursday, coupled with modest adjustments to airline schedules, would guarantee that members from Western Australia, if they so desired-which I invariably do, and the member for Forrest shares my passionate obsession-would have the opportunity to return home on a Thursday night. That suggestion was not taken up by the committee. The most weighty point that was made in response to my suggestion was that, with parliament question time starting at 3 o'clock, and with the MPI on a Thursday, to close the House at 5.00 or 5.30 would leave no time for MC 2202 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 22 June 1995 other matters and would not take into account things that might develop out of question time, such as censures and the like. I think that is a sensible point. My fallback position was: 'Why don't we suggest some modest changes to the airline arrangement?' SoI took the opportunity of getting hold of the submissions by Qantas and Ansett. I will read them into the record because they make patently clear that neither of the airlines has any understanding of what we do. That reflects as badly on us as it does on them, because it makes crystal clear the point that we have not bothered to take up the changes in our sitting patterns with the airlines in any forceful, constructive or detailed way. The Qantas submission says: Qantas in providing travel management services to Members of Parliament and their staff have found the new procedures require more flexibility in arranging departure times. The previous Friday morning departure enable configuration changes to our aircraft in order to facilitate greater premium seat availability. I read that twice and I asked the member for Bonython( Mr Martyn Evans) to explain to me what it meant. He said what it meant was that they had no understanding of what was going on. I think that is right, and that is reflected by a notice from Qantas that I tabled at my informal session with the committee. It is headed 'Qantas, the Australian airline, budget week special' and then tells us what a fantastic deal we get: we can depart Canberra and arrive in Perth on a new configurated jet on Thursday night, leaving at 7.40. The only problem is that no-one bothered to tell the people from Qantas, and they never bothered to check, that 7.40 happened to be 10 minutes into the reply by Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Howard). That is not a plane that any person who has any respect for the courtesies of this parliament could catch. I happen to believe it is important to listen to the Leader of the Opposition's budget reply, whatever side of the House you are on. This reflected their ignorance, and our lack of effort, in seeking to make some sensible arrangements. The Ansett airline reply is just as bad. It says: The key area affecting the airline is obviously the change in sitting hours, which has been brought forward on a Thursday. Essentially this factor has enabled Ansett Australia to provide a greater availability of our premium seating and relieved pressure on all associated Friday morning services. So they are pleased that we are not there, en bloc, on Friday. It goes on to say: From the traveller point of view, it also enables far better through service connections to ports further afield, such as Perth. Well, I must confess I have dozed off and missed that bit! It further says: Our increases in direct services to both Brisbane and Adelaide have also provided further flexibility in travel options around sitting arrivals and departure times. In general terms a continuation of both the change in sitting times and improvements in our schedule ex Canberra has eased congestion on key flights and improved the ability for us to accommodate travellers. That is, because all the politicians are not flying home on a Friday morning, things are easier for other people. But not one thought, not one jot, not one iota of effort-either by us or by them-has been put to the configurations which apply on a Thursday. Here are the Thursday flight options which applied on the night of the Leader of the Opposition's budget reply and which apply tonight. There are five departures from Ansett between 4.30 and 7.40 p.m. and three departures from Qantas between 6.45 and 9.40 p.m. Five leave just before anyone would have the chance of even sneaking out the door once the Thursday, 22 June 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 2203 adjournment started. Modest changes to the airlines' timetable and modest changes to our timetable would have the effect of ensuring that some people, if they wanted to-and this is entirely a matter of choice-would get home on Thursday night. Others might prefer to spend the entire week here. This was a point made to me by the member for Moncrieff in the course of the informal discussions. Other people would prefer to spend the four days here and then get back to home, family, electorate and constituents as quickly as humanly possible. That is my preference and I would like to try to guarantee that. The other submission which I thought was worth quickly referring to was that by the Clerk of the House of Representatives, Mr Lyn Barlin. At page 6 of his submission he says: The only additional comment I would make in relation to sitting hours is that there is very little effective government business time available on Thursday afternoons after 3.00 pm. There is frequently great pressure on available time before 5.30 pm once question time begins if any complication occurs (keeping in mind that there is usually a matter of public importance proposed for discussion as well.) On a Thursday afternoon, once question time begins, you are never going to have any effective chance for government business. Why? Because Thursday afternoon is precisely the time that any opposition-worth its salt or not worth its salt-will raise censures, will cause disruption, for maximum political effect. The members opposite would do it, and we would do it if the roles were, however so disastrously or inelegantly, reversed. So any sensible management of government business requires that whatever business has to get done is done before question time on Thursday. After that, you are at the mercy of the political motivations of the opposition-which I respect and acknowledge. Finally, the committee did not take up my suggestion that we close the parliament half an hour or an hour earlier on a Thursday. Its formal recommendation 9.3.6 recommended that question time should commence at 2.30 p.m. each sitting day. Game, set and match: 6-4, 6-4, 5-3; new balls; the member for Perth is serving. If question time is at 2.30 p.m., not one moment is lost by starting the House on Thursday morning at 9.00 and starting the adjournment at 5 o'clock rather than at 5.30. It is a modest half-hour adjustment and, with a bit of detailed vigorous application to the airlines, we might actually achieve some sensible configurations which would make life better for those honourable members from Western Australia and other outlying states who happen to have marginal seats and young families. (Time expired) Stephen Smith) for his contribution to the debate on the report of the Standing Committee on Procedure. I also thank the chair and the deputy chair of the committee for their contribution not only to the debate but also to the committee report. I want to take up some points made by the honourable member for Perth. His point about an earlier start on Thursday is something that ought to be seriously considered. It is only half an hour, as he said. However, as a member of the public works committee, I point out to him, in a marginally mischievous way, that it would require some negotiation with the honourable member for Throsby( Mr Hollis). This honourable member currently convenes a public works meeting at 8.30 in the morning and he might feel that 9.00 was a little intrusive. But that is relatively incidental.

359,Mr Andrew,"Well, I must note that aside came from the honourable member for PerthMC 2204 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 22 June 1995 member for Perth's rightful indignation at what he saw as a malapportionment of the committee. There was a heavy representation from the eastern states and a lack of representation from the western states. Therefore, as a South Australian, I have even more reason to be indignant, given that there are no South Australian representatives on the committee at all. I point out to the honourable member for Perth that, in the case of the opposition, appointment to the committee is largely by nomination through the whip's office. I am not sure what arrangements the government has for representation on the committee. If the honourable member for Perth is particularly anxious to have this malapportionment corrected, it is very much more in his hands than in the hands of the parliament. All of us who come from states not as distant as Western Australia are sympathetic to the difficulty that the Western Australians allude to-to the pressure that sitting in the federal parliament places on young families and with the distances travelled .. As a South Australian, I am very conscious of the fact that it is possible for me to be home in South Australia frequently before colleagues in Queensland or Tasmania are able to be home. In that sense, South Australia enjoys an .advantage that is geographically denied to Western Australia. I want to make a few comments about the report, and I want 'to make them in the context of this Parliament House. I share with both the chair and the deputy ohair the reality of having worked in this Parliament House and in the former Parliament House building. I am one of those people who thought that the former Parliament House ought tohiwe been remodelled and ought to have remained the home of the federal parliament. It is' not a -view that I would still maintain because I think this is abuilding in which it is a great privilege to work and the architecture and facility of the building is something of which we all should be proud. I do recognise that the building has inevitably two problems, and those of us who have worked in both buildings are more conscious of these problems than are those who have worked only in this building. The two problems are that parliament is more polarised in this building and that it is easier for members of parliament to become isolated in this building. I lay the blame for the first problem, that of polarisation, largely at the feet of the Prime Minister( Mr Keating), and I do this in an uncharacteristically uncharitable way. The Prime Minister's style is to polarise the parliament. I respect his capacity to do this, but his style is to treat the opposition as if it were some lesser form of life. That is something about which I am quite indignant:' Weneed-onstantly to remind ourselves, as parliamentarians, that everyone in the parliarpent not only has a right to be there, by dint of having been elected, but also has a right to an opinion,. whether in government or in opposition. The opposition, regardless of which party is in opposition, has an obligation to speak for all of those people who did not vote for the government. I am charitable enough to recognise that even the Prime Minister may be prepared to concede that in a private moment, but certainly none of his mannerisms in the House would attest to that approach. SoI find existence in this house much more polarised than it was in the other house, with the same party in power but with a different person as thPrime Minister. Having largely placed blame for the polarisation at the feet of the Prime Minister, I now address the question of isolation. This parliament building, by very reason of its extent, is a place in which people easily become isolated. As I look at the way in which the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Procedure addresses the whole question of the structure and sitting times of the House, I think we have an obligation to ensure that we do Thursday, 22 June 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 2205 all we can to break down any sense of individual isolation. Part of the isolation is inevitable because of the architecture of the building. Part of it is inevitable because of the extensive facilities that we all have in our own offices, which allow us to be individuals and, if we choose, not to mix extensively with our colleagues. But part of it is broken down, I think, by a structuring of the sitting hours to ensure that people have maximum contact with each other if they choose so to do. One of the things that the Standing Committee on Procedure, when contemplating sitting hours, might care to take up is a proposal that we sit onCe again on Monday and Tuesday evenings; that there be a scheduled dining room time, as there once used to be, from 6.30 to eight; and that the parliament then sit from eight until 9.30, with a 9.30 adjournment. This would still allow the parliament to rise at a very respectable hour and it would still leave Wednesday evenings free for the sort of interaction that has become characteristic of Wednesday evenings, but it would mean that the total sitting time was extended and that the dining room became once again the focus for most honourable members who were in the parliament on a Monday and Tuesday evening. I have not had an opportunity to discuss with the caterers, or with the Speaker's office, just what the impact on the dining room of our decision to rise at eight has been, but I suspect from what I have observed that it has been chaotic. I suspect that the caterers have no idea from one evening to another how many honourable members are likely to be dining in or dining out. It has also broken down the dining room fraternity that was built up, that was particularly significant in the old Parliament House and to a lesser degree extended into this Parliament House, but that now scarcely exists because at 8 p.m. people make a decision either to dine in or to dine out. I respect their right to do that, but the opportunity for some sort of parliamentary fraternity, by reason of the fact that we are all going to the dining room between 6.30 and eight, has been broken down. SoI would like the committee to consider taking Monday and Tuesday evenings and extending briefly the sitting time by, I am suggesting, not more than two hours-that may be a matter for negotiation-to ensure that the House still rose at a very civilised hour but that we remained more of a unit and that we broke down some of the isolation that I think unintentionally, but unfortunately, has come to characterise the parliament. I would like to compliment the honourable member for Moncrieff ( Mrs Sullivan) on the work that she has done on this committee and to acknowledge the role of the chairman and the role that the committee has played in endeavouring both to listen to the opinion of a wide range of people in the parliament and to incorporate, as far as they are able, that opinion in the report. . The suggestion by the honourable member for Moncrieff that, on the tabling of the first reading of a bill, the second reading speech ought to be made available is one that I would also like to endorse. Much is to be said for the capadty of the opposition to have at its fingertips, as early as possible, the information that the minister presents in the second reading speech so that informed debate can be a characteristic of the second reading of the bill. I would like also to compliment the committee and give my support to the suggestion that question time ought tb commence at 2.30. That has a great deal to commend it, not only from the point of view of ensuring that the media have a more comfortable opportunity to observe question time but also because one of the things that, incredibly, have characterised question time is that electors now find themselves.less able to access question time on television than was the case, because of .the congestion of television time beyond 3 p.m. MC 2206 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 22 June 1995 This led to an extraordinary reaction in my electorate-and I am being kind to the Leader of the House and Deputy Prime Minister( Mr Beazley) in acknowledging this-in that one of my constituents, indignant at what was happening, sent a letter to the Deputy Prime Minister, with a copy to myself, saying that he was unhappy with the 3 p.m. question time and asking the Deputy Prime Minister why it was that the House had chosen to move to that time. The Deputy Prime Minister-well intentioned, I am sure-replied, saying that one of the reasons that we had moved to 3 p.m. was that if there were visiting delegations it meant a very congested lunchtime, and the 3 p.m. question time allowed us to appropriately extend the lunchtime. That is perfectly true. But, constituents being what they are, and the image of parliamentarians being what it is, my constituent instantly translated that to mean that every lunchtime was extended from 12.30 until 3.00, that every lunchtime involved visiting delegations and that this was an indication of just how cavalier we, as a parliament, happen to be in the way in which we deal with the affairs of the state. I know that was not the intention of the Leader of the House and Deputy Prime Minister, but I do think that, in a small way, the decision to go to 2.30 helped to break down that impression. Incidentally, I believe that the 2.30 question time has a great deal to commend it. I also happen to find, along with other opposition members, that the present question time roster is a source of a frustration to us. The recommendation of the committee that would allow ministers to be brought in more frequently is one that ought to be endorsed by the parliament. I say to the member for Charlton that he may well recall-though it is now longer ago than I would care to admit-the frustration of being an opposition backbencher in question time, and the difficulty of getting opposition backbench questions up. That is frustrating enough, without having it complicated and compounded by the absence of ministers whom the opposition particularly wishes to question. I also commend the committee on the decision to extend the grievance debate. That is entirely appropriate. Grievance ought to occupy the minimum of one hour and 20 minutes, and it has frequently been unintentionally compressed. I point out to the committee that the grievance debate is very important to all members, particularly to backbenchers. It does provide a unique opportunity, in that it allows backbenchers to participate during a broadcast time. No-one should make any comparison between the grievance debate and the adjournment debate. The adjournment debate is seen as a relatively unimportant instrument in comparison with grievance. The decision to ensure that grievance no longer ends at 5.15, but becomes an obligatory one hour and 20 minutes, is one I would like to endorse. I again thank the committee for their deliberations and their consideration. As I have indicated, I am largely happy with the recommendations outlined in the report. I would however ask the committee at some future date to consider the wisdom of extending Monday and Tuesday evening sittings, not only to extend the business of the House, but to in some small way break down the isolation which is an unintended consequence of working in this building. This is largely in the hands of us as individuals, but it would be facilitated if we were to spend more time in dining in the same place at the same time. That was certainly our experience in the old house-and such a change would be a relief to the caterers, who must find the present provisions quite unpredictable.

The member for Moncrieff and I enjoy our membership, particularly with the chairmanship of the member for Charlton( Mr Robert Brown) who allows us to go on. Mr Nehl interjectingthe ponds are starting to empty out and the bullfrogs are coming back into the chamber. The member for Charlton sometimes let the member for Moncrieff and me have our long discussions, and he could go out and have a coffee and come back, and not much would have changed. I tried to have a deal with the member for Moncrieff at one stage such that, if she and I both did not go to the meetings, they would probably get them over with pretty quickly. But, as both of us would miss that so much, we decided that an arrangement like that would not be terrific for parliamentary democracy, let alone for our own particular interests. Procedure Committee meetings are very interesting, and I think the committee has, over the period since its inception, done a lot to change the way in which the culture of this place works. Those members who have been here for a while might remember that, prior to the Procedure Committee, we used to have a standing orders committee, which used meet on a very irregular basis. In the main, the government would say no to anything the opposition said, and the opposition would come away unhappy. Now we have the Procedure Committee being very generous, and the government being exceptionally generous in accepting recommendations, and the opposition members still are not happy, but they have probably now got more reason to be less unhappy than we were when the standing orders committee was in operation. I find it very interesting nowadays to listen to interjections and points of order at question time about how terrible the standing orders are. I have a quiet smile when I look over at the right honourable member for New England( Mr Sinclair). If the opposition thinks that the current standing orders for question time are draconian, terrible, horrid and awful, and that they stop democratic discussion and allow ministers to get away with all sorts of devilment, then they can thank the right honourable member for New England, because these were all his idea when he was persecuting us some years ago.

366,Mr Leo Mclea Y,"There goes the echo again. It must be the high ceiling or the fact thatMC 2208 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 22 June 1995 the member for Wakefield ( Mr Andrew) and the member for Perth( Mr Stephen Smith) have said. The member for Wakefield wants to dine and the member for Perth wants to go home. The committee looked long and hard at the propositions put forward by people about these sorts of arrangements. When we looked at the cut-off time for debate-6 o'clock on Thursdays-we also consulted the airline timetables. We were very careful in our original report to put forward proposals for the sitting patterns of the House that would allow members from every capital city except Hobart to return home on Thursday night. Most country people can return home on Thursday night. There are a few people who come from the very outlying states, and from the very outlying parts of those states, and they would have difficulty getting home on a Thursday night. If we brought the time forward, most of those people might get home just a little earlier, but it would not accommodate people who are from places with more difficult transport connections. While there might be some symmetry in the mind of the member for Perth about the committee asking for question time to be brought forward to 2.30 p.m -in that that might allow us to finish at 5.30 p.m -I do not think that that symmetry was intended, and I doubt whether there would be a change in the time that the government would propose as the start of question time. The member for Wakefield says that the Leader of the House( Mr Beazley) might have caused one of the member for Wakefield's constituents to believe that the life of us all down here is one long lunch hour, and that that is why we have the parliament sit at 3 o'clock. It is not for that purpose. The sitting at 3 o'clock is to accommodate frontbenchers-ministers from the government side, and opposition frontbenchers-so that they are able to do things in other parts of this city and on the eastern seaboard during the morning and still get back to participate in question time, which is one of the most important parts-if not the most important part-of the parliamentary day. Under the old arrangements of 2 o'clock, that blocked out the day, but 3 o'clock allows people both to do their duty at question time and to be able, often, to see to some political activity in, say, Melbourne, Sydney or the city of Canberra itself. That sort of activity is a far better arrangement for constituents than our being able to finish at 5.30 p.m. on Thursdays. There are some other matters that the member for Wakefield raised where he thought that we might sit later on a couple of nights of the week so that he and his colleagues can dine with each other. It is good to see that members of the opposition are convivial in this way, because newspaper reports say that they would rather feast on each other's blood than they would sit downwhip that he ought to tell his colleague who is sitting next to him that, if he wants to participate in the high-minded activities of the Standing Committee on Procedure, he should not learn these evil little concepts of interjection, particularly whenmost unruly if I used it.

371,Mr Deputy Speaker (Hon. N.b. Reid),"The honourable member should concentrateThursday, 22 June 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 2209 members would not be happy with. What we have in the current sitting pattern is some consistency where people can plan either to dine later at 8.00 p.m. or to go out of the building. It gives people that flexibility, which is what people always demanded. One of the worse aspects of this building in the past was that we were all cooped up in here until 11.00 p.m. each riight. We would arrive at 8.30 a.m. and get out at 11.00 p.m., we would go home, go to sleep and come back here at 8.30 the next morning. We never had any contact with the real world. These changes were made to encourage members not just to associate with their colleagues, but also to have the capacity to socialise on a wider sphere in Canberra and to do more human things than to sit around and plot and plan like the old sitting pattern used to encourage people to do. The executives on both sides encouraged this because they do not like backbenchers sitting around plotting and planning. The Main Committee was one of the great innovations of the Procedure Committee. Since the Main Committee has come into operation, we have not had to have any guillotines, except in the first week for some roll-over business from the last session. We have had a far greater capacity for members to participate in debate. I do not think there has been any debate on legislation in the House that we have had to truncate since the Main Committee commenced operating. The budget debate this year was probably the best example, with the government wanting to have the budget completed by a particular time and sent to the Senate. Had we not had the Main Committee, we would have had about eight hours less debate on the budget this year than we had. The Main Committee has been very useful for that. Indeed, this morning we are going to discuss this report for about 2Y2 hours. The reality is that running up to the end of session, if we had not had the Main Committee in operation, we would have had the member for Charlton tabling this report in the House-we did not even have a tabling speech-and, with the best endeavour, the government may have got time for half an hour of debate some time this week or next week. The Main Committee is a singular success in providing opportunities for members of parliament to make contributions to legislation. I take this opportunity to mention the unfortunate demise of the member for Moore( Mr Filing). It is a shame that the opposition did not see fit to leave the member for Moore on the Procedure Committee because it might have been useful to have non-government members other than members of the National Party and members of the Liberal Party represented on the committee. The member for Moore, as a Liberal member on the committee, made a very good contribution to the work of the committee. Although this is a decision that the opposition can make, it is unfortunate, to my mind, that the member for Moore is not allowed by the opposition to stay on the committee in the quota of non-government members. However, I place on record the fact that, although I did not agree with some of the things that the member for Moore said, the member for Moore made some very useful contributions to the committee. Some of the points of view of the member for Moore are reflected in this report and in previous reports of the committee. The committee has made a suggestion concerning policy statements made by ministers outside the House, and I hope that the government will take up the committee's suggestion. With the way government works and with concerns about timeliness, et cetera, ministers often make important statements outside the house on matters about which members of parliament",138,Representatives Main Committee
372,Mr Leo Mcleay,"The question whether we should sit late at night is one that a lot ofMC 2210 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 22 June 1995 are very interested. The most significant statement in this regard is the Justice Statement which was made by the Prime Minister( Mr Keating) and the Attorney-General( Mr Lavarch) recently. If these sorts of statements are not made in the House, they are, in a sense, matters unknown to the parliament. The proposal of the committee is to the effect that a minister who makes a statement of some significance away from parliament can table the statement in the parliament. The proposal means that a motion can be moved to take note of the statement, the House can find time for it to be debated and members can then make a contribution. Debate on these sorts of papers would probably take place in the Main Committee because the Main Committee provides us with a vehicle in which to deal with such matters. This is a matter that the government could take up. The committee is not proposing that, when a minister tables a paper, the paper be debated there and then in the House. The committee's proposal is to the effect that a minister could come in and table a paper. A motion could then be moved to take note of the paper and the matter would then go onto the Notice Paper. The government could either make time in the House for debate, or, with the agreement of the opposition, make time for debate in the Main Committee. In completing my remarks, I pay tribute to my colleague, the opposition whip, the honourable member for Casey( Mr Halverson). The business of this committee is carried out by agreement between the opposition whip and 1. The approach of the opposition to the operation of the Main Committee is a positive one and the response by members is also positive.

It is something that happens to him quite often and he manages to survive. He will undoubtedly recover from this attack. I would like to start by paying tribute to the honourable member for Charlton( Mr Robert Brown), as Chair of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Procedure, for an excellent job, sometimes under slightly trying circumstances. I allude there to the spirited exchanges sometimes occurring between the honourable member for Watson and the honourable member for Moncrieff ( Mrs Sullivan), which do add a little to the time taken by the committee but also add to the understanding of the issues that are involved. I congratulate the honourable member for Charlton and thank my fellow members of the committee for a job that has been well done. I would also mention the committee secretariat, and particularly our secretary, who has done an excellent job-sometimes under very trying and difficult circumstances indeed. The facility to coalesce a point of view and actually get it down in a few words has been quite outstanding. I have had not had the opportunity of hearing everybody who has spoken in this debate but I did hear most of what the honourable member for Perth( Mr Stephen Smith) had to say.

The honourable member complained also that he has to leave Perth at about 5 o'clock on Sunday evening on 10 Sundays a year. I am surprised that it is only 10-1 thought we sat considerably more than that many weeks. But I also leave home at about 5 o'clock on the Sunday evening because I like to be down here for the Monday morning, to know that I can arrive and will not be blocked out by fog as so often happens in Canberra during the winter. It also gives me the opportunity to attend various committee meetings and get organised for the parliamentary week. SoI do not see that as a great problem. The honourable member for Perth said that this year on a majority of the Thursday nights we had been sitting late, until 8 o'clock, because the Leader of the Opposition was making statements in response to various things. In actual fact, there have been two occasions this year and I am not aware of any last year when that has happened. The honourable member said also that any opposition worth its salt would be moving censures, suspensions of standing orders and so on, and no government business would be done on the Thursday afternoon after question time. The reality is that in the last 18 months, since these new sessional orders came in and we started rising at 6 o'clock, there have been six censure motions. That does not apply to every week. There have also been 16 suspensions of standing orders-surprisingly, or perhaps not surprisingly when one thinks about it, 10 of those from the government. I imagine the six suspensions of standing orders were the same as for the six censures from the opposition, but the government has had need to suspend standing orders on 10 occasions since the new sessional orders came in. Obviously, it wanted to introduce something or change the order of business. The assertion by the honourable member for Perth that government business on every Thursday is disrupted by the opposition is not an absolutely correct assertion. I do agree with the honourable member for Perth about the airlines' understanding of what happens in this place and the requirements of members and senators. I do not think they have got a clue. He is quite right to suggest that there needs to be a fairly significant improvement in communication between us and the airlines, because they are very significant to our lives. I want to talk about question time. I do not like the 3 o'clock timing of it. The honourable member for Watson has reminded us all of the fact, which I understood already, that the executive-he mentioned shadow ministers as well but basically it is the ministers-needs to be able to undertake activities in this city and on the eastern seaboard. Consequently it is much more convenient for the executive to have question time at 3 o'clock. I think the downside of that is that, by having question time at 3 o'clock, it is never televised live. It is televised at half past 12 or 1 o'clock in the morning. Of course, when the ABC replays it at that time, the audience is fairly limited. It is important that the people of Australia have the opportunity of seeing what is happening in question time. After all, question time is the focus of the parliamentary day. It is the only time that we have the Prime Minister there MC 2212 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 22 June 1995 twice a week. Under the old system, we used to have all ministers present at question timethe entire shadow ministry stilI attends-but there is now a roster for ministers . . Question time is the only time, when it is being televised, when the press gallery is in the chamber. The press gallery is half empty on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. The press gallery is full on Monday and Thursdays, when the Prime Minister is there and we can expect a bit of fireworks. The public galleries generally tend to be full on the Mondays and Thursdays but are half empty on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. This indicates that the people of Australia believe that the parliamentary focus of the day is question time and that the greatest interest is there when the Prime Minister is present. It is absolutely essential that the Prime Minister is present. The Prime Minister is the leader of this country, no matter what party the Prime Minister leads, and we require that he be there and be available to be asked questions and to, hopefully, answer them. People do not really understand what goes on in question time. Schools come here to go to question time. It used to be very hard to get in but it is much easier these days. Constituents, andÂ· particularly children, constantly say, after they have been to question time, 'We would not be allowed to act like that at school.' And, of course, they are quite right. However, I tell them that they have to realise that question time is structured in a certain way so as to be very dramatic and very theatrical. It is the focus of the day and oppositions, in the past and in the future, whether us or the present government, have only 30 or 40 seconds in which to ask a question. The government ministers can take five, 10, 15,20 minutes to answer a question. Mostly they do not answer; they are not in the business of answering questions or providing information. That is one of the shortcomings. I omit the honourable member for Charlton from that criticism because, when he was a minister, he would always answer questions. Highway stopped, the black spots were abandoned. I have no hesitation in praising the former transport minister for the great job that he did in that position. I wish he was stilI there, at least until the next election, because we might get a bit more money spent on the Pacific Highway. As I said, question time is very important. It is the focus of the parliamentary day. I am opposed to the rostering of ministers. I believe that the Prime Minister should be there for every question time. It is also important that the people of Australia should be able to see their parliament in action. Question time""is the only bit that they get to see, if they are stilI awake at 12.30 or 1 o'clock in the morning. We should change it, if for no other reason than the convenience of the people of /\.ustraIia-not the convenience of ministers. People keep telling me that they would like to see questi<;m time but that they do not want to stay up that late to watch it. . I agree with the proposition that there should be more time for. the grievance debate. This is a very significant area, particularly for private members business. I relish the opportunity to speak in the grievance debate and I spoke in the debate this Monday. I would have spoken last Monday but, because of the suspension of standing orders, grievance time was taken up. More time should be allocated for the grievance debate. The member for Watson said. that the Main Committee is a tremendous step forward and I agree with him. I think it is excellent. It-is providing opportunities for members to speak about things that are important to them and even more important to their constituents. I",140,Representatives Main Committee

However, the member for Watson said that there had been no guillotine. That is absolutely incorrect. He was correct in saying that we had an additional period of time to debate the budget in the Main Committee. Approximately a day and a half extra debating time was provided in this chamber. We did have the guillotine, there was a cutoff point and we did have the gag, which restricted people's opportunity of speaking. Some members did not get the opportunity to speak on the budget. I happen to know because I was one of them. I was down on the list and, because of the guillotine, even with the gag operating, it was still impossible for me to speak on the budget. The budget is the most important document and piece of legislation to come before the parliament and I believe every member should be given the opportunity of speaking on it. I also make a suggestion which I made in the committee but which was not incorporated in the report: we should have provision in the Standing Orders for this committee to adjourn on certain occasions and in special circumstances when the Prime Minister of the day is making an important statement. During the last sitting there was an occasion when the Prime Minister( Mr Keating) was making a major statement and all of us who were involved in the Main Committee operation wanted to be in the House listening to the Prime Minister. As the member for Perth said, it is important that all members have the opportunity to hear major statements, whether they be from the Prime Minister or from the Leader of the Opposition. I appreciate the comment that he made about that. I suggest in future considerations we look at putting in the provision for this committee to adjourn when major statements are being made. Ministerial statements is another area we need to tighten up. Too often many mini-ministerial statements are made in answers to questions. I think that is wrong. I do not point the bone only at the present government. I am sure we did the same thing when we were in government although I would hope that we did not. Ministerial statements should be made as ministerial statements because that then gives members of the parliament representing the people of Australia the opportunity to debate them. Statements can be referred to this chamber and that means there is an opportunity for all of us to have a say on them. The member for Watson also mentioned the ministerial statements outside the House and I totally agree that, if this happens-and I do not believe it should-they should be tabled in the House so that they can be debated. He mentioned the Justice Statement. I have need of the Justice Statement and only yesterday my staff member was told that we have to buy it from the government bookshop. It is appalling that members of this parliament cannot get hold of such an important parliamentary document as the Justice Statement without having to buy it. I would put that on the record as well. Mr Melham interjectingPrime Minister of the day to be more statesmanlike and dignified in question time and at other times. I suggest, with the best goodwill in the world, that the present Prime Minister has denigrated the high office of Prime Minister of this country and he needs to comport himself with more dignity in keeping with the traditions of parliamentary democracy.

377,Mr Tanner (Melbourne) (12.04 P.m.),"I welcome the opportunity to comment on theMC 2214 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 22 June 1995 Dr Blewett, which I think have very much enhanced the workings of the parliament. I have only been here a relatively short time-a couple of years-but I certainly believe that, in general, those reforms have been very positive. In an overall sense, the comments that are in this report under the auspices of the committee now chaired by the honourable member for Charlton( Mr Robert Brown) are very worthwhile. I refer to a number of the specific themes that are mentioned in the report and add my views to some of the things that have been mentioned by the honourable member for Cowper( Mr Nehl) and some of the previous speakers. Firstly, it is fairly widely recognised that this Main Committee has been a successful innovation within the proceedings of the parliament. The comments in the report indicate that the Main Committee should be continued as an integral part of the process of debate, consideration. of reports, legislation and the like. I would certainly endorse that and endorse the comments that the honourable member for Cowper made in that regard. I note the comments that were made in the report with respect to the public gallery and the need to take steps to encourage visitors to parliament to come and watch the proceedings of the Main Committee as well as the proceedings of the House itself. It is fortunate that the members of the committee did not go into any detail about the types of initiatives that we might want to pursue in that regard: perhaps a hot dog stand or one or two other things might assist. But I think it is important to keep these things in perspective-that people do come to see the proceedings of the chambers of the parliament for reasons other than just seeing politicians. It is ultimately the base of our democratic system of government and there is a certain symbolism associated with seeing the parliament, in seeing the House of Representatives, which clearly is not replicated within the Main Committee because the Main Committee is simply an adjunct to the House of Representatives. Whether we like it or not, I think that this Main Committee will always be something of a poor cousin to the House of Representatives. Therefore we should not concern ourselves unduly with the lack of attendance and the fact that today, in spite of the fact that I am doing my best to make a good contribution, we have only got a couple of people sitting opposite in the seats available for the public. The second point to which I wish to advert is the issue of question time. Both the rostering system and the timing of question time are raised in the report. With respect to the timing matter, I am something of an agnostic. I think that the later time of question time is marginally better for backbenchers in terms of the various other obligations that backbenchers have. I really do not have a particularly strong view about the alternative that has been put forward of 2.30 p.m. rather than 3 p.m. However, I do have a couple of views about the question of rostering. One recommendation that is put forward is that the opposition be entitled to demand the presence of one minister at any question time, obviously in order to ensure that, where there is a particular issue running and a particular minister is under pressure, that minister cannot hide behind the fact of not being on a roster on the particular day. This is probably a reasonable suggestion, but it needs to be kept in mind that ministers do other things; they do have other responsibilities. Part of the difficulty in pursuing this suggestion is that we would need to ensure that ministers actually had some notice that they were going to be required to attend question time. Otherwise they would not be able to schedule alternative commitments: meetings with delegations, functions and the like. In a Thursday, 22 June 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 2215 sense, the more notice we require the opposition to give a particular minister, the more we defeat the purpose of the exercise in the first place. It then becomes very difficult for the opposition to know two or three days in advance that a particular minister is going to be targeted at a particular question time. Of course, it forces them to telegraph their punches, in a sense, as to what type of theme they are going to be running in question time. In essence, it is a worthwhile and constructive suggestion, and I think that the spirit of the suggestion is very logical and fair, but some further work on the detail may be necessary in order to work up an appropriate proposal. I should add that, in a sense, some of the criticisms that are made of the new system of question time by the opposition really only have value because it has failed to make use of the opportunities, by and large, that are offered by the new arrangements. One of the opportunities that is offered by the new arrangements is the ability to concentrate on particular lower profile ministers in more junior ministries, to really give them a hammering and put them under some pressure, to test just how much they are on top of their portfolios and to see whether they are fully across the difficult issues that might be pertinent at the time. In spite of those opportunities, the opposition, in my observation, has not yet taken that option. It has not been able to make use of that. I think the opposition would find that it would get greater value out of the new question time arrangements if it started to pay a bit more attention to some of the ministers who very rarely get asked questions by the opposition. I think the statistics would show that a large number of ministers have barely been asked a question by the opposition in the time that this parliament has sat-maybe one or two, but certainly not very many-and that they tend to rely on government backbenchers to ask questions, to keep them occupied in question time. The next issue I refer to is sitting hours. I have some sympathy with the honourable member for Cowper about the question of being able to get home on Thursday night. I am certainly of the view that we should conduct our arrangements in such a way as to enable pretty well all honourable members to get home on Thursday night. To me, the great advance made by the reforms under the Blewett committee was to enable the vast majority of honourable members to get home on Thursday night. It means for me that I can now work a normal Friday rather than wandering around in a semi-comatose state, unable to do much more than sign correspondence and look at things coming across my in-tray. unfortunately my best years are already well behind me. Mr Robert Brown-No, ahead of you. member for Cowper. To me, if we are faced with a choice of extra hours on the Thursday evening or, for example, sitting till 9 or 10 o'clock on the Tuesday evening or the Wednesday evening, it is much more logical to sit later on the evenings when we are required to be in Canberra in any event. It is also worth pointing out that we have actually saved the taxpayer a bit of money by enabling honourable members to leave on Thursday night, because there is one less day for which people will claim travel allowance. We have also ensured that honourable members are able to spend a slightly greater amount of time with their families, which is ultimately a fairly important question.",143,Representatives Main Committee

I do have some sympathy with the view of the honourableMC 2216 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 22 June 1995 I have some sympathy with the honourable member for Perth( Mr Stephen Smith), when he refers to the speeches by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Howard), with respect to the republic and to the budget, which twice now we have had to have on the Thursday night. This has forced honourable members either to delay their return home until the following morning or to go through some rather bizarre travel arrangements in order to get home late on Thursday night. I would not mind that quite so much if there were any content in what the Leader of the Opposition said in his speeches. Unfortunately, in the one on the republic he took 30 minutes to say what anybody could have said in about three minutes, and his speech on the budget was essentially rhetoric with no specific propositions about alternatives, about what the opposition would do if it were in government. If there were a greater degree of substance in the speeches I would perhaps not quite mind so much, but to stay back to listen to vacuous nonsense is a bit irritating, to say the least. I would say as an observation on this question of sitting times, schedules and so forth that I am an opponent of the parliament sitting more. It is a mistake that people in the community often make, to assume that the only real or important work that parliamentarians do is actually being in parliament and sitting. In fact, it is probably less important than the work that parliamentarians do in their constituency. It would worry me that, if we spent more time here, we of all political persuasions would end up being more remote, less in touch with our electors and less in touch with what is going on at the grassroots level in our electorates. Ultimately what we do, day in, day out, when we are not in parliament, is go around our electorates, be at functions, deal with problems and talk to constituents, delegations and the like. To me that is probably the paramount role of a parliamentarian. Certainly for a backbencher it is the paramount role. To impinge on that for the purposes of longer sittings is wrong. Ultimately it has a undemocratic impact, in that we are less representative of the people who have actually elected us to be here. The role of parliament is touched on in this report. A commentator a couple of years ago made an observation that parliament in our system is now little more than an electoral college that every two or three years elects an executive and then wallows in irrelevance. I think that is probably being a bit harsh, but there is a certain degree of substance to that. In a sense it reflects the increasing complexity of government. The emergence of parliamentary committees to some extent reflects those changes, so that a lot of the detailed action in consideration of legislation occurs less often in the chambers of parliament than perhaps it once did. SoI think we all have a lot of thinking to doA division having been called in the House of RepresentativesSitting suspended from 12.16 p.m. to 12.28 p.m. and its relationship to the executive. One of the things we could look at is how we seem to spend an enormous amount of time debating bills that involve minor, fairly technical amendments to legislation where we have to use the legislation as, in a sense, a heading to enable us to debate broader issues. I suppose there is a necessity for that, but, on some occasions, it also involves the whips of all the major parties asking people to speak and, therefore, to fit themselves into a fairly artificial structure of debate. Our democracy would be much better suited if we were able to have substantive debates in the parliament on the key issues that face the nation rather than having to modify what we",145,Representatives Main Committee
381,Mr Tanner,"Before the suspension, I was making reference to the workings of parliamentThursday, 22 June 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 2217 are saying and how we are saying it in order to fit in with, say, the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.2) 1995 or whatever the case may be. Obviously, we still need to debate all of those technical amendments to legislation and so forth, but I am sure that we could do that in a much shorter time. Consideration of this reform of the parliament may, in future, be taken up by the Standing Committee on Procedure. The final comment I make relates to the scheduling of parliamentary sessions. I am very pleased to see that I scored a footnote in the committee's report as a result of my brief submission and that relates to the fact that of the budget, we now have three major breaks in the parliamentary calendar. The winter break is relatively unchanged-roughly seven weeks-but, because of the need to have a substantial break prior to the budget in order to allow ministers to prepare for the budget, the summer break has been shortened. This has led to a rather ridiculous situation where parliament is resuming sitting later in January. It is absurd that we should all be going back home to shiver in our electorates, those of us who do not go overseaswhen we could actually be sitting here for at least some of that time, and yet we are coming here late in January. One of the reasons this can cause problems for members-not that any of us are still likely to be on holidays late in January-is that I find that to come cold back to work and start sitting straight away is often a problem. We get a little build-up of work over the Christmas-New Year period that we have to deal with and it is certainly better to be able to have a week or two of working in the electorate office before the House starts sitting. I would normally return to work about that time in January so perhaps it is not such a huge problem. I do think that the recommendation the committee has made, that we start sitting on the first Tuesday in February rather than late January, is a sensible one. It gives a little more flexibility at a time of the year when it is better to be away from this place than it is during winter. I also support the committee's recommendation that we should always sit on Mondays, with one exception. I think that is a sensible suggestion. It gets more value out of a week. It ensures that, if we are coming here, we actually get some substantial value from what we are doing and we do not lose a day for no particular reason other than that it is the start of a session. Overall, the report is a very good one, and I commend the honourable member for Charlton and the committee members for their work. who participates very actively in the parliament-perhaps a little too actively at times. Certainly, in the time.

386,Mr Bradford (Mcpherson) (12.31 P.m.),"I would like to make a few remarks as oneMC 2218 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 22 June 1995 many committees. We cannot be everywhere. I am certainly very keen for the committee to continue its work. I think those of us who have been here for some time have lots of ideas about how the parliament can be improved. I suspect the enthusiasm for change-I am not sure; the chairman might tell me-is probably greater on the opposition side than it is on the government side. That would probably be the case no matter who was in government or who was in opposition. Plainly, to a large extent the opposition bears the brunt of the government's decisions in respect of these practices. The government simply has the numbers. In the end, the parliament survives, I suppose, largely because of the conventions and a certain amount of goodwill that exists between the two sides. There are a number of issues raised in this report that require ongoing consideration. I am sure that that is recommended and that there will be an ongoing process of consideration. I am one who is concerned about question time. I think all of us are: on our side, perhaps for different reasons. It is a pity that question time reflects so badly on us all as members. From our constituents, and particularly from school groups that come here, we all get tarred with the brush that is used in question time, that we are all a mob of louts. I try to explain to people-I am sure we all do-that question time is a smaIl part of the day. It is always going to be an active part. It is in the House of Lords; it is in every parliament of the world. I suppose to some extent it gives the opposition a good opportunity to make points, one way or another, in the form of the questions that it asks. In the end, the true purpose of question time ought to be as it is defined, to seek information and to have information provided. I understand that that is its purpose. I think the culture has to change. We can talk about changing the rules as far as the Speaker's independence is concerned, but in the end there has to be an attitude by the government-and, hopefully, by us, if we were in government-that that is the purpose of question time, and that ministers will be required to answer questions and know more. The practice of ministers going off, as they inevitably do, to talk about what the opposition did 10 or 20 years ago, or to make a personal attack on the person who has asked the question, is not the intention. If we were in government, I think we would still find it a temptation to do that, but I am hoping that we would not do so. The chairman of the committee, the member for Charlton( Mr Robert Brown) has been here a lot longer than I have, and maybe it is a bit unrealistic of me to expect that to happen. The government can tinker with it and put bandaids on it and talk about the Speaker and his role until the cows come home; but, until it gets to the fundamentals, it is really only putting bandaids on it. The other thing I would advocate-and I think the committee considered it in its previous deliberations-is that dorothy dix questions be banned. I suspect that I probably would go as far as to suggest that only opposition members ought to ask questions of the government, unless there can be some guarantee that we will not get the sort of charade that we get in question time every day. It really is a charade. Even the government blokes here would have to agree that, when they get up and ask a question that they read out and the minister has the answer prepared, that is reaIly notminister writes the question out. He might be prompted occasionally-and I do not want to cast too many aspersions-by a member's interest in the subject. If a member asks, 'What",147,Representatives Main Committee
387,Mr Nehl,The question was written in his office.,148,Representatives Main Committee
388,Mr Bradford,"Exactly. That is exactly what happens, as my colleagues says. TheThursday, 22 June 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 2219 about we have a question on this?', the minister probably says-and I am only guessing'Okay; you go away and I'll prepare a question,' and he gets his advisers in. chair, and do not respond till you get the call. up and reads that answer. Inevitably, he goes on through pages 1, 2 and 3, unless he is particularlyabuses of question time occur and it is no wonder that the opposition is annoyed by that. When the present government members are in opposition after the next election, they will be just as annoyed about it, and I hope that, as the government, we will not do it. If ministers are asked questions that require them to make statements, then they ought to make statements. As I understand it, the only objection to doing that is that it then becomes a matter of debate. As my colleague who spoke a moment ago said, very often they ought to be matters of debate, as they are the sort of things we ought to be doing in the parliament. If something is important enough for a minister to get up and talk for 10 or 15 minutes, then he ought to do it. There are plenty of places for him to do it, and I would encourage that. The answer to question time is an attitudinal and cultural thing, and I would like to think that, in government, we would fix question time up in that way, without tinkering around with it and trying to make it work by putting bandaids on it instead of making an actual cultural change. Sure, it depends a lot on the Speaker and the Speaker's independence, and I certainly would not want to cast aspersions on the current Speaker or on any other, because I think it is improper to do that. Obviously, I would like to somehow see the word 'relevant' defined. The Speakers keep throwing it back on the parliament to define it. Maybe it is a difficult thing, but the word has a literal meaning. My experience in the parliament is that, clearly, ministers are very often irrelevant, except in the absolutely broadest interpretation of what 'relevance' actually means. That needs to be fixed, and I challenge the government to define what is relevant. I know the Procedure Committee has considered in the past whether time limits ought to be applied, and that is another thing that has been done in the Senate. I understand the pros and cons of that; but, on balance, I would probably come down on the side of having time limits applied to answers-and, indeed, to questions, if one wanted to be even-handed. Obviously, there needs to be more time for the answer than for the question. I would very much like to see question time work better. I understand that it has a volatile atmosphere, and that is good. It is healthy, and it reflects the healthiness of our democracy, but it does not reflect very well on us. Some of the displeasure about politicians is simply because of the fact that people watch question time on television, or they actually come here and watch. In that case, we knowbecause we all have the school groups tell us so-that they are quite aghast at what goes on in question time. I suspect that that is why the government will never sell its proposition-if we were to come to the point-that the election of a president should be left to the politicians.

They see the way you behave and they do not want you to be involved in the process.' If there is going to be a president, as the polls have told us, then people are going to want the righta jaundiced view of us in our roles as members of parliament. I know there is a lot more to it than what happens in question time. It is a much bigger issue than that. What happens in question time is only a little bit of what happens here, and we try to explain that to people. But that is all that people see and it is all they think we really do-yell and yahoo-when we go into the parliament. I do not want to be tarred with that brush, because I like to take this role very seriously, participate in debates and really do the job. It is difficult. The process, in the end, is predetermined. You often feel, when you go into the parliament to make a speech, that you are wasting your time-in opposition, anyway, because you are not going to change the government's mind. I think you very rarely do-we come in and make passionate speeches.

I think that is absolutely proper and I am sure that with the change of government that would occur. If the Prime Minister does not set an example in making this institution important, nobody else is going to. You have to lead in that regard.Â· The Prime Minister of the country should be in the parliament often. I know he has a million other things to do and we do not expect him to be sitting there all day, but certainly in question time he shouldas Prime Minister, would be there when question time is on. We would want to have question time. There are occasions we argue in the parliament that question time could be knocked off. I can understand that, on the odd occasion where we have an extra sitting day or something. But the thing is that the Prime Minister needs to see question time as important. I am not sure how far we would go, but my own view would be that all ministers should be there every question time. I suspect that that is what we will do. But certainly the Prime Minister should be there every question time. In relation to the operation of question time, I notice that the government is going to have another look at it. In other words, it has admitted that that is a much bigger issue. I see in paragraph 6.4.4 that consideration of that will be continued by preparing a discussion paper on possible options for change. I am pleased about that. As I said, I was the initial opposition whip here in this Main Committee, prior to my unfortunate demise. Mr Robert Brown-You did a very good job. although there was some reluctance on our side to acknowledge that it was going to work, I embraced it enthusiastically because it was a job I was given to do. Committee would work. I did my best to make it work, and, with your chief whip, we have made it work. It works. There are some physical problems-such as access to the publicwhich have been addressed by the committee, and there are a few procedural problems. However, as I said, the Main Committee does work and it has achieved its objective of allowing debate on reports that may never have got back into the parliament because of the pressure of other business. The concept of the Main Committee dealing with uncontroversial ""' matters is a bit over the top because everything is controversial in this place if you want to make it controversial. By nature, if it is before the parliament there is an element of controversy about it. That aspect has not worried us too much, and the more informal atmosphere in the Main Committee has made it a verythan sometimes occurs in the chasm of the House of Representatives where honourable members seem lost in the huge chamber. one has not.

I was sceptical about finishing early at night, but I can now see that the earlier finishing time is conducive for those of us who attend the gym. It is much better to go into the gym at 7 a.m. after having slept all night than to go into the gym after staying in this place until 2 o'clock in the morning. there are a number of points to touch on. Members need to bear in mind that, as with the first report, this report is a package which we are presenting to the parliament. Some members of the committee have different views from the views expressed in some of the recommendations, but it is give and take. We cannot all have what we want, and this is the problem in relation to hours of sitting and a few other things that I want to speak about. In terms of the creation of the Main Committee, the universal view is that the Main Committee is a success. The Main Committee has a different atmosphere from the main chamber, but a lot of constructive work takes place there. The Main Committee is an unqualified success. The sceptics are proved wrong. The Main Committee is one of the beneficial changes that came into being. The other beneficial change is standing committees. The House of Representatives committee system provides backbenchers with a meaningful role in the parliament and this situation is as a result of the goodwill between the government and the opposition members on the committees and because these committees operate a little bit differently. Many of the reports which are brought back to the parliament are unanimous reports, and that aspect helps. As Chair of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, I am in a position to know that that committee has received the bulk of references in terms of advisory reports. If success can be measured in terms of the government picking up recommendations, the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs has achieved a substantial success rate. There have been some controversial pieces of legislation referred to the committee, and the way the legislation has been dealt with is a credit to the cooperation of the right honourable member for New England( Mr Sinclair), the honourable member for Tangney( Mr Williams), the honourable member for Holt( Mr Duffy), the honourable member for Jagajaga( Mr Staples) and the other members of the committee. Proper resourcing of the secretariat and secondment of officers from the department to assist in specialist reports are the keys to the success of the committee. In the House of Representatives, where the government has the numbers, honourable members have seen the government take up substantial recommendations. This situation has resulted in alterations which enrich the legislation which originates in the House of Representatives. The area of House of Representatives committees is an area in which backbench members of the government and the opposition can playa constructive and positive role in terms of influencing legislation. That is where I differ from the honourable member for McPherson( Mr Bradford) who just rose to speak. Government members in standing committees can express quite differing views from the government's position in terms of the introduction of legislation and achieve success.",151,Representatives Main Committee

418,Mr Nehl,"They have.Thursday, 22 June 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 2223 has changed in terms of the operation of those standing committees in the short time that they have been taking place: they are seen as allowing the participation of members of parliament in the process; they also allow the parliament to bring experts and practitioners in the various fields before it, so that it really is a democratic process. We need government and opposition members to resist the push by the Executive for urgent consideration of this legislation. My view has always been that if the legislation that has been introduced by the Executive into the parliament is so crash hot it will withstand scrutiny by members of the parliament and by members of the public. In some instances there will be policy differences, and that is when a number of the recommendations may not be taken up. But in the short time that the committees have been operating the parliament has received reports that not only withstand scrutiny but are gaining international recognition. The reports of the legal committee on the child sex tourism bill and the war crimes bill, as I understand it, have been considered model reports, and members of the parliament in New Zealand and other parliaments are using them as a basis of legislation in those countries. I think that says something about the potential for the operation of those committees. One of the underutilised areas of the committees is our ability-and it is pointed out on page 18 of this report-pursuant to the standing orders, to examine annual reports of government departments. Parliamentary committees, particularly in the House, need to do that a bit more often because that is another useful mechanism for suggesting change to the Executive. There is nothing wrong with reviewing an annual report of the director of public prosecutions or the ombudsman, for instance, by bringing them before the committee and going through how the legislation might currently be working. The committees could bring forward reports to the Executive suggesting areas of change. backbench member of parliament on either side can make a substantial contribution. It is an aspect that does not get publicity because it is not one where we are at one another's throats. SoI think thatmy five and a bit years here I have found the committee work most enjoyable. It is nice to have one's fingerprints over pieces of legislation and legislative change. On the matter of rostering, there is a comment in this report that there has been criticism of the present roster system. Opposition members of the committee expressed a strong view that the roster should be abandoned, that is, in relation to the roster of ministers for question time. The truth is that there are members of the government who are not well disposed to the rostering system. It is a matter of public record that I was one in caucus who felt that the Prime Minister( Mr Keating) should be at question time every day. I expressed that view because I believe that he is a master in that forum; that he is the equivalent of what Bradman was to cricket when it comes to question time in the parliament; and that it was absurd to select someone like Bradman in a side as captain and then say that because of his outstanding performances and to even up the score he had better go and sign a few signatures out in the paddock and be used for only part of the time. That is my particular view.",152,Representatives Main Committee

423,Mr Melham,"There is harmony. Friendships are forged across the parliament, and inMC 2224 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 22 June 1995 What members need to understand, and members of the public as well, is that in politics as in everything else it is the majority view that prevails. The overwhelming view on our side of the parliament is that the roster system has proved beneficial. I think what has happened is that the members of the opposition, quite frankly, have not taken the benefits that they should from the roster. They still need to learn a little about tactics and how to launch an offensive, and this rhetoric about 'Yes, we want the Prime Minister back in question time every day'Mr Robert Brown-No, they don't. it is a disadvantage, from this government's point of view, when he is not there because of his total dominance. Frankly, I like him in question time because I think that it shows how he is so dominant and why he is the best person in that position, at this point of time, that this country has to offer and that this parliament has to offer. We only have to look at the galleries at question time-both the public gallery and the press gallery-because when the Prime Minister is not there the galleries are empty. When he is there they are all there, they are all filled. It is an electric atmosphere, it is a charged atmosphere. But that is one where I do not have the numbers. We will still work on it, though. The operation of the sin-bin is on page 28 of this report. Question time is theatre, and we are all guilty of participating. I suppose the truth is that, in terms of government members, I would probably be one of the more culpable ones in terms of the interchange and in being quite vociferous from the backbench, because I do not believe in sitting idle on the backbench when the members of the opposition are in the fray. There is only one way: we have got to give it back to them. If we are fair dinkum in terms of the operation of the sin-bin and if it is what we want-total decorum and total silence when a question is asked or when a minister is answering a question or when the Prime Minister is answering a question-then I say to the Speaker and the Deputy Speaker that they should exercise the sin-bin a lot more harshly and a lot more often than they do. I think that if there were two or three days in succession where the Speaker or Deputy Speaker, whichever is in charge, threw out three or four government members and three or four opposition members-quite frankly, under the present standing orders that is possible, and I would say that I would probably be the first government member to be thrown out, because I have been given a bit of leniency-then we would get a question time where we could hear a pin drop. But is that what we really want? The truth is that in our heart of hearts most of us do not. I find question time the most engaging and enjoyable part of the operation of the parliament and it is the most electric when the Prime Minister is there. I am not saying that as one who is one of the mates of the Prime Minister-my views are well known in relation to that. It is a balance. So let us not get on with the humbug. I think the power is there. I actually enjoy the interchange between government and opposition members, but I do believe that there are times when that power should be exercised a bit more. I think that the Speaker and the Deputy Speaker have shown enormous tolerance to us as members of the parliament. The other matter, which I will finish with, concerns the hours of sitting. It is well known that, in relation to the sitting hours, I was one of the main architects in the initial report of what has been adopted and is known as the 8 o'clock rule. Frankly, I will defend that until the very end because I think it has enabled us, as members of parliament on both sides will",153,Representatives Main Committee

We are not having the situation where we are all walking around this place as zombies late at night. From the point of view of health and quality of debate, and from the support staff's point of view, we have more civilised hours. I am one who will strongly resist the breaking of the 8 o'clock rule. I acknowledge that at the end of a session and towards the end of the day we might have to break the 8 o'clock rule or whatever because of the recalcitrant nature of the Senate and the fact that we generally have to wait in relation to it. I think the 8 o'clock rule has been a tremendous success and we should resist any attempt to extend hours on a Monday night, a Tuesday night or a Wednesday night just because we are here. With those comments, I commend the chair in what was a substantial input into this report. He has done a marvellous job.
