I N To","day's Argus the leader of the Opposition is reported to have said last nightMr Willis, in his speech, said that the Labour Party was-so well organized that there should be no dissolution at the present time. aware that the feeling of the country was against the Ministry, and therefore did not desire a dissolution. I have consulted Hansard, which, as honourable members know, is a verbatim report, and I find that the words which I used were theseHonorable members opposite nave derived some satisfaction from a reckless statement of the honourable member for Wilmot, that were a dissolution to take place at the present time, the polls would be swept by the Labour Party. The honourable member might be able to let'himself down softly in that way, but he could not deceive me, nor could he deceive Mr Tom Mann, who has said that honourable members opposite would go further than they now profess to be prepared to go, and that if they were candid and honest, and said what they really believed in,'.they would gÂ» the full length of. Socialism, according to the Fabian Essays, and of the socialistic movement of England, and the Continent.; but he adds that they are not supported by the people. There is a great difference between the two statements. I think that my views as reported in Hansard are very clearly and definitely set out. the Prime Ministeri f he has received a communication from the Premier of Queensland regarding'the continuance of the Sugar Bounty Act, and dealing with the whole subject.

Home Affairs, ufon noticeReferring to his answer to the question of the honourable member for Barker, on 8th September, on the matter of the annual increases to civil servants under State Acts, and generally to the matter of existing and accruing rights under section 84 of the Commonwealth Constitution(1) Are the law officers, including the Attorney-General, of opinion that none of the following payments or rights under State Acts in force when the Department of the State became subject to the Executive control 'of the Commonwealth, are existing or accruing rights within the meaning of the Constitution :(a) Annual salaries. (4) Prescribed annual increases of such salaries. (c) Commission on work done by an officer as part of the duties, or by reason, of his office. (2) Are the law officers of opinion that rights under such State Acts may be taken away by a .Federal Act? If Yes(3) What, in the opinion of the law officers, are existing or accruing rights within the meaning of Section 84 of the Constitution? answer to the honourable and learned member's questions is as follows:It is considered generally undesirable to furnish legal opinions given by law officers of the Crown to the ex-Government, especially when the cases submitted may come before the High Court for decision. As already partially intimated in reply to a previous question, it may b ; stated that it was held by the Crown Law Officers that, on confirmation by the Governor General, the classification of the service made by the Public Service Commissioner supersedes the State Acts as regard salaries, increments, and allowances. The present Attorney-General has given no opinion on the matters referred to. Home Affairs, upon notice(1) Since the scheme for the classification of the Public Service has been presented to this House, has the Commissioner informed any public officers that they are not entitled to the grade assigned to them therein, but to a lower one? (2) If so, on what grounds, and in how many instances in respect of each State? answer to .the honourable member's questions is as follows : 1 and 2. A clerical error occurs in the printed classification, whereby six omcers in the New South Wales Customs are given wrong designation; when this was dis;overed, the Commissioner notified the officers of same. They are described as third instead of fourth class inspectors, but the mistake is self-evident, as the classification and pay of the officers show their positions as in the fourth class. Five of the officers referred ti: have been granted an increase in the classification. The Commissioner is not aware of any other similar cases. the Minister of Trade and Customs, upon notice1. When the provisional Patent regulations tentatively adopted on 31st May are proposed to be finally approved? 2. Whether any and what alterations are intended to be made in the provisional regulations? 3. Whether those interested will be afforded an opportunity of making suggestions relating to the regulations, as proposed to be amended? 4. When will the first complete specifications under the Federal Patents Act be accepted? orable and learned member's questions are as follow:1. Probably within the next fortnight. 2. Yes; such alterations as the working of the provisional regulations may prove necessary or desirable will be made in accordance with the piactice in such cases. They will probably, however, be of a slight character. 3. In accordance with the Rules Publication Act, the regulations were gazetted on the 31st May last, and persons interested had then sixty days' notice in which to make any suggestions. A few suggestions have been received, and these have been given due consideration. 4. Complete specifications will be accepted when the indexes of the State Patent Offices have been put in order. The difficulty of bringing the Act into effective operation in this connection was clearly indicated by Mr Deakin when the Bill was under discussion in Parliament during its second reading, when the Honourable member remarked that it would probably take a considerable time before complete specifications could be accepted. [Vide Hansard, 29th September, 1903, page 5507 ; and 30th September, page 5591.) The Patents indexes and records of all States except New South Wales are now being carefully inspected, but in regard to the last-mentioned State a difficulty has arisen, which it is hoped may be shortly adjusted. The Commissioner is using every effort to push on with this work. Trade and Customs, upon noticeWhether it is the intention of the Public Service Commissioner to recommend that the exemption of certain officers in the temporary service of the Department of Trade and Customs at Sydney (enumerated in notification of 23rd June) shall be renewed at and from ist October, 1904, in those cases where the officers have carried out their duties in a satisfactory and efficient manner?",13,First Commonwealth Contingent

55,Sir John Forrest (Swan),"I taket he Western. Australian Government no difficulty will be experienced in inducing them to give effect to their views. At the same time, nobody desires that any . mineral wealth which may be discovered shall not be worked. Personally, I am of opinion that no minerals will be found in Western Australia except within about 250 miles of Kalgoorlie. letter which I received the other day it was stated that a mining lease comprising ninety-six acres had been'applied for, about 250 miles to the east of Kurnalpie, which would be somewhere near the probable route of the railway. Of course it would be altogether adverse to the interests of the Commonwealth to place any restrictions whatever upon the working of mineral leases: But I am convinced that no difficulty will be experienced in inducing the Government of Western Australia to reserve from alienationany reasonable area upon each side of the projected line. I am sure that the representatives of that State share my opinion. Probably it would be advisable to set apart, say, twenty or thirty miles upon each side of the railway, but of course there would be nothing to prevent that area from being leased for pastoral purposes, as the land is quite, suitable for pastoral purposes %yhen water is procured. At the present time, however, we do not know the exact route -which the line will follow. I can assure honourable members that it is not merely the value of country which the railway will traverse which induces me and those associated with me to advocate^its construction. I . am impelled to do so from a desire to conwere made by syndicates to obtain undue nect the eastern States with Western Australia, and thus to make Federation a reality. Until a Bill authorizing the construction of the line is before us, I think that the honourable member's suggestion is premature. sure as to what the honourable member for New England desires. Does he wish to reserve' an area upon each side of the proposed line for all time? honourable' member that there is a land tax operative in South Australia. I understand that he believes in a land tax. him that any land which might be alienated would be subject to a land tax. Personally, I do not see how we can define the particular locality in which any area should be reserved at the present time. The honourable member ought to be quite satisfied, seeing that in South Australia a land tax is jn operation. the kind of land itax that i's levied there. I am of opinion that the country upon Indeed, in a private each side of the projected line should be reserved by the States which it will traverse. After the railway has been constructed it might be sold. South Australia's attitude upon this matter. That State would be quite prepared to reserve land upon each side of the proposed line for certain purposes, but the suggestion that we should make provision for it in this Bill, even though we do not know the route which the railway will follow, seems to me a very impracticable one. If the honourable member will defer his proposal until the measure authorizing the construction of the line' is under consideration he will be acting wisely. sympathy with the object which the honourable member for New Engjand wishes to attain, but I contend that the present is not an opportune time to give effect to his suggestion. I can assure him that the members of the present Western Australian Government are fully seized of the necessity for preventing any unfair exploitation of the resources of that State. The previous Government -were called upon to deal with several cases in which attempts control of large areas. These were promptly frustrated. If my memory serves me correctly, I think that even in the direction which the railway is intended to take some veiy active gentlemen endeavoured some' time ago to secure large blocks of land. However, their little scheme was discovered, and quickly thwarted. The honourable member for New England may rest assured that the Western Australian Government are fully alive to the need for preventing exploitation of the national resources in the way that he fears.

I sympathize with them in their desire, as the right honourable member says, to connect the east with the west, and so consummate the great scheme of Australian CJnion; but there are practical considerations which ought not to be overlooked. The proposal made by the honourable member for New England is not without precedent, I think, in all the States.

131,Mr Spence,"Previousl y we heardStates under the control of the Commonwealth, and, therefore, I am not so much alarmed as are some other honourable members that the Commonwealth should be requested to undertake the construction of this line. I do not suppose we shall rush into the undertaking for some little time. What is proposed is certainly an important departure, in connection with which we should be assured of the distinct co-operation of .the States. New England and Parkes have pointed out what usually takes place .when railways are projected, and there can be no doubt . that persons would be found very glad to take up a large area of land along the route of this railway. to get it at a very cheap rate, and they would naturally regard it is a very good speculation. So far from opposing this measure, T am in favour of it, but I think, with the honourable members to whom I have referred, .that we should have a distinct pledge from Ministers that they will ask the Governments of both the States interested for an assurance that the land for a certain distance on each side of the proposed alienation. be in a position to refuse to survey or construct the line later if the States Governments failed to give that assurance. know (that some persons are always on the watch for an opportunity to acquire land along the route of a projected railway for speculative purposes. No one can find fault with them for that, but it is our duty to see that the public interests are not sacrificed to the private interests of any syndicate. in accord with the 'suggestion of the honourable member that, in this instance, steps should be taken to see that the interests of the public are conserved. The construction of this railway will be a very great undertaking, involving many important considerations that are not now before us. The whole question of the management of railways by the Commonwealth, and the setting up of a new Commonwealth ment is involved. 'i.dertakings the States are protected by the fact that they have control of the land. In New So'.tth Wales we not only reserve land from alienation, but we have introduced, the betterment principle in connection with rail wav construction. tralia there is a land tax which may operate with a somewhat similar effect, but the ComMr Spence. monwealth Government would have no such protection, if it were to undertake the construction of a railway. It is, therefore, desirable, when the construction of the line is not yet before us, that we should look ahead to what our position would be if we should agree eventually to undertake it. I hold the opinion that the States chiefly concerned should undertake the construction of the line, unless some move is made to The honourable members for bring all the railway systems under the control of the Commonwealth Government. It would not do, I think, to have divided control of railways; because the construction of branch lines following the general development of the country would involve They would be able very difficult problems. I have always believed that the Commonwealth Government should have control of all the railways, and I have no fear that if that were the case we should be able to overcome all these difficulties. I have no doubt that the people of Western Australia would be in a position to undertake the survey, and perhaps the construction of the line, but we have to recognise the fact that South Australia is not a rich State, and we are, therefore, jusline will be reserved from tified in offering the comparatively small If this were done, we should sum which, would be required to carry out a survey of the line. ber think that the sum proposed will cover the whole cost?

A very large for New England, area of the country is comparatively flat, and is not covered with scrub to any great extent, so that the cost of survey should not be very great.

If the States Governments are prepared to give the assurance to which I have referred, I see no objection to the measure. honourable members will forgive me', if I make a few observations on this question, about which I frankly admit that I feel very strongly. We were told during a previous debate that a distinct bargain had been made in connection with this particular matter. I have seen no official confirmation of any such bargain. Although some of the people of Western Australia may have been induced to vote for the Federal Constitution Bill on grounds other than the provisions contained in it. and for reasons other than were put forward in the rest of the States, this House is not bound by the arguments used there by the advocates of the Bill. But if we pass the measure now before us, we shall be committed to the construction of the proposed railway, probably at no distant date. It may be that its construction will be postponed, because of an unfavorable report, but, in agreeing to the survey, we are committing ourselves to a first step towards the construction of the line, which we shall not be able to retrace. tion for considering the proposal at the present juncture is that it will provide a means of defence. leged advantages to be obtained by a quicker carriage of mails should weigh with us at all. But, even so far as defence is concerned, I feel that there are many other ways in which the money could be more advantageously expended. The two States most concerned are South Australia and Western Australia. We have had very strong representations of the opinion of the the proposal, but the opinion of the people of South Australia has not been nearly so strongly expressed here. railway. I have no doubt wish to see the railway to the Northern Territory constructed first. which I have read, and the speeches which I have heard in this Chamber, the representatives of South Australia are not keen about this proposal. members have spoken against it? for Barker said there was no immediate hurry and no great desire for the line in South Australia. member will not deny that the honourable member for Barker was lukewarm in regard to the proposal. construction of the line. representatives of South Australia are hostile to the construction of the line; but they are not keen about it. able member says now; but he conveyed the impression at first that they are hostile.

The opinion was then expressed that one of the first considerations should be economy, and, if honourable members cast their memories back still further, they will remember that we agreed without demur to a proposition that we should go before the electors at the same time as the members of the Senate, in order to save the cost of a second election.

The honourable member for Newcastle made a most valuable suggestion, and I am glad that the Minister of Home Affairs has already intimated that it is the intention of the Government to adopt it. I desire to make another suggestion. I hope that if it is decided to construct the railway, proand that fact seems to me at least to justify vision will be made for the adoption of the method which has proved so beneficial in Victoria, namely, the butty-gang system. We have had a number of light railways constructed in Victoria honourable member that we are not now dealing with the question of construction, but of survey. sult of the survey, the Government will take means to provide, not only against the exploitation of the lands along the line of route, but also that the construction shall be carried out under Government supervision upon the system which has proved so successful in Victoria. suffered severely as the result of the enorshould twit the right honourable member for mous profits which have been wrung, from nearly all the States by contractors from that nowadays. further large sums will not be thrown away in that direction. will be inserted in this Bill providing for the reservation of the lands upon each side of the proposed railway.

He affirms that he has obtained sufficient information' to warrant him in deciding against a survey of the route of the now being urged against the Transcontiprojected railway. Where he has derived that information I cannot even conjecture. At first I was disposed to think that there was no justification for a survey of the line, but the more I looked into the matter were sufficient grounds to warrant it being undertaken. I have read reports which state that there are millions of acres of the line. I have perused the report of the right honourable member for Swan upon the country to the south, and I have also snidied the accounts furnished by Mr Muir and others. According to these authorities there are millions of acres of grassy land along the probable route of the line, further investigation. As I stated on a previous occasion, unless the country between Port Augusta and Kalgoorlie possesses better possibilities than at first sight present themselves, I shall not vote for the-construction of the line. My fears are n6t only on account of the character of the land, but also on account of the want of the water. Apparently the representatives of Western Australia think that there will be sufficient justification for fhe construction of the line if the fact be established that good land exists between Port Augusta and the Western Australian border, even though ;here may not be any prospect of a large traffic upon' it. I cannot understand why In the past we have the honourable member for Laanecoorie Swan with talking lightly about the expenditure of millions of pounds. Some men can handle millions sterling better than others can handle pence, and, seeing that the right honourable member has always justified any large expenditure for which he is I hope that a clause responsible, I think that we ought to seriously regard his views upon this question instead of jeering at them. Honourable members have repeatedly jeered at the right that he had expended millions of pounds, whilst acknowledging in the same breath that he had spent those millions well. Verv early in the debate the right honourable member declared that he believed this line would pay, and that he made the statement fully conscious of the fact that he had a reputation to lose.

195,Mr Fowler,"-The objections which areing me that in the early days of Victoria he was able to lead his horse over what are now grassy plains without putting his foot upon a solitary blade of verdure. The fact that there are millions of acres of grassy land, some of it timbered, upon the probable route of the proposed line indicates that there is a .possibility of obtaining water at no very great depth. To my mind, the proposed survey should be one of an exploratory character, and especially so in regard to the supply of water. I understand that to the north of the Great Australian Bight there is a stretch of limestone country where water can be obtained only at a very great depth, if at all. That is the chief difficulty which has to be confronted. A thorough search should be made for water, as the survey progresses. for Swan says that he can conserve water along tlie route. from certain catchment areas, but I have grave doubt about it, because I understand that it soaks away very rapidly. As the survey proceeds, I am of opinion that efforts should be made to obtain water by sinking. The country to be traversed is of limestone formation, and is not likely to prove rich in minerals. I am heartily in sympathy with the idea that the land upon each side.of the line for a reasonable distance should be reserved. honourable member be prepared to take in a private syndicate formed for the purpose of consttucting this line? thing to do with the construction, of railways. The honourable member for Corangamite said that a century hence, when population has been settled upon the country which the line will traverse, it will be time enough to undertake its construction. To my mind, that is not the way to develop our resources. If he had visited America he would know that the railways there are pushed out from the various centres, and that settlement follows. Under the landgrant system there, it. is customary to give those persons who undertake the construction of railways every alternate block, It is idle to say to the people, "" Go out into the interior and live there as best you can for some years, and then we will construct a railway."" Tbat is not exhibiting an enterprising spirit. country which the proposed line would traverse proves to be of good quality, and if water can be found along the route, we shall have some justification for constructing it. That is my reason for voting for the second reading of this measure. If the survey does not disclose that the land is worth opening up, and likely to be able to support a population, I shall not be disposed to go any further. is favorable, is the honourable member prepared to vote for the construction of the railway immediately? water is available, and if the country proves to be of good quality, I shall be prepared to support the construction of the line within a reasonable period. Under such circumstances, I shall be obliged to take into consideration the fact that there is a large gold-field at Kalgoorlie, and that the competition by sea cannot be so keen as it otherwise would be, because goods intended -for that centre have first to be transported to Perth, and then forwarded by rail for a distance of 400 miles east. There is, first of all, the gold-fields population, which is likely to be employed for the next fifty years in opening up those fields, and if in addition to that fact the report of the survey party shows that there is. good country to be developed and that a water supply is available, I shall feel justified, but not otherwise, in voting for the line. The report might show that there is good grazing or agricultural country along the line of route, but unless it also sets forth that water could be obtained at a reasonable depth to aid in developing the country I should not vote for the construction of the railway. no provision for testing the water supply. Minister of Home Affairsi f provision will be made in that direction. It has been suggested that the mineral resources of the country should receive attention, but while that is undoubtedly a very important matter, it is still more important that the water supply should be tested. If the land itself were ever so suitable for grazing or agricultural purposes, it would be valueless without a proper water supply. tent does the honourable member suggest that tests should be made?

I do not know whether the Minister has any faith in the divining rod, but from some information which I have received lately I am inclined to attach some importance to its use. Some of my friends have employed it with very successful results. In any event, steps should be taken to test the water supply, either by putting down bores, or in some other effective way. I certainly intend to support the proposal outlined by the honourable and learned member for Parkes. ' We should have some indication from the Governments of Western Australia and South Australia that they are prepared to reserve the land along both sides of the line. If the land is fit to be opened up by a railway, it is only reasonable that the Commonwealth should re1 ceive some benefit from it. against the introduction of this measure solely for the reason that I considered it premature, and I am afraid that I shall have to vote against the Bill itself, even though it be amended as suggested. The time is hardly ripe for the making of a survey,'but no one can say that it would be premature, at this stage,, to give effect to thesuggestion, made by the honourable and learned member, for Parkes, that, the land along both sides of the proposed route should be reserved. That is a most necessary and .reasonable precaution to take. The sooner tbe possibility that this land may berequired is provided for the better it will be. We have already adopted a somewhat similar course in , dealing with the lands required for the purposes of the Federal Capital, by providing, in the Property for Public Purposes Acquisition Act, that land acquired by the Commonwealth shall be assessed at its value on. the ist January preceding the date of acquisition. In these circumstances, I think it would be .well to provide in this Bill for the reservastruction of the line if the survey shows tion of the land on both sides of the line. viding for the construction of the line would be the proper one in which to make such a provision. honourable gentleman. I hold that it should be inserted in the measure now before us. We made provision for the valuation of the land to be acquired for the purposes of the Federal Capital before we had actually 1 decided upon the site of the capital, and I think that we may well provide in this Bill for the reservation of the land along the route of the projected railway. I shall sup1 port the honourable member for New England in any proposal he may make in that direction, believing that in doing so I shall assist in improving the Bill, and that the time is opportune to take such action. think that the House owes a debt of. gratitude to the honourable and learned member for Parkes for the splendid suggestion that steps should be taken to secure the reservation of the land along the projected route, because the taxpayers of the Commonwealth will have to pay for the construction of the railway. The cost will fall, not upon any one member of the community, but upon the whole of the people of the States. Great corporations often secure millions of acres of land on both, sides of lines of railways, and, locking it up for centuries, prevent settlement along them. If a private corporation were to obtain a. grant of land on each side of this projected railway, the country would probably not be populated for a hundred years. The land would be locked up, just as is the case along some of the railways, in the United States of America.. I . should oppose the selling of the land,, but if the suggestion ma'de by thei honourable and learned member for Parkes were acted upon, the Commonwealth would be able, by selling the land, to recoup itself in respect of the cost of carrying out the survey, and constructing the.

Such a provision would enable Tasmania to get back the money which is taken from the people of that State for the. purposes of this railway. What interest have the people of King Island, or of Tasmania generally, in this railway? Of course, when we raise the question of sentiment, or point to the necessity for military protection against outside aggression, Tasmania is interested. I do not desire to take up much time in discussing this matter, but merely to put myself right in the eyes of the public. The Bill should provide that private corporations and private "" land sharks "" and other "" boom boosters,"" should not be allowed to tie up land, and then demand immense compensation from the Commonwealth before the line can be constructed. very pleased to hear the good sound socialistic views expressed by the honourable and is of opinion that a certain area of territory on each side of this proposed railway ought to be held by the State.

On that coppei-field many hundreds of thousands of tons of ore may be seen on the surface. Of course it is of low grade, but we all know that low-grade copper pays, so long as there is cheap means of transit. I have gone over the whole of the country up to the border of Western Australia, and much of it is splendid pastoral country. Unfortunately, it has experienced droughts, but then all Australia suffers periodically from droughts. When the seasons are good, as they now are, very large sums of money are spent in that country, and very large returns are received. I am perfectly satisfied that, so far as the South Australian portion is concerned, this railway would yield a handsome return. The honourable member for Laanecoorie said that the honourable member for Darling stated that the country to be traversed is a desert. Possibly, some persons believe that it is a desert. In South Australia, we have a large tract of country over which its representatives pass every week. For many years this country has been called a waterless desert, but it has been pioyed to be capable of growing almost anything. I am quite satisfied that a great proportion of the counstruct a railway through this country. try which is believed to be desert in the two States, along the proposed route of this line, will be found to be, if not agricultural country, at any rate good pastoral countiy, and undoubtedly good mineral country. From the fact that he is supporting the proposal for a survey, I should take it that the honourable member for Darling does not. hold the opinion which has been attributed to him. It has been said that the land is not known. I.t is a remarkable fact that some time ago a private syndicate was prepared to build this line on the land grant system. It would be pretty careful to ascertain the nature of the country in which it proposed to invest the enormous sum lequired to build such a railway. There is no philanthropy about a syndicate, and the members of this syndicate were quite satisfied that they were going to have a very good thing on. finite commercial offer ? as is done in connection with other schemes. is it not in evidence? gleaned by the survey party, not only as to minerals, but also as to the water, and as to whether it can be obtained without expensive boring. I feel sure that the survey party would consider that to be part of .their duty, and as all that is now asked for is tbe expenditure of Â£20,000 to see whether there Cis any justification for building a railway which would be of advantage to the Commonwealth without being an unnecessarily heavy burden on the taxpayers, the proposal shall have n:y heartv support. listened with considerable interest to the last speaker* The facts which he brought forward are rather convincing to me against the construction of the line. Knowing, as I do, the enterprise of the people of South Australia in undertaking the construction of the Port Darwin railway for a distance of 1,000 miles or more at their own expense, and learning from the honourable member about the wonderful mineral resources of the western part of that State, and the large area of agricultural land which is there available for settlement, it does seem to me a remarkable thing that they will not consmall population, with a heavy burden. member puts that forward as the reason. But, in reply, let me say that the people of South Australia will not allow the line to be constructed at the present time, even by the Commonwealth. able member know that? South Australia are opposed to its construction. We know that there is sufficient evidence that the Government of the State has not given its assent to the survey of a route through its territory, and is opposed to the construction of a railway. 3 pects, of a line 400 miles long were bright, from my knowledge of South Australia, which is much longer, I think, than that of the last speaker, and my personal knowledge of the men at the head of affairs, having been reared with them, I submit that to its construction at the expense of the Commonwealth.",31,Thomson Tha T Matter For A Moment To Denounce I T Will Be The

Sir WILLIAM LYNE (Hume) -The matter now under discussion is one which should be considered quite apart from any party spirit. The question of constructing a railway to connect Western Australia with the eastern States has been under discussion for many years-prio r to the time that Fremantle superseded Albany as the first port of call for the English mail steamers. Many years ago I succeeded in persuading the Parliament of New South Wales to pass resolutions in favour of extending a railway from Cobar to Wilcannia and BrokenH ill , and I gave as one of the reasons for advocating the construction of the line that it would probably form portion of a line which would be carried right through to Western Australia. I have seen no reason to change the opinion I then held. have since taken place in connection with Federation have strengthened my belief that a line such as that now projected should be constructed. number of persons, especially in Victoria and South Australia, are opposed to the construction of the li;:e, but I cannot conceive upon what grounds. shall unhesitatingly vote in favour of what I believe to be a great national work. has been said that the prospective traffic would not warrant the construction of such a railway. That might be said in nine cases cut of ten ; but as the country becomes opened up, and large centres of population are connected by rail, the traffic increases, until ultimately, in most cases, the revenue returns become satisfactory. In many places traffic cannot be developed unless a railwayis constructed Sir honourable member quote a case similar to that now under consideration? ceptional case. If it were not so, I should not advocate the construction of the railway as a national work. If it were proposed merely for the development of any one StateI should throw the responsibility of its construction upon the persons directly interested. which took place at the Federal Convention with regard to 'bringing Western AusI f what tralia into the Federation, and I have no hesitation in saying that it was fully anticipated, and practically concurred in, that the proposed railway connection should be made. particular time the great object in view was to induce Western Australia to join the Federal union, and there can be no thorough union between that State and her eastern sisters -until railway communication is established. tralia had insisted upon the construction of the railway being agreed to, there is no doubt that would have been conceded ? Sir WILLIAM LYNE I have not the slightest doubt that if a resolution had been submitted committing the Commonwealth to the construction of the railway it would have been carried. I have very little doubt that the proposed railway will pay, because many of the passengers arriving here from Great Britain and other parts of the world in the steamers which make Fremantle In fact, the developments which their first port of call would doubtless be glad to avail themselves of the opportunity to save two or three days by making the overland journey from Fremantlei across I know that a large to Sydney or Brisbane, or other parts of the eastern States. In the same way, passengers leaving Australia for London could also effect a great saving of time by makI ing the overland journey from Melbourne or Sydney-perhap s to a greater extent It from Sydney than from Melbourne-and I ' fully believe that a large percentage would join the steamer at Fremantle, instead of going round by sea. gained in connection with Adelaide does not justify that impression. Sir' WILLIAM LYNE -Adelaid e does not bear quite the same relation to the other States as Fremantle would if the propcsed railway were constructed. One matthe question of the cost of maintaining the railway is the saving in time that would be effected by the carriage of the English mails overland from Fremantle to the eastern States. If two or three days could be saved in that way the public convenience would be promoted, and the desire of the community for the speediest possible means of communication between Australia.

Sir WILLIA M LYNE -That shows that they recognise the point which I have in mind. This, after all, is a small matter, so far as the future of the railway is concerned. Western Australia, but the eastern States. If the line be constructed, it will doubtless we should object to a trial lead to a large quantity of produce grown in Eastern Australia being sold along the route right through to Kalgoorlie. A wonderful development has taken place in Western Australia, and we have to look I to still greater developments. I do not know so much about the agricultural reThe proper sources of the country. Doubtless they will be materially developed, but a great expansion in the mineral resources of that State will certainly take place. Another Kalgoorlie may not be discovered, but I have no doubt that rich belts of mineral country will be opened up. The construction of this railway would lead to the discovery and development of mineral tracts of country as yet unknown, and, in any event, every additional sovereign produced in any of the States must tend to the benefit of the whole Commonwealth. For these reasons I desire to emphasize my opinion that the Bill should not be trammelled in any way, but that it should be passed, as practically one step towards carrying out the moral undertaking entered into with the people of Western Australia before that State became part and parcel of the Commonwealth. think that the question before us requires very serious consideration. The Bill makes absolutely no provision whatever for that examination of the country which many honourable members supporting the proposed survey believe to be necessary. It provides solely for an engineering survey. The terms of the Bill, so far as my reading of it goes, would absolutely prevent the expenditure of any moneys under it in securing reports on the resources of the country to be traversed, or in making tests to determine whether a water supply is available. If the engineering survey proves that which I take it is the object of the Bill-that a railway can be constructed between the given points-w e shall still be in exactly But the Federal Government the same position as we occupy to-day, so far as our knowledge of the nature of the country and the possibilities of a permanent water supply is concerned.

The Federal. Government has almost reached the expenditure limit of 25 per cent, and if we embark on works of the character now under consideration we shall find the Government compelled to resort to direct taxation, because, very fortunately for some of the States, 75 per cent, of the Customs revenue must be returned for a few years longer. Unless we are prepared to face this question, and provide a sufficient sum to enable us to obtain all information, and then, if that informa-. ti'on is satisfactory, to proceed with the construction of the railway, we ought not to pass this Bill. If we do pass the measure, we should tell the people of Australia that we are doing so in good faith; and if the survey report is satisfactory, it is the bounden duty of the Government to give effect to the hcision of the House. I do not believe there is an honourable member who is deliberately attempting to fool the people of Western Australia, and if that be so, the work ought to be proceeded with in the event of a satisfactory report. That must be the result, unless we are deliberately passing this Bill merely to afford the people of Western Australia a barren satisfaction. Is the Federal Government, or the Parliament, or the States prepared to undertake at the present time, or even in a short time, an expenditure of ^Â£5,000,000 ot ;Â£6,000,000? I am one of those who believe that we are not prepared for that expenditure, and, in that belief, I shall have to vote against the Bill. Buti f the Bill be passed we should insert a provision such as has. been suggested by the honourable member for New England and the honourable and learned member for Parkes, to provide that there shall be at least some chance of the Commonwealth obtaining a return for the money expended. I was absent for. some little time this morning, attending a fruit conference, but I heard two or three honourable members from Western Australia say that they were prepared, and that they believed the people and Governmentof Western Australia were prepared, to make a land reservation along the line of railway, to be handed over to the Commonwealth. the Commonwealth, but to be preserved against speculation. of ""Thank you for nothing."" I understand that South Australia was prepared a little time ago to make a land grant to a private syndicate if it would construct a railway. If it is a fair thing for the State to hand over the land to a private company and that is what we object to. construct the railway and keep the land. to make use of that provision to prevent a survey from taking place? is a great deal in what the honourable member has said. I ' believe that the Government and the Parliament of South Australia are not particularly anxious for this railway to be constructed'. It is very deeply to be regretted that such is the case. panies which are against its construction. They control the Government to-day. that the people of South Australia will very soon take the matter into their own hands, and see that these monopolies are broken down. Buti f that State were as honest and anxious as Western Australia in this matter, I believe that it could be arranged by those States without reference to the Federal Parliament. ThatI think would be the infinitely preferable way.

I do not wish to look at this proposal too much from a State point of view. But I would invite honourable members to remember that the two States which have the smallest populations, and whose public revenues are somewhat seriously embarrassed are Queensland and Tasmania. neither of those States can possibly hope to obtain the slightest advantage from the construction of this railway. a good present every year. from Western Australia. 1 to be led into a discussion of the merits or demerits of the different States, nor shaU I attempt to pit one State.against another.

Holding, as I do first, that this project more directly concerns Western Australia and South Australia, and that, therefore, before the Commonwealth is asked to incur any expenditure, they should furnish that information which we are now asked to obtain; secondly, that the Bill is of such a character, that, if passed, it would not enable the Government to get such information as the House would be satisfied with, before it could authorize the construction of the railway; and, thirdly, which is a more important consideration with me, that the finances of two States are in such a condition that the passing of this vote might ultimately have the effect of imposing direct taxation upon their people, I shall have to oppose the motion. Buti f the 912 second reading be carried I shall assist those least some provision by which the Commonwealth would be able to get .back a direct return for the outlay which it is asked to incur. honourable members, particularly the right honourable member for Swan, have expressed some surprise at the fact that the people of South Australia do not seem to be wildly enthusiastic about this proposal. The reason has been supplied by the honourable member for Hunie, who has pointed out as one of the' chief advantages of the railway that passengers could' run .straight across from Kalgoorlie to Sydney without -going near Adelaide and Melbourne. he meant that. What he meant was that they could run up to Broken Hill, and proceed thence vid Wilcannia and Cobar to Sydney. to get across from Port Augusta to New South Wales? gusta to Broken Hill, as the honourable membe'r knows, there is a railway; 'and a connection from Broken Hill to Cobar could easily be made by New South Wales, so between Perth and Sydney. be between Adelaide and Perth. able member for Hume said that one stipulation upon which his vote for the construction of this railway would depend would be that its gauge should be 4ft. 8Â£in., as in New South Wales. The gauge is 3ft. 6in. from Port Augusta to Terowie and from Terowie to Cockburn, 5ft. 3m. from Terowie to Adelaide and from Adelaide to Melbourne, and 4ft. 8Jin. from Cobar to Sydney. The honourable member has indicated that his anxiety is to make Kalgoorlie, as it were, a suburb of Sydney. I do not mean to suggest that he deliberately advocates that a gauge of 4ft. 8Jin. should be adopted for this connecting link, with a view to preventing any traffic from going down from Adelaide to Melbourne. half inches is the world's standard gauge. orable member forgets that Victoria, South Australia, and Western Australia have not a single mile of railway of that gauge.",41,Langdon Bonython Coul D The Ter Which Has An Important Bearing Upon

On the part of those who think twenty-five miles on each side of the line this line advisable and a proper underas a condition precedent to the proposed taking far the Commonwealth, it is a great expenditure. mistake to put forward that kind of argument, and to lay down conditions which proposal is, but I have not yet grasped must necessarily arouse antagonism in its advantages.

This country is well worth developing, .and whether the Commonwealth undertake the construction of this railway or not, I feel sure that the Tarcoola district will, before many years are past, justify the State in the construction of a line.

Probably drought had something to do with the desertion of the country, and the low price of wool coming after the drought, followed by the inroads of the rabbits, would also be factors. A very large amount of development took place as the result of men going there with plenty of money. But not much money has been made on the Gawler Range country. However, it would not be traversed if the line took a more northerly route, in which case it would pass through a much better pastoral district,' the runholders there having managed to maintain their footing, and in some cases to do exceedingly well, even in very ba'd seasons. While I believe that the survey of the proposed route is justifiable, and shall therefore vote for the Bill, I do not pledge myself to vote for the construction of the proposed railway until I ' have seen the reports of the surveyors. vi.ry handsome majority which was obtained for the motion for the appropriation of money for fhe purposes of this Bill was very much appreciated by the people of Western Australia, who, as I have remarked before in this Chamber, have long felt that hitherto they have not reaped any of the practical and tangible benefits from Federation which the other States have received, although they have borne their share of the cost. They regard the vote to which I refer as an assurance that their claim that this great work should be at least considered is recognised. Although we understand that some of those who voted for the resolution, and will vote for this Bill, do not pledge themselves to vote for the construction of the proposed railway, we are sanguine that when the survey and accompanying explorations are made, we shall have such a tale to tell that the opposition to the proposal will not be greater than the present opposition to the Bill. I wish to express my gratification that only three members of the Labour Party voted against the motion, though it was in no sense a party question. I should like now to deal with one or two objections which have been raised to this proposal. honourable"" member for Franklin has complained that Western. Australia has not done all that she should have done in preparing reports on the scheme. He thinks that she should have gone to the length of making the survey, a suggestion with which I shall deal later on. As for ordinary information, the Government of the State has done all that a Government could do to obtain it, and to place it before the House, and I regret that the speeches of some honourable 1 members indicate that they have not made that study of the reports which have been furnished to them which they might reasonably have been expected to make. Had they done so, we should not have heard some of the statements which have been made in regard to the absence of water and the nature of the country to be traversed. I sympathize as much as any one does with the Governments of those States which are in financial difficulties. Both Tasmania and Queensland are struggling with a shortage of funds, and are straining every nerve to make up deficiencies. But they are not alone. Western Australia has to face similar difficulties. We may be in a better position to meet our obligations; but it must be remembered that we have a falling revenue, and that the special means of revenue which we now enjoy under the Constitution will shortly come to an end. Those who referred to the poverty of their own States as a reason for not voting for the proposed survey must therefore remember that Western Australia is also being called upon to use extra efforts to make both ends meet. 1 It seemed to me that the honourable member for Laanecoorie took a very narrow view of this question. His attitude reminded me of the struggles which have taken place in our States Legislatures in regard to railway proposals. Frequently proposals for the construction of railways, which had everything to recommend them, have been shelved for a long time, owing to the predominance of local considerations. I am afraid that a similar spirit has been introduced into this debate, because the honourable member for Laanecoorie and others have made the question one of State against State. Victoria owes much of its prosperity to its railways. The settlement of the country, and the development of its resources have been possible only because enterprising public men in years gone by built railways to places which were then uninhabited. Therefore, those who urge The 'hat we should wait for population to extend along the route of the proposed railway before entering upon its construction, ignore all the lessons of our past experience. The railway would help to develop the country, and those honourable members",44,Langdon Bonython Coul D The Ter Which Has An Important Bearing Upon

With reference to the proposal for the reservation of land along the line of route, I am glad that the honourable and learned member for Parkes has advanced so far along the line of democratic legislation as to advocate the principle of the nationalization of land. refreshing to his constituents, and to the democrats of Australia generally, to find the honourable and learned member, who is so notoriously conservative, adopting such an attitude. exactly what he means. that the Commonwealth should construct the line only upon what would practically amount to the land grant system, I join issue with him at once. that before even the survey is entered upon the States of Western Australia and South Australia shall hand over a certain portion of their territory to :the Commonwealth, he is raising an entirely new consideration. If , on fhe other hand, he desires merely to prevent private land speculators from deriving the advantage of the increased value given to the land by the construction of the railwav, I am perfectly in accord with him. I am quite sure that that was all the honourable member for New England intended. prevent private speculators from doing as they have done so often, namely, securing the land along the line of the proposed railway, and simply waiting for the State to spend its money in order that their profits might be secured. We are willing that that should be done, but we do not think that the States should be treated as if they were private speculators. If it be held that some return should be made by the States which derive the greatest benefit from the construction of the line, I would point out that Western Australia has already proved her sincerity, and has shown herself willing to make every effort in her power to recoup any loss that may accrue. she has spent thousands of pounds in sending qut exploration parties, and boring parties, and in preparing reports for the use of honourable members. made an offer to South Australia that she will make good any loss that that State may incur for ten years after the construction of the line. the total loss. addition to her own share. She has shown, also that she is prepared to deal in a liberal spirit in respect to any loss that' the Commonwealth itself may suffer. In view of these Three distinct offers, I think I can. claim that Western Australia is It will be at least prepared to pay for her portion of the unearned increment. If honourable members want to put the screw on, and to insist upon our handing a large slice of our territory over to the Commonwealth, I think I desire, however, to know they are going too ' far. If the consent If he proposes of Western Australia to join the Federal Union had been given subject to the condition that the railway should be constructed, there would have been no objecI f he insists tion to such a provision as that now suggested. The same principle that was applied to New South Wales in connection with the granting of territory for the purposes of the Federal Capital Site, might reasonably have operated in regard to the construction of the proposed railway, if that had been in the bond. But I contend that it is unfair to insist upon taking from usa slice of our territory, in consideration of the construction of a railway to which we contend we are unconditionally entitled. The railway itself is naturally a Federal He wished to work. If the capitals of the other States had not been connected by rail-if , for instance, Sydney and Brisbane had not been so connected--the strongest representations would have been made, and rightly so, by honourable members from New South Wales and Queensland for the construction of the necessary line by the Commonwealth. State would not assist the other. doubt that in such a case one State would assist the other. I regard the connection of the States capitals by rail as a matter of Federal importance, and in the exceptional circumstances of Western Australia and South Australia, we have a right to ask that the project now before us shall be regarded, not from a State point of view, but as a work Of a national character, which, when constructed, will benefit the whole of Australia Then she has It is my misfortune that I cannot view this question in that broad, Federal spirit which seems to animate some honourable",45,Langdon Bonython Coul D The Ter Which Has An Important Bearing Upon

The line would pass through territory which, so far as we know, is a desert. If the country had been any good, it. would have been taken up by capitalists long ago. Some honourable members have referred to the probabilities of obtaining abundant supplies of artesian water, whilst others have expressed the belief that valuable mineral deposits will be brought to light. If the country is mineralized, however, no artesian water will be struck, because artesian water is obtained only in country of cretaceous formation, which never occurs in known, ever since Queensland joined the Commonwealth she has suffered a very considerable loss of revenue, and I object to that State making any contribution towards the cost of a survey of the proposed line.

I know that my constituents share my views upon this question. I would further point out that if this line is ever built it will not pay for axle grease. Reference has been made to the gold-fields.

I do not think that we have any right to vote any sum of money for railways until the States' railways have been taken over by the Commonwealth. ported this proposal up to the present stage, tic on the subject as was the honourable member for. Eden-Monaro a few minutes ago. The Bill before us leads us into new avenues, and we ought to consider very caref u l ly before we commit ourselves. In the first place, the States have not seen fit to hand over the control of the railways to the Federal Parliament. If the administration of the railways had been one of the transferred functions, the proposal before us would have merited very earnest consideration. At present, however, we are prac'tically asked to initiate a work which JOHN FORREST -What about dethe States primarily interested do not seem disposed to undertake. No doubt this is a very large project, and its magnitude may be one reason why the StatesI have indicated are not disposed to further it . But I cannot think that the construction of such a railway will bring about the great development which the honourable member for Eden Monaro would lead us to suppose. If thai were so, this project would invite almost immediate State action. I have supported this proposal hitherto, and I shall give it my vote to-day, because I recognise that the people of Western Australia received, in effect, a promise that something in this direction would be done as an inducement to them to enter into the Federal compact. mises from many of the leaders of. the Federal movement. and while there is no provision in the Constitution like that, for instance, relating to the Federal Capital, I am prepared, as far as I can, to honour the understanding then arrived a't. One reason why I think we ought to consider a vote of this kind is that it affects two State's-that it is not wholly confined to one State. True, the project affects one State more than another, but neither Western Australia nor South Australia can advance without the assistance and co-operation of the other. It seems to me that by making this exploratory survey we may induce! those two States to undertake the actual work of construction. If , after we pass this Bill to-day, we are called upon to consider the propriety of expending money on the actual construction, a new issue will be raised, which I must then consider. I wish to say, however, that in voting for the proposal before us, I do not feel that I am pledging myself or my State to the carrying out of this particular work.

The honourable member for Bass said that there was nothing in the Constitution engaging the Commonwealth to construct such a railway; and with that we must all agree. been demonstrated to the satisfaction of the majority of honourable members that when, during the discussion of the ConstituAct of Parliament a rigid provision which tion, the other States decidedthat Western Australia, owing to that isolation, would not, and could not, in her own interests, enter the Union,, the 'people of that Statu were induced, by certain promises, if not oi the removal of that isolation, at least, of an inquiry into the practicability of its removal, to come to a decision which rather surprised the people of the eastern States. Mi. MAHON -The promises went much further fhan that. is the very smallest claim, and it can be well supported by evidence. the leading men connected with the Federal movement. such promises in the reports of the Convention debates. wish to enter into that question at this time. I can only say that that is the conclusion I have come to, and it is the conclusion which must be come to by any one who looks into the matter carefully. tion is where one would expect to find some reference to this matter. cause it was not a matter which it was proposed to provide for in the Constitution. vided for in the Constitution. tain proposals which have been made, and which I fear may prove hampering proposals, T am perfet-.tlv at one with thosr honourable members who wish to preserve to the Commonwealthand to the States the increment in value which will be given to lands along this railway line if it is ever constructed. But by endeavouring to put such a'condition Into this Bill, those honourable members are practically giving into the hands of South Australiaa State, the Government of which have been of late First, I think the discussion has more or less antagonistic to the proposed construction of this line-wha t ought to be retained in the hands of the Commonwealth. That, I think, is not desirable. .1 quite agree that it is desirable, in the negotiations which must take place with the Governments of those two States, the Commonwealth Government should sefe But I think it has that satisfactory arrangements are madebefore the survey is proceeded with. But I do not think that we should put in arÂ» might not be capable of being adhered to by the States concerned, and which omitted a great many other things equally important which ought to form part of the negotiations prior to any survey being made. That is my opinion on that matter, and I hope that it will receive from honourable members their consideration. Several suggestions, and very proper ones, have been made by the honourable member for Newcastle and the honourable member for Grampians, as re-, gards testing the country for minerals, for pastoral purposes, and for water supplyThese, of course, should receive consideration. I do not see that that can be done out of this survey vote. It must be a matter for united action by the States, in whose interests settlement would take place on the lands, mining enterprises would be developed, and-apar t from the supply of water for railway purposesa discovery of water would be made. The proposed vote is not sufficient to enable the Commonwealth, to undertake these inquiries. But I think that when an expedition for one purpose was crossing the territory, the States concerned might arrange for united action in those other directions. I do not. think I have any more to say, except to refer to the statement by the honourable member for Franklin, that he would be perfectly willing that a survey should be made by the State of Western. Australia, and that a decision should be come to on that report. We have had several reports from that source. I think that any report ought to be such as would command respect fromthis Parliament, not merely as regards the capacity of its compiler, but also as regards the unbiased position of those who superintended the work",50,Langdon Bonython Coul D The Ter Which Has An Important Bearing Upon

441,Mr Dugald Thomson,"As to cerof the survey. For these reasons, especially for the very important reason that I think Western Australia has a claim to satisfaction, so far as an inquiry goes, I support the proposal. I recognise that there will be a great many questions to be faced after a survey is made. We shall have to consider all the information which the report may contain, and, further^ to face the very important financial consideration, not merely whether the line shall be constructed, but whether it shall be constructed immediately, or at a later period. But as regards gathering information and seeking to satisfy the people of Western Australia that we are determined not to keep them isolated, but to carry out what they were led to expect before Federation-a n inquiry to see if we can remove the isolationI think that the Bill should receive from every honourable member favorable consideration.
