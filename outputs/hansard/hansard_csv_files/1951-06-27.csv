On the last occasion I raised the matter, I directed the attention of the Prime Minister to a report to the effect that a ship had arrived in Melbourne with timber whioh had caused the quarantine officers so much concern that they threatened that, if they cbuld not destroy the pest by fumigation, they would order the cargo to be dumped. Will the Prime Minister inform me when T may expect the reply which he undertook to give to my question: Does he realize that the post constitutes a danger to th* houses which the Government is importing at great expense ? Is he aware of tha experience in New Zealand, where tha pest has infested the pine forests, and is causing grave concern, and does he. realize that it may cause similar concern in Australia ? Is the report ready which he promised to obtain fox me, and is the Government really taking the matter",8,Setup

In the ordinary course, the answer to his earlier question would have been availahle to-day; but when it came beforo me last evening, I thought that, perhaps, it should be made a little more complete in one particular. I think that I can undertake that he will receive the answer to-morrow. ter inform me whether he has any information that indicates whether the HanlonLabour Government in Queensland is to make up its own mind in response to bi> request for a transfer of power by th -> States to enable the.

Ha« the Prime Minister any similar information about the decision of the McGirr Labour Government in New South Wales? aware, no official indication has yet come from either the Government of Now South Wales or the Government of Queensland about its attitude towards the proposed reference of power by the States to the Commonwealth. What the honourable member has said about the procedure which he assumes will be followed Tefers, of course, to a procedure which has not been unknown in the past and which, I dare say, will he followed again in the future. representing the Minister for Shipping ber has asked whether the terms of and Transport aware that, as the reference of the inquiry will include 'result of the hold-up of shipping such matters as loading equipment, port at ""Port Adelaide some weeks ago, facilities and other subjects which aro certain "" overseas shipowners decided obviously related to the use of shipping to omit the port from their schedules until in Australia.

In the circumstances, will the honourable gentleman take action to ensure that full publicity is given to this fact so that merchants and other persons in South Australia who wish to import goods may not be penalized any more than is absolutely necessary? member knows, the Minister for Shipping and Transport is a citizen of Adelaide and he is giving very special attention to this matter. I shall inform the honourable gentleman later of the Minister's views on the subject. : tion to the Prime Minister, I point out that, in common with other representatives of Tasmania in this Parliament, 1 welcome the prospective visit to Australia of an overseas shipping expert. question of the honourable gentleman welcoming anybody, as he ought to know.

I have no doubt that, in order to make a complete survey, the expert would like to visit most, if not all, of the ports of Australia and he will be encouraged to do so. In reply to the final question, I am not prepared at this stage to enter into any preliminary financial commitment in respect of any recommendation that may arise from the inquiry. Mr Freeth having asked a question of the Minister for External Affairs, standing order which provides that any question in relation to the character or the conduct of any person outside the House must be asked upon notice. OIL for Supply confirm the reports that have been circulated to the effect that the refinery at Glen Davis will be transferred to Bell Bay in Tasmania and used in conjunction with the aluminium project there? decided that the distillation plant at Glen Davis shall be transferred to Bell Bay and operated there by the Government, in conjunction with .the aluminium project. Some of the details of the transfer have yet to be decided. As a result of the transfer, we shall he able to produce 16,000,000 or 17,000,000 gallons of petrol a year by refining crude oil in the plant. The present production of petrol at Glen Davis is approximately 2,750,000 gallons a year. We shall be able to produce petrol in Tasmania at approximately 2s. a gallon instead of 4s. a gallon, which is the present cost of production at Glen Davis. The residual gases will be used by the aluminium project, thereby saving a great deal of coal and reducing the cost of aluminium ingots. Aluminium cannot he manufactured without petroleum coke. The only source of supply of petroleum coke in Australia is the Glen Davis distillation plant. N'o petroleum coke is at present available to us from anywhere else in the world. When the plant has been transferred to Bell Bay, petroleum coke for the aluminium project will be available on the spot and we shall be able to sav; approximately £37,000 a year in respect of freight charges on such coke.

Social Services whether he will give consideration to relieving the plight of people living in country areas who, because they suffer from mental disorders, voluntarily enter, institutions for the treatment siderable thought to the matter that the of mental diseases in order to obtain shock honourable member has raised, and departor specialist treatment? At present, the social services benefits that are normally payable to such people cease while they are receiving treatment. Country people have no facilities available for treatment in their home towns and are required to enter institutions in the cities, to the financial distress of their dependants. of the unfortunate people who are. dealt with by my department the most grievous are probably those of the mentally afflicted. Under existing procedure these people enter State institutions and the Australian Government provides for their support. For obvious reasons, it is not desirable that the Government should continue to pay them money after they have entered an institution. Some of them are able to handle a certain amount of money themselves and their ability to do so is considered in all individual cases. The Government also pays for their transport and any other incidental expenses that may he incurred on the journey to and from the hospital. I shall consider the matter that the honourable member has raised and ascertain whether the Government can do any more for these people than it is doing now. very considerable shortage of labour in the. Australian community? Does he know that many age pensioners endeavour to augment their incomes by engaging in casual work according to their strength and ability? Has his attention been drawn to the fact that the practice adopted by his department of penalizing those who earn more than a certain amount of money has tended to create an economic waste by preventing such people from working? Is he yet able to say whether consideration has been given to the proposal that I put forward that, provided applicants for age pensions are eligible to receive the benefit, they shall not be penalized so long as the present shortage of labour in the community exists if they earn additional income in excess of a specified amount? mental omcers are now working intensively on a review of all aspects of social services benefits with a view to rectifying all the anomalies that have become apparent, including the specific anomaly that the honourable member has mentioned. I am hopeful that before the year ends provision will be made to utilize the labour pool to which he has referred. to the numerous statements that the Minister for Social Services and his colleagues have made with respect to the means test since the Government assumed office, is he able to say whether he intends to evolve a plan to enable the Parliament to abolish that test or to liberalize the conditions of its application?

Minister for Commerce and Agriculture been drawn to the following statement which appeared in the monthly summary of Australian conditions which was issued hy the National Bank of Australasia during June:During the season now ending a process of widespread re-adjustment has been taking place throughout rural industry in response to the sharp u p l if t in wool prices. This has led to a withholding of sheep from slaughter, to the turning over of dairying and agricultural lands are being obtained from, to sheep grazing and, by increasing the demand for table poultry, has even"" affected egg supplies. In view of fhe manner in which the disruption of primary production occasioned by the present wool prices has accentuated the butter shortage and led to fantastic prices being charged for lamb and other meat, does the Minister intend to adhere to his party's policy of refraining from interfering with private enterprise by the imposition of controls; or does he propose to take action to offset the effect of the high price of wool upon the supply and price of meat, butter, eggs and other necessaries? If so, what action does he propose to take ? report from which the honourable member has quoted, but I could agree that substantially, it describes a trend that has evidenced itself in Australian agriculture during the last year, the cause of which is also, to a very measurable degree, as stated in the report, the relative'attractiveness of wool-growing in comparison with other primary industries. The Government is concerned about this matter to which it is devoting its attention. However, the Government might be helped if the honourable member would expose his own thinking on the matter.

What was the total amount of the interim distribution of Joint Organization profits made by the Chifley Government in 1949 ? tion obviously should be placed on the notice-paper. Ihe honourable member for Hume that the day before the general election in 1949, the Chifley Government distributed £25,000,000 to wool-growers. The estimated profits that remain amount to approximately £60,000,000. The Government has announced that it intends to distribute in full to wool-growers who have left the industry their share of those profits. I stated in the House last week that the policy to be pursued in the distribution of the balance of the profits will be considered by the Government at a comparatively early date. A decision wil] then be announced. tion to the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture I inform him by way of explanation that primary producers in my division are seriously concerned about the lack of supplies of sulphate of copper which is used, among other purposes, to combat mildew in the vine-growing industry. Can the Minister state whether there is any likelihood of an improvement of supplies of that commodity, and whether improved supplies may soon be available? ment are aware of the problem presented to certain rural industries, including agricultural, horticultural and live-stock industries, by the current shortage of sulphate of copper. The whole of thc available supplies of that material in Australia are being directed for use in our primary industries. Government officials in various parts of the world are engaged in trying to procure supplies of sulphate of copper, in the sterling area if possible but, failing that, in the dollar area. There is a world-wide shortage of the comimodity at present, but the principal Australian producing company, Electrolytic Refining and Smelting Company of Australia Limited, at Port Kembla, has understand, will probably result in the Australian demand being entirely supplied from that quarter by the end of this year. In the meantime, the Government will take every possible step to make good the deficiency by imports. THE PARLIAMENT.

The distinction is, that if the member is ejected from the proceedings under Standing Order 303 the matter can be reviewed by the Speaker, as was done in this House last year. If he is ejected from the House by naming, that action cannot be reviewed by either the Speaker or by the House, because a decision of the House, except after some delay, can only be reviewed upon seven days' notice. I assure the honourable member from my vast, varied and unrivalled experience of these things, that that is the position. Speaker, whether it is a fact that Standing Order 303 is patterned on a certain standing order of the United Kingdom House of Commons, which was introduced as the result of an incident in which a member of the House of Commons threatened the Speaker with violence?

General say whether there have been any recent discussions between the Australian Government and the United Kingdom Government regarding the restoration of special conditions for the handling of food parcels to a basis similar to that previously in existence? Is the honourable gentleman aware that there are many people in Australia who are desirous of sending food parcels to Great Britain, but find that the present postage rates are too high and that delivery is unfund made available for their own purcertain and slow? If no such consideration is contemplated in the near future, could the matter be taken up with the United Kingdom Government to ascertain whether a scheme similar to the original one could be introduced.' taking place with either the United Kingdom Government or the postal authorities about this matter, because such action is scarcely necessary. At present about 1,000,000 food parcels a year are being sent* to Great Britain from Australia, at a cost of about 5s. 7d. for a parcel weighing up to 11 lb. An 11 lb. parcel sent from the United. Kingdom to Australia would cost not less than 12s. 6d. in postal charges. Therefore, it will be seen that a very substantial concession is being made by our own postal authorities. For delivery of these parcels we utilize every ship and every means of conveyance available to us, and I am informedthat leliveries are as prompt as the means at our disposal permit. to the attention of the Treasurer that the special frozen funds of private trading hanks lodged with the Commonwealtli Bank reached the phenomenal figure of £586,000,000 at the end of last May, and that this constituted a new record? This during the ten weeks ended the 30th May, a total increase of £124,000,000 during the last year and £197,000,000 during the last two years. In view of this situation, why has home-building finance been restricted by the Commonwealth Bank and the private banks? Could not some of this money be made availahle for home building purposes? Why is there any necessity for the hardening of interest rates as indicated by the reports of the Loan Council meeting? utilization of any of the money in the special accounts set up by the Banking Act 1945, or regulations under it, would defeat the object for which those -accounts were set up. I know that representations have been made that building societies and such bodies should have part of that noses.

At least it will have the effect that the same individuals will not be able to travel abroad for a similar purpose again unless they are able to do so without the proper documents.

Minister) -by leave-Sinc e 1950 we have, as a member nation of the United Nations, been represented in Korea not only by air and naval forces, but also by the Third Royal Australian Regiment. Its record has been, and is, magnificent. It has earned the highest praise. It has done much hard fighting, and has sustained substantial. casualties. By those most competent to form a judgment, its morale is reported to be high. Indeed, the final proof of morale and efficiency comes in this morning's news that this fine battalion has received the special presidential, citation, the highest honour which the United States of America can confer on any military formation. Commencing from a date about two months full establishment. The strength of indiago, a section of the Australian press has vidual sub-units' has been reduced at given great publicity to allegations by times, during and immediately after one or two press correspondents, the battle. That is always the case with burden of which is that the battalion has forces in action. Owing to congestion on heen neglected; that there has been in the lines of communication, there have adequate leave; that repeatedly wounded men have been returned to duty; that reinforcements have been inadequate or unsuitable; and so on. One newspaper went so far as to say that, unless relieved immediately, "" the Australian battalion in Korea. . . will become a battle fatigued unit of tired and neurotic men "". The Minister for the Army( Mr Francis) has, from time to time, on the best experi advice available from both Korea and Japan and here in Australia, answeredthese criticisms. In view, however, of the deep anxiety which must have been caused to relatives by the controversy, I . myself decided to peruse the complaints and all the reports received in respect of them, and I then decided to make a statement to the House. The first thing that I want to say is that the Government has confidence in the skill, experience and soldierly qualities of General Robertson, the commanding officer of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force, and Colonel Ferguson, who has heen commanding the regiment so ably in the field. One of the first duties and desires of each, in his respective sphere, is to see to the proper treatment of his men. That there will be some grievances is inevitable. It would be surprising if there were not. But that either the general or the colonel should be either indifferent or incompetent is unthinkable to anybody who knows their respective records. My own golden rule on these matters is quite simple. It can be stated as follows:"" Support the man who shoulders the responsibilities until you have reason to suppose that he is unfit to carry them. If you have such reason, remove him. But, in the name of common sense, do not undermine him by creating or allowing to be created the impression that, while you will not remove him, you will not support him either."" In the light of these conditions, let me put on record certain facts, which will. I hope, speak for themselves. The battalion has not always fought at",21,Passports

91,Mr Menzies (Kooyong,"Primebeen, inevitable delays in getting reinforcements forward from the base in Korea or from Japan. Honourable members will appreciate that such delays were inevitable when they compare the size of our force with that of the total force that is supplied by the lines of communications. In addition, reinforcements cannot be accepted by and properly absorbed into a unit during the progress of a battle. Bnt the battalion has consistently fought at a very much higher strength than did any unit of the Australian Military Forces in previous wars over a similar period. The Commander-in-Chief, British Commonwealth Occupation Force, has examined the daily strength returns of all United Nations forces in Korea and has reported that no other battalion in the whole force bas been as consistently maintained at such a high strength, in proportion to its establishment, over a period of eight months. He has stated also that General MacArthur, shortly before his departure, commented upon the consistently high -strength of the battalion. A very large pool of reinforcements had been established in Japan before the Australian battalion moved to Korea. On the 10th April, Brigadier King, the second-in-command of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force, informed a conference of general officers in Melbourne that at that time there were on hand and in sight adequate reinforcements to meet requirements at intense rates for two months and at normal rates for seven and a half months. there was abnormally heavy wastage, running beyond what might be called intense rates, during April, especially in the battle that took place on ANZAC Day. That wastage amounted to 171 from all causes, including 99 battle casualties. This abnormally high wastage led for the first time to a situation in which the number of fit reinforcements immediately available was barely sufficient to maintain the battalion at its maximum establishment. However, corrective action had already been taken, and 40 reinforcements had been ordered forward by air from Australia during April. After hearing of the heavy wastage in April and the large number of reinforcements in Japan who were temporarily unfit, a further 160 reinforcements were ordered forward by air from Australia on the 2nd May. Mr Menzies. Their movement began on the -15th May and was completed by the end of the month. Therefore, there were, throughout the course 'of some of the fiercest criticism, more than enough reinforcements in Japan to meet even an intense rate of casualties. The flow will be continued at a high rate. It has been asked whether the troops are properly trained. Lieutenant General Robertson has informed us that he knows of no basis for allegations that reinforcements have arrived in Korea without having received adequate training. All troops, before they are even eligible for selection for service in Korea, must have had at least three months basic training in a recruit unit in Australia. This applies also to tradesmen destined for duty in their special capacities with pioneer units. In any event, honourable members will agree that badly trained troops could not have performed as the Australian troops in Korea have done in the most difficult circumstances. The quota of leave for the battalion has always been the same as for other components of the United Nations forces, which is five days in Japan as and when the operational and transport situation permits. It is hoped that this will work out in future at approximately one leave period every four months. There is little doubt that thousands of Australians who fought in World WarI . and World War II . will be able to quote examples of long service without leave which However, far exceed in severity the examples from Korea. It is not always possible to send unlimited numbers of men on leave when the unit is required in the forward area, nor can unlimited numbers of reinforcements be absorbed in replacement of men who are away for only five days at a time. Such a course of action might well lead not only to heavier casualties but also to the temporary destruction or impairment of the fighting prowess of the unit. It is incorrect to say that leave arrangements for the Australian forces have been restricted because of insufficient reinforcements, although they have at times been restricted by operations and by transport shortage. No unit in Korea has been allotted a greater proportion of leave than has the Australian battalion. In the middle of May, the total number of men who had been in Korea without leave for not less than six months was 320 out of an establishment of 978. The Commanderin-Chief, British Commonwealth Occupation Force, compared these figures with those of American units and found them much the same. The Government is, however, so reluctant to expose Australian troops to the rigours ef two successive Korean winters that it has decided that no man who fought in Korea during the major portion of last winter w ill be required to fight there next winter, unless he expressly elects to do so. If , at the end of eight months' service in Korea, a man has completed at least two years overseas, he w ill be eligible for return to Australia. If , on completion of eight months in Korea, he has not served overseas for two years, he w ill be given not less than thro'* weeks' leave in Japan. A f t e r this leave, he w ill return to Koreaf o r not more than four months, at the end of which time he w ill be eligible for return either to Japan or Australia. In other words no man w ill be asked to serve for more than twelve months in Koreai n a total of two years before returning to Australia; and any man who completes two years abroad during his first eight months in Korea w ill return to Australia at the end of that eight months. This relief scheme, together w i th the very generous leave arrangements already in force, w ill require the enlistment of yet another 600 volunteers in Australia on a short-service, two-year basis. A while ago Brigadier T. C. Eastick, of South Australia, was sent to Korea as an independent investigator by the federal executive of the Returned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia. On the 23rd May, the executive issued the following statement :The Federal Executive, after hearing the report of Mr Eastick on his recent visit to Korea, is satisfied that in all leave centres excellent facilities were available, and there was an abundance of amenities. On 20th April, when Mr Eastick left Japan, adequate reinforcements to the 3rd Battalion weTe available in Japan to cope with all ordinary contingencies. From the report, the Executive is quite satisfied that no other Array has been so well looked after. There is no shortage of arms, equipment, clothing, or rations. Until through which our troops have passed. Each the ANZAC Day push, good leave arrangements commanding officer assured me that patients to Japan were operating, and the FedeT.il Executive has sufficient faith in tlie Commanderin-Chief to feel that adequate arrangements would continue to be made. The Governnient decided last October that members of the Korean force would not be liable to tax on their mili tary pay, and the Commissioner of Taxation has since authorized the anticipation of necessary legislation to give effect thereto. District allowances in Australia have been referred to in the course of some criticisms. Army personnel living in isolated areas such as Darwin, Woomera, & c , receive district allowance in addition to pay to compensate for difficult conditions of life in those places. Meni n Korea do not get district allowances but get concessions in other directions, including deferred pay. gratuity pay, taxation concessions and the like that more than compensate them. The Government has declared as its policy that, on discharge, repatriation and post-war benefits should, as a general rule, be not less favorable for men with Korean service than for . those serving in the 1939-45 war. The Treasury Finance Committee, which consists of the permanent heads of the three Service departments and the Treasury, is now reviewing the whole range of these conditions and will shortly make a recommendation to Cabinet through the Treasurer. The matter has also been taken up by the Ministerf or Repatriation (Senator Cooper). Finally, I am now in a position to give the House some details of a report that was presented to me only a few hours ago by Major-General Norris, the Director General of Medical Services and a man of great experience in war, who returned from Korea and Japan early this week. Major-General Norris has been informed by the resident medical officer of No. 3 Battalion of the Royal Australian Regiment that all casualties have been cleared from the battle areas even under the most difficult operational conditions. No man, he was told, was returned to the unit unless a medical officer considered him fit to do so. In other words, only class A men were drafted for action. Major General Norris's report continuesI have visited every hospital in Korea returned to units were medically examined and declared f it to do so. From unit records, nine men have been returned to the battalion after being wounded twice. One of these remained on duty with the first wound. There is no record of any man being wounded more than twice and returning to tiie unit. Major-General Norris told me in conversation that a qualification was required to that statement. He believed that there was a record of one man who was wounded three times but whose first wound was so superficial 'that he did not cease duty. Therefore, for all substantial purposes, what I have just stated is correct. The report continues.1 visited all the Australian patients available in the various medical units in Korea. In my opinion all were adequately cared for. J. heard no complaints. I am convinced that no discrimination is made in the care aud attention given to the United Nations casualties. In respect to tlie medical facilities the foree is truly a United Nations one. The general t h e n gave some p a r t i c u l a r s in order to in d i c a te t h e q u a l it y of the medica l service w h i c h is equally a v a i l able to A m e r i c a n , A u s t r a l i a n , U n it e d K in g d o m , and other troops. He reported as f o l l o w s : The efficiency of the medical service may be assessed from the following results: Approximately 500 men were evacuated beyond the unit because of wounds received in action, accidental wounds, or injuries. Of these, nine died subsequently. evacuated beyond the unit because of sickness. Of these, together with many times this number of minor ailments, one only died subsequently. Of those 950 evacuated beyond unit lines, approximately 350 were treated in Korea and returned to the battalion within three weeks. In a country where smallpox is prevalent, not one case has appeared among the Australian troops. From the information presented to me, this is a unique record among the components of the United Nations forces. N'o case of malarial infection contacted in Korea has appeared among any of the Australian troops. These results in such a difficult and diseased country as Korea are beyond any previous achievement on any action service. During service in Korea the battalion has not been constantly engaged in action with the enemy. On many occasions the unit has been in reserve. During operational periods involving long and difficult movements delays had inevitably occurred in certain supplies, but never, apparently, in ammunition or rations. In an emergency, clothing, including boots, would be flown right into the most forward area. I was informed that Australian troops were given priority over American units in the issue of winter clothing. So good has been clothing Mr Mensien. among Australian troops have been practically non-existent. The general continuedThe statements published in the press concerning amenities appear quite unjustified. The present leave conditions, some of whioh are available to the Australian troops, are keenly appreciated by the battalion. The general then mentioned the leave centre in Tokyo which I myself inspected last year. He saidA t the leave centre in Tokyo, "" which I inspected, facilities are available for an initial hot bath, an issue of clean or new clothing, bar, reading, personal hygiene, conducted sight seeing and shopping tours, bathing pool, pictures and medical attention. In association with the B.C.O.F. general hospital the recuperation and convalescent centre at M i a Jima is beautif u l l y sited and equipped with fishing, sailing and other recreational facilities. It would be surprising if , at the conclusion of the successful operations in which this battalion has been engaged there were not some signs of fatigue.. In addition, always, in any battle area, certain personnel new to such experience become disillusioned and dismayed. However the actual incidence of evacuation because of "" war neurosis "" was remarkably low. The commanding officer assured me that at no time bad he been embarrassed by any shortage of men available under his command and on the ground. The battalion strength submitted to me were far in advance of what we had generally experienced in the last war. This is war. ""War is a grim business. Even now, apparently, many do not Approximately 450 men were realize the gravity of our obligations in Korea. I am sure that our troops in Korea will continue to represent us in the post of danger in a manner worthy of our highest traditions. It is our duty to give them all the support, material or -moral, within our power. I believe that there is not an honourable member in this House who has not appreciated the manner in which the report concerning Australian forces in Korea has been presented. I daresay that no honourable member would believe that criticism of administration in relation to the small Australian force in Korea had heen actuated hy party political considerations. A lot of blame might be attached to politicians, but I do not think it can be said that they would make political capital of a matter of this kind. Although the report is extensive, it does not deal with the main issues as conthe issue of winter cisely and factually as one might have exthat cases of serious frost bite pected it to deal with them. After hearing",22,Korea
92,Mr Haylen (Parkes),"by leavethis report, one would conclude that the war in Korea was being conducted in the best possible manner and that every phase -of operations that had been investigated liad been found to be in perfect order. I imagine that the usual 64-dollar tour was made of these areas. The complaints that have been made coucerning the treatment of Australian forces in Korea have been well substantiated, have been long -standing and have often been repeated. The Minister for the Army( Mr Francis) undeavoured to lull honourable members into a false sense of security when he stated, in February, that conditions relating to Australian forces in Korea were satisfactory. During the recess certain facts became known. Criticisms came, not only from honourable members on this side of the House but also from honourable members who support the Government, particularly the honourable member for Henty( Mr Gullett) and the honourable member for Macarthur ( Mr Jeff Bate). Those honourable members voiced their concern over events in Korea and complained that they could obtain ho statement of any significance from the Minister for the Army. Conditions went from had to worse. Are honourable members to assume that half a dozen war correspondents who are dedicated to their duty sent these stories out of pure malice? After repeated challenges had heen made to the Minister to state that the stories were incorrect, their accuracy was denied. If the Prime Minister contends that the reports of the war correspondents were incorrect, action should he taken against those correspondents. ""What would induce a junior officer to break accepted standards of military conduct by making the statement that such an officer has made? Not lesire for publicity, but his feelings conto be really genuine. It contained too forning the urgent need of his comrades. He complained that men who had been wounded .had heen returned to the lines several times. Lieutenant McDermott, of Bondi, said that wounded men had been returned to the lines on five occasions. ber quoting McDermott? the name given in the newspaper. able gentleman will vouch for the accuracy of what he is saying. do not want to know the accuracy of what he said so much as what was said in rebuttal hy the Minister for the Army, who, at last, finding himself in a hopeless muddle, asked the Prime Minister to get him out of it. I do not think that any of these questions have been fully and validly answered. The Prime Minister will agree that a long statement about amenities and hospitals, while reading well, does not get back to the real issue, which is the complaint that men had to go back into the line after being wounded. On two occasions, the Prime Minister said, did he not able member should not ask questions. two occasions wounded men went back into the line, hecause the Prime Minister said so, if I followed his statement correctly.

In my view, the statement itself was too long many "" ifs "" and "" buts"" and excuses, and was in effect a whitewashing of the Minister who is responsible, in the first place, for not being straightforward enough to tell the House that something was wrong. We do not blame the Minister for what happened in Korea, because, as the Prime Minister said, much may ""happen in the stress of war. But let us I think that that was be frank. The Minister was not frank. We had the series of stories about the Australian Battalion in Korea being neglected and about wounded men being sent back into the line, which was",25,Korea

The final point I make is that asking groups of people in the Returned Servicemen's League or any other organization to go on a tour and bring back a conclusion might or might not be valuable to the Government, but it would not be in the best interests of the services generally. Invariably reports obtained in that way coincide so much with what the Government wants that one even begins to suspect them. This matter is above any party political line. If we agree that the Prime Minister should make a statement on the matter then surely I am entitled to say that sections of that statement look very much like whitewashing. Some of his conclusions are most unfortunate and there is still a case to answer about what happened between the time at which these reports were made and the time when the "" brass "" got down to dressing the matter up for the Prime Minister. Finally, if the reports of senior representative pressmen were wrong, what is the Prime Minister going to do. about it? proposedThat Government business shall take precedence over general business tomorrow.

That very important motion deals with soil erosion. I put it to the Vice-President of the Executive Council( Mr Eric J. Harrison) that the private member's day which normally will be on Thursday of next week be not interfered with,' because that day will possibly provide the only opportunity for the discussion of private members' business that will occur during the remainder of the sessional period. Further, I ask the Minister, who made certain intimations to my deputy, the honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell) r who is away to-day owing to illness, to make some re-arrangement of the business, in view of the lengthy statement that the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) made to-day, which was not contemplated by my colleague, and also in view of the facts that my colleague agreed that the second reading debate on the Post and Telegraph Rates Bill 1951 should proceed to-morrow. -Vice-President of the Executive Council and Minister for Defence Production) [3.51] -in replyI assure the Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt) that I am a great believer in giving private members an opportunity to express themselves. Therefore, I shall do all that I can to see that his si _ jestion shall be observed.

108,Mr Anthony (Richmond,"Postcertain Postal Department charges were adjusted by the Chifley Government in July, 1949, and by the present Government in December, 1950, for the purpose of bringing them more into line with progressively increasing costs. These were the only adjustments that had been made since 1941, and they represented an overall increase of 35 per cent, in Postal Department tariffs over a period of ten years. I ask honourable members to bear this percentage in mind in connection with the facts that I now propose to place before them. When I presented the 1950 bill, I pointed out that despite the increases dealt with in the bill, a heavy deficit for. the current financial year was inevitable, but that the Government had decided to approach the matter on an interim basis and to review it again in the light of actual results and the precise effect of the revised tariffs. I also informed honourable members that a further statement would be made to the Parliament after the effect of the basic wage judgment on departmental expenditure had become known. As was forecast, there will be a heavy deficit in the commercial accounts of the Postal Department for this financial year. The estimated loss is of the order of £5,000,000, and if the present tariffs are continued the deficit for 1951-52 will be much greater. In fact, allowing for further likely increases of the costs of labour, materials, freight and mail conveyance, it could very w.ell.exceed £12,000,000. These figures are impressive and reflect the serious position which faces the Postal Department in its endeavours to achieve financial stability. They are not astonishing, however, when account is taken of the tremendous additional costs which the department has had to meet because of factors completely outside its control. Let us consider wages, for example. The basic wage judgment which operated from December last, and cost-of-living adjustments made since November, have increased the department's annual wages bill by about £8,000,000, whilst consequential rises of the prices of materials, freights and incidental items have added at least £2,500,000 to its yearly working expenses. It is probable that expenditure Postal Department costs is the purchase, for 1951-52 will he increased by"" somefrom abroad of large quantities of thing like £4,000,000 as a result of furmaterials which were normally obtained ther rises of wages and costs of materials which may occur during the next twelve months. Even an increase of the weekly wage by ls. costs the department approximately £200,000 a year in direct wages, apart from the effect on materials. In examining Postal Department finances, it is useful to look back over the last ten years and to compare the low level of costs then and now. During this period, the costs of every item of equipment used by the Postal Department have increased very greatly. Here are some typical examples: Automatic exchange equipment has increased in price by 114 per cent.; underground cable has gone up by 200 per cent.; and trunk aerial wire has increased by 200 per cent. The cost of telephone instruments has increased by 174 per cent.; that of postmen's uniforms hy 114 per cent.; that of letter receivers by 238 per cent.; and that of paper for the telephone directories by 300 per cent. The newspaper industry wiU appreciate that, item. Concurrently, wage rates have more than doubled. For instance, a postal officer whose maximum salary was £266 in 1941 now receives £572. A telephonist's salary has risen from a maximum of £205 to £463, a telegraphist's from £328 to £698, and a lineman's from £290 to £602. The increase of annual wage rates does not reflect fully the department's added labour costs, which have been greatly inflated by the 40-hour week. As I informed the House last year, the 40-hour week not only led to an immediate direct increase of £1,000,000 in the Postal Department's yearly wages bill, but it also made a heavy rise of overtime inevitable if the service to the public was to be maintained. In 1946-47, expenditure on overtime was £317,000, but this year it will exceed £2,000,000. The 40hour week has also caused a marked rise of the costs of materials, freights and other items, and has contributed very substantially to the basic wage increase and to cost-of-living adjustments, which represent such major factors in Postal Department expenditure. Another important reason for increased at lower rates from Australian sources. Such purchases have been made partly to give effect to the Government's direction that Commonwealth departments shall secure stocks of scarce materials from overseas rather than compete on the local market, and hecause in some instances it has not heen possible to procure needed supplies from local manufacturers. It will beclear, from these facts,that costs of labour and materials have increased by substantially more than 100 per cent.. during the last ten years. I recognize that the position that faces the department is not unique, and is in no way different from that which has confronted every business undertaking, both private find public, in all countries since the end of thc war. I need not emphasize that it is .clearly impossible for an undertaking to pay its way with a rise of charges, representing 35 per cent, over a period of ten years, which is so much below the increase of the costs of giving service. Although the new tariffs proposed represent a substantial increase of the present rates in some eases, I point out to honourable members that the overall effect of the 1949, 1950 and present adjustments will be to increase the department's tariffs by a little less than 75 per cent. I think honourable members will agree, Mr Speaker, that in thc light of all the evidence of unavoidable extra costs, the proposal to raise the charges again is by no means astonishing. The fact that the department expects to pay its way in 1951-52 with a general level of tariffs less than '75 per cent, above eliminating any factors that may be likely those operating ten years ago, shows that the efforts of the administration to operate the postal and telecommunication services as economically as possible in the face of heavy and inescapable increases of labour and material costs have not heen unsuccessful. Naturally; before deciding upon any rate increases I gave very close attention to the matter of whether some of the higher costs could he met hy economic within the department. I have examined the matter of the staff employed in relation to the volume of business, because stuff represents a large item in the overall expenditure. I have found that throughout every section of the department continuous attention is given to the relation Mr Anthony. of staff to work volume and that in all activities, wherever it is practicable to apply scientific principles for the evaluation of work loads and the determination of staff required, this is being done. It is possible to estimate on an hourly basis the number of telegrams that a telegraphist can despatch, the number of pounds of mail that a postman can deliver or a sorter can handle and the number of calls that a telephonist can put through That aspect has been investigated exhaustively and exact computations have been made. It will be of interest to honorahle members to know that in a. very large section of the service the work load actually discharged hy telephonists, telegraphists and other large groups of employees of the Postal Department has remained unchanged for many years and that the present output still compares favourably vvith that of years ago. In fairness to the department's, employees, who number thousands, I again emphasize that fact. From time to time loose statements are made alleging lack of interest on the part of employees in their work, but, as the result of investigations that I have made, I am satisfied that the vast majority of , the employees of the department are rendering excellent service. I recognize, however, that in a large organization such as the Postal Department, improvements are always possible, and I assure honorahle memhers that special measures have been taken and are being continued with the object of improving efficiency and of to give rise to unnecessary costs. Although these measures are being pursued with vigour by well-equipped omcers, there is no prospect of any economies or improvements that arise being sufficient to reduce appreciably the wide margin between earnings and expenditure. Another alternative which might be suggested as a means of bridging the gap between expenditure and revenue would be to curtail drastically postal, telephone and telegraph services. Such a step must he considered in the light of the tremendous increase that has taken place in the demands for service of every type which it is the department's obligation to provide. On the average, usage of each of these services has increased by approximately 30 per cent, during the last ten years. I think that honourable members who are constantly being approached for the provision of new and improved facilities in their electorates w ill agree that any curtailment of services to the public would give rise to grave difficulties and would not be in the best interests of the community, having regard to the vital importance of the communication services in the daily l if e of every individual. Such a curtailment would necessitate the dismissal of thousands of specially trained men whose job it is to cater for the postal, telephone, telegraph and broadcasting needs, and wonld undoubtedly also lead to serious loss of revenue. I should not entertain moment. I am satisfied that the solution does not lie in the direction of a serious curtailment of essential services or in reducing the activities of this great public utility to a level at which it would he entirely inadequate to meet the reasonable demands of users in cities and throughout country areas. In view of what I have said, the conclusion that the Government has reached, namely, that the charges for postal, telephone and telegraph services should, be adjusted to meet the increased costs of the services, is the only one possible in the circumstances. The proposals for higher tariffs have heen developed with regard to costs of providing, operating and maintaining services, the importance of continuing to furnish relatively cheap facilities to rural areas to stimulate the spread of population, and the necessity to maintain and develop effective communication services to meet theneeds of our growing population and expanding industries. The bill now before the House provides for the following revision of rates, which, with the consent of honourable members. I shall incorporate in Hansard:Letters: The existing rate of 3d. for the first ounce will be increased to 3id. The charge for each additional ounce will remain at 2|d. Lettercards: The existing charge of 3d. will be increased to 3id. Postcards: The existing charge of 2 id. will be increased to 3d. Commercial papers, patterns, samples and merchandise: The existing rate of 2d. for the first 2 oz. will be increased to 3d. and the charge of l i d . for each additional 2 oz. will lie increased to 2d. 5 0 7 Printed matter (including printed papers, circulars, catalogues, and books and publications not registered for transmission as newspapers or periodicals) : The existing rate of 2d. for the first 4 oz. will be increased to 3d. and the present charge of l i d . for each additional 4 oz. will be increased to 2d. Registered newspapers, periodicals and books not posted in bulk: The existing rate of l i d . for the first 6 oz. will be increased to 2id. and the present chargo of l i d . for each additional 6 oz. will be increased to 2d. Registered newspapers, periodicals and other publications posted in bulk: The existing rate of 2id. for Hi oz. will be increased to 2*3. for 8 oz. Hansard: The existing rate of l i d . for 12 oz. will be increased to 2d. Telegrams: The base rate for ordinary telethat proposition for one grams will be increased from ls. 9d. to 2s. 3d. where the offices are not more than fifteen miles apart and from 2s. to 2s. 6d. in other cases. The new base rate will apply to telegrams of twelve words instead of fourteen words as at present. The charge for each additional word will be raised from l i d . to 2d. Press telegrams: Interstate press telegrams will he charged one-half the rate applicable to ordinary telegrams. Intra-state press telegrams and those relating to proceedings of the Commonwealth Parliament will be charged one-quarter of the rate for ordinary telegrams. Lettergrams: The base rate of ls. Od. for 30 words will be increased to 2s. for 24words. The charge for each additional word will be raised from i d . to Id. The new rate for letters represents a rise of 40 per cent, on the rate which applied ten years ago. In the light of costs, which have more than doubled during the same period, the increased charge is reasonable. The higher rates for commercial papers, printed papers and registered publications not posted in bulk are made necessary by the greatly increased costs of dealing w it h these articles. Postal administrations throughout the world are faced with financial problems in regard to the handling and conveyance of non-letter type mail. We have been reliably informed that the United States Post Office, for instance, is losing about 400,000,000 dollars yearly on these classes of mail matter. We are losing substantially on the carriage of such matter. A f a i r l y marked increase is proposed of the existing bulk rate for publications registered for transmission as newspapers and. periodicals. The present charge represents a very substantial concession, particularly to the smaller journals, and is utilized extensively hy metropolitan and country newspapers, publishers of periodicals, and a large number of non-commercial bodies, including churches, ex-servicemen's associations and organizations of employers and employees. When I investigated this aspect, I was interested to find that no less than 12,000,000 religious periodicals and approximately 11,000,000 trade union publications are handled annually on' a bulk rate basis and that this service is used extensively by many commercial organizations. About 160,000,000 articles are posted annually in bulk and the numbei is growing rapidly. Of those articles only approximately 25,000,000 are daily newspapers. The extent of the existing concession will be apparent when it is realized that on the average the revenue from 1 lb. weight of letters is 7s. at the current rates, whereas the same weight of registered publications posted in bulk returns only 2^d., or 3 per cent, of the amount derived from letters. The cost of handling a newspaper or periodical is greater than that of handling a letter, and it will be obvious that the continuance of the present unusually low charge is not justified. The new rate of 2£d. for S oz. will still involve the department in heavy financial loss in respect of bulk postings, but the Government desires to maintain a concession in order to stimulate and encourage the wide dissemination of news and to prevent thr imposition of hardship on the large and widespread number of people who avail themselves so freely of the special tariff. With regard to telegrams, the present rates are quite inadequate to cover the handling costs, and the higher tariffs proposed in the bill will still be insufficient honourable members are aware, the departto meet these expenses. In dealing with the matter, however, the Government has paid regard to the value of the telegraph service to users and its wide use by the general public. Although the Post and Telegraph Bates Act covers only the main postal and telegraph charges, the very heavy increases of costs have affected all services provided by the Postal Department and it is proposed to adjust other rates suitably by amending the relevant regulations or taking other prescribed executive action. I have already circulated to honourable Mr Anthony. members statements showing the main directions in which it is proposed to amend the charges generally. The overall effect of the proposed increases of postal, telegraph and telephone rates, will he to raise the department's earnings by less than 30 per cent., thus making the accumulative increase during the last ten years less than 75 per cent. The revenue to be derived from the new charges should be sufficient to enable the department to pay its way during 1951-52. We hope to complete the next financial year "" about square "", provided our costs, siich as wages and so forth, do not rise disproportionately. diture to which the Postmaster-General refers include increased capital expenditure? included in this revenue statement. As a matter of interest, I point out that the United States Congress is now considering proposals for a substantial upward revision of postal rates so that the annual loss of the Post Office of more than 500,000,000 dollars may be offset in part by the increased charges. We deal internationally with other countries in respect of air mail, and we are receiving demands from them that we increase our air mail rates for the same reasons that we are compelled to increase the rates that are now under consideration. The plans before the United States Congress include a rise of 100 per cent, in the rates for newspapers and magazines and hulk circulars. Other countries, including the United Kingdom, have recently adjusted their charges. As ment has been engaged for some years past on a comprehensive works programme for the purpose of overtaking the arrears of the war and early post-war years and of meeting the great demand for new services. Although record progress has been made, there is still much to he done to provide waiting applicants with telephone services and to remove congestion on junction routes between exchanges and on the trunk lines. It will be necessary to continue these efforts in order to maintain the services at a reasonable standard of adequacy and efficiency.",27,Second Reading

110,Mr Anthony,"No, that item is notSumming up, I emphasize that the 40-hour week has directly and indirectly added millions of pounds to Postal Department's wages, penalty rates and overtime as well as being a major component in the higher cost of all materials used by the department, and the reduced hours have also necessitated the recruitment of several thousands of additional staff for sections in which the 44-hour week had previously heen worked. But for the increase of the basic wage by f l a week and associated cost-of-living and marginal adjustments, the department would have shown a profit in the commercial profit and loss account for the present financial year, despite an overall rise of only 35 per cent, in charges during the period of ten years to which I have referred. Hadi t not been for the higher costs since November, including the increase of the basic wage by £1 a week and associated charges, this financial year would have been completed with a profit instead of an estimated loss of approximately £5,000,000. Mr E. introduction of the 40-hour week does not relate to the loss of £5,000,000? tariffs that were imposed in November, this financial year would have been completed with a profit, but costs continued to rise. The 40-hour week did not affect this last section. overtook it ? avenue in which economies may be effected will continue to be fully explored. The work of the indoor and outdoor staff is subject to constant and critical review. Procedures have been streamlined, and operations have been mechanized, wherever possible. Any marked curtailment of facilities, for which the public demand is increasing, would not only impose great inconvenience, if not actual hardship, on many sections of the community, but also hamper national development and result in serious loss of revenue. The department is an efficient organization, which has taken and will continue to take all possible action to provide residents in all parts of Australia with reasonably adequate and efficient services. I . hope that I have convinced honourable members on both sides of the House that there is justification for the proposed adjustment of tariffs, and that the reasons for the increases are clear. I have no hesitation in asking honourable members to support the bill. adjourned. Debate resumed from the 26th June (vide page 436), on motion by Sir That the hill be now read a second time. MT. DALY (Grayndler) [4.23] -Prob ably not since the immediate post-war years has a government been faced with the problems that now confront the Menzies Government. It has to grapple with the problems of rising prices and inflation, production and the shortages of essential goods, industrial dislocation and unrest, which in many instances the international situation, and, finally, the defence of Australia in the present troubled state of the world. If il; were not for the fact that most of those problems have been aggravated by the inefficiency of this Government, I should have some sympathy for it. But its record of achievement is barren. It has failed completely, through incompetence, to implement any part of the policy that it placed before the electors Every in 1949. Therefore, it cannot expect, sympathy from the Opposition in its futile efforts to increase the production of essential goods, and to handle other matters of national policy. Until the recent election, the Government sought to excuse its incompetence by claiming that its efforts to give effect to its policy were frustrated by a Labourdominated Senate. Such an excuse can no longer be offered. The Government has a clear mandate to give effect to its policy, and the Opposition in tbe Senate and this House cannot prevent it from doing so. The people and the Opposition rightly expect the Government to give effect to measures, in accordance with its pre-election policy, to bring economic stability to the country, to protect us",31,Second Reading

114,Debate (On Motion By Mr Daly),"against the evils of communism, and, generally, to improve the conditions of our citizens. But having in mind the Government's sorry record, I am not hopeful that the people ""will gain any benefits while it remains in office. Rising prices and inflation form the major problem. I shall give the House an indication of how the upward trend of prices is affecting the people. A report that has been issued by the Oommonwealth Bureau of Census and Statistics discloses that, in 1948-49, while the Commonwealth exercised prices control, the cost of living increased by approximately 9$ per cent, compared with the previous year. When the Commonwealth relinquished prices control, the cost of living increased hy 19.8 per cent, in 1949-50 compared with the figure for .1947-48. I believe that those figures are conservative. On a statistical basis, the cost of living may have increased by iipproximately 20 per cent, in that period of two years, but every citizen knows that the cost of the necessaries of life and other commodities, when they can be obtained, has increased by more than 20 per cent. The Government endeavours to place all the blame for the higher prices on lack of production, resultiug from the activities of the Communist party. Since this Government assumed office, production has not increased. Yet the promise to stimulate production was a major feature of the election manifestos of the Liberal party and the Australian Oountry party in 1949, in their effort to gain the votes of the majority of the people. The Treasurer ( Sir Arthur .Fadden) stated in his policy-speech on that occasionAs every housewife knows, as every farmer knows-in fact, as every Australian knows, the Golden Age (i.e., Chifley Governinent) has been an age of recurring shortages of coal, of power, uf milk, and cream, of potatoes, and matches and butter; an age in which chronic shortages of all the basic materials and equipment necessary to maintain and expand production have crippled our efforts ancl plagued our daily lives. In a later part of the same speech, he said' We (i.e., Liberal and Country parties) have a concrete policy of stabilization primary industries profitable again, reduce their production costs and cheapen their products to the consumer, and provide more of them. Mr Daly. .1. shall now read a list of goods which I selected at random to-day from Sydney newspapers, and which are in short supply iu the metropolitan area of that eity. There is a shortage of milk, and butter is not obtainable unless the citizen buys it on the black-market for 6s. or 7s. per lb., or gets it from uuder the counter from his local grocer. Tea is becoming difficult to buy, sugar is hardly procurable, eggs are in short supply, matches are almost unobtainable, and common salt, potatoes and pepper are not availahle. In addition to those commodities, galvanized iron, steel and building materials are fading from the market in New South Wales in this "" Golden Age"" under a Liberal partyAustralian Country party Government. Honourable members opposite explain that the Communists are responsible for those shortages, because they have dislocated production. Communists influenced the cows not to produce milk? will probably tell us that red cows are responsible for the shortage of butter, arid that the shortage of eggs is attributable to the activities of Rhode Island Reds in the fowl yard. That would be little more fantastic than some of the charges they have made already. WhilstI agree that the activities of Communist agitators in many industries have helped to slow down production, I am not prepared to let the Government use the Communist bogy to cloak its own incompetence. The truth is that the shortages of butter and other primary products have been caused by seasonal difficulties and the Government's complete inability to stabilize rural industries and to offer to the producers sufficient incentive to -stimulate output. I reject the excuse that the controls which were imposed hy the Labour administration in the interests of the people caused blackmarketing and thus failed to keep down prices. Shortages of important commodities to-day are due to the fact that manufacturers and producers have gone on for the strike in many instances in protest which will make them against the returns that they are receiving. They should be condemned for withholding -supplies of their",32,James Harrison S O The Is Caused By Communists And Others

116,Mr Daly,"Government supportersproducts just as strongly as supporters of the Governnient condemn the workers who hold up industry because they consider that their labour is worth more than their employers are prepared to pay for it. The Government is prepared to take repressive and coercive measures against the workers, but it will not do anything about those individuals who are denying essential commodities to the community because they consider that their profits are not large enough with the result that pensioners and otlier citizens on small fixed incomes must pay blackmarket prices from, their meagre resources or go without the goods that they need. The Government is bursting with excuses for its refusal to do anything about rising prices. It claims that inflation has galloped away from it, that production has decreased and that the Communist party is responsible for all our troubles. But the Labour party says that the Government destroyed the only possible effective prices stabilization scheme when it defeated the proposals that were submitted to the people at a referendum and in consequence the power to control prices had to he handed hack to the States. The Government is busy arranging for a referendum on communism, but it is shirking the real issue by refusing to allow the people to express their will in relation to prices control. An effective Commonwealth system of price fixing on the lines of that which was initiated by the Lahour administration, reinforced by a. number of strong economic measures, would provide the only means of restoring stability and preserving the already sadly diminished purchasing power of the Australian £1. In fact, the members and supporters of this Government, who attacked the Chifley Government for maintaining controls that were essential to the puhlic interest, now propose to introduce a bill which, will incorporate almost all the measures for which they condemned that Government. The stable door has been opened by the Menzies-Fadden Government and inflation is galloping away. Our flimsy £1 is fast losing much of its remaining value. Now the Government, the members, of which abandoned the controls that were designed to maintain the value of the £1, is doing a trapeze act and preparing to turn a series of political somersaults. It has realized at last that the controls which the Chifley Government exercised were essential to the maintenance of economic stability. Had the anti-Labour parties not been so eager to abolish controls in order to win votes, in preference to preserving the value of incomes, the' nation would be. in a sound economic position to-day. My criticism of this Government's incompetence is not merely destructive. I realize the complexity of the problems that confront it. .But the baby is there to be nursed hy the Government that conceived it. Hacl the Chifley Government received some co-operation from its opponents in implementing a nation-wide system of prices control, great benefits vvould have been enjoyed by the people of Australia. The Opposition now suggests, as a means of applying a belated remedy, that the Government should accept the advice of various State Premiers and conduct a referendum on the prices issue instead of on other matters. That course of action woulcl provide it with a chance to preserve the meagre, faded value of the Australian £1. The rate at which prices are rising to-day is a real threat to the people of Australia and to the general economic structure of the nation. Something ""must be done to halt the trend, so that people may he able to buy something like a pound's worth of goods for every twenty shillings that they spend. The prices of necessities have spiralled so rapidly that now it is almost impossible for the average wage-earner to obtain his requirements. "" ""When answering a question in his usual vague fashion to-day, the Treasurer indicated that the budget might include provision for substantial increases of sales tax on items which the Government regards as luxury goods. I refer particularly to such articles as radio sets, which to-day are a necessity for the poor man. The present rate of sales tax on radio sets is 25 per cent., but we have been told that, in order to force men and women out of the radio industry, the rate will be increased to 66§per cent. Electric irons, toasters and other household necessities will be similarly taxed. That is how this Government proposes to reduce the prices of essential commodities! It is the strangest economic process of which I have ever heard. The Sydney Morning Herald of the 26th June published an article which included the following dire forecast:We can expect some pretty stiff increases in sales tax on "" Luxury"" goods when the next Federal Budget is introduced. There should be no difficulty in distinguishprosecute some of the individuals whom ing luxury goods from essential goods. The essentials are those you can't get. I have already mentioned many of the essential items. Generally speaking, it is true to say that goods which are needed in the poorest and the wealthiest homes alike in order to enable families to keep body and soul together are the most difficult to obtain. The Opposition does not claim that the problem of rising prices could be solved with ease overnight. But it asserts that the time has come for the Government to honour at least some of the promises that it made to the people on this subject in 1949 and again more recently. has happened to its policy for the taxing of excess profits? parties also contended when the Ohifley Government was in oflice that the size of the Public Service was responsible in some measure for the lack of production. What has happened to that argument? Is it not a fact that, under the present Administration, the number of public servants, all of whom are necessary for all I know, has reached a record level? The Government proposes now to increase taxes. Were we not constantly told by its members and their supporters when they were in Opposition that production was inadequate hecause the Chifley Government had destroyed incentive by taxing individuals, companies and other organizations too heavily? At any rate, the present Government parties assured the electors that.they had a solution of the problem of inflation. All that the Opposition asks is that the Government shall now give an effective answer to its criticism by implementing even some sections of that bold policy, of which it boasted, to increase production and to keep prices down to the absolute minimum. Undoubtedly, the best way to attack the problem of rising prices would be to after the referendum has been conducted accept the Opposition's advice and conbefore it acts against the Communist Mr Daly. duct a referendum on the subject of prices control. Then, with the approval of the people, the Government would be able to go ahead and stabilize the purchasing power of the people. When is the Government going to tackle the problem of communism? When will it take effective action under the law, which is there to he implemented, and it describes as traitors for their subversive activities in industry? The Communists could readily be brought to justice under the existing laws. A Labour Government used the law against them, and this Government should do likewise. It proposes instead to conduct a referendum before it attempts to counter the activities of the Communists. I agree that the proposal is so important that the Government ought to consult the wishes of the people as a whole rather than obtain the * views of the State Governments. ber support the Government's proposal What for a referendum? member for Warringah ( Mr Bland) do about this problem! He has opposed every referendum proposal of any kind that has been submitted to the people for as long as I can remember. He has resisted every campaign to obtain wider powers for the Commonwealth even when he must have known that ultimately such extensions of power would be in the best interests of the people. Where does he stand on this issue? I venture to prophesy that the Liberal party will bring him into line, as it always does when it cracks the whip over its members. The Government's proposals in relation to communism should be referred to the Australian people because the subject is one of the most important upon which they could be called upon to adjudicate. While the referendum is being conducted, the Government should act upon the advice of the Labour Premier of New South Wales, and, at the same time, obtain the opinion of the people on the subject of prices control. The Government need not wait until party. As the Premier of New South",33,James Harrison S O The Is Caused By Communists And Others

121,Mr Hamilton (Canning) [4.47],"openly whether or not they advocate that also. Grayndler ( Mr Daly), in dealing with the shortage of butter and eggs, insinuated that farmers were retaining those commodities upon their properties in anticipation of price increases. He knows that there is no basis for an allegation of that kind. Members of the Opposition who talk continually ahout doing this or that for the workers, speak with their tongues in their cheeks, because the Labour Government that was in power in 1947 agreed that the prices of dairy products should be determined upon the basis of a 56-hour week. Nevertheless, they say that improved amenities should be given to workers who enjoy a 40-hour week. That basis of determination alone drove from our dairy farms and poultry farms many men who would otherwise now be engaged in producing commodities of which there is ashortage, but honourable gentlemen opposite are squealing about that shortage now. Members of the Opposition ask for prices control. They say that, had it not been for the actions of the present Government parties when the referendum on rents and prices control was held, there would be stability of prices in this country now. I remind them that the object of the present Government parties in opposing the referendum was to prevent the writing into the Constitution of a provision giving to the Commonwealth permanent control of prices. There was no need for the Prime Minister of that clay to throw on to the shoulders of the States, as he did, complete responsibility for prices control in this country immediately the people had voiced their Opinion of the Government's proposal. Although honourable members opposite' complain bitterly, and in some instances hypocritically, of the action of the present Government parties in opposing that referendum, they know very well that we told the Chifley Government that we were prepared to support any defence transitional legislation that was designed to give to the Commonwealth temporary power to control the prices of commodities that were in short supply. We agreed that it would be an act of madness to exempt such commodities from prices control until supply approximated demand. Mr Hamilton. Honourable gentlemen opposite should The honourable member for get together on this matter. Mr Larcombe, a Minister in the Queensland Government, has, according to the Queensland press of the 22nd June, 1951, complained that, 'under State prices control, other States can fix higher prices in order to attract supplies; but he also said that in that respect the position was worse when the Commonwealth controlled prices. In which way do honourable members opposite want it? A member of the Lahour party -who is a Minister in the Queensland Government has said that under the system of control of prices by the States the position is better than it was when the Commonwealth was responsible for prices control, but honourable gentlemen opposite, who voice in this Parliament not their own views but those of the executive of their party, say that the Commonwealth should control prices. Mr Larcombe is also reported to have saidI t was then the common practice of the Canberra price-fixing autliorities, whenever commodities were scarce, to arrange the scale of prices to ensure that adequate supplies went from Queensland to Sydney and Melbourne, leaving the Queensland people to suffer the shortages. According to a report in the West Australian of the 8th January, 1951, the honourable member for Eremantle ( Mr Beazley), speaking at a summer school in Perth, said that revaluation, the abolition of sales tax, the revision of tariffs, increased direct taxation and subsidized essentials, followed by wage-pegging and prices control, were a combination of effective means for increasing the value of the pound. The honorahle member for Grayndler complained that, according to a report that he had heard, this Government intends to increase direct taxation, but the honourable member for Fremantle has advocated such a course. The Opposition should speak with one voice upon prices control and wagepegging, but at the moment it is at sixes and sevens. The honourable member for Fremantle is reported to have said also that the people of Australia had indicated their opposition to prices control which, to be effective, had to be accompanied by wage-pegging. The honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell) and other members of the Labour party say that they do not want wage-pegging. If honourable gentlemen opposite do want prices control-and I doubt very much whether they do-the y sbould recognize that it must be accompanied by wage-pegging, because wages and prices are interlocked. There has been some criticism of the cost of houses. It is well known that approximately 80 per cent, of the price of a house is attributable to labour costs. What are the members of the Opposition doing to assist the people whom they claim to represent? They are advocating that bricklayers, for instance, should lay only 300 bricks a day. If a bricklayer lays more than that number, he is criticized by his trade union. By refusing to allow bricklayers to lay more than 300 bricks a day, the trade unions are hurting, not men with plenty of money, who can afford to pay high prices for the things that they need, but men with small or moderate incomes who want homes. If bonorable gentlemen opposite maintain their present attitude, the cost of houses will continue to increase. It has been suggested that the Government is doing nothing in regard to communism. Yesterday the honourable member for Yarra( Mr Keon), during a speech in opposition to communism, criticized the Government severely for having curtailed broadcasts by Eadio Australia and for certain other actions and, in scathing terms, accused it of having refused to send wheat to starving India. First, the chairman of the Australian Wheat Board, Sir John Teasdale, announced that no wheat was available in this country for despatch to India. Why should he say that wheat was not availahle for that purpose before he had made a survey of the position ? When the survey was completed, it was found that some wheat was available for India. I am reliably informed that, before the completion of the survey, this Government offered to the Indian Government as a gift 2,000 tons of maize, from 7,000 to 9,000 tons of sorghum and 9,000 tons of barley, but the Indian representatives refused to accept the offer. Although millions of Indians were starving, they said that they did not want the coarse grains that we offered them. true. the 4th May, the ship Biver Burnett was loading 8,000 tons of wheat in Fremantle for India.' It was necessary for the Australian Wheat Board to make the survey to which I have referred because certain quantities of wheat must be kept available in this country under the terms of the In ternational Wheat Agreement. That agreement was accepted by the Labour party when it was in power, although the nations to which we were required .to send wheat under certain conditions that relate to price are not required to sell their commodities to us under similar conditions. When the survey had been completed, it was ascertained that wheat was available for despatch to India, and another 9,000 tons was sent. Between 250,000 and 300,000 bushels are ready to be shipped in August. The honourable member for Yarra said yesterday that wheat should have been shipped to India immediately, but that could not be done. Ships must be chartered and sales arranged weeks and probably months before the date of despatch. A great deal of organization is necessary. It was impossible to make arrangements for wheat to be sent to India immediately, but as soon as it was possible tp send some, it was sent. The members of the Opposition could assist the starving Indians by suggesting that the waterside workers get a "" wriggle "" on in loading foodstuffs for other countries. tliat the mover and seconder, together with other honourable members who so desire, may accompany me to present the Address-in-Eeply to His Excellency the Governor General at 5.15 p.m., the sitting will now be suspended until 8 p.m. Sitting suspended from 5 to 8 p.m. pension of the sitting I was giving the House some information in rebuttal o'-' the statement of the. honourable member for Yarra that the Government had donenothing to assist the starving Indian people by sending them wheat.

125,Mr Hamilton,"Before the susbushels of wheat were to he sent to India in August. Evidence of the fact that the Government had agreed to give India assistance as speedily as possible, but that the main problem with which it was faced was one of shipping, appeared in the press of the31st May last. It was also stated that with a view to overcoming the shipping difficulty the Government had asked thr British Ministry of Food, which is an executive arm of a government of tl Opposition's own political colour, for permission to send urgently to India .shipments of wheat which, under the terms of the International Wheat Agreement, would not normally be sent until later this year. Only yesterday the Minister for External Affairs( Mr Casey) informed the country that the first cargo of gift wheat for India under the Colombo plan is expected to leave in September. I say to the Opposition, and particularly the honourable member for Yarra, that the Government has done everything possible to provide wheat and foodstuffs to the people of India. The honourable gentleman developed the argument that we should take such steps in order to defeat communism in the Eastern countries, and I agree entirely with him. We know that he has for some time fought against communism inside the ranks of his own party.. That, to me, appears to be as far as he has gone. In the Melbourne Sun News-Pictorial of the 22nd August, 1950, the honourable member was reported to have saidBitter practical experience has taught the anti-Communist iu red-controlled tyiions that without independent returning officers exercising government authority over union ballots they stand no chance. He said furtherTo-day the rank and liie, which was the most strongly opposed to any such government supervision, is becoming increasingly impatient with opposition to such measures. The following report appeared in the Melbourne Herald on the 15th March last-and ' I do not think that he will complain about the press in respect of these articles as he did yesterday in respect of some others:Mr Keon told caucus that safeguards for clean and secret ballots would strengthen tht trade union movement and restore control by bona fide working unionists.

A report which appeared in the Sydney Morning Herald of the 16th March, 1951, read, in partMr Keon said Dr. Evatt had been a wonderful success in opposing anything proposed against the Communists, and he had given the lead in opposing legislation to dissolve the Communist party. The public, suffering from blackouts and the disruption caused by the Communists, wanted to know what Dr. Evatt's policy was. able gentleman shall not refer to members by name. to the right honourable member for Barton. I was merely quoting from a press statement not matter. tinuesSince caucus was not even allowed to discuss the legislation, but had simply to obey the orders of the Australian Labour party conference, it was obvious that the party was being "" led to ruin by a dictatorship "". In the Sydney Daily Telegraph of the 16th March last the following headlim appeared:Bitter Clash in Labour Caucus. Once again it was reported that thp honorahle member for Yarra had attacked the right honourable member for Barton, and I agree that what he had to say was correct. But it' ill became him to come into this House and charge the Government with doing nothing to assist the starving people of India as a means of controlling communism. I think that we should first start controlling communism at home, and clean it up. If the honourable gentleman could clean up some of the conditions on the waterfront so that we could get ships to take wheat to India, we should he able to help the",38,James Harrison S O The Is Caused By Communists And Others

132,Mr Hamilton,"The report constarving people of that country much more quickly than otherwise. Despite his mouthings about communism, what did the honourable member do on the occasion of. the. introduction of legislation in the last Parliament to provide for secret ballots for the election of trade union leaders,, so as to allow trade unionists to .put, their own house in order? An examination of the Votes and Proceedings of Thursday, the 15th March, when thu vqte.was taken on that legislation, shows that the honourable member's, name is noi on .the voting list. The records show that he was not absent from the precincts of. the House when the vote was taken and they also show that he was not paired. I say that honourable members should not make statements outside the Parliament and then not take the opportunity of recording their votes and so making their statements good. It is not of much credit to the honourable gentleman for him to come here, as he did.yesterday, and accuse the Government, and particularly one section of it, of doing nothing, when an examination of the records shows that he did not have the courage to vote on the issue that I have mentioned. If he wants to keep his marble clean then let him do the right thing by this Parliament and not run away from the position. Having dealt with the honourable member's scathing attack on the Government -yesterday, I now turn to some other matters. The subject of defence has been mentioned in this debate and in the debate on the previous measure, but very little has been said or written about defence in Western Australia. When I came to this Parliament in 1946, at the first opportunity I raised the subject of Indian Ocean defence. The Hansard record shows that I said that in the very near future we should be having trouble in the Persian Gulf area because of the oil there. Speeches to this Parliament, as far as I can see, make no mention of any adequate defence preparations for the Indian Ocean and the west coast of Western Australia, which stretches for a distance of 4,350 miles. In the north of Western Australia there are more than 100,000,000 tons of better than 60 per cent, pure iron ore. scrap iron to the Japs. interjection. I have heard stories of pigiron having been sent to Japan, but it was the same gentleman who is blamed on that account who, as the Attorney General in the Lyons Government, had to introduce legislation to prevent a Labour Premier of Western Australia from giving to the Japanese the 100,000,000 tons of iron that I have mentioned. So it is of no use for honourable members opposite to introduce the subject of scrap iron They were prepared to support the giving away by Western Australia of 100,000,000 tons of better than 60 per cent, pure iron ore to the Japanese. There are still no measures being taken, nor are we told of any measures likely to be taken, for the defence of the Western Australian coastline. There is nothing to protect the sea lanes between Australia and England. In a case of emergency it would be dangerous to use the Panama Oanal. 1 have also previously raised the matter of establishing an air route across the Indian Ocean so that some islands can be equipped and thus be available for use as bases in the event of war. I hope that this Government during the next three years for which period at least its term of office will last although I think that it will last for twenty years, will make some move to provide an adequate defence for the western side of the continent. We appreciate the fact that a squadron of long-range reconnaissance aircraft is to be based there but. I claim that that is not enough. As far hack as 1911 the people of Western Australia were told that the Henderson naval base was to be established at Cockburn Sound. Practically nothing has been done in relation to that except the expenditure of a few million pounds for which I cannot see much result. I say to the Government, let the Navy make up its mind whether it The Governor General's wishes to have a base on that side of the continent or not, and if it does, let it get to work and construct it somewhere there. If the Navy is not going to provide a naval base on that side of the continent; then it is up to the Government to say so, in order that the land that is being held in reserve, which is valuable building land,-.may he utilized",39,James Harrison S O The Is Caused By Communists And Others
133,Mr Griffiths,The Liberals gave,40,James Harrison S O The Is Caused By Communists And Others
134,Mr Hamilton,"I welcome thatby the State for the erection of houses. Personally I should like the Government to decide to construct the naval base mentioned in 1911. It must be recalled that Admiral Sir James Eraser said, when he was here during the last war, that it was a shame that a port like Albany, with all its advantages, should not be utilized to the fullest degree. bility of carrying out one of those partiHe said, in mild terms, that it was a disgrace to this country that a ship had to be taken a distance equal to the distance between London and New York, that is, from the west coast of Western Australia to Sydney, to be repaired. Western Australia is the only State in the Oommonwealth which has not facilities for the repair of ships. There is a shipbuilding industry in Queensland, Victoria and South Australia. If the Government intends to do anything in this matter, let it make a start. Some honourable members opposite who were in office for eight years, four of which were post-war years, said nothing and, what is more, did nothing about this matter. I hope that the Government will make a decision about the naval base in Western Australia and let the Western Australian people know where they stand. If the honourable member for Swan( Mr product is controlled, but he is, as well Hamilton) believes what he says then as heing the producer of certain goods hti must be a very happy man in politics, the because he must be untroubled by any that are uncontrolled. Consequently twinge of conscience. HoweverI wish his standard of living is f alling relatively only to make a passing reference to him, behind that of other sections of the combecause in this chamber he completely munity whose incomes are not controlled.. falsified a statement that I made' at an .Adult Education Summer School in culture, and his very junior colleague Western Australia in January of this from Canning, could have explained a year. He said that I had advocated little more why those three items are wage-pegging. In the course of that subject to control; The Minister was speech I said that various propositions very indignant at the suggestion that in regard to the combating of inflation miners should go short of butter, and had been advanced at one time or another deplored the continued existence of these during the last three or four years, includcontrols, but he failed to mention the ing revaluation, wage-pegging, tariff rereason why subsidies on these items have vision, sales tax revision, prices control, been continued. Of course, the answer increased taxation and subsidies on to why he did not do that is very plain. exports. I did not advocate any of these It is not that the Government is interested steps at all. WhatI directed attention to in controlling the prices of these comwas what I considered to be the constitumodities, but that these commodities are in tional impossibility of the Government's the basic wage regimen and therefore by carrying out some of them and the poliholding their prices down the "" C "" series tical unlikelihood of its carrying out index, upon which the basic wage is fixed, others, the latter applying especially to is falsified. In the past it has always been revaluation. The Liberal party has a majority of twelve Ministers to seven Australian Country party Ministers in the Cabinet. The twelve believe in revaluation, but they are prevented from putting it into effect by the Australian Country party. Consequently, that was the political explanation of the impossicular steps. When the honourable member quoted me as having advocated any of those matters he completely misrepresented my speech. I refer honourable members to the answer given by the Minister for Commerce and he was asked in this House yesterday. The question was touched upon by the honourable member for Canning( Mr Hamilton). The Minister for Commerce and Agriculture, I believe quite correctly, said that the unfortunate state of butter, potato and onion supplies in Australia could in part be attributed -to the fact that these products are in a segment of the Australian economy which is controlled, but which operates amongst other segments that are not controlled. The producer of the commodities that I have mentioned has a controlled income hecause the price of his purchaser of other goods The Minister for Commerce and Agri-",40,James Harrison S O The Is Caused By Communists And Others

136,Agriculture ( Mr Mcewen) To A Question,"contended that whilst the basket of goods represented by the "" C "" series index is not a complete group of commodities which a family must buy, nevertheless the movement of those prices is representative of the general movement of prices I hroughout the community. Quite clearly, if selected items of the basic ""wage regimen are made the subject of subsidies whilst other things are not, then that regimen and the price movement within it cease to be an index of the general price level. That is what has happened in our community. Por that reason the Western Australian executive of the Labour party has made representations to the Western Australian Governnient to cease its alleged price control of meat. No meat is in fact sold at the prices at which the Liberal party Government in Western Australia orders it to he sold, but this theoretical price, which does not exist in any'butcher's shop in the State, is taken into account in the basic, wage regimen and operates to keep wages down. The real price of mea t, which is not taken into consideration in fixing the hasic wage, is far above the theoretical price fixed by the Western Australian Governnient. If this Government stands for laisserfaire, and it has always contended that it does, let it stand for an open slather for the whole community, including the wage(iarners, by ensuring that the basic wage index shall not be falsified. Let it do that by allowing butter, meat and other commodities to he included in the regimen at the real prices calculated by the Commonwealth .Statistician and not at some unreal theoretical prices. If that he done there will be a sharp upward movement of wages which will bring them more into line with the cost of living. The Government stands either for a controlled economy or for a free economy. The worse combination is that of sectional control and sectional freedom. Moreover, the control of one item and not of another is most unfair. I am not making out a case exclusively for the wage-earner when I advocate the lifting of certain controls. I believe that whilst the Government's interest in subsidies is directed primarily at keeping wages down, nevertheless it. is inflicting severe hardships on the dairying industry. The Treasurer ( Sir Arthur Fadden) has claimed a surplus of £5,000,000 in his budget. The right honourable gentleman, whose knighthood is one of the sweet mys-' teries of this Parliament, frequently attacked the late Mr J. B. Chifley, when he was Treasurer, for what he called his astronomical budgets. We all remember the passionate speech made by the Treasurer-it may have been the speech he made on the night when his collar-stud burst, but that was possibly during a speech in the banking debate-whe n thu right honourable gentleman advanced an alternative budget to that put forward by the late Mr Ohifley. He eited great reductions of expenditure which he said were possible. Several times he referred to the last Chifley budget of £595,000,000 as an astronomical budget. Unfortunately, the economies worked out in theory by the right honourable gentleman when he was on this side of the House do not appear to work out now that he is on the other side. Compared with a budget of £595,000,000, the Treasurer's budget totals £73S,000,000, which is £143,000,000 more. The Treasurer is well on the way to the doubtful honour of being the first framer of a federal budget which wall be over the £800,000,000 mark. The right honourable gentleman's claim to a surplus of £5,000,000 is an interesting feature of his budget. There was a time when surpluses had some reality. In the recent general election campaign the Government stated in its Western Australian propaganda that in order to counter inflation it would budget fpr surpluses. A £5,000,000 surplus in a national income of £2,000,000,000 can scarcely be regarded as a strenuous effort to budget for a surplus. However, it might have been a step in that direction had there been any reality ahout the surplus. In the days of more orthodox finance, while the Government was borrowing money-and at the time. I am speaking of, it had borrowed almost £100,000,000-an y revenue surplus was regarded as being no surplus at all. The theory was that if a government had to borrow to balance its budget, whatever money went into the Consolidated Bevenue Fund at the end of the year was not. a surplus but an amount that could be regarded as a reduction of indebtedness. That applies emphatically to this budget, which not only includes borrowings but also advance expenditure by the Government of income from the wool tax which, represents an encroachment on the revenue of the succeeding years. In the. course of this debate certain honourable members opposite, notably the honourable member for Sturt( Mr because if younger people are to conWilson), have raised the matter of social services contributions. Enthusiastically supported, by interjection, by the honourable Freeth), they have told the old story about the safety of a social services contributory scheme. We have been told of its superior ethical qualities and have been informed that by a small contribution of 3s. 6d. a week we shall almost get rid of the means test. T"" that were the position, the Prime Minister would not have announced in 194° that he had set up a committee whicli by 1952 would have drawn up a report on the possibility of setting up a social services contributory scheme. Labour party offered. a contributory scheme at all, so I am not involved in a defence of such schemes. I suggest that the honourable member who advocated the contributory scheme should look at the two pre-war reports of investigations initiated by nonrests squarely on the non-Labour parties Labour governments. One was made by Sir Frederick Stewart and the other is known as the Kinnear Report. Lf the honourable member reads those reports he will be able to form an objective assessment of contributory schemes. The claims made for them, are largely false. What is usually ignored by the people who advance such schemes is that to-day there exists a. body of age pensioners who* have no equity in any contributory scheme. If non-contributory age pensions are the responsibility of any government then they are the responsibility of every government since an age pension system was first established in 1909. There has been allowed to form in Australia a group of 500,000 age pensioners who have not contributed to any scheme. Their pensions must be financed out of taxation, and if a contributory scheme is established now to secure the future pensions of the younger people that contribution must be exacted from the wages of the younger people as well as the taxes to pay for the people who are now receiving age pensions. When it is said that 3s. 6d. a week will get .rid of the means test, the argument advanced that a contributory scheme establishes a safe fund is destroyed tribute for their future pensions their contributions should go into a pool. If the scheme envisages the abolition of member for Eorrest( Mr the means test for people already of an age to receive pensions, then quite clearly no fund will be built up by the contributions for the financing of future pensions. There appears to be some variation in the thoughts of Government supporters on that matter. If the contention that a contributory scheme is safer than one financed out of taxation is to be considered, I refer honourable members to Sir Frederick Stewart's report which was made when the government of the day was ahout to establish the 1938 social services contributory scheme. That scheme was torpedoed by the Australian Country party. Therefore, the Labour party will not take reproaches from the Australian Country party section of the House on social services contributory schemes. Such a scheme became law in 1938, and that it was not implemented is a responsibility which and particularly on the Australian Country party. Sir Frederick Stewart dealt with the particular argument that a contributory seheme is safe. The experience in Australia generally during the depression showed that incomes fell and that the taxes collected decreased in proportion as the incomes fell. Sir Frederick Stewart pointed out that a contributory scheme, such as the one that existed in Great Britain, was not safer than a scheme fianced out of taxation. When there is mass unemployment and great numbers of people cannot contribute the scheme becomes unworkable. Another ooint about social services contributions that is never faced by honourable members on the Government side is that they advocate a flat rate contribution by everybody, irrespective of income. If that is done, the scheme becomes merely a way",41,James Harrison S O The Is Caused By Communists And Others
137,Mr Wight,That is more than the,43,James Harrison S O The Is Caused By Communists And Others
138,Mr Beazley,"I do not believe inof evading the scientific principle of taxation which is that it should be taken from income according to capacity to pay. Suppose that a contributory scheme had been started in 1909. What was the pension envisaged in those days? It was 10s. a week. I do not mention that figure derisively. It was about one-quarter of the then basic wage, and the present pension is in the same relation to the hasic wage to-day. Buti f a contributory scheme .had been initiated in 1909, persons who were then 21 years of age and who are stiU living, would have contributed for over 40 years in order to qualify to receive a pension of 10s., and the movement of the value of money in the interim would have completely destroyed the whole basis on which that contribution had been computed. The experience of the century has heen one of wholesale depreciation of the purchasing power of money. Therefore, advocates of any contributory scheme must take that fact into consideration. In 1938 the State government of Western Australia initiated a civil servants contria propaganda agreement designed to win butory pensions scheme. I became a contributor to that scheme which envisaged a pension at the rate of £3 a week. At that time the old-age pension was at the rate of £1 a week and a person who contributed to the civil servants scheme naturally thought that he would enjoy a great advantage over many of his fellows. To-day, however, the age pension for an eligible couple is £5 a week, and the benefit at the rate of £3 a week that was envisaged as a pension for State public servants in Western Australia in 1938, has become completely obsolete. In fact, the Government of that State, because of war conditions and the depreciation of the purchasing power of money, now has to provide 91 per cent, of the contributions under that scheme. Thus, that scheme whioh was allegedly based on the thrift of a section of the community is now virtually financed by the taxpayers. At least it consumption of rice in this country in can be said that a scheme that is financed from taxes .that are extracted from the current national income will maintain its value in relation to the current purchasing power of money; and as it has been our experience that the value of money is constantly changing, it becomes necessary for advocates of a contributory scheme to say how they propose that the benefits payable under such a scheme should be adjusted to the current purchasing power of money. The honourable member for Canning( Mr Hamilton) spoke about the Colombo agreement. In reply to remarks by the honourable member for Yarra( Mr Keon), who contended that the Australian Government has not done sufficient to provide relief for victims of the famine in India, he informed us that by September next 250,000 bushels of Australian wheat will have been delivered to India. As the famine in India calls for the immediate provision of relief, the delivery of that quantity of wheat by September next to a country which is perennially short of foodstuffs to feed its people can hardly be regarded as an answer to the charge that the honourable member for Yarra made. Judging by statements which the former Minister for External Affairs, Mr Spender, made in this chamber the Colombo Agreement is goodwill for Australia among the Asian people.' It was evolved as the basis of a plan to put Asia on its feet. However, it has not been backed by deeds and, consequently, it will not help to win goodwill for us in Asia. Indeed, our participation in it ""may prove to be positively disastrous because it would be better for us not to say anything about what assistance we are going to give to peoples of beleaguered areas, if we are not able, in fact, to do anything at all in tiiat direction. I do not profess to know all about the wheat situation in Australia, and I do not criticize the Government for iis failure to supply adequate quantities of wheat to relieve sufferers in the famine areas of -India. However, when the honourable member for Lalor( Mr Pollard) was Minister for Commerce and Agriculture in the Chifley Government he banned the order to make available the entire Australian rice crop for the purpose of supplementing the food supplies of people in eastern countries in which rice is a staple diet. Honorahle members opposite strongly criticized the Chifley Government for having taken that action. Those honourable members, when they were in Opposition, also declared that the 89,000 tons of butter that were sent annually to the United Kingdom during the regime of the Chifley Government was a contemptible contribution, but, to-day, only 29,000 tons of butter is being sent from Australia annually to the Mother Country. Consequently, I am not astonished that honourable members opposite are now rather silent about the subject of butter exports to the United Kingdom. I do not criticize the Government ou that score, but I point out that the Treasurer and his colleagues in the Australian Country party, when they were in Opposition, alleged that the deterioration of Australia's exports of foodstuffs was due to the taxation policy of the Chifley Government. I should now be glad to learn from them the reason for the further deterioration of exports of foodstuffs to levels much less than half of those that the Chifley Government made available. Is that further deterioration due to the taxation policy of this Government? disturbances. Minister has explained that this Government has been more successful than any other Government has been in dealing with industrial disturbances. If that claim is justified, and if there is less industrial trouble in this country to-day, some evidence should be available that butter production in this country is increasing. No such evidence has been provided. I am afraid that this Government is a government of alibis. Soon after it had assumed oflice it claimed that it had arrested inflationary trends and that it had solved the problem of industrial unrest. The honourable member for Canning dealt strongly with the Communists, but only verbally. He spoke of the action that the Government intends to take to deal with the Communists. At the same 'time, he criticized the Chifley Government for its alleged failure to act in that power of the Commonwealth should be direction. Now that we are in Opposition and the Government has a majority in both this House and the Senate, we are being told that we should be working in the,trade unions on behalf of the Government. Honourable members opposite claim that the Chifley Government was Mr Beazley. ejected from office because it had failed to deal effectively with the Communists. Let us approach the matter on that basis. Honourable -members opposite are responsible for government policy and we shall be pleased to learn eventually what that policy is to he. However, we find that as that policy develops, the Government is confronted at every turn with the consequences of its own lies. I refer, for instance, to its claim that it lacks adequate constitutional power to deal with the Communist party. On this matter I advise honourable members opposite to read Hansard reports of proceedings in this chamber in November, 1938. If they do so, they will find that the Prime Minister, who was then Attorney-General in the Lyons Government, made a brilliant speech in which ho advocated centralization of powers in the Oommonwealth in stronger language than which any other politician has used in dealing with that subject in this chamber. On that occasion the right honorahle gentleman advocated eight ways in which the powers of the Commonwealth should be expanded and they were quite as sweeping as the fourteen-point proposals that were submittedto the people at a referendum in 1944 when the present Leader of the Opposition was Attorney General. Although the present Prime Minister, in 1938 advanced a credo of belief in stronger federal powers he has been a consistent opponent in the interim of any increase of power being given to the Commonwealth. In view of that fact it is indefensible for. him now to turn round and complain that following tbe High Court's judgment in respect of the validity of the Communist Party Dissolution Act the Commonwealth does not possess sufficient power in respect of industrial matters. Honourable members opposite have consistently challenged the Opposition to declare what attitude it intends to adopt towards the Government's proposed referendum submission to the people that the industrial increased. My reply to that challenge is that when we are informed of the Government's actual proposals it will be time enough for us to answer tlie challenge. If the Government intends to seek an enlargement of the Commonwealth's industrial power along the",43,James Harrison S O The Is Caused By Communists And Others
139,Mr Mooke,It is due to industrial,45,James Harrison S O The Is Caused By Communists And Others
140,Mr Beazley,"But the Primelines that Labour has always advocated, I have no doubt that the Opposition will sympathetically consider the Government's proposal; but if the Government merely intends to attempt to twist the Commonwealth's industrial power so that it can be used against the trade unions, we shall adopt a different attitude towards it. In the course of this debate members of the Australian Country party have claimed that the Opposition does not enjoy the support of the people. The Opposition holds 52 seats and 2 nonvoting seats, or a total of 54 seats, in this House. In any event, unlike tbe Australian Country party, we have not found it necessary to enter into an agreement whereby another party has undertaken not to oppose our candidates at general elections. If there is any party that should not talk about having the support of the people it is the Australian Country party. In Western Australia, where candidates of that party were opposed by the Liberal'party, it was annihilated. It does not exist in South Australia, or Tasmania, whilst in Victoria it has entered into an unprecedented alliance with the Labour party. In this Parliament the Australian Country party has lost two seats that it formerly held, and it would lose 10 more if its candidates were opposed by Liberal party nominees. In those circumstances it is not dfficult to understand why the Australian Country party has entered into its crawling electoral pact with the Liberal party in order to continue to exist. The Labour party has at least been able to form a government that coiUd stand on its own feet. That is something that the Australian Country party, at no stage of its history, has ever been able to do, and it never will be able to do so. When the Commonwealth of Australia was formed 50 years ago there was no Australian Country party in existence, and I am confident that 50 years hence, when we celebrate the centenary of federation, its party will have ceased to exist because when the Liberal party next goes into Opposition its electoral non-opposition pact with the Australian Country party will disappear. That is not germane to the subject now under discussion except, perhaps, insofar as the Australian Country party has not yet disappeared, whilst, unfortunately, the value of the £1 has practically disappeared. It would appear that the Government still finds itself unable to have faith in its own economic policy. When it assumed office, the Prime Minister gave a series of broadcasts, which he continued until his advisers toid him that he was talking too often. In those speeches he outlined reasons for the substantial increases of prices. Pirst, he said that the increase of the price of vegetables hacl been due to floods. Whilst the floods, apparently, have subsided, those prices have not done so. Now, the Government is practically silent on the subject of rising prices. It says that the present inflationary trend is due to the activities of Communists. To-day, the Government has a majority in this chamber and in the Senate, and if I were a cartoonist the best cartoon that I could produce on the subject would be one which would depict the Treasurer saying to the Prime Minister, "" Soon, Bob, there will be no one to blame but you and me "". able member's time has expired. debate seems to be confined to honourable members from Western .Australia. 1 shall not participate in a family squabble by arguing with the honourable member for Fremantle ( Mr Beazley) in reply to the interesting lecture to which he has just treated the House, because I wish to deal with other subjects, particularly on that was discussed by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie ( Mr Johnson). I refer to the problem of developing northern Australia. I commend that honourable member for the vigorous and well-informed speech that he made on that subject. This is not a parochial matter, although it relates to the development of a great part of Western Australia; it affects Australia's interests as a whole. I shall briefly restate the problem. At present, the population of this country is approximately 8,000,000, but we have developed in a lopsided way in that 4,000,000 of our people are centred in the southeast corner of the continent within 100 miles of Sydney and Melbourne. That thought is rather terrifying from the defence standpoint, for two reasons. Let us imagine what would happen if",45,James Harrison S O The Is Caused By Communists And Others

142,Mr Freeth (Forrest) [8.43],"ThisAustralia became involved in a war in the near future with a major power that possessed atomic weapons. I do not consider that to be beyond the bounds of probability. could easily calculate the war potential of Australia, based upon the country's contribution in two previous world wars, and could estimate the cost of dropping two atomic bombs, one on Sydney and one on Melbourne. As the result of such an attack, the whole of Australia's war potential would be immediately destroyed, and the destruction in those cities would be enormous. Australia would be wiped out as an effective participant in the war. Such an attack by a major power would not be unduly difficult. We cannot defend ourselves adequately against long range aircraft that would be expendable. It would not matter to the enemy whether or not those aircraft returned to their base. We can contemplate that we should have no adequate defences, should any power decide to cripple us permanently in the way I have suggested. For years, people have talked about our empty north, and about the covetous eyes of Asia that are cast upon it. If we were to calculate its population potential on the same area basis, for example, as India, 250,000,000 people could occupy the north of Australia. I agree immediately that that is not a practical basis of calculation, because large areas are relatively uninhabitable, and would not sustain a population on anything like the same basis as that of India. But we must remember that, whilst those areas in the north will not sustain a population, according to our standards, comparable with the populations of the countries of Asia, they would sustain on Asiatic living standards a much larger population than they sustain at present. are the standards by which the countries that are looking for living room wil] judge those empty spaces in our north. At present, in the country north of the 26th parallel of latitude, there is a population of approximately 13,000 or one person for every 180 square miles. That population, instead of increasing, is becoming less every year. That is the effect of our lop-sided development. I believe that this Government, and all preceding governments for many years, Mr Freeth. have been aware of the problem. But mere awareness of the position is not enough. How is the problem to be solved ? That major power The difficulty may be expressed thus: If a government , is cynically minded, it simply says, "" We have to expend the money in the areas in which we can get the most votes. If we do not expend the greater proportion of our revenue in the areas in which the majority of people are now living, and in which, consequently, the votes are, we shall not get credit for such expenditure"". That is the cynical attitude. In order to be more humane, governments must be aware of the fact that the bulk of the revenue must be expended in places in which people are already living, so that they will derive an immediate benefit from it. Unfortunately, because governments are in oflice for relatively short periods, they tend to concentrate on schemes that will produce immediate but rather shortterm results. Added to that is the fact that Australia is now passing through a period of inflation, and that the Government is obliged to pull in its horns, as far as possible, in incurring expenditure upon developmental works. I know that many members of the present Cabinet, and many members of the previous Government, have been most enthusiastic about developmental projects; but if we are perfectly candid, we must admit that nioney expended on the north would be in the nature of a gamble. Few people live in that part of Australia, and even if large sums were expended in the north now, there would be no certainty that, people would be encouraged to settle in it. Therefore, we may assume that, if it rests with a government to expend money for the purpose of developing and populating our empty north, the money is not likely And those to beexpended, and we must try to find another solution of the problem in order to induce people to settle in that part of Australia. How can we do so ? We cannot simply take people by the scruff of the neck and put them into that country. We cannot, as is done in some other countries, build large concentration camps and send politically unwanted persons to them. Some form of inducement and incentive must be given to people to go to that part of the country of their own accord. They must be encouraged to go there by suitable rewards for their own efforts. I cite as one of the most enthusiastic and ardent supporters of the development of our north, the Minister for External Affairs( Mr Casey), who, before he became a member of the Government, wrote a book entitled Double or Quit. His conception of the avenues of expenditure by the Government on public works and development was to restrict such projects to those that would, in themselves, stimulate the settlement of the empty areas. The right honourable gentleman referred objection eould be overcome provided the to what he called "" developmental stimuTreasurer ( Sir Arthur Fadden) is willing lators and I believe that his idea could to give serious consideration to the matter. be applied with advantage to the proposal I can name a few of them.

Certain excepthe proposal; tions would be made to that proposal, and certain conditions could be attached-to it, raised to the proposal is that the tax such as a requirement to re-invest in that concession has been tried but has not area a substantial proportion of the encouraged people to settle in the income earned in it.

144,Mr Feeeth,"Yes; I shall deal withaffect the salary or wage-earner, who is required to develop the country by living there with his family. It also does not assist the non-resident, speculative investor. There is no doubt that if the Government cannot or will not expend huge sums of money in the north, outside capital must be attracted for that purpose. But, strangely enough, although the objection has heen raised that the scheme has been tried without success in the Northern Territory, the same argument is twisted and used in another way when the inhabitants of the Northern Territory ask for more generous tax concessions. If they claim that the present concessions are inadequate to encourage the development of the Northern Territory, they are told that any additional concessions would discriminate unfairly against people in Western Australia and Queensland. That is a two-faced argument. It is not a fair or an honest argument, and I hope that it will not be used by the Treasurer in answering this proposal. Clearly, the proposed scheme, which represents an extension of the present system, would he given a fair trial if it were applied to the entire area of Australia north of the 26th parallel of latitude. The present Government and previous governments have accepted the principle, but only the principle, that tax concessions are necessary to encourage development. They have not had the courage to give the principle a wholehearted practical test. They have applied it piece-meal in little niggling bits and that has not been good enough. That is why I am prepared td agree that the system has not worked successfully in the past. The principle was outlined in the , Payne Committee's report on the Northern Territory as long ago as 1937, and I believe that the present Minister for External Affairs( Mr Casey) obtained from that report the idea that large 1 applications of government or private capital were needed to develop our northern areas. As investments of that nature would be purely speculative, he expressed the view in his book, Double or Quit, that the capital should he provided allowed to do as they have done. by private enterprise. This is what the right honourable gentleman wroteAustralia is a capital-hungry country, as all fact is that the population is decreasing countries in the developmental stage must he.because people cannot make adequate Afr. Freeth. Our annual savings are nothing like sufficient to provide the capital necessary to develop Australia as rapidly as we must. Later in the book he statedThe magnet for capital is opportunity. It may be argued that the plan that I have outlined does not go far enough and that, even with a tax-free period of twenty years, large companies still will not be attracted to invest capital specu-' latively in the hope of drawing large profits from that empty area. However, I refer honourable members to the development that has taken place at Wittenoon Gorge, to which the honourable member for Kalgoorlie ( Mr Johnson) referred last night. A few years ago there were only two or three people in the locality. But, as a result of the investment of over £1,000,000, there is now a flourishing township there with a population of over 500. That is the stage of any process of development at which governments should enter the picture. At Wittenoon Gorge now, due to the aid of the State Government, there are schools and other amenities which, for a town of that size, are equal to anything anywhere else in the State. The great difficulty is to persuade any government to invest money where there is no population. Governments consider that it is too risky to meddle with the funds of the community in such speculative enterprises. I said earlier that I would discuss the present system of tax concession in the Northern Territory and prove its inadequacy. On this subject, I join issue with the honourable member for Kalgoorlie, who blames the pastoralists to a certain degree for. the present state of the country. I believe that I am quoting him correctly when I say that he said that the wool barons of the north-west were largely responsible for the poor state of the country. I do not believe that that was a true or fair statement, and I am sure that any person who was placed in the same position as that of the pastoralists in that ""region would do exactly as they have done. tainly should not be encouraged, but the",48,James Harrison S O The Is Caused By Communists And Others
145,Mr Johnson,They should not be,49,James Harrison S O The Is Caused By Communists And Others
146,Mr Freeth,"Bad practices cerlivelihoods there in spite of the present high price of wool. This is due largely to heavy taxation. I have jseen the balance-sheets of a number of representative pastoral companies which operate there, and they reveal a consistent loss over a period of about fifteen years. Capital has been written off in amounts of thousands of pounds each year. of wool in those years? honorahle member's question in the course of my argument. Over a five-year period, on the concessions which they receive, pastoralists cannot recover in one or two good seasons the losses that they sustain in the long and heart-breaking years of bad seasons and low prices. Seasonal conditions in the area are such that one good season in four or five is about the best that the pastoralists can expect, and even then they have to take the chance of getting good prices for their wool. An examination of their financial situation shows that an enterprise may carry on for, say, four years with a cumulative loss of. about £4,000 and then, in the fifth year, make a profit of about £10,000. Cases like that are not unusual. The net profit of a pastoral company in such circumstances over five years would be £6,000 and the average, for the purpose of determining the rate of tax over a five-year period, would be £1,200. The rate of tax would be 64d. in the £1 at present tax rates. Therefore, the tax on £10,000 would be £2,600 and the net profit over a five year period would be £3,400, or the equivalent of less than £700 a year. Taking into consideration the amount of capital that would be employed in order to produce an income of £10,000 in a good year, that return would not even pay the standard rate of interest. Let us consider how a pastoral enterprise that operates in a much, bigger way than such a company as that would fare. The total loss sustained over four years might be about £10,000. Net profit'in the fifth year might be as high as £40,000. Those amounts are large, but I believe that profits such as that are being made in the area to-day. The average profit for five years, on those figures, would be £6,000. The amount of tax, at the rate of 13s. in the £1, would be £26,000 on a single year's profit, so that the net income over five years would be £4,000, or £800 per annum. That would not even represent the minimum rate of interest on the capital invested in the enterprise. The figures that I have used do not exaggerate the situation in northern Australia. A five-year period for the purpose of averaging rates of tax and a concession whioh permits the cost of certain improvements to be. treated as deductions for taxation purposes do not give the slightest encouragement to pastoralists to remain in production. That system has caused to arise the situation to , which the honourable member for Kalgoorlie objected last night. Men are going into the territory and hanging on from year to year until they experience a good season. When their patience is rewarded they say, in effect,"" Eight. We will take this money and buy a farm in the south, where at least the grass is green once a year and there is a consistent rainfall so that we shall be able to rely on experiencing more than one good season in four or five years. We shall have a comfortable farm, relatively close to Perth, and shall carry on happily there "". That is why pastoralists are taking money out of the territory. Who can blame them for doing so? It is up to this Government as it was up to past governments, -which failed in their duty, to give some worthwhile encouragement to men to go into that country of their own accord. A committee representative of pastoralists in the north-western regions was appointed some time ago to come to Canberra and interview the Treasurer on this matter. The Treasurer promised to examine their proposals. I hope that he will have the courage and imagination to look beyond the limits of mere departmental objections, which are inevitably raised whenever tax concessions are proposed. I hope that he will have the foresight to envisage the requirements' of the whole country for many years ahead and the will to do away with this lopsided developmental outlook which tends to concentrate most of our population in the south-eastern corner of the continent, leaving the north neglected and virtually empty.

The honourable member for Forrest( Mr Northern Territory. As the end of each Freeth) devoted the whole of his speech to the problems of northern Australia. Throughout the life of the last Parliament, I endeavoured to persuade the present Minister for External Affairs( Mr Casey), who was then Minister for National Development, to take some action with the object of developing the northern area of our continent where lies the open gateway to the far north. Unfortunately, I could not induce him to do anything. Government do ? ber for Forrest complained that former governments had been aware of the needs of our northern regions, but had done nothing to satisfy them: I remind the honourable member ""for Fisher( Mr Country party resigned from the party Adermann) that the Bruce-Page Government and later the Lyons Government, both of which were of the same political complexion as the present Government, consistently neglected the north although they were in power over a period when there was great unemployment and when, therefore, developmental works should have been undertaken. They gave no, indication that they were conscious of the fact that there was such an area as the undeveloped north. Therefore, it is like a breath of fresh air to hear somebody ou the Government side of the House making reference to a very important proposal for the development of northern Australia. The honorahle member for Forrest urged the importance of granting tax concessions to residents of the northern part of Western Australia. He said that the tax concessions which had heen accorded to residents of the Northern Territory had been unsuccessful. I remind him that primary producers in the Northern Territory, whether they be graziers or miners, have been granted tax concessions since 1937, although the employees, of course, have to pay tax on the normal scale. The concessions were introduced in 1937 for a period of five years. The Therefore, I appeal to the scheme was reviewed in 1942 and was extended for five years. It will be reviewed again next year. That policy has succeeded only in encouraging speculation, instead of proper settlement, in the five-year period of the tax concession scheme draws near, many residents of the territory make arrangements to transfer their properties and get out of the region. I know something of the empty noTth, and I support the suggestion that tax concessions greater than those in operation now be granted to the people who live at the front door of this nation. During the general election campaign of 1949 we were told by the present Government parties that if they were returned to power they would deal with the problem of prices and put value back into the £1. Last year, when Government members were considering the economic position of the country, the question of what is known as revaluation was discussed. One member of the Australian as a result of the stand that he had taken on that measure and subsequently lost his seat. We have heard nothing about revaluation for quite a long time, and it was gradually fading out of the picture prior to the last general election. But it has been reported in the press that there is a possibility that; in the near future, the relationship of the £1 sterling to the dollar will be reviewed. If that relationship were to be altered, the Australian Government would have to review the relationship of the Australian £1 to the £1 sterling, and the farmers and exporters of this country might awaken one morning to find that the returns from the sale of their commodities overseas had been reduced by 20 per cent. The Governor General's Speech, in which the policy of the Government for the next few months was outlined, dealt mainly with communism and defence. There was no reference in it to the burning subject of inflation. .During the course of this debate, honourable members on this side of the House have criticized the lack of action by the Government during the last eighteen months to check the present",50,James Harrison S O The Is Caused By Communists And Others

Nonsensical statements have heen made hy Government supporters to the effect that if the Governor nothing to check the speed at which it ment can deal with the Communists and the unions in the way in which it wishes to deal with them, it will have gone a long way towards solving the problem of inflation. The cry of the majority of honorahle gentlemen opposite is "" Communism, communism, and more communism"". Communism was a catch-cry that was used to gull the public at the general elections that were held in 1949 and this year, and it is likely that the Government will try to saddle the old horse again in the next Federal Stakes. At the last meeting of the Loan Council, the Treasurer ( Sir Arthur Fadden) told the State Premiers and Treasurers that loan funds were drying up. Yesterday, the right honourable gentleman said in this chamber that a loan floated by the Commonwealth quite recently was oversubscribed to the extent of 22£ per cent. The Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Ev;att) asked whether any alteration had been made of the policy in regard to trading banks participating in or subscribing to Commonwealth loans, and the Treasurer replied that trading banks were still restricted in that connection. Having regard to the fact that the last Commonwealth loan was over-subscribed, the people of this country want to know why the Treasurer told the State Premiers that loan funds were drying up. I believe that the right honourable gentleman said that because the endeavours of the State governments to carry out public works involving the expenditure of money raised by loans was causing him some concern. He told the States, in effect, that it would not be long before they would be compelled to abandon a great many of their schemes for development and reconstruction. In Queensland, work upon the reconstruction,of roads that were washed out during the wettest year in the history of the white man's occupation of the State would have to he curtailed if , as the Treasurer stated was the case, loan funds were drying up. I am very concerned about inflation in this country. Apparently I am more concerned about it than the Government is, because during the last eighteen months the Government has done little is galloping. It was stated in yesterday's Sydney Sun that, in the very near future, the Government would have to impose drastic controls because it intends .to implement its plan for defence mobilization. The only way in which we can obtain any information about the Government's health policy is to wait until the Minister for Health( Sir Earle Page) has addressed a meeting of the British Medical Association and then read press reports of his speech. The only source from which we can get any real indication of the Government's economic policy is the metropolitan press. I assume that the report in the Sydney Sun to which I have referred is fairly accurate. If so, drastic controls will be imposed in this country. It may be that that report is a hint that the"" Government is conscious that we are faced with an internal problem. The lac£ of action by the Government to combat inflation is due either to incompetence or to failure to learn anything from what occurred in 1929. The period between 1919 and 1928 was, in comparison with the present time, a period of mild inflation, but it caused the crash of 1929, as a result of which one-third of the Australian community was thrown out of employment. The government of the day stood idly by during that period of mild inflation. Inflationary conditions are worse now than they were between 1919 and 1928, and a crash will occur unless some action is taken to prevent it, but the Government is apparently content to stand idly by and do nothing to prevent it. It is obeying the dictates of the economist who said in 1949 that the only way in which it was possible to make the present system work was to have a pool of unemployed. It is p-w that the implementation of the Government's defence plans will entail a continuation of a policy of full employment, but the pool of unemployed that somepeople believe must be established in order to make the present system workcan be established by means of an economic crash. Apparently that is the intention of the Government. The rate of inflation in this country i< exceeded perhaps only by that in the United States of America. When the Treasurer introduced the budget last year, he told us that the international situation had deteriorated: Nine months later, we are told that the Government proposes to undertake certain defence works. During the last nine months, the United States of America has speeded up its defence preparations. This Government could learn much from what is happening in America, where an extensive defence programme has been superimposed upon inflationary conditions. It has been estimated by one economist that, by the middle of next year, one-fifth of the goods and services produced in America will be going directly, or indirectly, to the armed services America is a very wealthy country and may be able to withstand the impact upon its economy of a huge defence programme. Unfortunately, Australia is not so wealthy as is the United States of America and, therefore, the impact upon our economy of inflation and huge defence expenditure will be greater. The Government should ask the people, by way of referendum, to agree to an alternation of the Constitution to give to the Commonwealth power to control prices in this country. The control of prices by the Commonwealth proved to be very effective during the last war. In 1945, the Australian economy compared favourably with that of any other country because the Commonwealth, under the defence power in the Constitution, had been able to control prices and maintain economic stability. We can learn much from our experiences during the war and from what is occurring at the present time in America. Some people have more faith in economists and economic advisers than I have, but there are one or two of them whose advice leaves one with the feeling, "" This fellow is right"". had suflicient experience of economists between 1929 and 1932. If the Government conducts the referendum which it intends to hold this year concerning the Communist party it should, at the same time, put before the people the question of control of prices and capital issues. It has been found necessary to exercise these powers in time of war and the Government should ensure that it may adopt similar measures in time of peace. The Mr Riordan. Government should put the economy of this country on an even keel and it can do that only by obtaining additional powers by way of a referendum. If it be correct, as is reported in the press, that the Government intends that luxury industries shall close down and that their manpower shall be diverted to defence industries the Government should make sure that it is empowered to bring about this state of affairs. The Government related the Communist Party Dissolution Act to the defence power under the Constitution, but the High Court gave a judgment against the Government Acting under the defence power, the Chifley Government continued the rationing of petrol after the war, but the High Court ruled that the defence power did not operate in respect of such a matter as petrol rationing. The High Court may well decide that the defence power does not enable the Government to close' down luxury industries because it is operative only in time of war or immediately after a war. The history of the Communist Party Dissolution Act is indicative of the fact that the Government waits until something happens and then looks round and wonders where it is going. There are three accepted bases on which the Government could finance the "" huge "" defence expenditure which it is reported to have undertaken. Finance may be obtained from taxation, from the raising of voluntary loans or by the use of central bank credit. During the last Parliament a new method of finance was introduced by the Treasurer. He introduced a bill under which a certain industry which he regarded as being prosperous was selected for the purpose of providing a forced loan. T f the Government wishes the people to be united in rendering every possible assistance in the This country implementation of the defence programme it should not experiment with methods of finance. The accepted three methods of obtaining money which I have mentioned are sufficient to finance any plans that this Government may adopt. I have not very much faith in the Government's intentions in relation to this "" huge "" defence expenditure. Last year the Treasurer decided to raise the rate of sales tax on cosmetics and radios. Sales tax is a vicious imposition on the manwith a family because tbe more dependants a man bas tbe more tax he has to pay. The bachelor who has no dependants does not pay nearly so much as the family man pays by way of sales tax on the commodities that he and his family eat, wear and use. If there is to be equality of sacrifice and an equitable sharing of the cost of defence that cost should be placed on the shoulders of those who are best able to bear it. The basic principle of taxation is ability to pay and he who is best able to bear the burden should carry it. ""When the Governnient holds a referendum it should ask the people for the power to control prices and capital issues and it should ask for the power to ration commodities so that consumer goods will be equitably distributed. Unless the Government does that it may find itself in a position similar to that in which it found itself in connection with the Communist Party Dissolution Act. I have said that the Government used the Communists as a catch-cry during the general election that was held in 1949. To the consternation of the Government, that catch-cry turned up trumps and it had to take some action in relation to the matter. Consequently, it introduced a bill which it related to the defence powers under the Constitution, although it knew that it did not have the power to put such legislation into effect. The Government knew in advance what the decision of the High Court would be in relation to the Communist Party Dissolution Act. As its cry concerning the Communist party had heen so successful in 1949, the Government kept the issue alive. During the general election in 1951 it announced that it would bave a referendum on this subject. If the Government had been sincere in its desire to deal with the Communists, and conscious of its responsibility in consequence of the promise that it made to the electors in 1949, it would have submitted a bill for the holding of a referendum on this matter immediately the House met last year. Alternatively, it could have done then what the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) has done now. It could have asked the Premiers to concede to it the necessary powers. Now, eighteen months after the general election of 1949, the Government is going to try to obtain these powers at a referendum. If the Government is sincere why did it not make this attempt at the beginning of last year? The manner in which the Communist Party Dissolution Act was drafted indicated that the Government was conscious that there was a doubt about whether it complied with the requirements of the Constitution. Wliy was not the matter submitted to the people at a referendum immediately? Because it was too good a catch-cry for the purpose of winning a subsequent election. The Government has not been so sincere in relation to communism as it has proclaimed itself to be. The important issue in this country at present is our economic condition. As the late Mr Chiney said, "" The horso of inflation is galloping "". As a matter of fact, inflation is now not a horse but a turbo-jet aircraft, so great is its speed. During the last three months wages have been raised because of. increases of prices. When wages rise, prices increase again because wages have risen and the movement sweeps through the country like a bushfire. Inflation of this type has been experienced in the United States of America where the. Government has not been prepared to take any action to prevent it. I hope that the Australian Government will take action with regard to the inflationary condition of the economy of this country. to support the motion before the House. I think that honourable members will agree that never in the history of this eountry has a Treasurer and a government been called upon to face a task as difficult as that which confronts this Government and the present Treasurer ( Sir Arthur Fadden). This task has arisen from the maladministration and the socialistic policies of the former Government and the sudden changes of world events which have thrust upon the Government a great responsibility in relation to defence. It was not realized that this responsibility was so near when the general election was held in 1949. The Government has to deal with this problem as effectively as possible and it deserves the support of this House in carrying out its diflicult task. 1 The honourable member for Kennedy( Mr Riordan), the honourable member",51,James Harrison S O The Is Caused By Communists And Others

I could speak on development in my own electorate and throughout the Commonwealth in a similar way. Every problem that concerns development is related to the task of supplying the materials that are needed for developmental projects. The honourable member for Kennedy spoke on the raising of loans and the Government's financial position. Money is of little consideration at the present time. The real task that confronts this country is the production of goods. If this task is not undertaken successfully Australia will face a very diflicult situation. ""We live in what is almost a fool's paradise. We speak of matters that are of little importance. [Quorum formed.] suffering damage from shortages of essential goods. That fact places upon us the great responsibility of trying to overcome the production failure due to the maladministration of the former Labour Government. We might be likened to people who live in a fool's paradise, because we are short of essential commodities and are sailing dangerously close to the wind in regard to food supplies. When we recognize how short we are of food generally, even at a time when we are fortunately passing through, and have passed through, the hest seasons that this that courts must make their decisions on country has ever experienced, we must realize that should we experience drought conditions again we shall be faced with the full effects of the unfortunate policy introduction of a 40-hour week shows that of the former Socialist Government. The 40-hour week was introduced when that Government was in office in 1948. I shall not criticize the Commonwealth Arbitration Court for having made the decision that the nation could carry a shorter working week, but I do say that the Government in office at that time should have known better, and should have recognized the inability of the country then to withstand that great alteration of Mr Eggins. its economy. The fact is that right from that time we have seen the production of this country failing to meet requirements. They That is why we are placed in our present very difiicult position. We had then just The emerged from the war and had to undertake the rehabilitation of ex-servicemen. have delivered very fine responsibility on the nation and called for greater, and not less, effort on the part of the people. I think that I am safe in saying that the proposals for a shorter working week undoubtedly originated in Communist propaganda designed to reduce our production and to create internal problems for us while, at the same time, communism outside this country was threatening us and our allies. The Communist design was to weaken our defence. The same thing happened in regard to the 40-hour week proposal as is now happening in regard to the proposal for a 36-hour week. Everybody in this country would gladly recognize a working week of 40 hours or whatever the court might decide would be in the interests of the people generally, This country is provided that we were to get 40 hours, or whatever the number of bours might be, of work. But the actual working hours in this country have been reduced to 35 a week, which means that all the industries of this country are suffering seriously. A good deal of the evidence that was submitted to the court by trade union representatives when the 40-hour week case was before it, has not been sustained by experience. The Labour Government in 1948 was to blame because it did not approach the court and submit evidence about what the economic result of the reduction of hours would be. I know the evidence submitted to them, but the fact that the Government submitted no evidence of the economic results of the it failed to meet its responsibility to the country. Experience has shown that since the introduction of the 40-hour week no improvement of man-hour production to offset the production loss resultant on the reduction of hours has heen achieved. In, say, a small factory where ten men were working a 44-hour week, eleven men had to be employed after the introduction of the 40-hour week, so that the same production as before could be achieved. There has heen no improvement of man-hour production despite the fact that trade union representatives who submitted evidence to the court told it that in a shorter working week increased production would be achieved because there would be less fatigue among the workers. The introduction of the 40-hour week was the commencing point of the drift of our economy. Nobody could avoid recognizing the effect that its introduction would bave on our industries generally, as well as its further effect on rural industry. When the 40-hour week was introduced, why did not the Government of the day make some preparation to meet its effects, instead of leaving the task to this Government? neglected that responsibility, and it was not until the present Government came into office that there was any realization of the need for increased capital expenditure in this country. The present Government made arrangements with the International Bank for a dollar loan that made possible the importation of an extensive range of capital goods that are being brought here for installation in the various industries which will enable us to achieve a marked increase of production. If the Chifley Government had recognized the need for additional mechanization that arose from the reduction of working hours, these capital goods would have been in this country long ago and already would bave been working towards improving our economy. Honourable members opposite have spoken of the need for development and the opportunities for it, and have stated that they recognize the country's inability to supply all the means that are necessary for that development. But the Government that they supported failed to take the necessary steps to ensure increased production. In the first speech that the Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt) made in his new capacity, he made sweeping charges against the Government to the effect that it had not provided the means to develop this country. In 1948, when the 40-hour week was introduced, and the effective working week fell to only 35 or 36 hours, this country missed its opportunity through the failure of the Labour ^Government, and many amenities required by the people disappeared. Whether the then Government thought that it was assisting the masses by its failure to inform the court of the results of a shorter working week is a matter about which we can form our own opinions; but the actual fact is that its inaction has brought to the people a good deal of misery that could have been avoided by prompt action in 1948. However, under the influence of Communist-dominated forces within its political organization, the Labour Government had to yield to pressure and allow the 40-hour week to become operative, to the detriment of this nation. The introduction of the shorter working week has had a most vital effect on the primary industries of this country. When The former Government the production of secondary industry is adversely affected the production of primary industry must also be similarly affected. The primary producers of Australia have always been the greatest body of purchasers of the products of secondary industry. But when they could not obtain all the supplies of manufactured goods that they needed, they in disgust eased up in their work and of necessity just carried on as best they could. It must be said to the credit of the primary indj.<tries that they have struggled to maintain production of the main food lines where it was in 1942. Much of their success has been due to the good seasons that we have been experiencing for some years. Our primary industries are our most efficient industries, because the men and women who remain in them are experienced in them, and have carried on under the most difficult conditions. Because of their experience they have been able to keep production up. The dairying industry is one primary industry that has recently come before the notice of the public more than it ever did before. The honourable member for Macarthur ( Mr Jeff Bate) last night gave a full recital of what had happened in that industry, including the requests that it had made to the previous Governnient and the failure of that Government to meet them. As he showed, it was a case of ""too little too late"". What has happened in connection with the production of milk? The latest figures availahle, which are for last year, show that production of milk is approximately the same as is was in 1942. That fact is due to the good seasons that we have experienced in recent years. However, there has_been a marked change in the use of milk. The annual production of milk in 1942 was 1,105,000,000 gallons. Production last year had risen to 1,253,000,000 gallons. I have obtained certain figures concerning the use of milk mental blunder. Once the dairying which may be of interest to honorable members. In 1942, ordinary fluid milk used for domestic purposes amounted to 25.5 gallons a head throughout Australia. At present, Australians use 31.3 gallons a head of such milk. In 1942, 12.2 gallons of milk a head were used to make condensory products. That has increased until now 12.7 gallons a head are used. This large increase of the use of fluid milk has been at the expense of the production of butter. That is one of the main reasons why butter production at present is very low. In considering the figures that I have placed before the House, it should be remembered that, although the consumption of milk per head of population has increased since 1942, the population of Australia has also increased by about 600,000 or 700,000. The task of supplying the increasing population is a great responsibility, and one that the industry has accepted very well considering the conditions under which it is being conducted. The effect of the 40-hour week on the primary industries of Australia has been severe. That is mainly because the introduction of the 40-hour week has caused young men and women to leave primary production for the brighter lights of the cities and country towns. Thousands of such young people have left our primary industries. In many country towns new factories have been built which have attracted workers from the farms. In my own electorate, clothing factories were established in the dark days of 1942 and 1943 in four of the most important towns. Frome 100 to 150 young women have been attracted from the surrounding district into those factories. Some young men are also employed there. The greater number of those young people left primary industries to work in the factories. Other young men have entered other positions in country towns and cities where they work' fewer hours and receive more pay. Primary industries, Mr Eggins. particularly the dairying industry, cannot compete in wages and conditions with secondary industries. The failure of the previous Government to recognize that fact and to ensure that the dairying industry should be given encouragement at the right time was a very serious governindustry, or for that matter any stock industry, begins to slip back, some years must elapse before it can be restored to full production. Our agricultural industries can be built up perhaps in one or two years by the correct planting of crops, but a run-down livestock industry needs five years' hard work to restore it to f u l l efficiency. A number of dairy-farmers, owing to the difficulties under which they were working,"" have changed to the rearing of beef cattle. Moreover, the latter type of farming requires less labour and material than does the former. In almost any part of the north coast of New South Wales bonorable members may see that hardly . a farm is adequately fenced. That is because fencing materials have not been available during the last four or five years. If a farm cannot be adequately fenced and subdivided into paddocks it cannot be efficiently managed. Galvanized iron for buildings is badly needed, and evidence of the shortage of this material is apparent throughout our coastal dairying areas. I have no doubt that such shortages are general throughout Australian primary industries. When all the difficulties under which the primary industries are labouring are made known, honourable members of this House and the people of the country will pay a grateful tribute to the magnificent efforts of our primary producers which have resulted in the maintenance of our production of the necessaries of life. However, I warn the House that when the industry is afflicted by droughts,, there will be acute shortages of all dairy products and then the cry of "" What has become of our dairy produce ? "" will rise from the critics. However, I have every confidence that this Government will recognize the difficulties of our primary industries and in particular will help to restore the dairying industry to its old efficiency. Honourable members opposite, when they attack the Government's efforts to increase production, and f a i l to appreciate the industrial needs of the country, are neglecting their responsibilities to Australia. Australian production has not increased by much more than 10 per cent, -since the war ended. In the private enterprise countries of the United States and Canada, production is between 50 per cent, and 70 per cent, better than it was when the war ended. In those countries the evidence is quite apparent of the mighty effort that is being made to make up the loss of production caused by the war. A t a most inconvenient time in the history of Australia the 40-hour week was introduced. The 40-hour week would not have had such a bad effect on production if people had worked an actual 40 hours each week. However, a survey of industry clearly indicates that the average effective working hours in industry are not more than 35 or 36. That is a great weakness in the industrial life of this country, and instead of talking ahout matters that are not of immediate concern, honourable members opposite would do well to address their attention to the organizations with which they are associated. They should t r y to instil into them an awareness of our need for materials to carry out our defence plans and our natural development. No honourable member of this House would like to see an effective 40-hour week more than I , but when the 40-hour week develops into a 35 or 36 hour week, it is time we woke up to the danger and ceased to live in our present fool's paradise. The Treasurer ( Sir Arthu r Fadden) has a more difncult task than has ever confronted any Australian Treasurer. During the war our economy was almost ruined by the socialist policy of Labour governments. That policy was carried into the post-war years when the Government of the day sought to socialize shipping, airlines, coal and banking. None of those schemes has brought one pound of real wealth into the country and the Treasurer now has to try to remedy the harm that has been done to our economy. If the Government had used the money and the time spent on socialization schemes on the development of our primary and secondary industries we should be in a much better economic position than we are at present. Now the Treasurer has completely to change the industrial outlook of the country and has to t r y to approach our problems in a reasonable and proper fashion. If he does not succeed, our economic position w ill be much more serious in the future and, what is worse,we shall not he able to defend Australia. These problems' must be tackled in a serious fashion otherwise production w ill f a l l and we shall not be able to develop Australia or to keep it .

The policy on which the Government was returned to office included a promise to take steps to curtail the activities of. the bureaucracy, and to prevent the expenditure of money upon an excessive number of public servants. Such a promise was repeatedly made by Government supporters in the general election campaign in 1949. I believe that before the committee approves of the expenditure of such a huge sum, it should be told whether the Government has made any attempt to give effect to that pre-election promise. honourable member for Yarra( Mr Keon) is seeking to discuss an item dealing with the Publio Service Board, in the proposed vote for the Prime .Minister's Department. Service Board is the authority that deals with the Public Service generally. I submit that the honorahle member is trying, by a devious method, to avoid the previous ruling of the Chair. order is upheld. dissent from your ruling, Mr Chairman. Although the statement by the Postmaster-General( Mr Anthony), that the matter raised by the 'honourable member for Yarra( Mr Keon) appears in the schedule, is true, the clause under consideration relates honourable member has stated that he proposes to dissent from my ruling.

I hope that the Treasurer will give us some information about the kind of equipment and furniture that is to be purchased for such a large sum for the Australian Legation iri Italy.

If there is a reason, I shall be interested to hear it. Treasurer) member for Grayndler ( Mr Daly) has referred to an item in the Treasurer's Financial Statement for the year 1.949-50. I remind him that the committee is considering the schedule of the Supply Bill (No. 1) 1951-52. The only reference in that measure to expenditure upon the Australian Legation in Italy is to be found under the proposed vote for the Department of External Affairs. The total amount provided for the Australian Legation in Italy is £12,800, which is made up of £S,200 for salaries and payments in tbe nature of salary, and £4,600 for general expenses.

What were the allotments to the States for (a) Government distribution and (6) private distribution? 6. Have .all deliveries to the various States been completed? Development has supplied the following answers 1 and' 2. The 100,000,000 dollar loan negotiated by the Government last August has now been fully committed in that orders have been placed for goods to the value of tiie whole loan. Delivery of these orders will continue, however, till the end of 19S2. Orders for approximately 10,000 tractors of all types have been placed. Numbers of these tractors have already been' delivered but defence orders B laced on the main manufacturers in the taited States of America, have slowed down output and deliveries are a little slower than had been hoped. ' The Government is doing all in its power to speed up delivery of tractors. 3. The makes of crawler tractors being imported are Caterpillar, International, Allis Chalmers, Cletrac and John Deere and range in power from 20 to ISO drawbar horse-power. Special types of wheel tractors are being imported mainly in the light and heavy-powered types and some high clearance models. These wheel tractors will be used almost exclusively for agricultural purposes. The mokes ordered are Allis Chalmers, Case, John Deere, International, Massey Harris, Oliver and Twin City. Most of the wheel tractors ordered are kerosenepowered but a few have diesel engines. The majority of the crawlers ordered are diesel powered. 4 and 5. The Commonwealth Government hae no control over the distribution of tractors once they are in the hands of the importers, manufacturers' agents, in each State. Government aud private users alike must obtain their tractors through the agents who consequently control the final distribution. However, licences were issued to the agents in such a way as to ensure a fair division of all tractors among the States. Statistical records are not yet available to show how many of the tractors BO far delivered have gone to each State.",81,Immigration
