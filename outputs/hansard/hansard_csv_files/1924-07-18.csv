J. B. McLean, D.S.O., of Brisbane, had been unable to accept the invitation of the. Government to Bit on the commission. I ask the Prime Minister to extend that invitation to some other member of the medical profession of Queensland-no t necessarily of Brisbane. way to accept tlic invitation to sit on thc commission. We are very anxious to bave a representative of Queensland on the commission, and the Government will endeavour to obtain the services of some other medical officer of that state. WAR Treasurer's statement the other day that Colonel Semmens, chairman of the Repatriation Commission, receives a salary of £1,500 per anmim, I should liie to know from the Mimster for Works and Railways what salary that officer draws as Acting War Service Homes Commissioner. draws no salary as Acting Commissioner for War Servico Homes. His sole remuneration is his salary as chairman of the Repatriation Commission. was made in this House last week that the wireless broadcasting regulations had been framed and were on issue. Can the Prime Minister state when these regulations will be in the hands of honourable members? DidI understand the Prime Minister to say,, the other day, : that the wireless broadcasting Regulations would be treated in the same way as ordinary regulations, and would lay on the. table of. the House for a month? If so,, will honourable members be given an opportunity to move to disagree with them as a whole or in part? cipates that the regulations will be printed and issued within the next few days. Yesterduy, in reply to a question, I said that the Government does, not propose to take any extraordinary procedure respecting these regulations. There is an ordinary routine to be followed for all regulations, and that procedure will be followed in this case. DR. STEFANNSON'S OVERLAND TRIP.

16,Mr Mcneill (Wannon) [11.10],"I their crops without having the handicapthe shires to make the roads good there, because of the heavy cuttings which will be required. are slippery and the gullies boggy. Those men are suffering hardships because of the absence of good roads. The same conditions apply on the road from Coleraine to Balmoral, which touches the Melwhole of the money to the development ville Forest and the Gringe settlement. On the main road from Oasterton to Mount Gambier 'there is a considerable amount of traffic, including a daily coach both ways, but on this side of the border the road is not in good condition, although it is good from the border to Mount Gambier. The shires which control those roads have no money .for their repair. their rates to provide sufficient money for decent roads. I contend that, while it may be a laudable object to construct main roads for motor traffic, such as the Prince's Highway, from Mount Gambier through Portland, or through Orbost to Delegate, there is more urgent road construction work to be performed. Our first duty is to see that the men who are struggling along in new settlements are provided with good roads. As the money has been allocated an injustice has been done to them-an injustice which should be remedied. I have a letter here from the President of the shire of Glenelg, Mr pecting a portion of the grant-and James Ross, in which he states that his shire requires from £20,000 to £25,000 from this grant to provide anything like decent roads in the soldier settlements. They also require a grant for the main road from Mount Gambier to Oasterton, for roads in the soldier settlement territory on the border of the Glenorchy and Struan estates, and for the Dergholm-Elderslie road. That shire made application last year to the Country Roads Board, but obtained no money at all. I have a letter also from the secretary of the Kowree shire, in which he asks for £6,255 to provide a decent road from Edenhope to Goroke, near Miga Lake, in the Gymbowen country. That road is a bog. in winter time. The same conditions apply to the road from Minimay towards the South Australian border, which can hardly be negotiated in the McNeill) in liis plea for the outback wiuter months. The fair thing has not been done to these shires, which have askod the Country Eoads Board for a portion of the grant received from the Commonwealth Government. If grants are to be made to the shires, those among In winter time the hills them which control new settlements should participate, whether those new settlements contain soldier settlers or civilians. That course should be followed in preference to allocating the of a new road bordering on the coast. The Minister for ""Works and Eailways( Mr Stewart) has assured us that the Government's intention when making the grant, was that a portion of the money should, go to the shires controlling new settlements. Yet not one shilling has been allocated to those shires. I know that I shall not appeal in vain to the They cannot afford to double Minister, because he understands the conditions under which these people are working and living. I do not see on the schedule any provision for one of the most important roads in Victoria-that running from Stawell through Murtoa. Horsham, and Dimboola, to Serviceton. In the winter time if is almost impassable for vehicular traffic. Instead of spending £10,000 or £20,000 on roads in East Gippsland, the money should be spent in those old-settled districts, where the people have been labouring under the roughest of conditions for the last 50 or 60 years. Seeing that the shires are exrightly so-and that the whole of the money granted by this Government, with the exception of £5,000, which is not sufficient for one shire, has already been allocated by the Country Eoads Board and the Commonwealth Engineer, it is only fair to ask them to reconsider the matter. They would be justified in reducing the grant to some shires by £5,000 or £6,000, and by £2,000 or £3,000 in other cases, in order that the men in the new settlements may be given decent roads. That is all I ask for, and I trust that the Minister will give this matter his serious and sympathetic consideration. f 11.24] -We are all in sympathy with the honourable member for Wannon( Mr settler.

I settlement inspector, "" I am very much afraid that a number of these settlements will be failures."" He replied, "" I feel confident that 50 per cent, of them will be successes."" That is a significant remark, coming from a man who is on one soldier settlement or another every day of the week. The day will come, in my opinion, when the State Governments will request the Federal Government to forgo the repayment of a great deal of the money that has been advanced for soldier settlement Speaking as a formershire councillor, I can support the statement of the honourable member for Wannon that many shire councils carry on their work only with the aid of a big overdraft from the bank, for which they have to pay substantial interest. penny to spare to make new roads. When soldier settlements are established in country districts, not only are new roads necessary, but the existing roads are obliged to carry much heavier traffic. Two The Government should insist that some of the money now being advanced to the states for road construction shall be spent in making reads into .soldier settlements. Every conference of solOn one settlement not more dier settlers that has been held iu Victoria has. adopted resolutions requestingthe improvement of country roads. The State Governments-, cannot give effect to these resolutions unless the Commonwealth Government advances to them, mucli imoir-e money than it has done in the past, and. it could afford to use some of State Governmentsabout its surplus to do so. If the Governmen* introduced' a proposal to double its road grant to the states, it would be supported whole-heartedly by the Opposition. I hope that -the Minister for Works and Railways will consult Cabinet on the advisableness of ear-marking for the purpose of making roads in soldier settlements, some of the £1,000,000 which was voted recently by this Parliament. To do so will ensure that the settlements will, be more successful (than they can possibly be otherwise.. double difficulty faces the Minister for Works and Railways im this matter. On the one hand' the Commonwealth Government, which is advancing the money, Recently may reasonably expect to exercise a cer. said to an experienced soldier tainamount of supervision over its expenditure; and, on the othei' hand, if the measure of control which it seeks to exercise is too severeresentment will be felt by the State Governments. What is desired is that the true functions of the State Governments may be preserved, but that the Commonwealth .Government may be permitted to exercise reasonable supervision. The people of the different states must bear some blame for the unsatisfactory allocation of the money. previously advanced for road making by the Commonwealth Government. No state, except Victoria, has a well organized central road authority. There has been too much of the ""pull devil, pull tailor"" business among the local governing bodies of the states; The honourable member for Indi( Mr Cook) urged that the spending of Some of them have not a single the money should be left entirely to the State Governments.

MrO ' KEEFE called plunder. posite seem to call everything plunder. It is highly desirable that each state should appoint a central roads authority like the Victorian Oountry Eoads Board to advise on the expenditure of money voted for road making. Such a body would not only have the confidence of the state concerned, but also of the Commonwealth Government. Victoria stands head and shoulders above every other state in regard to the organization of its road construction and maintenance work. I have been urging for a long time that the Western. Australian Government should take steps to appoint a similar body in that state, and I suggest to all lionorable members who come from states other than Victoria that they would be well advised to act similarly in respect to their states. One effect of the operations of the Victorian Country Eoads Board is that this year, as last year, Victoria is the first state to allocate the money that has heen ^granted. statement the other day that not only has Ihe whole of the Victorian grant been allocated, but that most of it has been devoted to the extension of new roads which were commenced with the help of the Commonwealth Government vote last year. Victoria thus has a well-prepared and comprehensive road policy, and w ill ultimately develop a fine system of arterial highways. The board acts regardless of political influences and local considerauons for the benefit of the state as a whole. It s officers are now experts in l-oad making and repairing. When tenders are submitted for any work the board desires to have done its omcers are able to say at once whether they are f a i r or not. sion between road contractors only one tender is submitted for a particular job, the board can judge whether it is unreasonably high, and if so it can reject it . What may be called ""gentlemen's agreements "" are, therefore, not likely to eliminate the competitive basis for road work in Victoria. The adoption of the Victorian system in the other states would ensure for them the development of a proThe local governing perly formulated road policy and also the spending of Commonwealth money in an economical way. Such boards would T h is can hardly be greatly facilitate the allocation of all moneys which the Commonwealth Government, from time to time, grants for road work. I congratulate the honourable member for Wannon upon having brought this matter before the House. He has demonstrated very clearly that the allocation in Victoria has not been in the best interests of the soldier settlers and other small men on the land. Expenditure upon road construction should be devoted primarily to roads that are developmental rather than to the further improvement of first class roads for tourists and motor traffic. If we cannot have both classes of roads, those cross-roads that feed the main arteries should have prior consideration, so that the settlers may be able to travel with reasonable security and comfort, and get their products to market. Of course, we cannot have spur railways built in every direction to serve settlers who are 10 or 15 miles from a main line, and roads are the only alternative. I understand that I noticed a newspaper the allocation of the Commonwealth grant has already taken place in Victoria, and I suppose that the whole amount is already exhausted, but I hope the arguments which have been advanced this morning w ill influence the allocation of the money in the other states. The experience in New South Wales last year was similar to that in Victoria as stated by the honourable member for Wannon. The honourable member for In d i ( Mr. Cook) facetiously pictured the Minister for Works and Railways spending the whole of his time travelling through the country to inspect primitive roads. No such ridiculous suggestion has been made by honourable members on this side. The Minister can readily get from honourable members reliable information regarding If , in consequence of colluthe roads in their districts, and I do not think that any honourable member would support a claim which he did not think was justified. I have had requests from many districts in my electorate for a share of this year's grant, but I shall only mention the shires of Crookwell, Burrowa, and Goulburn. The Crookwell Shire failed to",17,Grant Fokmax Motion Of Adjournment
40,Mr Mann,Honorabl e members op,18,Grant Fokmax Motion Of Adjournment
41,Mr Lazzarini (Werriwa) [12.0],"get any portion of last year's grant, and I am very much afraid that it w ill fare no better this year. That district produces potatoes, and I am naturally interested in it because a Melbourne newspaper charged me with desiring to convert that product into currency! A railway terminates at Crookwell, and the fertile district beyond is served only by roads; which I have found by personal experience to be very bad. The shire has repeatedly asked for a portion of the money granted by the Commonwealth to New South Wales for road construction, but unless some in fluence is brought to bear on the state authorities that control the allocation, I am afraid the district will be overlooked. Burrowa, which is one of the safest and soundest agricultural districts in Australia, is again asking for assistance. town is a railway terminus, and is served by only three trains a week. The only communication with the country beyond is by roads which no honourable member would care to travel even in the day-time.. There is no necessity for the Minister for Works and Railways or any other member of the Government to travel these districts in order to be convinced of the justice of their claims. I can supply the Minister with proof that the roads are in a very bad condition, and that the expenditure of a portion of the Commonwealth grant upon them is justifiable. WhatI have said of the other two shires applies also to Goulburn, some of the outlying portions of which are in difficulties owing to the state of the roads. The local bodies have made out a good case, but I am afraid that for the reasons mentioned by the honourable member for Wannon and others they w ill be refused assistance this year as they were last year. The excuse of the controlling authority is that the Commonwealth grant is for main roads, and that the roads for which these shires are requesting money do not come within that category. But what would be the use of a main road if it did not havo branch roads to feed it with traffic ? That objection is a mere excuse on the part of the state authorities in order that they may evade their obligations. It ha!> been said that because of the smallness of the total amount available assistance cannot be given to all the districts that require it , but I should be prepared to support the Government in making available any reasonable amount for the development of the country roads. If the Government will submit a proposal to increase the Commonwealth grant to £1,000,000, or even to £2,000,000, it will meet with no opposition from this side of the House, because we regard good roads as essential to the development of rural industries. I hope that in the near future the Government w ill see its way clear to propose an increase in the grant. Although there has been general complaint in all the states regarding the allocation, of the Commonwealth's grant for road construction, I think the Minister is very fortunate in not having to police the allocation and expenditure of that money. If the Commonwealth attempted to interfere in any way with the state authorities The there would be continuous friction. I have every confidence that the authorities which are entrusted with the allocation of this money do their work conscientiously, and apportion the money in the manner that is most likely, in their opinion, to develop a sound system of main roads.

That is the principal reason for a certain portion of last year's grant being unexpended. The Commonwealth advance is misunderstood by many people to be generosity on the part of the state, but I do nfat think we need complain on that account if the result desired by the Commonwealth is attained.

This year's grant for the Commonwealth will' shortly be -allocated, and the discussion this morning-base d at it is upon the experience of last year-ma y gain for the country districts', for which this money was in tended, more sympathetic consideration than was extended to' them last year. The claimsof many municipalities and district councils were rejected last year because the road's for which tliey the money were not regarded as developmental ; but I found that a good deal of money was allocated to roads closeto Adelaide, not nearly so developmental in character as some of the roada for which assistance had been refused. The Minister for Works and Railways( Mr Stewart) may believe that the money is spent judiciously, and it is not his faul t if that is not the ease. The discussion of this motion should have a good effect upon the expenditure of the grant that is being made this year. I may appear to be parochial in referring again to Eyre's Peninsula, but it is a part of iny elecr torate which is, to a large extent, undeveloped, and in which expenditure upon road construction would be of great benefit to the people. amounts allotted tolocal authorities in this -district the money has, so far, been practically wasted. would take some thousands of pounds to put the road from Streaky Bay to M i a nipa in proper order, but as the local authority concerned' received only a small grant for the purpose I make bold to say that the money, was, to some extent, wasted. While a larger amount would be of great value in this important centre, roads in districts close to the metropolitan area received more consideration-. In the last' few years the South Australian Government removed a number of main roads from the main roads schedule of the state, not because they are not main roads, but because the GoPossibly, in future, it may vernment was trying to' dodge its responsibilities. Some of these roads are in such a state of disrepair as to be almost impassable. The people between Port Pirie and Crystal Brook, have made application for some of this grant, but as the district is closely settled they may receive only the scant consideration given to their requirements in the allocation of this year's grant. In making arrangements for a similar grant next year the Government would be well ad vised in proposing a very considerable increase in the amount, in order that the state authorities might be able to carry out really useful work, instead of merely tinkering w it h their road's as they have been obliged to do because of the smallness of the grant so far made. It would be more economical to spend a considerable sum on main road sought development in one year than to spread the expenditure of the same amount over a number of years. When shire councils hare only a few hundred pounds granted to them for this purpose the money is used in patching the roads. Because no permanent road construction can be carried out the nioney is practically wasted, and the roads require furthe r expenditure in the next year. W it h a substantial grant a shire council could carry out the work of road construction properly in the first instance and it would last a number of years. T believe that owing to the change of government in South Australia, country districts in that state w ill receive more consideration than has been given to them in the past. I have said that last year's grant in South Australia was spent in districts close to the metropolitan area. Owing to the small The honourable member for In d i ( Mr. Cook) said that the grant is intended for road construction in isolated districts.

Nearly all local bodies consider that they should participate in the .grant. I think that it was the intention of ""the Government, in making the grant, to consider the development of settled districts in the different states. I believe that intention has been carried out. Speaking for my own electorate, which is being rapidly developed, I can say that the roads have received veiy fair consideration. The honourable member for Perth( Mr Mann) has eulogized the Victorian Eoads Board and the system adopted -in this state. I believe that the Victorian system is quite a good one, and is carried out in the interests of development in this state. In South Australia we have a department in charge of roads development which is working very well indeed. I think I am quite safe in saying that it is practically free from the evil of political influence. It has its own inspectors and chief engineer, and the allocation of last year's grant was in ite hands. track from Oodnadatta to Charlotte Waters. MrM .

Once the grant ,is handed over to the State GoyemmentSj it would be impracticable for the Minister for Works and Eailways( Mr Stewart) to interfere with its allocation. The state authorities should be quite -comI commend the honourable petent!, as I feel that they are in South Australia, to deal with the expenditure of the money. There are one or two matters which should be given attention. In many instances the money is spent far away from a town. I believe that it is a compulsory condition of the grant that a road upon which this money is to be spent must be not less than 1.6 feet in widthi In a great many outlying country districts the roads are only 12 feet or 14 feet wide. If a district council spends money on a portion of a road 16 feet i<n width which has to be linked -up with a road only 12 feet or 14 feet wide, the money will be practically wasted. It should be optional with the constructing authorities :to say whether a road upon which the grant is expended shall be 12 feet or 16 feet in width. The honourable member for Wannon referred to the road between Mount Gambier and Oasterton. That is practically -the main interstate road connecting South Australia and Victoria, and until very recently it was the only road connecting those states. From Mount :Gambier to the border, a distance of 14 miles, there is a good metalled road, but for 12 or 15 miles on the Victorian side of the border there has been practically no road construction at all. That portion of Victoria has been settled for at least 70 years, and yet fhe road to which I refer is one of the worse in this state. MrM . CAMEEON -The honourable member has no conception of how bad it is. There is a continuous stream of did not clear the traffic over that road, and it is a common .thing for teams to be requisitioned to pull vehicles out of the bogs on it.

50,Mr West,"Then it must be very bad.-improve the condition of this particular road. I have no idea why it should have ibeen allowed to remain in such a state for over 70 years. It may be because it is in an outside portion of a shire, and those using it have not had sufficient influence to get it attended to. There is considerable traffic between Oasterton and Mount Gambier, and this road is specially deserving of consideration. I feel sure that, if the allocation of the grant is left square miles-nearl y twice the size of in the hands of the local governing bodies in South Australia, there will be very little complaint. We have, in considering this matter, to remember that local authorities are not always prepared to tax their ratepayers as much as they should to help themselves. One of the functions of the South Australian local government department is to see that local bodies exercise their powers to make assessments and levy rates in such a way that the revenue derived will enable them to carry out the duties imposed upon them. In making allocations .of this grant in South Australia that aspect of the matter is always taken into consideration. The allocation of the main roads grant -can be safely left in the hands of the -state departments. I congratulate the Minister for Works and Railways( Mr Stewart) on being in charge of a department that last year made a new departure as far as the functions of the Commonwealth are concerned. The Minister recognizes that the outback communities of Australia are not able to provide roads for their own use, and therefore the Government is making a grant to assist them. In Western Australia-probabl y because of its vast area and sparse populationthese road grants are particularly welcome. This national Government is aiow assuming a duty which previously was purely a state function, and is at last concerning itself with the development of Australia. under the State Government to develop Western Australia, with a population of only 300,000, and comprising, as it does, one-third of the area of the Commonwealth. I ask honourable members to visualize, if they can, an area that is two and half times the size of New South Wales, and in which there is neither rail-way nor main road. Until recently this area was considered incapable of development, but it is now being proved to be good for pastoral. purposes. It is true that it is poor country measured by eastern standards. I am speaking of the .Murchison district, carrying one sheep to twenty acres. It has an advantage over the eastern states in that it has a permanent water supply. Underground throughout an area of almost 500,000 New South Wales-fres h water is to bo obtained at a depth of froin. 20 to 40 feet, and this in a country that was once considered uninhabitable. It extends from the Murchison district right to the South Australian border-abou t 400 miles north of the trans-Australian railway. From Nullabor Plains northwards, pastoralists, not only from Western Australia, but from South Australia and New South Wales, are flocking to open up this country. The great problem is to reach these people, whose holdings must be large to enable them to make a living. A man with 150,000 acres is a small pastoralist. Owing to the high tax imposed upon the people of Western Australia by our policy of Protection-whic h I trust will never be altered-w e are unable to establish industries there. We are paying highly for our protectionist policy. -The honourable member is aware that the subject under debate is the allocation of the grant for developmental roads. that this country, which was recently shown on the map as a desert, is now being opened upj, and that developmental roads are badly needed there. I caunot expect to make even a sympathetic Minister like the Minister for Works and Railways agree to make a grant to assist the settlers in this country unless I am able to prove that it is capable of development. How is it possible for a population of 300,000 to develop the vast areas of Western Australia except in the way proI t is absolutely impossible posed by the Government in an extension of this policy? The Government is now taking upon itself the duty of opening up new country by the construction of roads. As far as the northern part of Western Australia is concerned it is impossible for the State Government to make the necessary main roads unless a larger grant is made available by the Oommonwealth Government.

Western Australia, and instead of administering it as it has administered the Northern Territory, make a grant to the people there to enable them to forim their own local government. will have to be done if that country is to be properly opened up. It is not fertile, acre for acre, as is the land in the eastern states, but it is capable of development. It is a country of vast distances, and can be brought into productive use only if taken up in large areas. It is served by a vast underground reservoir, which is second to none in Australia. Unfortunately, the settlers are troubled by the kangaroos and emus that are overrunning this area. The Eradu district was at one time almost free of these pests, but recently I saw there no fewer than 200 emus crossing a farmer's crop, doing their best to destroy it. The late Alfred Deakin used to speak of thinking "" continentally,"" and unless the Federal and other governments assist the settlers somewhat on the lines now proposed by this Government, Australia will never be properly developed. Western Australia, affords an example of the difficulty experienced with main roads. That district was rich in gold mines,' but, like most mines in similar districts, they have ceased working. declared to be in the rainfall belt, and is being rapidly settled. It is some distance from the main railway, and the roads are in a shocking condition; none in Victoria is worse. These settlers should certainly be assisted. I do not know whether other sections of the community of Western Australia were able to press their claims more forcibly than the settlers of Westonia, but the fact remains that they have not been able to obtain a grant. I hope that from the new grant they will be able to secure assistance. The distribution of the money is, of course, entirely a matter for the State Government. The Minister for Works and Railways has issued a circular for distribution among the various road boards to enable them to ascertain the exact position. It has been suggested this morning that federal members should get into touch with the different shires in their electorates, and make representations to the Minister. I am not in accord with that suggestion. The local governing bodies are in a better position to know what is required than is a Minister in Melbourne or any officer of his department, no matter how capable he may be. We have been treated generously, as the Federal Government, in setting aside a certain amount for a road Something of that sort grant, is not acting strictly within the four corners of the Constitution. The development of the outback districts is a function of the national Parliament. But the impecunious states find it impossible to assist in this direction, and the local communities have been taxed inordinately for the upkeep of roads* I trust that the Government will extend this important function which it has now undertaken. confine my remarks to the space of one minute to allow the Minister full time under the Standing Orders to reply to the various points that have been raised by honourable members. I am profoundly disappointed with the allocation of the road grant by the State of Victoria, but I anticipated as much when the Main Roads Development Bill was before the House. I sincerely hope that if there is any eviThe district of Westonia, in dence whatever of the money allocated to shires not being fully used, the money unexpended will be returned for allocation to other shires which are in great need of a grant. for Works and Railways) [12.45] -A t ""the outset, I desire to express my appreciation of the spirit in which this debate has been conducted. I have listened with interest to the honourable members who have spoken. I desire to emphasize that the object of the Main Roads Development Bill was to supplement the roads policies of the various states, and to secure the construction of additional roads. A t present there are three classes of roads policy-first , the policy of the shires; second, the policy of the states. Victoria has its Country Roads Board, but I am not familiar with the details of the' machinery of the other states. Third, we have the proposal of the Commonwealth Government to supplement the activities of the states. Last year a grant of £500,000 was made by the Commonwealth Government, which, with a similar amount this year, makes",22,Grant Fokmax Motion Of Adjournment

55,Westonia Is Now Mr Stewart (Wimmera,"Minister£1,000,000 in two years. Add to that amount a further £1,000,000 provided by the states, and we have £2,000,000 for the construction within the Commonwealth of roads which otherwise could not be constructed. Honourable members on all sides will agree that in coming to the assistance of the States in this matterparticularly when the grants are made out of revenue-w e should be particularly careful that the states do not "" go slow "" in their programmes because of it . We have, therefore, so far as possible, endeavoured to safeguard the Commonwealth against such a position arising. One of the greatest difficulties I have exnent and durable nature, it is considered perienced in administering the act has been to combat the tendency on the part of the shires to make application for small be spent. In Victoria the Country Roads grants for the patching of roads. Sums as low as £40 or £80, to pay for a few chains of metalling at different points along a road, have been asked for..

Green) that the states are in a better position to judge as to local needs than is the Commonwealth Minister in Melbourne. The views of the honourable garding soldier settlements are endorsed by us all, but the .states have control of their own soldier settlements, .and are in a better position than the Commonwealth to know the conditions under which the soldiers axe settled. In the interests of honourable members themselves., it is unwise that we should deal directly with the shires. a large country .constituency, I would be placed in an impossible position if I were expected to back up the application of every shire in my district. There would not be enough money to satisfy them all, and trouble would arise within the electorate if -one -shire obtained a grant and another -did not. Such a position I could not contemplate with equanimity. The policy is for the shires to submit their proposals to their State Governments, which winnow .them out, and submit those only which conform to the requirements of .the act. The .states supply one-half of the money, and while the Commonwealth Government stipulates the class of road to be constructed, and requires that it shall be of a permathat the states should have some say as to the locality in which the money should Board last year submitted eighteen or twenty roads to be constructed in terms of the act. In their submissions this year the roads to be dealt with are, with only one exception, extensions of the roads approved last year. Where there is not sufficient money for the whole road to be constructed in one year, if each year an additional length is added, the result, just as spread over a number of years, is to provide a considerable length of good road. But to go throughout the Commonwealth, spending a little here and a little there, in order to placate one shire or another, is not a policy which can be defended. I can assure the House that every care will be exercised in dealing with -the submissions of the states. I am sorry that I cannot entertain the proposal that we should examine the claims which have been rejected by the states. To act as an umpire in these matters is .a position I would not contemplate for one moment. deavour to get the Country Roads Board to agree to pay to the Minimay Shire the £4,000 owing to it from last year's grant for the purpose of constructing roads on the Woodlands Soldier Settlement Estate?

Notwithstanding the pacifist character of the present British Government, even it has seen fit to proceed with something in the semblance of replacements of obsolete vessels, for it hasordered a limited number of cruisers. provide work for the unemployed. us look at the matter from that standpoint. In this country many operative shipbuilders need employment, and one would expect the Opposition to support this proposal for their sake if the prospects were favorable for building one of the cruisers in Australia. If the amendment is carried the Labour party will have to bear the blame for keeping these men out of employment, for then it is quite certain no work would be available for shipbuilders. Mr E'. EILEY -Would the honourable member have the cruisers built in Australia ? matter for the Government to decide. In making up its mind it will no doubt consider aU the circumstances of the case, including the possibility of bolshevik propaganda delaying the construction of the ships if they were being built here. Personally, I should like to see these and any other war-ships' that we need built in Australia, if the work can be done advantageously to the Oommonwealth and our working people. It appears to me that it will certainly be necessary to maingotten that countries lying not many days tain in Australia a staff of skilled mechanics in order to keep these ships in a state of efficiency after they are built. The Government may be trusted to take all these matters sympathetically into consideration. We should start at the earliest possible moment to put our house in order from a defence point of view. No country in the world could possibly accuse us of aggressive motives in building these vessels, fbr although we fervently hope and pray for peace, it is wise to be prepared for eventualities, which may develop much more quickly than we now have any reason to anticipate. At present we are living on terms of amity with our neighbours, but it must be remembered that the ally of to-day is the potential foe of to-morrow. We cannot be charged with making an offensive gesture by making reasonable provision for resisting an attack. Not only are Ave thoroughly justified in taking adequate steps to protect our people, but an obligation rests upon us to do so. Heavy responsibility would fall on any Government whose dilatoriness in defence matters resulted in Australia being caught unprepared in the turmoil of war. Australia is more def enceless to-day than she has ever been in her history. During the greater part of the 130 odd years since the foundation of Australia our people have looked to the British navy for defence: and protection. In later years we certainly supplemented the protection we received from the British navy by building a small fleet of our own. But that small fleet unit is no longer effective. Until after the last war the North Sea was always regarded as the probable theatre of decisive .naval engagements, and Australia's defence was really provided for there, for the shattering of Britain's naval power in the North Sea by Germany in the recent war would have settled the fate of Australian nationality. But the position has now entirely changed. It is generally admitted from the trend of international events in these days that the centre of future naval operations, will be neither the North Sea nor the Atlantic Ocean, but the Pacific Ocean. We cannot afford to shut our eyes to this fact, and we must take notice of what our neighbours, particularly those in the East, are doing in regard to providing -naval armaments. Itshould never be fordistant from our shores are inhabited by hundreds of millions of people; and that their population is rapidly increasing.

85,Sir Elliot Johnson,"That is atoresist aggression, we may find ourselves in a very precarious position. Honourable members opposite appear to have great faith in the peaceful intentions of all the maritime nations of the world. I wish I could share in their optimism. Doubtless these nations are peacefully disposed towards us just now, but the time may come when the opposite will be the case, and they may menace our very existence. In any case it is wise to adopt reasonable protective measures. Honourable members of the Opposition take all necessary precautions to protect themselves, from burglars, for example. They insure their property and do everything they can to reduce the possibility of loss from the depredations of gentlemen whose bump of acquisitiveness is too highly developed. mit that we shall be acting on the same principle in doing all that we can to protect our people from those who may have hostile designs against us. Tof a i l to make provision for our defence will place us in jeopardy . The abandonment by the present British Government of the Singapore naval base project makes our position much less secure than it has been so far. Had the British .Government determined to continue its work at Singapore, there might have been 'some reason in certain contentions made by honourable members opposite during this debate. With a suitable naval base at Singapore the capital fehips of the British navy could, within a reasonable time, come to our assistance in time of need, but the position now is that there is no place east of Suez or Capetown which will afford a base for such vessels and afford the necessary docking facilities. It is essential that fueling and docking facilities should be available within a reasonable distance of the active operations of capital ships. The two cruisers which the Government proposes to build will help to some extent in protecting Australia, but even they will be of little use if an approaching enemy has a more effective force to oppose to them. Unfortunately Australia, even if it had the means, is not permitted by the Washington Treaty to construct capital ships. It is limited to the building of cruisers of 10,000 tons, and whilst it is our imperative duty to arm ourselves with such vessels which will be useful in protecting our commerce and shores against ordinary raiders, it is well to recognize that* they will be of very little availagainst capital ships^ because they can be destroyed before they can come within range of an enemy capital ship. According, to the highest naval expert opinion, one capital ship would be of more use to us than would half a dozen cruisers. Wehad that demonstrated during the late war. A number of German cruisers, ineluding the Gneisenau, the Scharnhorst, the Dresden, and the Bresldu were cruising in the Pacific, and there is no doubt that but for the presence of the battleship Australia in OUT waters the principal sea-ports on the eastem coast particularly would not have escaped their unwelcome attention. The Germans, however, knew that if they came I subwithin range of the Australia's guns they would be destroyed without being able to strike a blow, and for that reason they gave the Commonwealth a wide berth and steamed into American waters. Similarly, if foreign cruisers were supported by capital ships our own cruisers could not engage the enemy, and would be obliged to seek safety. That does not mean that we should' not construct cruisers; they are required for a number of defensive purposes, but we must, in addition, provide means by which we can be assured of the protection of capital ships of the Royal Navy in time of necessity. contention is that ten cruisers would be useless against one capital ship? Sir ELLIOT jOHSTSON -Yes, because they could all be sunk before getting within range of the enemy, and therefore whilst there is an obligation on us to build cruisers immediately, and later to supplement the present programme and develop other arms of defence, it is also necessary, especially having regard to the abandonment of the Singapore base, to provide in Australian waters floating docks capable of accommodating any capital ships of the British navy that may come to our help. The honorable member for Wentworth ( Mr Marks) stressed that point in the speech he delivered in the House before he left for England, and I was particularly impressed with his argument that floating docks should be constructed at convenient places on the western coast, because Eremantle is the point of arrival and departure of the greater portion of our sea-borne commerce. Whilst «",28,Defence Equipment Bill Second Reading
86,Mr Penton,"The honourable member'sI agree with that view, I submit that we must also protect the eastern sea-board, along which all our eastern and American commerce is borne. tent of coastline from Bass Strait to Torres Strait would be at the mercy of enemy raiders if our naval bases were confined to the western coast. Therefore it would be advisable to consider also the construction at Sydney, preferably in the vicinity of Cockatoo Island, of a floating 'dock capable of berthing a capital ship. I understand that recent investigations have revealed a site which offers ample depth of water for the purpose. I hope that site will be further investigated, because it must be remembered that naval docks must be capable of berthing vessels of very deep draught, for the ordinary draught of a battleship is greatly increased when, through injury from shell fire or other causes, the vessel is partially waterlogged. general defence policy of the Government hope that due regard will be paid to this aspect of the matter, and to the fact that cruisers unsupported by capital ships can be only partially effective in the work are designed, and cannot be effective against enemy cruisers supported by capital ships. the Labour party's, antagonism any preparation for defence. listened to the speeches made by honourable members opposite, and all that I can gather from them is that they have a deep-rooted objection to compulsory military training and to the replacement cf the obsolescent cruisers. seems peculiar, in view of the fact that, a few years ago, Labour members were the apostles of compulsory military training. They loudly boasted, at one time, that they were the authors of that system, the necessity for which they repeatedly stressed in this Parliament and in the country, and they claimed also that they were responsible for the establishment of an Australian navy, which was essential for the protection of the Commonwealth. Indeed, I believe that compulsory military training was formerly a plank of the Labour party's platform. Now the members of the Opposition have abandoned all those principles of defence which-they once held to be indispensable to the welfare of Australia; they have made a complete volte face, and have become Sir Elliot Johnson, pacifists of the first degree. If the reins of the Federal Government should fall into the hands of the Labour party, and The vast exthe defence of Australia should depend upon them, the outlook for this country would be black indeed, should they persist in their present policy. But I sincerely hope that better counsels will prevail. Very shortly the general defence policy of the country must be seriously considered. One of the arguments of honourable members opposite is that, the people are not able to bear a heavier burden of taxation. The answer to that is they are not asked to. There is no necessity for them to do so, when the Federal Treasurer has a large surplus. Even after the remission of a large amount of direct and indirect taxation, there should be a large balance, which might very well be applied to putting our house in order for defence purposes by the provision of When the cruisers, submarines, and destroyers, the military training of our youth, the buildis being considered I ing of .air-craft stations, and the provision of air-craft, and the establishment of munition factories. Whilsti t is true that a trained army is useless without munitions, the converse is equally truea for which they plentiful supply of munitions is of little use without trained soldiers to use them. And trained soldiers are of little use with-' I cannot understand out highly trained officers to command to them. We who advocate the precaution of I have providing the necessaries for Australian defence cannot be regarded as militarists. Preparations of that kind cannot, by any stretch of the imagination, be construed into an offensive gesture, and nobody can suspect us of aggressive intentions towards That attitude other nations. Our policy is to do the best we can while we have the means to provide, according to the advice of experts, for the defence of the Commonwealth. . My statement regarding the comparative strength of cruisers and capital ships is corroborated by a statement made by Lord Curzon, in reply to a speech by the Labour Parliamentary Secretary to the Admiralty ( Mr Amnion)Another astonishing statement which the Parliamentary Secretary to the Admiralty made was that you could protect the trade in the East by means of cruisers alone. I think his statement amounted to something to that effect. That is one of the points with which I wish to deal this evening. How could you possibly pit a cruiser of any description against a capital ship? How could you pit a cruiser, carrying 6-inch or 8-inch guns, against a battle-cruiser carrying 14-inch guns? It cannot be done. A light cruiser in such a situation would simply have to turn tail and clear out of it as fast as she could, if indeed, she gested; When a small boy, I went to sea could get away, because everybody who knows anything about the sea is aware that, if there is anything like a heavy sea on, the lighter ship feels it far more than the heavier ship. To try to protect our trade by means of light cruisers is quite impossible. Therefore, I mainfore very long he developed bellicose tentain that it is wrong that the right honourable gentleman should come and tell the House that you do not want a dock at Singapore because you do not want the capital ships. I have paid very careful attention to that expert naval opinion which says that we should not go on with Singapore, that it is waste, criminal lunacy, and so forth . only two naval experts have used such words. One is Admiral Mark Kerr, and the other is Sir Percy Scott. When the Prime Minister held up Sir Percy Scott as an expert in tin's House the other day, he absolutely insulted the Royal Navy by doing so. Sir Percy Scott has left no stone unturned during the last year or two, ever since Admiral Lord Fisher died, to rim down the Navy and belittle it on every possible occasion. He has been challenged. here, but outside, to open debate before an expert audience, and what did he do? He ran away. I asked liim to debate this question of Singapore. Admiral Mark Kerr came and debated it , but Sir Percy Seott ran away. He was invited to appear before Mr Bonar Law's committee on the capital ship, but he declined. In fact, he ran away. He always runs away, and he will not substantiate his statements before any conference. These are the only naval experts and flag-officers who have raised their voices against Singapore. We cannot disregard so great an authority as Lord Curzon on a matter of this kind. This emphasizes my own contention that it is necessary for us to consider whether the time is not ripe for the immediate construction of floating docks of sufficient capacity to accommodate capital ships, so that in time of trouble we might be able to say to the British Admiralty, "" Send us one or more of your capital ships to support our cruisers. You can do so with confidence, because we have provided means for docking and repairing them."" If we were in that position we could, with confidence, appeal to the British naval authorities to assist us. Without such facilities we shall be in a parlous position indeed, in the absence of any capital ships of pur own. I commend these matters to the attention of honourable members of the Opposition in the hope that some of them will see the error of their ways. It is not a matter of aggression, but of self-protection. I am reminded in this connection of my own experience [91] as a small boy, which has impressed upon me the wisdom of the policy I have, sugwith a number of other lads of about my own age. Some were bigger than I was, and one who was rather a hefty lad was cast ih the same watch as myself. Bedencies, which resulted in two or three encounters between us, in which I fared considerably worse than he. I found that if I wished to keep the peace with my shipmate it was necessary that I But should do all the fetching and carrying for the cockpit during my watch below. At the close of the voyage I went to a friend who introduced me to an instructor of boxing. I quietly took a few lessons in the art of self-defence, and on my nextvoyage, my bellicose shipmate, following his old tactics, I was I have challenged him myself, not soon engaged in a match with him. It is sufficient to say that he got a surprise on that occasion, whilst I thoroughly enjoyed myself. He had to do his share of fetching and carrying afterwards, and I was left unmolested 'by him. I had no belligerent intentions towards him. I took no offensive action, but I did adopt self-protective measures. I was unable from my own experience of them to rely on my own pacific intentions and defenceless position securing for me immunity from aggression. In the same way I say that, in Australia, we need to put ourselves in a state of preparedness. We do not want to be taken unawares. We do not wish to make trouble for any one else, but should trouble arise we want to be in a position to meet the trouble makers. I believe in the policy of the old seasoned warrior who, while he trusted in the Lord, always took the precaution, to keep his powder dry. [3.5],I have listened to the debate on both sides with a great deal . of interest, and I was particularly impressed by the eloquent address of the honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan). I have heard the arguments submitted by honourable members supporting the Government, and I may refer particularly to that used by the honourable member for Forrest( Mr Prowse), and also, I think, by the Minister for Defence( Mr Bowden), that it",29,Defence Equipment Bill Second Reading
87,Mr Nelson (Northern Territory),"is good policy for a man to insure bis house. We were reminded that a man insures his house, not hecause he can be certain of the offender in the event of it being burned down, but to insure himself against loss in any eventuality. That argument sounded all right, but after consideration I found that it cannot be applied to the matter now under discussion. The man who insures his house at least has a house to insure, but I fail to see that \ve^ in Anstralia, have .a nation to insure. the nucleus of a nation, and, in my opiniou, we seem in this case to be putting the cart before the horse. Some argue that our first line of defence is the Navy, and others that it is the Army. Personally, I am of opinion that Australia's first step towards defence should be the building up of a nation nioney which the Government contemplates spending upon were placed in an agricultural bank to promote primary production, development, and settlement in Australia, it would accomplish far more in a shorter time than can be accomplished by the building of cruisers, which, at best, will become obsolete within tlie next few years. Tho .policy proposed reminds me of a boy's toy balloon. No doubt, to see the Australian flag, flying from the mast of a ship and Australian-born sailors on its decks is spectacular and inspiring; but it is very much on a par with the boy's balloon, which if it is pricked leaves nothing behind it. In modern warfare it often occurs that the first line of deis that? It is the fault of our legislafence is broken through, and I am, therefore, very much concerned about what is behind our first line of defence. We have' a few badly-congested cities;, but after 25 or 30 years spent in roving over the vast empty spaces of Australia. I have come to the conclusion that the big problem which should have been tackled by governments in the past has been entirely negleeted. The Government proposes now to spend millions on the construction of cruisers, and we are invited to believe that that is not a matter of much consequence, beeause the money will come out of surplus revenue. That is all bunkum, in view of the immense national debt that is hanging over the heads of the people of Australia. It does Jfr. Nelson. not follow because we have a revenue surplus that we can afford to spend any of it in the manner indicated. If I could believe that the proposed expenditure would result in permanent good, I should have some justification for supporting it. But in the present economic position of the world I fail to see how we can be justified in expending many millions in the creation of a navy to defend us against some very improbable* enemy. We know that at the present time tbere We have merely is not a nation in the world that is prepared to face the expenditure involved in an international war. We have heard that a peace conference is to meet, to make the chances of war even more unlikely than the present economic position of the world makes them. Expenditure is proposed for the protection of our congested cities. Ports might be built for in this country. If the the protection of those on the coast, but many of our cities have been established armaments far inland, and could not bo bombarded from the coast. Although Australia's population represents two persons to the square mile, if the facts are carefully considered it will be found that we have vast areas in which the population is not one to 1,000 square miles. It is high time that we got down to the fundamental requirement of defence, and that is the building up of a nation. If we are perpetually tied to the apron-strings of the Mother Country,, that will be a reflection upon the manhood of Australia. Under existing conditions, I frankly admit that, from the pioirit of view of defence against an aggressor, Australia is in a deplorable position. But whose fault tors, past and present, who have not faced the fundamental duty of building up a nation. The defence of the country does not lie in. the expenditure of huge sums of nioney on boats that will in a few years become obsolete, but in the building up of a nation worth defending. If we tackle the problem of building a nation in a satisfactory way, the question of defence will look after itself. At present the Government, is neglecting essential things, and attending to those which are anything but essential. I stress the fact that under existing conditions no foreign nation is in a position even to contemplate the making of war. Yet the Government is proposing the construction of cruisers for our defence. By the time the reconstruction of the world's economic position has arrived, these boats will be absolutely obsolete. I claim that if the money proposed to be expended in the construction of cruisers was expended on the primary industries of Australia, particularly in its undeveloped portions, hy the adoption of a vigorous policy of immigration and settlement, that would bo a far more patriotic proposal than the one we are now considering. If these cruisers must be built-ari d there is no doubt that they will be, as the Government has the weight of numbers behind it-the n arises the question where they shall be constructed. I claim that they should be built in the Commonwealth. If we wish to acquire the status of a great country we must carry out those works requisite to the building up of a nation. struct cruisers overseas, Australia will never become self-contained. Honourable members opposite have referred to the excessive cost of the Fordsdale and other vessels as a reason why we should not build the cruisers here. But I would remind them that this argument can be applied to other commodities. If our policy were the obtaining of goods in the cheapest market, our primary industries would fare badly. Honourable members opposite, particularly those representing primary interests, would be the last in the world to sanction such a step. But from their standrpoint, that our workers should obtain their wages by the -construction in Australia of war vessels and a dock suitable for the requirements of a navy, is quite a different proposition. Too long has Australia relied upon outside sources for her requirements. It is time that we demonstrated to the world that we are self-reliant. By building these cruisers in this country, something will be done towards establishing a true basis of internal defence, so that Australia, as a nation, may be capable of defending herself and of maintaining adequate war services. The man with some interest in this country is more likely to defend it than is a man without a home. The average working man in Australia has nothing to defend. If our country is opened up to allow our workers to take their place in the ranks of the producers, they will then 'have something to defend. Only in that -way, and not by force or conscription, can we promote true patriotism. I applaud the honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan) for the sentiments he voiced last night on the subjeot of loyalty and patriotism. I enter my protest against the expenditure of millions of pounds of the people's money while Australia remains undeveloped. The time may come when the Mother Country will be so situated that Australia cannot depend upon her assistance in the event, of an. enemy attack. Of what use would be a couple of cruisers against the modern vessels of an enemy? They would be sunk, and our coastline left absolutely undefended. Eveni f Sydney and other coastal towns were heavily fortified, no enemy would obligingly place its fleet in a position at which it could be shelled. The enemy would If we conmuch prefer to land its troops on an undefended portion of our coastline, and the rest would be comparatively easy. Unless we intend to build up. the nation quickly and to provide adequate defence facilities, all this talk about expenditure on the military and naval services is so much hot air. If we first build up the nation, an adequate defence policy will naturally follow. -Most Australians, particularly those of the! party to which I belong, are peace loving. I take strong exception to a number of the speeches that were delivered from the Government side of tb» House, in which disparaging references were jnade to a pertain people in the Pacific. Such statements should not be tolerated in this House or country. The honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan) last night very truly said that such references were nothing short of provocation to a people that has always played trumps so far as Australia is concerned.

During the war, especially when tbe Emden ""was at large, without' Japan's assistance it would, have been jatmost impossible for -as to convoy our troops in safety across the Indian Ocean.. I resei\t very much offensive references to a nation that was the first to respond ito the invitation extended by .the late President of the United States -of America to attend .a conference to con .sider the reduction of armaments.

On page 19 of this report Mr Bruce saidOne other point I want to put, and tliat is again to remind the Assembly what the position is going to be if we continue to do nothing. If we do nothing, it means that within the next few years the whole of the world civilization is going into chaos, for one about the financial position of Australia, main reason that the finances of every nation will sink into such a hopeless state that there will have to be almost a complete re-organizapeople of this country have to pay every tion of the world.

During the war we managed, from no munitions at all, to build up a. munition industry that could supply the wants of an army which amounted to 400,600 men. That .will go on, and will 'be duplicated and triplicated, and even further. But tlie point I want to emphasize is that if we liave to do tiiat, then tlie whole of onr future prosperity and development is gone. Wc can do nothing -else except endeavour to protect ourselves. From Australia's point of view, that is,, above all things, important, but I venture to say that from the point of view of Europa also it would he a great disaster if Australia has got to follow a programme of that nature. He drew an appalling picture of a world for peace. of chaos resulting from the building of (hat the people of Australia, which is thearmaments.

I wish to quote the Prime Minister -again on the subject of private enterprise. On this point he is quite-emphatic, and, in view of his statements, -cannot understand why he and his followers have aboUshed certain Government undertakings. He said at GenevaThere are other subsidiary questions such -ns the private manufacture and trade in arms. Those are important, and as far as my own country is concerned, we hare very clear and definite views about them. We signed the ""Conventionof Saint Germain, and we desire .above all things to see it carried out. The manufacture of arms in Australia is eitlier done by the Government, or it is controlled by the Government, and we liave no intention of altering that rule. Those steps we hope to see token by all other nations. The man who delivered himself of that -sontimeiit is the head of the Government that sold to private enterprise the Commonwealth Woollen Mills, one of the finest institutions established under our defence scheme. Woollen Mills make armaments? to keep the bodies of our soldiers warm with, good clothing when they went to fight. There was not a better -clothed set of soldiers at the fron t than the Australians. hoots are even more necessary in war than -.some armaments. I hope the message that the Priine Minister gave to the representatives of the assembled nations was heeded, and that they returned to their countries, and said, "" We had a man from Australia who told us that armaments are under Government control in that country. He advised usto place them under Government control.""' As a result of that message, perhaps other nations have taken the manufacture of munitions out of the hands of private in -dividuals. -covenant say that it was not desirable for -private individuals to be engaged in the -manufacture of munitions of war ? M u n i tions contractors all over the civilised .world belong to tbe war-mongering class. T h a t was one of the main reasons why the When the League of Nations said that the manufactureof munitions should be removed from the selfish, grasping, grabbing control of private interests. A much maligned The few expnrt has, been quoted in this House on the subject of the Singapore base. In. that connection, I direct attention to the following newspaper extractAdmiral Sir Percy Scott, addressing the Australian Natives' Association iu London deI nounced the building of battleships, and con1 demned Singapore base as useless to AustraUa, which, be said, should easily be able to protect herself by submarines and aeroplanes. He announced that France had finally determined to discontinue building battleships. Sir Percy, Scott (says a Keuter telegram) argued, on the assumption tliat battleships were useless against modern defensive weapons, snek as airships,, aeroplanes, mines, torpedoes, and submarines. He described the Singapore base as a wicked) sehemc, and expressed the opinion thnt the Dominions should not' contribute a penny towards it. Admiral Scott said that the expenditure of f20,000,000.on the Singapore base was futile, because if battleships ever succeeded in getting tliere, which was doubtful, they would certainly never get oiit again in any .attempt to defend Australia, Kew Zealand, or any of our otlier British possessions in thc Pacific. Australia's line of defence was obviously aeroplanes, submarines, arid torpedo boats, ""against which no Hostile fleet would dare to upproach within 200 miles. I ask leave to continue my remarks.
