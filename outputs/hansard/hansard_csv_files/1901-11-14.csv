19,Mr Barton,"In reply to the honorTreasurer) -With the indulgence of the committee, I wish to make, before we proceed to deal further with the Tariff, a short statement which may relieve some of the anxieties in the minds of the public. For some time past the Minister for Trade and Customs and myself have been considering the objections which have been raised to some of the items, and we have made certain representations to the Cabinet; though honourable members will realize that the members of the Cabinet have little opportunity for meeting to fully consider these matters. Considerable objection has been raised in commercial circles to what is generally termed the package duty, which is generally ascribed to the Tariff proposals, though, as a matter of fact, the Tariff has nothing whatever to do with it, Parliament having enacted in the Customs Act that the value of goods upon which duty must be paid shall be taken as their value free on board at the port of export. The usual practice used to be to take the value of the goods in the principal markets of the country of export, and add 10 per cent., but the provision in the Customs Act makes it incumbent upon the Customs officials to charge the duty upon the rates levied in connection with the packing of the goods, and the conveyance of them to our ports. That provision was inserted in the A ct because we had ascertained from the various Custom-houses that in some countries there is a practice of charging upon the invoices a lower price for goods than their actual value, and increasing the charges for packing to make up. Experience has shown, however, that in order to prevent that fraud we have, to a certain extent, penalized those who deal honestly with us. Sir WILLIAM McMILLAN authorities ought to act upon the assumption that the people with whom they have to deal are honest. found that we are treating importers somewhat harshly, and that the provision in the CustomsA c t gives rise to anomalies and to friction. Under these circumstances, the Minister for Trade and Customs has determined to discontinue the collection of the extra duty from to-morrow, and we hope to be able to devise some other means whereby, without putting extra burdens upon those who deal fairly and honestly with us, we shall be able to make those who attempt 21 o to defraud the Customs pay what they ought to pay. The large majority of merchants deal honestly with us, but in some cases the invoices that we get do not fairly state the prices of the goods, and wherethat happens, dishonest importers are able to improperly compete with those who are trading fairly. There are also certain duties in the Tariff which have not operated as we expected, and have caused friction. We, of course, desire to work as harmoniously as possible with those who have dealings with the Customs, and it is to the interest of both parties that the best feelings should exist. Three of the duties complained of are duties upon articles in regard to which we have laid down the rule that there shall be a charge upon the cubic measurement. We had a similar rule in regard to some items in the Victorian Tariff, but I do not know that it was in existence in any of the other States, and the trouble which has arisen in the working of the Commonwealth Tariff did not arise in Victoria. This rule applies to item 85earthenware, &c to item 89-glasswar e --and to item 92--monumenta l stone, &c., the duty in the first case being 6d. per cubic foot and 15 per cent, ad valorem, in the second case 8d. per cubic foot and 15 per cent, ad valorem, and in the third case 5s. per cubic foot and 15 per cent, ad valorem. We propose to substitute from to-morrow the following duties : For earthenware and glassware-item s 85 and 89-2 0 per cent., without measurement charge ; and for monumental stone-ite m 92-5s . per cubic foot, without the ad valorem duty. There are also articles upon which what are known as composite duties are charged, and while we The Customs consider some of these duties right and justifiable, further information leads us to believe that in other cases they operate unfairly towards importers. So far we have not been able to fully consider the objections raised in every case, but we have considered the objections in some cases, and I intend to mention those which may come under the cognisance of hononable members to-day or to-morrow. The first composite duty is that upon cigars, which are charged 5s. 6d. per lb. and 15 per cent, ad valorem. We think that those are charges which we can justify, and we therefore propose to ask the committee to allow them to stand. With",15,Protectivedutie S

21,Sir Geoege Turner,"We haveregard to the duties on cocoa, chocolate, and confectionery-ite m 17-whic h are 2d. per lb. and 15 per cent, ad valorem,,, as the amount imported is comparatively small, and as the duties have created some anomalies, because some of the articles to which they apply are the raw material of certain industries, we intend to reduce the duty to 2d. per lb., and abandon the 15 per cent, ad valorem. In the item of tea, which of course is a very important one, from which a considerable amount of revenue is derived in all the States-and I believe in all countries where they have duties as a means of raising revenue-ou r proposal was that there should be a duty of 2d. per lb. on ordinary tea and 3d. per lb. upon packet tea, plus, in both cases, 20 per cent. We have had some little experience in the working of these duties, and it does appear that it woidd be very difficult, from a departmental point of view, to collect them in the manner which we have pursued. It would probably involve the necessity of having all tea tested, and would create a good deal of trouble to those who import tea, and probably a considerable amount of friction. As time wore on, these difficulties might possibly be overcome, but there would always be a considerable amount of trouble in arriving at the true value of the tea sent here, and while treating fairly with those who send proper invoices, we might, in dealing with China and other countries, have invoices upon which we could not rely. ply to cigars ? think so. that it will apply to cigars to the same extent. surer asked the concurrence of the comAs far as we can investigate the matter, it seems much more easy to determine the fair value of cigars than to arrive at the evervarying value of tea. W it h regard to tea, we propose to abandon the composite duty, and ask the House to impose a duty of 3d. per lb. upon ordinary tea and 4d. per lb. upon packet tea. Mr V. L. SOLOMON -Why should there be an additional charge upon packet tea 1 cuss that when we come to the item. I am making this short statement in order to acquaint honourable members with, the intentions of the Government. These are the I only matters with which we have had an opportunity of dealing up to the present time, but on Tuesday next we shall be prepared to mention to the committee all the other matters in regard to which we think we may fairly ask the House to make alterations in the proposals which have been submitted. There are a number of items, such as tea, rice, kerosene, and cotton goods, winch are looked upon as practically only revenue duties, and it will be a matter for our consideration whether we shall not ask the committee to deal first with the rest of the Tariff, in order that we may see how it is finally settled, allowing these four large revenue-producing, items to stand over. In the meantime we shall have some experience of the revenue-producing power of the other items,, and that will guide us in asking the House to take a certain course in regard to the purely revenue-producing items I have mentioned. It will be well for honourable members to turn this suggestion over in their minds so that we may be able to readily ascertain the feeling of the committee when we come to the items. These are all the matters which up to the present we have been able to determine, but on Tuesday next we shall make a statement with reference to any other items upon which alterations may seem to be advisable* and mention exactly what changes we are prepared to suggest. did not hear the beginning of the very important announcement made by the Trear surer.

29,Mr Reid,"I congratulate the GovernMajesty's Ministers. Some of the announcements of the Treasurer are naturally hailed -with pleasure by the Opposition, because, as honourable members know, we made a very strong attack upon a large number of itemsi n the Tariff. Our complaints in regard to a small number of items have now been removed, but I understand that the statement, of the Treasurer is only an instalment of favours to come. This is a preliminary announcement of the reductions in the stock-in-trade of His Majesty's Government. I heartily congratulate Ministers in so far as their revised and reconsidered decisions tend to bring tlie Tariff more in harmony with sound principles, and I hope that having, in view of the storm of indignation in this House and everywhere else against the composite rates, agreed to remove some of them, the Government will see their way to go further and remove all of them. I think it will conduce to straightforward dealing if the public are allowed to know what those duties really mean in point of rate and impost. I think one of the least concessions Parliament can make to the public in the interests of an intelligent understanding of the system of taxation under which they live, is that the rates of taxation should not be cunningly concealed. The rate of taxation by the foot measurement is an absolute disguise as to the incidence of taxation, and it is adopted for that purpose. Ministers have not invented this composite rate-it was in existence in ""Victoria. Sir WILLIAM LYNE in the United States and in Canada. existence in other countries as well. posite rates in Victoria.

I do not wish to enter into a general discussion at this stage, but I shall wait with interest the explanation of the Government as to their method of proceeding, if they agree to remove some of the composite rates and not all of them. I admit that we cannot expect an explanation at present, but I shall await developments with great interest. In the meantime, I have received the announcements of the Treasurer with the greatest possible pleasure, and now that we have enlightened Ministers sufficiently to bring them more into line with our views, our utmost efforts will be devoted to further that beneficial process, so that at least we can have a Tariff which we need not fight to the very death. I hope that will be the outcome of the reconsideration of the Tariff by Ministers. MightI ask the Treasurer, regarding a matter which is almost as important as crockery, what decision Ministers have arrived at in respect to the inclusion of agricultural machinery in the free list 1 I cannot understand why they should reduce the duty on crockery and not include machinery and agricultural impleI t was in existence ments in the free list.

I hope Ministers have discovered the .folly of trying to perform that operation, .. and that they will abandon the duty on butter-boxes, because this is a matter of . great importance to thousands of people.

Is there a man, excepting tht The right honourable Customs authorities, who knew when we were listening to the speech of the Minister for Trade and Customsi n announcing I confidently expect that these duties-o r did . the right honourable gentleman tell the House-that they would be charged on the bringing of the goods down to a port of shipment, and on tht before their constituents, cases and packing ?

If it had been my pecuniary interest, I should have taken trouble to look into the matter, as any business man would. This is a matter which affects all business men very keenly, but to men in other occupations, it does not come home so vividly, and consequently may be overlooked. Speaking for myself, I never dreamt when the Minister for Trade and Customs announced the percentages on the articles, that there was to be the same percentage on the cases which contained them. It is perfectly obvious that had we known such a duty was to be imposed, a great deal more would have been heard about the matter when the Customs Bil l was under consideration, and I , at any rate, should have had some strong observations to make.",18,Honourable Members Hear Hear

If the Government had not brought down this infamous proposal, we should have been saved a world of time in attacking and discussing it, but now we are happy in the reflection that our attack has had a fruitful result. life the Minister for Trade and Custom is eating humble pie and admitting that that Tariff, which was to astonish the world, is f u l l of imperfections.

The argument in favour .of the amendment was that 'the high duty would lead, not to an increase of revenue, but to a decrease, and I pointed out that in one of the smaller States, and in the largest State of the Commonwealth, although the duty on proof spirit was set down at a certain sum, there was an allowance for under proof. The effect of that allowance in South was that, instead of the duty being 15s. on case spirits, .all the best and most reliable brands of a strength of 16.5 under proof, it was only 12s. '6d. per gallon. showing that in South Australia the result of the allowance was that the people received the very best brands of imported spirits, bottled, corked and capsuled in the distilleries of the firm whose names were attached. twice as much case whisky and brandy under proof, as of bulk whisky and brandy. On the other hand, in Victoria, where they had a duty of 12s. per gallon levied on proof and under-proof spirits, and where it was no advantage to introduce case spirits or underproof spirits, tlie result was quite different. The result was that the quantity of bulk whisky imported into Victoria was more than double that of case whisky, that the good brands which the people can rely upon and see in bottles, securely corked and labelled, were not imported in anything like tlie same ratio that they were imported into South Australia. to ascertain the position in regard to New South Wales, but I find that it is impossible to separate the importation into that State of case spirits from the importation of bulk spirits. It seems to be absolutely demonstrated, however, so far as South Australia and Victoria are concerned, that in the State in which there was an allowance made for under-proof spirits the importation of case spirits of known and well-matured brands exceeded that of bulk spirits by more than two to one, whilst in the other States Mr V. L. Solomon. in which the ordinary rate of duty -was whole discussion over again. formerly .charged upon the spirits, irrespecfrom tive of whether they were proof or underbeen proof, the result was exactly the reverse. Whether these proof spirits, before being supplied to the public, were ^broken down in a simple way, or whether that object was achieved by means of inferior colonial spirits Yesteris a matter that is probably better known to Victorians than to myself. If we insist upon duty being paid upon proof spiritswithout making any allowance for underproof spirits, we shall be offering to tlie distillers of the old country an absolute premium to send out nothing but proof spirits, and to the wine and spirit merchants of Australia to indulge in all sorts of adulteration. I venture to think that the revenue will be better off under the system which I Australia suggest than under tlie Government proposals. If it were otherwise, how is it that which generally include the South Australian Government, of which the present Minister for Trade and Customs was the head tor some five or six years, never I quoted figures saw fit to alter the incidence of the taxation upon spirits, despite the fact that Tariff alterations were made during that period, which was one of great financial difficulty 1 One firm in Victoria, whose names I shall not mention, puts the position thusIn that State there is received The levyingof the duty on the basis of per proof gallon, with .no allowance for underproof, acts as a deterrent to the importation of old matured spirits, as the trade decline to buy a bulk spirit of an under-proof strength, because by the difference between proof .and milder-proof of the importation is the cost of the spirit per gallon increased. This, to our knowledge, has had to be overcome by distillers and blenders on the other side of the world in their shipments to such of these States as have not had the advantage of a duty providing for an under-proof strengtlvaading a percentage of pure spirit sufficient to raise the shipping strength to a few degrees (about 3 degrees) over proof. Is that the sort of thing that we wish to encourage? While endeavouring, to the I have-since endeavoured best of our ability, to protect the revenue of the Commonwealth, surely we desire to encourage the importation of the best class of spirits for the purposes of public consumption. A t any rate, we do not desire to encourage the introduction, in bulk, of spirits which are not pure, which have to be broken down, manipulated, and, perhaps, adulterated with colonial spirits, with water, or with a host of other things that are -known to the trade, and which are afterwards vended to the people of Australia. tween breaking down the spirits at home and breaking them down here ? MrV . L . SOLOMON -The spirits come from the old country under the brands of distillers who have a reputation at stake, and whose reputation would not live six months in the opinion of the Australian public if the quality deteriorated. In that fact we have a security that the bottled spirits which are properly corked and labelled, and which come off the shelves of hotels,, are what they are reprethat, instead of getting a gallon of spirit in sented to be. The Treasurer put it somewhat inadvertently yesterday tliat the advantage to be gained by the imposition of this duty lay in the fact that a number of people would be employed in bottling and labelling in Australia. That is a very pretty protectionist idea which I do not think has much relation to the duty upon spirits. I submit that it would be wise to adopt the system which has been in vogue in New South Wales and South Australia, of making a proper allowance for underproof .spirits not exceeding 16""5 degrees? Such a step will result in a better class of liquor being imported into the States than will be imported if we offer this absolute premium to the importers to introduce nothing but whisky, brandy, &c, up to the f u l l strength of proof. I have not the -slightest fear that the adoption of the amendment will prove detrimental to the. best interests of the revenue. On the other hand I believe that the revenue will gain by encouraging the importation of such brands of case spirits as Crawford, Walker, Dawson, Catto, Buchanan, and half-a-dozen others, seeing that the distillers who bottle them are interested in keeping their quality up to a pure and proper standard. The people in Australia who consume the spirit would soon know if it went below that standard. I did not move the amendment for party reasons, and I have not even discussed it with the leader of the Opposition. stand the honourable member for South Australia, Mr ""V. L . Solomon, making such a fuss about this matter, because if he has been in the trade he knows that what he has been telling the committee is not correct. good many years, and I know what takes place. He would have us believe that the only straightforward business people are bhose in England; that the Australians are all rogues, and would dish you up anything. The best spirit I ever sold while I was in the business was a spirit that came from Victoria. If water must be put into the spirits to be consumed, let it be Australian water, not English or Scotch water. Then we shall know what we are getting. No doubt an honest trader will sell spirits for a fair price, but you can get from dishonest traders what purports to be the same article for about half the money, but then you find six bottles, there is only that quantity in nine bottlos, and the public are expected to bake the value of their money in glassware. One honourable member said last night that the Government acted unfairly in charging duty where the actual quantity was only a gill above the reputed quantity in the case, but in my experience that never occurs. If any one needs to be protected, it is the consumer, who, in buying six bottles, instead of getting a gallon, nearly always gets a .gill or two under. W it h regard to the quality of the imported article, some of the greatest rubbish that ever came into Australia has come in under Usher's brand, and is really not Usher's whisky at all, though it is sent here from the old country. Mr V. L. SOLOMON -It is probably bottled in Victoria from spirit imported in bulk. bond, and when I complained to the merchants about it they asked me to send it back, and paid the freight both ways, charging me nothing. They afterwards informed me that it was a complete fraud, and that they were glad that I had drawn .attention to the matter. As a matter of fact, Usher is not a distiller, but a blender, buying whisky from the distilleries, and blending and bottling it . What is there to stop such an industry being carried on in Australia ? The honourable member for South Australia, MrV . L . Solomon, made a great mouthful about it, but I know that in Great Britain there are two or tliree towns whose whole population depends upon tbe bottling industry, and if the Government could create such a town here, free-trader as I am, I should be ready to give them credit for what I was in the trade for a they had done. The honourable member knows that the brand on a bottle is often no index to the quality of the spirit contained in tlie bottle, and he must be aware that the",20,George Turner I Have Told The Of Parliament

The whole of Australia is now open to the locally made article, whereas in a number of States a duty of 12s. per gallon formerly operated. seems to be a fair thing in the interests of the revenue that this industry should contribute excise. the suggestion of the honourable member for South Australia is a very good one. I fear that if large establishments for the manufacture of sparkling wines are started in Australia, the effect will be to diminish the revenue from the imported article.

Government propose to charge a duty of 14s. per gallon upon wine containing more than 35 per cent, of proof spirit; but in Victoria hitherto the practice has been not „to charge increased duty on wine containing 40-5 per cent, or less, and in New South Wales 40-7 per cent, or less, of proof spirit. In Great Britain, the practice is to charge Is. 3d. per gallon on wine containing 30 per cent, of proof spirit; 3s. per gallon on wine containing above 30 per cent, and not more that 42 per cent., of proof spirit; and an extra 3d. per gallon for every degree exceeding 42 per cent, of proof spirit. It is stated by those in the trade, and representations have been made by certain Chambers of Commerce, that certain ports and sherries run up to 37 or 37 5 per cent, of proof spirit, and cannot be carried through the tropics if they do not contain over 35 per cent. When the Distillation Bill was under discussion here, it was stated that some of our sweet colonial wines could not be carried to Great Britain unless they contained a considerable percentage of spirit. provides that no person shall sell Australian wine containing more than 35 per cent, of proof spirit. no power to enforce that provision, though if a person who is fortifying or blending It wines has a Customs officer to supervise the fortification, that officer can refuse to allow more than 35 per cent, to be added to the wine. than that. of fact the Commonwealth Government could not prevent wine containing over 35 per cent, of proof spirit from being shipped to Great Britain or elsewhere, nor interfere with its sale in the local hotels. There are good sound wines of recognised brands which have been coming here for many years which contain over 35 per cent., but under 40 per cent., of proof spirit; and it seems to me that consideration should be given to such wines. They should not be charged tlie full spirit duty. Another matter to which I would refer is this : A large quantity of wine is now on the water, or being shipped in execution of orders at the sources of supply, or in bond, which, under the State Tariffs, would not have been required to pay the full spirit duty, and it would be a great injustice to the importers if the duty were increased without notice. I suggest to the Minister that a certain duty should be charged for wine containing not more than 35 per cent, of proof spirit, a higher duty for wine containing not more than 40 per cent., and, if necessary, the full spirit duty for wine containing more than 40 per cent, of spirit. The Minister is in a better position to prevent the consumption of injurious imported wine than to prevent the consumption of injurious colonial M'ine, because the latter comes under his control only in the process of fortification, while he can, by proclamation, at once put a stop to the importation of what he considers deleterious wines.

I believe that the better class of ports and sherries cannot be brought here unless they contain over 35 per cent, of proof spirit, and hitherto such wines have been permitted to enter Victoria, Tasmania, the other States, and New Zealand. I have here the results of tests of two samples of colonial port: one delivered in Melbourne three months ago, and the. other delivered on the 12th inst. sample proof spirit, and the second 37 per cent.; and I am informed that that amount of spirit is necessary to prevent the fermentation of the sugar in ports and sherries. In my opinion the Government will lose revenue if they insist upon the high duty now proposed upon such wines. members do not wish to be unjust in this matter to either the importer or the local producer ; but lately, when the Distillation B ill was under consideration, we applied ourselves to the consideration of the question where does wine end and spirit begin, and we laid ib down in the clearest terms that wine must not contain more than 35 per cent, of proof spirit. In my opinion, when a man buys wine he should not be given something almost red-hot with spirit. In the famous section over which there was so much debate, it was provided that no Australian wine should be fortified so as to contain more than 35 per cent, of proof spirit, or with any other than with pure wine spirit. It is provided that no person shall sell any Australian wine containing more than 35 per cent, of proof spirit. broken, but if we get information upon which we can enforce the law, we shall take action. We find that the deliberate and well-conceived intention of the Federal Parliament is, that wine shall not be made of a greater strength than 35 per cent., and what we now propose is that if persons bring what they call wine into the Commonwealth, they shall at least be subjected to the same disabilities as the Australian wine-grower. If the imported wine contains above 35 per cent, of spirit, it shall be considered as spirit and dealt with accordingly. Sir have a sliding scale to some extent, instead of having two arbitrary amounts so wide apart as 8s. and 14s. 1 line where one thing ends and another commences. In this connection we have received veiy strong representations from representative bodies, and I shall quote one authority which will particularly interest the honourable member for North Sydney, namely, the Wine Association of New South Wales.

140,Mr Kingston,"Perhaps the same arwould place our wine-growers at a disadvantage. Minister for Trade and Customs has given a great many reasons, b u t none are good except one, namely, that 35 per cent, is the margin of spirit strength which has been fixed for Australian wines. If. there were any power to enforce that law,, and if it were being, enforced, there might be some reason for applying a. similar rule to foreignwines ; but the Minister knows perfectly well, tliat if any one chooses to add 15 per cent, of spirit to a wine already containing 35 per cent, of spirit, and export it to London, there is no power on the part of the Commonwealth Government to inters fere. Furthermore, if any hotel keeper chooses to fortif y wine up to 50 per cent., bhe Commonwealth Government has no power whatever to interfere with him. Therefore, there is no question of restraint upon the admixture of spirit with Australian wine. I never desired that articles manufactured in the Commonwealth should be treated less advantageously than those imported, but Ministers desire that special treatment shall be given to the Australian manufacturers. Our wine-makers have not to pay one penny of duty upon Australian wine, apart from the duty charged on spirit used for fortification purposes, and they are actually encouraged to fortif y their wines, because special facilities are offered for obtaining spirits for fortification purposes at a low rate of duty. I understand that the Government intend to deal with the importers of wines in the same way that they are willing to treat importers of spirits, and that with regard to wine shipped prior to the imposition of these duties they will make the same provision as in regard to spirits similarly shipped. Sir wines in the same way as we are dealing with shipments of spirits 16-5 degrees under proof, if we are satisfied that bhere is no attempt to get at us. easily protect themselves as to that, because the date of shipment is easily fixed. There is no use in going to a division in this matter, lesser quantity, weight, size, or value. because the protective incidence of the duty will insure the defeat of any attempt to reduce it . I am glad, however, of the assurance that justice is to be done to the extent of allowing, some concession with regard to goods that were ordered and shipped prior to the Tariff coming into operation. . increasing the duty will inevitably be to diminish bhe importation of wines of high strength, and thus the revenue' will suffer. Moreover, now that the wines produced in. Victoria and New South Wales and in South Australia can pass from State to State without hindrance, the importation of foreign wines into Queensland, Tasmania,, and Western Australia must fall off. There will be no corresponding, excise duty, and the tax will become a purely protective one. Surely that cannot be desired by the Government, because it would mean a diminution of revenue all round. I do not mind making a prophecy, that in the course of three years there will be an absolute failure of revenue in this particular respect. 1 The duty has been raised in the Sbate of New Soubh Wales from 7s. bo 14s. ab a jump, though in Victoria, in many cases, there will not be much increase: We have already raised the duty on wines not otherwise enumerated to a large extent, and the revenue from ports, sherrys, and perhaps clarets, will also be diminished.

It is not to be supposed it strikes me as remarkable that the desire that it is the duty of the Commonwealth to make a profit out of so abominable and deadly a vice, but it should be our object to impose such a duty as would absolutely prohibit the use of the article for any but medicinal purposes. I recognise that if we increase the duty too much smuggling will be resorted to, as opium is an article which lends itself to the smuggler's machinations ; in spite of every effort made by the Customs officers, large quantities of opium are brought in without the payment of duty. I do not think, however, that the increase of the duty to 30s. per lb. would have the effect of very greatly stimulating the operations of the smugglers. If by increiising the price of opium we could deter the white population of these States from using it, we should do some good, because whatever may be said as to the evils attendant upon tlie drinking habits of our people the vice of opium smoking has far more deadly effects. It is a new and abominable innovation, one of the curses of eastern barbarism that we have incurred owing to our com' mercial intercourse with eastern nations. There is no sort of reason why we should countenance, or in any way approve of, the introduction of the article, and I shall gladly support any proposal to increase the duty. sympathy with the opium smoking habit, but, at the same time, we desire to obtain a fair amount of revenue; although, of course, if we were discussing the matter from a certain aspect, we should not be sorry to see opium done awa)' with altogether. think that we shall be acting fairly under all the circumstances by accepting a proposal for the increase of the duty to 30s. no objection to altering the amendment from 24s. to 30s. The only reason that deterred me from proposing a larger increase in the first instance was tliat I was very much afraid that if we fixed the duty too high it would lead to a large increase of smuggling. W it h the consent of the committee I shall amend my amendment. Amendment amended accordingly. It is very gratifying to find honourable members on both sides of the House ready to do anything that may be calculated to put a stop to the opium habit. A t the same time for increased duties should have been expressed by honourable members on the other side of the House, and that the principle that duties should not be imposed for revenue purposes only should have been adopted by them. I think the Government would do well to consult their experts with reference to this matter. I do not know whether it is desired to poison all the Chinamen who smoke opium, but I would point out that the result of a very high or jirohibitive duty will be to make the Chinamen resort to the smoking of inclii, which corresponds in opium to nicotine in tobacco. It is the smoked-out opium, and the poorer class of Chinamen, who cannot afford such an expensive luxury as opium, which costs Is. per smoke even in Melbourne, very largely resort to tlie smoked-out opium for which they pay a small price. I agree with honourable members that revenue ought not to be the only consideration in a matter of this sort, and it would be well for Ministers to take the advice of the best experts they can get as to the effects of the proposed high duty upon opium consumption. Men who want opium will get it, whatever the price may be, because the unfortunate habit is so strong that men will pay anything for it , and I hope tlie Ministry will give this matter very careful consideration. not anticipate tliat the revenue will be affected through smuggling consequent upon increased duties, because in the Northern Territory the duty on opium was We fixed at 30s. and the result per head was a little greater than in South Australia. I assume that the opium smoking is confined to Chinameni n South Australia, and certainly there is no greater proportion of white opium smokers in South Australia than in the Territory. The opium duty at 30s. per lb. in theNorthern Territory yields over £6,000 a year whilst the 20s. duty in South Australia yields £286 per annum. As the Chinese population in the Northern Territory is about 4,000 and theChinesein South Australia number 200, it will be seen that the productivity per head of the 30s. duty is as great as that of the 20s. duty The Treasurer told us to-day that the package duties would be removed to-morrow.

203,Mr Conroy (Werriwa),"Opium takesa necessity to the hulk of the people in Eastern countries, and in hot climates, such as the northern parts of Australia, than is alcohol to Europeans; should find that those who use alcohol in preference to opium have nothing on which to pride themselves so far as degrading effects are concerned. The great bulk of the people in Eastern countries are as moderate, or even more moderate, in the use of opium than we are in the use of alcohol. ""We cannot do better than refer to Dr. Dymock, one of the great authorities India on this question. was sent for by the Indian and went growing districts of India, where he found that the great majority of the agricultural people did not use the drug. At all events it is far less injurious in the quantities in which they use it than the corresponding amount of alcohol would be. I intend to consider the question of the importation of this drug primarily from the stand-point of revenue, and secondly from the point of view of its medicinal usefulness. Erom the point of view of revenue it seems to me that a high duty will not prevent the use of opium, although it may diminish the quantity that pays duty as smuggling tlie Ministry consult their officers upon this matter they will find that a duty of 20s. per lb. upon this as high au impost as ought to be sanctioned. I am, therefore, inclined to agree with their proposal. The honourable member for Laanecoorie has urged still stronger reasons why we should not increase the rate of duty, and upon a question of this sort his words should command We shall not be wise to take a high moral attitude upon this question. who have investigated the effect of opium smoking in eastern countries have said that if they had the power they would not put an end to the use of the drug in that way, and medical men have asserted that in hot climates its use is nob so injurious as the use of alcohol. To make a proper comparison between the effects of opium and of alcohol, one should compare, nob inbemperabe users of opium wibh bemperabe users of alcohol, bub inbemperabe users of opium with intemperate users of alcohol.

For my sins I had to spend a little time in India, and I saw there the evils of opium consumption, and its advantages as far as there are any, and I say at once that there is no sort of reason why in hot climates opium should be used.

The natives of India are not habitual drunkards, but it have one day's ""burst"" at intervals of, say, three or six monblis. When this desire comes upon an Indian, his practice is to go out with the one idea of getting drunk. He gets drunk, and lies in a ditch until he gets sober, and when he recovers he is his own man again for another three or six months. The consumption of opium, as practised by a great number of people in India, is distinctly deleterious, and has bheeffect of absolubely paralyzing bhe physical and intellectual powers. A man who commences to take opium cannot abandon the what De Quincey says in his Confessions of an Opium Eater. Soi t is with the natives of India. They take opium constanbly, and good men degenerate and become utterly incompetenb by reason of the persisbent use of the drug. Shall we hesitate, then, to make it difficult for those amongst us-Chinese, for the most part, I fervently hope-to obtain it ? As to the Minister for Trade and Cusboms will be as well able bo prevent bhe smuggling of opium bearing a duby of 30s. per lb. as if ib were subject to a smaller duty. However, that is a matter of administration, and it is our duty to do what we can evil by imposing upon opium the highest duty that we can. We are not moving in this direction simply for the sake of increasing the revenue, but we should make those who indulge in this evil habit pay as heavy a charge as possible bo the Stabe, and, providing the Minister makes some arrangement by which opium imported strictly for medicinal purposes can be admitted at some lighter duty, I think we may very well levy a higher impost than that proposed by the Government.

I could refer to evidence given before Royal Commissions in England and elsewhere, showing tlie dreadful results of opium smoking.

A t present we appear to be anxious to obtain revenue from a traffic in which we do not believe, and which is demoralizing a large number of families in the Commonwealth. I speak somewhat warmly, because I have looked into this matter, and feel that in the interests of the people some drastic steps should be taken. I hope the Government will take prompt action not vviththe sole view of obtaining revenue, but to prevent opium from being brought into tlie Commonwealth. I am informed that when once a person becomes addicted to opium smoking it is very rarely that he is able to emancipate himself from the baneful habit. Eor that reason I trust that the Government will see fit to carry out the provision of the Customs Regulations Act, and prohibit the continuance of this demoralising traffic. worth) I think that every one will agree that the opium traffic is one of the greatest evils with which we have to contend in our social life. I am aware that the evil of opium-smoking is a very extensive one, and that it ramifies all through Australia. A t the same time. I think we ought to hesitate before taking to such an extreme step as prohibiting the importation of this drug. If there is any desire to take that step I think it would be better to defer the consideration of this item. Personally I should be inclined to increase the duty, even up to 40s. per lb., in preference to prohibiting the importation tically 40s. per lb. because the weight of the tins is included. attempt to prohibit the importation of any particular article, but allow it to be admitted under certain exemptions, we at once open the door to all kinds of fraud. It is like prohibiting the importation of liquor and then allowing chemists to dispense it . I think, therefore, that great danger is to be apprehended from the absolute prohibition of this drug. It is well for us to advance cautiously, to increase the duty first and to observe what the effect of that increase is. If we attempt to prohibit its introduction we shall involve the Customs department in an enormous amount of trouble besides offering a premium to swindling, whilst to a large extent the provision will remain a dead letter. If that were Of course I believe in adopting stringent measures with regard to the admission of any article which affects the health and character of the people, but, at the same time, I am adverse to enacting any law which in its operation will be ineffective. Instead of going to the extreme proposed by some honourable members it would be well to increase the duty. perpetuate the evil. statement is all very well, but we are a British community, and are not inclined to adopt the extreme measure of prohibition in a matter of this kind. I strongly urge that we should be satisfied with increasing the duty, and if experience subsequently demonstrates that more stringent measures are needed we can adopt them. very glad that the Government have accepted the proposal to increase the duty upon this article to 30s. per lb.

241,Mr Kirwan (Kalgoorlie),"I amstand-points, and both of whom are to my mind wrong. The honourable and learned member for Werriwa favours the retention of the duty at 20s. per lb. He urges, amongst other things, that if the duty is increased it will operate harshly upon those who use opium for medicinal purposes. But I claim that the quantity of opium which is used for medicinal purposes is so small when compared with that which is used for commercial purposes that his argument does not carry much weight. I am not in favour-as is the honourable member for Macquarie-of the prohibition of the importation of opium, because I believe that the craving for this drug is so strong amongst those who have once acquired the vice, that they will obtain it no matter at what cost. Moreover, prohibition would increase smuggling, whereas, an advance in the duty to 30s. per lb. will not have that effect. I should like to point out that the smuggling of opium can be carried on in a very simple way. I have just been handed the Victorian Hansard for 1891, which contains a report of the debate which took place in the State Legislative Council when the Opium Bill was before that Chamber. I understand that that bill prohibited the importation of opium, but it was not carried. The Hon. F. S. Dobson diiring that debate described the methods by which opium may be smuggled into Australia. He saysFor instance, how was it*thnt opium oould be wish to say that even if the committee, in its bought in Little Bourke-street for a much less earnest desire to mibigate the evils of opium price than would be charged for it elsewhere? smoking, prohibits the importation of that When lie first became aware of the fact, he was drug, it will continue to be smuggled into very curious about it, and a Chinese merchant, Australia, the revenue being in no way benenow dead, let him into some of the secrets. In fact, the man went so far as to admit that he had fited. I believe that, before any reform made a very large amount of money by smuggling can be effected, public opinion must be opium, and he explained some of the methods educated up bo a proper standard. Thereadopted. One plan was to purchase in Holland a fore, I think that the proposal of the large consignment of Dutch toys of a hollow character. These were sent on to China, where every Government is the wisest one under tlie hollow was filled up with opium, after which the circumstances. goods were forwarded to Amsterdam, from thence carried to London, and thence to Melbourne. say one word in explanation. I certainly Another plan was to buy cedar logs at Manilla, and fill every possible hollow in them with opium. One did not bhink bhab my remarks implied any of the most successful plans of all was to purchase desire upon my parb to increase the cona lot of cigars in Manilla, and put in every box of sumption of opium. If prohibition could be them a few solid cigar-shaped masses of opium, covered round with tobacco leaves, there not absolutely insured I should be quite content being enough in any box to make a noticeable to submit to it . That, however, was not difference in the weight. That Chinese merchant the question before the committee. The seemed to think he had done a creditable thing in question which we were debating was smuggling opium into Victoria in such ways. When smuggling can be carried on in such from a duby of 30s. per lb. than from one a simple way it is almost impossible for the of Customs authorities to effectually prevent the cannot stop the importation of opium. introduction of opium. I think, therefore, that the committee cannot do better than vote for an increase of the duty to 30s. per lb., especially as the experience of New Zealand shows that when the rate upon this drug was raised from 20s. per lb. to 40s. per lb., tlie revenue in one year increased from £4,000 to £7,000, whereas the consumption of opium decreased by 700 lbs. MrO ' MALLEY (Tasmania) I quite agree with every word that has been spoken by the honourable member for Macquarie. If the opium traffic constitutes an evil to the people of Australia, we ought to stop it . Ib seems to me that bhe greed of gain always or nearly always enables niany Christians to compromise their souls with the devil. My experience in San Francisco bears out to its completion the experience in India of the right honourable member for Tasmania, Sir Edward Braddon. We saw in San Francisco the daughters of wealthy men, who had acquired the habit of opium smoking, stealing into bhe Chinese dens in greab numbers. Once they had acquired this terrible habit, nothing upon earth could free them from it . There is no Caulfield Institute which can reform the women or men who become addicted to opium smoking. Of all the evils to which human flesh is liable, that of opium smoking is, in my opinion, the most damnable, degrading, and demoralizing. whebher more revenue would be derived 20s.

When upon the Addressi n Reply, I spoke somewhat fully upon the inadvisability of the Government abandoning a certain amount of revenue by reducing the excise duty on tobacco, and we have had no ind ication since that they propose to increase it. In my opinion, as the duties at present stand, the difference between the import duty and the excise duty is greater than is required even in the interests of the tobacco manufacturers of Australia, and I have no desire to injure them in any way. Their industry has hitherto been, generally speaking, a successful one, and I desire to see it continue so. A t the same time, we must look to the requirements of the revenue, and not give a greater premium than is necessary to that industry. UnlessI am assured that the excise duty will be increased I propose to move a reduction in the import duty. The Minister for Trade ancl Customs has explained to us how, in what I admit to be the difficulttask of providing duties for all Australia, he has arrived at his decisions by the method of averaging the State rates.

The output of the New South Wales tobacco factories in 1S97 was 1,872,736 lbs., and in 1900, 2,178,656 lbs., an increase of Over 300,000 lbs., or onesixth of the total production, in four years. Besides the advantage which the manufacturers of the Commonwealth will get from the difference between the import and excise duties, they will have an advantage of £50,000or £60,000 in the use of Australian-grown leaf, upon which they will have no duty to pay. We may anticipate that the growing of tobacco in Australia will increase. Their tobacco expert has declared that in Queensland there is land admirably suited for the growth of tobacco. He anticipates that leaf can be produced there which will be, not only good enough for mixing purposes-whic h has been the sole use hitherto for colonial leaf-bu t good enough to. be placed upon the market as a separate tobacco.

WATSON -Will an import duty of 3s. fid. tend to increase the revenue 1 rather tend to diminish the revenue, and for that reason, andbecausethe Government have not promised to increase the excise duty, I propose to move the reduction of the import duty to 3s. per lb. But before we come to deal with that question. I should like to point out that whereas upon imported tobacco the duty is charged upon "" the weight of tags, labels, and other attachments,"" in the case of locally manufactured tobacco it is charged only upon the tobacco itself. To charge duty upon attachments to the imported tobacco seems an extraordinary provision, but if the duty is to be charged in that, way there should be equality of treatment, aud the imported and local tobaccoes should be treated alike. address the House except upon some subject regarding which I claim to have a little knowledge, and I speak upon this matter because it closely concerns Tasmania. The Government have repeatedly pointed out that Tasmania will require all the revenue she can possibly get, because she will sutler a serious loss through entering the Commonwealth. I now desire to direct attention to tlie fact that if the present proposals with regard to the tobacco duties are carried out, they will inflict a very severe loss on Tasmania, which I think in common justice should be avoided. Tasmania is the one Statei n the whole group which does not manufacture tobacco, and she will be greatly injured by the increase of the duty on manufactured tobacco to 3s. 6d., and the fixing of a very low excise duty on Australian tobacco. the excise duty on the tobacco that is consumed by her. get, and she will lose the difference between that and the f u l l duty on the imported tobacco. Tasmania does not manufacture tobacco. The leaf is imported in a manufactured form, and I do not think very much colonial-grown tobacco is used in the State. However, I certainly think that in common fairness the Ministry should see that the duty on tlie manufactured imported article is reduced to 3s. per lb., and that the excise duty is increased. I intend to move that the words "" including the weight of tags, labels, and other attachments,"" be struck out, and I shall do this in the interests of the workingmen of Australia. I do not smoke myself, but I think it is hardly fair to ask men, in addition to paying a heavy duty on the tobacco they actually smoke, to also pay a similar impost upon all the tags of lead or other metal which are affixed to the cakes of tobacco they use. honourable member think that these"" attachments represent. represent a very considerable weight. I need hardly point out that in the Excise Act there is no mention made of these things. There are certain higher classes of tobacco which are wrapped up in tinfoil or paper, in order to preserve the f u l l strength and aroma of the leaf, and these wrappings add very considerably to the weight of the article. The duty on these attachments will amount to a very considerable item in connection with imported leaf, whilst it is intended to allow Victorian and New South Wales made tobacco to pass into consumption without any such burden upon it . If the Government insist upon levying a duty upon the attachments to these cakes of tobacco, the result will be that the only guarantee that the public now have that they are getting tobacco of a certain manufacture will be removed, as the manufacturers will cease to attach tags and labels, and the public -will probably have foisted upon them an inferior tobacco, for which they will have to pay a price as high as that of the genuine article. I shall not move an amendment at this stage, but I intend to do so later on. agree with what the honourable member for Tasmania and the honourable member for North Sydney have said, but I wish particular^'to draw the attention of the committee to a matter in connection with this tobacco duty, which specially concerns tlie section of the community I have the honour to represent.

Having set up an ideal in this matter,'he proposes to create an entirely original and flawless system of excise and sustoms taxation. How flawless his system is may be seen already from the criticisms of the honourable member for North Sydney and the honourable member for IVmania, Mr Cameron. there is no necessity to impose a duty on tobacco consumed by seamen. I venture to say that no honourable member who has a knowledge of tlie general practice of nations in this matter solitary instance amongst civilized peoples where such a practice prevails. It is notorious that tobacco is purchasable, free of duty, by the crews upon any British ships. On men-of-war and on fishing fleets and everywhere throughout the Empire this exemption is made in favour of seamen, and it has been reserved for the right honourable gentleman, whose adherence to the traditions of the Empire are notorious and almost pathetic, to introduce this innovation. cannot say that the innovator is an undesirable person. The innovator is very often a most daring and heroic Whether these terms altogether fit the personality of the right honourable gentleman, I leave it to other honourable members to determine. I propose to ask the committee to agree to place tobacco consumed upon ships upon precisely the same as it was formerly. in New South Wales it has not been the practice to collect duty on tobacco used as ships' stores. I am not personally acquainted with the practice in the other States, but I presume that the exemption was made generally. learn of some reason for this departure. cannot believe that revenue alone caused the Minister to go out of his Mr Ifvi/Jien. may be some-where way in this matter, and whilst I shall not move an amendment now, I intend to do so unless I hear some satisfactory reason to Whether there be such restrain me. I do not wish to delay the committee, or to intrude any matter which, or in the compared with the general question of the States to impose such a revenue from customs duties, may be termed I cannot for a moment suppose immaterial, but I desire to point out that a class of people who certainly do not get their living very easily, and who are subject to more than the ordinary vicissitudes that attach to I humanity at large, have been singled out by this Government for special punishment. I wish to know why seamen have been penalized in this matter 1 It is not a good and sufficient reason to say that revenue is required, and that therefore it is proposed to tax an infinitesimal proportion of the tobacco consumed, and to levy that tax upon a class that has from time immemorial been free from such taxation. It appears to me that I wish to abstain from moving an amendment now, in order that other members may have an opportunity to traverse, the whole question. I propose to move an amendment later on if the right honourable can recollect a gentleman in charge of the measure is not prepared to make some concession. I have merely risen now to draw attention to this anomaly and innovation, and to request the right honourable gentleman to iifford some reason for his action. . I reserve to myself the right of speaking later on the question of the incidence of the taxation and the inevitable results of the proposed increase of duty. I This is the first time in the history of the Empire that the sailor has been taxed on his tobacco, and I am sure the matter will individual. not be allowed to rest if the proposal be persisted in. It would be an advantage to the committee if the Minister would make a short statement of the reasons which led the Government to propose this alteration, which means a difference of 3d. per lb. footing in the margin allowed to the local manufacIn Victoria and turer. When the honourable member for North Sydney asked for reasons, the Ministeri u his usual elliptical way said"" We deem it fair."" There can be only one reason in the absence of a Ministerial explanation, and that is a desire to afford I shall be glad to still greater protection to the local manuI facturer. If protection has been the aim considerations of the Ministryi n fixing this margin, I regard it as a most unfortunate proposal.",42,Tobacco Viz
258,Mr Joseph Cook (Parramatta),"The right honourable gentleman told the committee in unmistakable terms that he was not going to tax the community for the purpose of encouraging any exotic industries. I dare say the tobacco industry is substantial enough in its way, but the fact remains that with all the tremendous protection it enjoys, it is not, so far as local production is concerned, a very considerable item in any of the States. The proposal of the Ministry will undoubtedly deplete the revenue to a considerable extent, and I hope to show that there is not the slightest justification for such a course in connection with an industry of this kind. I understand that nearly all the local manufacturers of tobacco are in a prosperous condition. Those of whom we have any cognisance are paying excellent dividends, and I see no reason why this 3d. per lb. should go into their pockets. We are told that Messrs Dixon are manufacturing 1,000 tons annually, and that quantity at 3d. per lb. represents, I should say, considerably over £25,000. I wish to know why, when we want every penny of revenue, we should give this bonus to people who are already doing excellently well. The aim of the Ministry is, we are told, to get revenue, and only incidentally to protect native industries. If that be their aim, tlie Government are acting very strangely in actually surrendering revenue without stating any reasons. It may be that somebody has whispered in their ear that it would be advisable to give a greater margin for the purpose of further building up local industries ; and no doubt, from their point of view, that would be a -desirable thing to do. If the Government arc not specially anxious to further contribute largely to these manufacturers, there is no other reason I can think of to justify an increase of the margin. Although the -difference was 9d. in New South Wales and Is. 3d. in Victoria, in the latter State there was manufactured only 150,000 lbs. of tobacco annually, as against nearly 1,000,000 lbs. in New South Wales. sents about 500 tons, so that Messrs. Dixon cannot have manufactured the quantity of tobacco which has been stated. Here are the figures for New South Wales. Last year 996,000 lbs. of locally-grown leaf were manufactured. The imports of manufactured tobacco totalled'1,181,000 lbs., and -,the local manufacture of imported leaf represented 858,000 lbs. In Victoria tlie imports of manufactured tobacco totalled 745,000 lbs., whilst there was made up from imported leaf 1,328,000 lbs., and from locally-grown leaf 120,000 lbs. It will be seen, therefore, that however much this duty may encourage the manufacture of imported leaf at home, it does not seem to encourage the growing of the local leaf. last year, there were only 213,000 lbs. grown in the whole of Australia. That was the yield from 199 acres. out that the protection enjoyed by this industry in Victoria has ranged from 100 to 150 per cent. In New South Walesi t has ranged from 65 to 100 per cent; whilst in Queensland it has been over 400 per cent. I admit that such a high rate of protection is not altogether prohibitive, because there are people who will have imported tobacco at any cost. Notwithstanding these enormously high duties, the imported tobacco comes in in large quantities, and is consumed by our people. One would imagine that, with the protection afforded by such duties, we could produce all the tobacco necessary for our local requirements, and run the imported tobacco almost out of the market. But notwithstanding these high duties, there is not much locally grown tobacco, either in Victoria or New South Wales. large quantity made up. hands employed in Victoria last year was 1,176, being made up of 5S0 males and 59G females. In New South Wales there were 541 mules and 259 females employed. Here again we observe that fatal tendency in Victoria to employ females instead of males. There are more females employed in A^ictoria than there are males, whilst in New South Wales the female operatives are outnumbered by the males by two to one. An industry which employs such a small number of hands cannot be said to be one which we ought to protect to any great extent. is directly employed.

DoI understand that we cannot make as good tobacco in Australia as is the imported article ? up to the present. pay this excessive siun for the purpose of fostering the growth of tobacco which is inferior to the imported article ? If we could out that this duty is not a mere equalization make as good tobacco the revenue would suffer by the process of local manufacture to the extent of £93,000 a year in Victoria alone. AVe are told that the wages paid in this industry average 33s. 3d. per week for males and 16s. 7d. for femalesThese are the figures supplied by Mr Ord, the chief inspector of factories in Victoria. The total wages of the operatives employed iu the manufacture of tobacco in Victoria, is about £37,000 a year. The difference between that amount and £93,000 is the price which we pay for the production in this State of what is said by protectionists to be an inferior tobacco. I wish further to point out that if we paid every operative engaged in this industiy £ 3 or £ 4 a week to do nothing, we should be money in pocket as compared with what we are doing at the present time. I apprehend that Ministers will hesitate before agreeing to levy such enormous imposts upon the people. If we paid every one of the operatives employed in the tobacco industry in Victoria£ 2 4s. Gd. per week for every £ 1 which they are now receiving, the State would be no worse off. AVhen we have to buy work for people at such au extraordinary and extravagant rate, it is time to call a halt in the effort to foster native industries. I can understand Ministers, professing the principles which they do, going out of their way to try and foster a huge industry which will give employment to many thousands. But here is a case in which duties up to 150 per cent, have given the employees in this industiy an average wage of only 33s. per week, whereas the total cost to the community has been more than £ 2 4s. 6d. per head for every man and woman so employed. The figures in New South Wales are very much the same. The loss of revenue there on It would be account of the margin allowed to local producers is about £ 1 0 3 , 0 0 0 ; and the wages paid to the people employed in tlie industry, averaging them at the same rate as is paid to the operatives in Victoria, represents about £27,000 a year only. The total amount of wages paid in the senior State is less by £103,000 than the amount which the duty itself yields. It is supposed that we need protection to make up the difference between the wage rates which are paid in Australia and those which are paid in other countries, otherwise the chief argument of protectionists falls to the ground. But I would point of labour conditions. The duty here is three or four times as much as is the total amount paid for the production of local tobacco. This is a most expensive industry to protect. I believe there is a tobacco factory in Victoria, called Camerons'. I am told that this firm have a share capital of about £50,000. has been increased to £50,000 made £40,000 profit on a capital of £35,000. The amount which the revenue annually loses to keep this industry going is £93,000. unfair excise. honourable and learned member remedy the trouble ? It is the margin between the excise and the duty on the manufactured import which enables them to make this profit. If the excise duty were the same as the Customs duty, they could not possibly make it. MrO ' MALLEY It would be better to give them an old-age pension. the honourable member for the suggestion, because that is practically what it amounts to. In New South Wales the large manufacturers of tobacco are doing exceedingly well. I believe that last year the largest paid a dividend of 12£ per cent.

I think that we should be assisting the revenue, and at the same time offering less premium to persons interested in the tobacco trade who have received an immense amount of protection at the expense of the general community. In all cases where duties are levied the proceeds should go direct into the Treasury rather than into the pockets of the manufacturers, whom we are told have enormously increased their wealth in recent years. One company that operates in New South Wales has received a large benefit from the import duty, and has paid a dividend of 20 per cent, upon its capital, whilst carrying to the reserve fund an amount equivalent to 80 per cent, of its capital.

Sir get a copv of that report ? which is now in the hands of another honourable member, who will probably read the figures to the committee. The tobacco industry should not receive any special protection, because only a comparatively small number of persons find employment in connection with it. There are only 1,000 operatives employed in New South Wales, and only 750 in Victoria. That is a very small number of persons to be employed in an industry that shows such immense profits. During the last two years, although the output of tobacco has increased enLrmously, the. number of male operatives has not been increased by more than 36, whilst 70 additional women and children have found employment. A t the same time by means of improved machinery the tobacco manufacturers have been able to greatly extend their operations, and to largely augment their profits. Sir member represents their profits as to having in any other branch of manufacture in the amounted to 100 per cent, on their capital 1 name the company if necessary. I consider the duty to 3s., and I shall be prepared to that the import duty on manufactured support a proposition to raise the excise so tobacco should be reduced to 3s. per lb., that there may be no advantage to the and that there should be an increase in the excise duty on tobacco locally manufactured. If this were done the importations would increase, and there would be a relative decrease in the importation of leaf tobacco for manufacturing purposes. An increase in the excise duty to Is. 6d. should receive consideration. The honourable member for Laanecoorie asked why it was that that the local manufacturer could afford to sell his tobacco at a lower price than was charged for the imported manufactured article. A great advantage is derived by the local manufacturer from the admixture of other elements with the tobacco leaf. vantage is enjoyed by the American manufacturer. although the local manufacturer pays the excise duty upon the f u l l weight of the D u r in g one manufactured article, consisting of tobacco That is to say, they have been leaf and other elements, he only pays the customs dut) on leaf which has been imported. 7 In all probability those who are manufacturers will become importers, and the be sufficient protection to the general the factories will be thrown out on the streets. the factories number under 2,000, and as 1 a matter of calculation, it would pay the Government to give them pensions to do nothing, because there would still be an immense profit left to the country.

As to the enormous profits which it is said the manufacturers of tobacco are making, I desire to say that these profits have very little effect indeed on the producer. The largest profits have been made by manufacturers who are largely, if not altogether, importers of unmanufactured leaf, which is grown almost entirely in America, though some of it comes from Manilla and the Phillipine Islands. This leaf is grown by negro labour, which is the cheapest in America, and, perhaps, the cheapest in any part of the world, and it is brought out here to compete with the local production. I am aware that a large number of Chinese are engaged in the cultivation of tobacco at the present time in different set of conditions to those which prevail in the sugar growing industry. The cultivation of ' tobacco can be carried on under conditions which are not at all distasteful or injurious °to the white man. There is no healthier occupation, and with the magnificent climate in certain parts of Victoria, New South Wales, and especially in Queensland, there is no reason why we should not grow tobacco leaf equal, if not superior, to the best leaf which comes from Virginia. After very careful inquiry, I do not see any reason to quarrel with the proing the differential duties, which closed oneposal of the Government, but I feel satisfied that the grower would be benefited by an increase in the duty on the unmanufactured leaf. duction in the revenue. would not make such a proposal myself. The result of an increase on the Governwere paying the growers 6d., and they rement proposal would be a stimulation of the duced the price to 3d. growth of tobacco in the Commonwealth, but I recognise that if it is to be of any good gentleman must have been misinformed. 21 i to the grower, it must be followed by a decrease in the revenue. In my opinion it is only a matter of time before the locally grown leaf will completely oust the imported leaf. local leaf has fallen off 200,000 lbs. in two years, because it is an inferior leaf. South Wales is due to the introduction of free-trade. Last year the acreage there had decreased from 2,744 acres to 199 acres, and will the honourable member say that such a reduction as that is entirely due to the inferior quality of the leaf ? W ill the honourable member say, as a representative of New South Wales, that leaf cannot be produced in that State fit for consumption 1 tobacco myself. member must realize that all that is required with our climate, soil, and natural conditions, is proper curing to produce an article equal to anything we can import. mostly in Queensland. the Commonwealth, but under a leaf is grown, a n d' will be grown in future. The best leaf is grown in Queensland mainly because of the climatic conditions, but also in a large degree because of the splendid action of the Government there in giving every encouragement to the local grower. The result of that encouragement has been an increase of hundreds J>er cent, in the tobacco grown, whilst in every other State there has been a decrease. In Victoria, the decrease has been due to the ill-advised action of the Government, of which the Treasurer was the head, in alterfourth of the factories. took the extra 3d. off the price that they were paying to the growers. recognise that to take 3d. off the price of leaf tobacco would leave next to nothing.",47,George Turner The Honourable Actually Less Wages Per Head Than Are Paid

326,,"It did not cost the Mr SALMON -My experience tells mesomething for their labour, than to pay them a direct premium for idleness. Such a step would sap our national character, and be most' disastrous to the community. The question of an import duty of 3s. 6d. per lb. upon tobacco has no relation whatever to the question of protection. It is a customs duty for the purpose of raising revenue. When we come to consider the question of excise, the advisability of protecting the tobacco industry must be considered, and then probably honourable members will have an opportunity of saying whether it shall continue in our midst or not. I feel that we must obtain revenue, and from stimulants and narcotics we are entitled to raise the greatest possible amount. Under these circumstances I am entirely opposed to the reduction of the rate of 3s. 6d. per lb. I believe it would be infinitely better to raise the duty to 4s. per lb. After due inquiry, I have felt for a considerable time that we should be doing the best for the Commonwealth, for the revenue, and for the tobacco industry, if we adopted the Queensland rates. However, I am satisfied with the proposals of the Government, and intend to support them. wish to say a word or two by way of explanation. Laanecoorie has accused me of complaining about the wages which are paid in the tobacco industry in Victoria. I did nothing of the kind. I simply stated the average wages paid, according to Mr Ord, for the purpose of arriving at a rough calculation as to the encouragement given to the industry as a whole. The wages paid to the employees in that industry, I stated, represented £37,460 annually; that is, striking an average for 50 f u l l weeks in the year. The point which I wished to make was that for every £ 1 paid in wages, £ 2 4s. 6d. was lost to the revenue, which would be sufficient to give every man engaged in the industry £ 3 10s. a week, without the necessity for him doing any work at all. This fact emphasises the costly nature of the work provided for these people. New South Wales the position is even worse. There, the amount lost to the revenue would give £ 4 14s. 6d. for every £ 1 spent in wages, and would represent £ 7 per week State pay for every man employed in the industry. 21 1 2 MrO ' MALLEY (Tasmania) I m o v e That after the figure "" 5 "" and before the word ""tobacco,"" the following words be inserted ""Until made a Commonwealth Government monopoly."" I wish to point out that in Erance, where, the manufacture of tobacco is a Government monopoly, the State makes between £17,000,000 and £18,000,000 a year. Taking the population of Erance as a basis -and ours is a rich population as compared with that of Erance-w e ought under similar conditions to make a profit of £2,500,000 a year. If the Commonwealth Government enjoyed a monopoly of this industry, aud it was conducted upon cooperative lines as is the business of the Hon. John Wanamaker, of Philadelphia, I should have no objection. But I came here to represent the toilers, who struggle to create the wherewithal to build up these monopolies. After hearing the honourable member for Parramatta say that one tobacco factory alone made £40,000 a year profit, I asked myself-""If that is the amount of profit which a firm is publicly known to have made, how much more has it made which is not known ? "" I am a business man myself, and I know that the public never know the inside of business transactions. I am not going to give the manufacturers any The honourable member for protection which is not shared by the workers. I am thankful to the honourable member for Parramatta, because he has enlightened me upon this question. The Australian climate and conditions are far superior to those of the southern parts of the United States where tobacco is cultivated in such large quantities. If this industry were a monopoly of the Commonwealth Government, the workers would be civil servants of the Commonwealth. They would receive a minimum wage, and share the profits which resulted from the industry. Further, when those profits were exhausted, they would not be thrown upon the streets to come upon the Statefor old-age pensions. It is our duty as legislators to lose no opportunity of benefiting the workers of Australia. Today tobacco is almost as much a necessity I went on to show that in as is tea. I know very few of the great democrats of the west coast of Tasmaniathe.intelligence of Tasmania-wh o do not use tobacco. Therefore, as custom has made the use of this article a necessity, it ' is our duty to meet that necessity.

327,Mr Joseph Cook (Parramatta),"Iprotection from me, they will have to run their businesses upon the co-operative system, the conditions of primary production, to taking out a certain interest for tlieir investment, and dividing the profits and losses with the operatives. No doubt many people thought that I came here as a sort of commonwealth pauper. I did nothing of the kind. servatives if we compared our banking accounts, and cause some of those gildedspurred roosters to feel that they had not ,so much when they took tlie blisters off -.their estates. Not only will tobacco have i o be made a Government monopoly, but .the manufacture and sale of whisky also. the idea suggested in the amendment is a very admirable one, but at the present time it is utterly impracticable. It is a proposal if we are to give profitable employment that covers a very large area and revolutionises the existing order of things to -a considerable extent. It could not possibly be fully discussed by the committee within the time at our disposal this .session. It is rather the ideal scheme of those who look to the socialism Of the future. I regard the item of tobacco as one to which we must look for a considerable .revenue. The major portion of our industrial population use tobacco. If they ceased to do so we should be very seriously concerned as to how the deficiency thus occasioned in the revenue could' be made up. To the industrial workers an increased duty of 6d. per lb. probably represents an additional annual outlay of 6s. or 7s. But they pay this duty in such a form that they hardly realize that they are paying it . I am not very much concerned as to whether the impost is 3s. or 3s. 6d. per lb., but I am concerned about the production of -tobacco in Australia. Those who talk so ^glibly about the margin between the excise -xluty and the customs rate, and declare that -the equalization of these duties would merely threw 1,000 operatives in Melbourne out of employment, look only at a very small factor in the question. I say that we ought to regard cue growth of tobacco leaf as one of the primary industries of which we hear so much. .1 may point out that in New South Wales, iu is88, uhore wore no less than 4,833 acres under tobacco cultivation. The average value of the tobacco crop is £ 1 5 per acre, so that 20 acres of land would keep a family in a fair degree of comfort, and give a return of £ 3 0 0 per annum. The area devoted to tobacco culture in 1888 in New South Wales would, under which some honourable members have devoted so much attention, keep one family only. But that area has from one cause and another been reduced to 546 acres at the present time. 4,883 acres, if devoted to I might shake up many of the contobacco culture, would be sufficient to support 240 families, and to give them far more remunerative employment than is at present afforded .to many people among our industrial population. In Victoria the position of affairs is just as bad-in fact, it is a little worse. The largest area ever cultivated in Victoria was 2,029 acres, in 1895, but the area fell off to 155 acres in 1899. In connection with this particular item revenue is the first consideration, but and healthy occupations to our population, we shall not neglect other aspects of the matter. I shall oppose any attempt to reduce the margin between the import and excise duties. Those who say that in Australia the growing of the tobacco leaf occupies the attention of Chinese or of Kanakas for the most part, must not forget that the operation of recent legislation will cause the number of Kanakas and Chinese to gradually diminish. To say that none but Chinamen can grow tobacco in Australia is an absurdity. only successful growers of tobacco. some little knowledge of this subject, because the greater part of the tobacco grown in Victoria is produced in my constituency. The land on which the tobacco has been grown is worth, for ordinary purposes, from 10s. to 15s. per acre per annum, whereas for tobacco growing purposes it is worth from £ 3 to £ 4 per acre per annum, when a market can be found for the tobacco leaf. The best tobacco leaf ever grown in Victoria has been raised by white men, and solely by means of white labour. I am prepared to admit that a quantity of tobacco has been grown in Victoria by Chinese; but it is absurd to say that white men cannot grow it successfully. Europeans have been growing tobacco in the district which I represent for a considerable number of years, and the employment has been a profitable one, but there has not been a very strong disposition shown by Britishers to settle themselves down to intense",50,Edwabd Braddon 3d Per Ib Is Personal Experience I Know That For An

The locality I am referring to is the King River Valley, and the honourable and learned member for In d i will be able to bear mo out in what I have stated. As to the causes of the decrease in the area under cultivation for tobacco leaf, 1 am informed that SQ far as New South Wales is concerned, the manufacturers having .a monopoly, could fix whatever prices they liked for the leaf, and had the growers at their mercy. In Victoria, the reduction in the area under cultivation was brought about in the first instance, by the increase of the licence fees and the restriction placed upon the manufacture of tobacco. Subsequently there was a decrease in the margin between the excise and the import duties, and last and by no means least, an outbreak of disease iu the leaf, known as blue mould, with which our scientists have not been able to cope, though I believe that one of them has now discovered a preventive for it. That was the' last straw on the back of the camel, but, notwithstanding this, I trust that honourable members will not lose sight of the important fact that in connection with this item on tbe Tariff a splendid opportunity is afforded for giving a great impetus to the production of the tobacco leaf in Victoria. I venture to say that, when Australians begin to realize the possibilities connected with the growing of' tobacco leaf here, they will be prepared to make up from other . sources the revenue that will be lost through Is. per lb. has been paid. That gives the the falling off in tobacco importations. local manufacturer an advantage of Is. per Where we now have hundreds and even lb. thousands of acres yielding a poor living to ono family, we should have hundreds of families following healthy occupations and manufacturing tobacco here must be making a good honest living. -The position of the honourable and learned greater. member for Laanecoorie is totally incomprehensible to me. He is opposed to any difference would not amount to anything reduction of the duty upon imported tobacco, and he is also opposed to any increase of the excise. l i e admits, with a candour that does him infinite credit, that he adopts this attitude in order to give to an exotic industry the protection which it requires to enable it to flourish. can hardly be regarded as a natural industry. The honourable and learned member, with prophetic eye, looks forward to the time when locally-grown leaf will entirely take the place of imported leaf. What will become of the revenuo from import duties then? increased then. sidering this matter we should have regard to the experience of India. There they have a climate and soil which are more* favourable to the growing of tobacco than any we. have in Australia, but tobacco growing there has been successful to only a . limited extent, and notwithstanding the great improvements they have made both in . their methods of growing and of curingand it is in the art of curing that the great,secret of profitable production lies-in spite of the fact that they have imported artisans from the United States to instruct them, the growers of India do not even now produce an article which can be for a moment compared with that produced in the United States, in the Philippines, and in Havana. The amount of protection which the tobacco industry will receive*, under the proposals of the Government*, exceeds even the usual desires of the Minister for Trade and Customs in thedirection of protection. Imported tobacco, will have to pay a duty of 3s. 6d. per lb., to compete with tobacco manufactured locally from imported leaf upon which a duty of Is. 6d., and a further excise duty of greater than the cost of manufacturing it",51,Edwabd Braddon 3d Per Ib Is Personal Experience I Know That For An

Tasmania is more vitally affected by these duties than any other 'State of the Commonwealth, and there must be-some limit to the extent to which she should suffer through joining the union.

If an amendment is moved to reduce the import duty to 3s. per lb., I shall support it in the interests of the consumers of tobacco throughout the Commonwealth, but especially in the interests of those of Tasmania.
