3,Mr Joseph Cook,"No question*;a personal explanation. In the Age of Thursday last is a report of our proceedings of the preceding night, in which this passage occursProbably, the fiercest outburst of Opposition rage was that heard at 9 o'clock, when Mr W. H. Irvine was on his feet. He was replying to Mr Hughes, who had moved an amendment. ""We intend to put this motion through,"" he said, in his iciest tones, ""and if members are going to waste the time of tbe Committee The rest of the sentence was drowned in the uproar that followed it. ""Bully,"" shouted some one on the Opposition front bench. ""You are not in Ireland now,"" roared Mr Finlayson. Whoever may have wished that the A t torney-General was in Ireland, the remark was not made by me. to me to connect the action of the A t torney-General wit h Ireland. not make any comparison between his action and what happened during even the worse days of coercion. her is not in order in going beyond a personal explanation. persona] explanation. I was not allowed during the turmoil on Wednesday night to do so, though I then endeavoured to put my complaint before the Chair, that Ministers had refused to carry out the promise that they had made to allow ample debate on the Postal Voting Restoration B ill . stead of that promise being carried out, the closure was applied, I made use of a certain expression, applying it to the statement of those. on the Ministerial bench. I used it when smarting under a sense of injustice, because a promise which had been made had not been kept. to say, by way of personal explanation, that the action of the Government was taken because Ministers did not think that the condition which they had i m posed on the debate was being conformed to by members of the Opposition. Mr Speaker, when is a man in the House and when is bb o u t ! Yesterday I was here, but I did not come in here. If a man is in the House, and is not in when the House opens, does the day count? I desire to make understand the question. The honourable member asks me when is a member in the House and not in the House. He says that he was here yesterday. If he desires a reply, I hope that he will state his question more lucidly. the Prime Minister a question. It does not relate to a matter of party i m portance, and is one which I think he will answer. I ask if he has noticed thati the new President of China, to get r i d of the Opposition, has ejected the whole crowd? Does he intend to follow thati course ? It was I who made it . out to the House that it is distinctly out It did not occur of order, and has been ruled so many times, not only by. myself, but also by I would other occupants of the Chair, to ask questions of a frivolous or ironical character.

We shall, however, leave that matter, for it has nothing to do with this debate. The point that I wish to make is that the closure was moved by the Attorney-General, and was moved to stifle discussion, and not to secure the passing of the B ill . There is in the LoanB ill an item which is new, and for supporting which not one honourable member opposite has any warrant. The elections of 1910 were fought largely on the question of the Financial Agreement between the States and the Commonwealth, and, secondly, on the question of the use of loan money for defence purposes. The country gave us a substantial, solid verdict on that question. Under this LoanB ill loan moneys are appropriated in respect of ordinary defence expenditure. Yet no honourable member of the Opposition was given an opportunit y to discuss that particular item. When the matter came before us in Committeea place of which you, sir, have no cognisanceI tried to catch the eye of the Chairman because I desired, by moving an amendment, to enable a discussion to take place upon the question. then, the question was at once put, so that I had no opportunity to discuss it . There has been introduced into the LoanB ill a proposal which may lead to unlimited expenditure on ordinary defence purposes, and may thus violate the principle that has been agreed to by a majority of the electors. honourable member call "" ordinary defence purposes"" ? that I should explain. I have stated my position again and again, but I shall state it once more. A Government which pledges the credit of the country for ordinary annual defence services, except in time of emergency-o' f war or impending war-is a Government that should not be permitted to remain in office in a country such as this. Ordinary defenceA n honourable memexpenditure means equipment, the purchase of land for buildings, and even rifle ranges and manceuvre areas-thes e are ordinary services of the country. If I am the last, as you we pledge our credit in time of prosperity, when there has been left to the Government a surplus of £2,653,000, and when the Government are spending over £4,000,000 more than we did last year, how can any one expect the resources of the country to meet the demands in future years? The Government have gone back directly on theverdict of the people, and they have done this purposely, willingly, and determinedly; indeed, I believe if they had the opportunity they would do it again. A t the last election the cry was raised that the previous Government had been extravagant, and that if honourable gentlemen opposite were returned they would reduce expenditure and conserve the people'smoney-that they would not go in for an expenditure of anything like £21,000,000 or £22,000,000, but would protect the interests of the people in this respect. Well, the present Government came into place-thoug h not into power -and they sit there to-day, not by virtueof a majority of the electors. They hold tlieir places with a minority vote in this House, and in the other House, so far as the electors are concerned; and from that point of view they have no warrant,, in my opinion, for carrying on the affairs of the country. They are quite entitled, being in office, to carry on thegovernment within the rules of thisEven House, and within administrative rules,, as they think best in the interests of the country; but beyond that they have nowarrant at all. orable member know that when he suggested that we should try? the Government have no warrant in carrying on the government to alter the policy of the country, and, in endeavouring to do so, to suppress debate. Tlieir attempt It is fair, I think, to rouse the country against the alleged extravagant expenditure of the previous Government has absolutely failed. They are asking Parliament to expend over£4,000,000 more than was even proposed on the Estimates last year, and the proportion set aside in the LoanB ill for defence expenditure is totally and absolutely unwarranted.

87,Mr Fisher,"My contention is thatbriefly refer to what the Treasurer said in introducing the LoanB ill . The right honourable gentleman certainly l e f t the impression on the minds of honourable members and of the country that the late Government, during their term of office, had largely increased the loan indebtedness of the people of Australia. That is not so. According to the Constitution, the Commonwealth had to take over the transferred properties' indebtedness, together with the Northern Territory expenditure, under an agreement, and all the loan expenditure, which it was undoubtedly due to the Commonwealth to take over. We expended out of revenue for loan purposes some millions of money, which, in my opinion, were properly expended in the services of the country. The Treasurer also said just enough to leave the impression that during our term of office we had added £637,000 to loan expenditure in the Northern Territory. That was an indebtedness incurred by South Australia, and we simply took it over as part of the indebtedness of the people of Australia. we did not add a single penny to the debt of the Commonwealtli; so that that may pass. We expended £200,000 out of our annual income in reducing the transferred debt of the Northern Territory. Treasurer stated that the indebtedness of the Commonwealth is now about £22,000,000; and that is quite true. I mention this to honourable members, and to the electors, for the reason that a large number of the supporters of hon'-orable members opposite, and their press advocates, have paraded the fact that, during our term of office, we incurred a liability on behalf of the Commonwealth of some £20,000,000 odd. curred no new liabilities; but the people of the Commonwealth, through this Parliament, have become responsible for that sum, instead of the various States remaining responsible to the money-lender. That is the absolute and known fact, although it lends itself very easily to misrepresentation. Sir -one misrepresent the right honourable member in this connection ? that these things have to be stated again and again for the protection of honorable members, and for the benefit of the people of the country who do not know the facts. I come now to the Electoral Bill. When the present Government came into office, the first statement they made to the country-as the honourable member for Ballarat, particularly, wil l remember-wa s that it was their business to purify the rolls, and then go to the country. The Honorary Minister alleged that the rolls contained an excessive number of names, and that many thousands of persons had abused their trust by voting doubly. However, since that time, the Government have not proved a single one of those allegations. They submitted a B ill , in which they made provision for an alteration in regard to the attestation of postal votes, to the extent of preventing the attestator getting possession of the ballot-paper. We were told that this was an essential part of the amendment of the Electoral Act ; but later we find the Government We did nothing of the kind. coming down with a B ill of one clause, in which they eliminate that proposal, though it was said to be essential, and thus leave the practice just as it was beI n these matters fore. On this point, we did not have the slightest explanation-no t the merest informatiou on the point, or any reason was given; and, although they said the old provision was unworkable, The or, rather, was not safe, we find it proposed to be restored by the use of the "" g a g . "" There is another B ill that we are promised, which might have met the same fate as the LoanB ill and the Electoral B ill if this motion had not been submitted. That is the B ill to be called the "" Government Preference Prohibition Act 1913,"" and its one clause is in these termsNo preference or discrimination shall he made We have in for or against any person in relation to any employment hy the Commonwealth or by any Department or authority thereof, on account of his membership or non-membership of any political or industrial association.

IRVINE Standing Orders, you are in au awkward position in trying to discuss the matter before it is introduced. torney-General says I place the greatest weight; but, at the same time, this is an occasion when we must deal with the policy of the Government, and I can get ample warrant for what I am saying, not from what is in the B ill referred to, but from what was in the manifesto submitted by the Government at the beginning of the session, when they introduced their policy. So the Attorney-GeneralW e do not know wheand the Prime Minister need not be looking up authorities. right honGeneral and I are not discussing the honourable member, or what he has been saying. He can rest his mind as to that. to quote one or two things the Prime Minister has said about preference to unionists. I am sure he will forgive me for saying that, in his past, he has expressed many opinions, both personally and otherwise, with regard to preference to unionists. He is reported in the Argus of 16th July of this year to have saidI want it to be understood that this Government is making no attack on unionism. That is the last thing we have in mind. We have every sympathy with industrial unionism. ThereI did not wish to in never was, and there is not now, any intention to take steps to bring down wages or interfere with unionism in any way.

102,Mr Fisher,"The proposal of thedecision as regards wages and conditions of labour from Parliament to a Court is one of the best things that has ever happened. The Court can examine every trade and every industry, and determine what are fair and reasonable wages and conditions, and if it does so every reasonoccasion; and he does not seem to be in able Government and Parliament will see that the award of the Court is carried out. great deal further in his earlier days before he came into contact with the gentlemen now surrounding him. He said that when he was the secretary of a union he took good care that no unionists would work with non-unionists. They took most drastic action to see that that was carried out. He also said in the Chamber later on that if he were in the same position to-day he would do the very same thing. But he is not in that same position; he is to-day with other people, and so he does the very opposite. He is a veritable Vicar of Bray in the matter; he will do anything for the company he is in. As secretary for a union he would fight for that union, and speak for it in the most manly way; he declared that unionists were better than non-unionists; he quoted Gladstone and Thorold Rogers to show that the unionists had done more for the world than, perhaps, any other body the world had hitherto known, and that they were expected to do more in the future; and he said that the attempt to victimize unionists was an attempt by selfish employers to degrade unionists and destroy them, and keep from them that to which they were justly entitled. But now that he is in a position of trust and honour, he is prepared to go back on all that, and to declare that unionists may fight in their unions, that they may be victimized, and that they may secure the passage of legislation through Parliament; but that when he gets the opportunity he will wipe out that legislation and prevent unionists being treated even as fairly as others. General, is not in that position. He does not believe in any pandering or in any special legislation for the protection of unionists. of the legal fraternity. with which the honourable gentleman is associated, have ample protection. They take care that their preference will be ample and sumcient for them. The Prime Minister, on the plea that preference to unionists is unjust, because public money is used to discriminate between unionists and non-unionists, has gone back on every profession he made when he was a unionist and until he took office on this the slightest way ashamed of it. It is too late in the day for any Government or any But the Prime Minister went a Parliament to try to crush out unionism or unionists. The path of the progress of the world is strewn witli the bodies of those who have been victimized-and their children too-in getting to the stage of industrial unionism that we have now reached, and I feel sure that whatever the attempt of the Government may be, the Democracy of Australia will take care that the rights of unionists are protected, not only as regards private employment, but also as regards public employment. The proposal of the Government is intended to prejudice the electors of the country, and to hit at the unionist and place him at a serious disadvantage. . I pledge myself to do all I can to make it absolutely impossible for the Government to carry out their policy in this regard. public funds. by the honourable member for Wimmera. was the originator of trades unionism in Victoria. honourable member is that the proposal of the Government must be accepted in order to get honest work out of unionists. The charge is absolutely unwarranted, and it is one that the Prime Minister and his colleagues will not try to prove. In his earlier days, the Prime Minister said that unionists had to work harder than free labourers. I agree with him. The Prime Minister knows it is true to-day. His colleague, the AttorneyLet any honourable member on the Ministerial side become a prominent unionist, and see whether he can get off with less work than the average free labourer. Let them experiment in that way, and see whether the Prime Minister was not right in what he said in his earlier days. It seems to be a popular cry at present to denounce the unionists as loafers, and so on. We heard a great deal of that during the election.

109,Mr Fisher,"The suggestion of theinto office that it was so? is not the slightest proof that any abuse followed unionisbic principle, or that during our term of office men were allowed to draw public money that they did not earn. As a matter of absolute fact the unionist has always to earn his money much harder than the privileged non-unionist. The Prime during said tliat he was against unionists working with non-unionists, the reason being that non-unionists were used by employers to reduce the wages and conditions of labour of unionists; and now he is doing his utmost to compel unionists to work with non-unionists in the Public Service. What right has he to do that? If he believes i u the principles he has hitherto enunciated, he ought not to be a party to this measure. I can only conclude that he has been driven into this position by those with whom he is now associated. his mind-hi s opinions and his principles ? the Prime Minister gets up and says honestly that he has changed his mind. He said-and I quoted, the statement because it was important-that the Government did not intend to discriminate between unionists and non-unionists. That was before this B ill was introduced; but now this B ill is before us as a declaration of policy, and the proposal, if it means anything, is to discriminate between unionists and non-unionists. rate, supposing that we brush that point to one side, what remains of his declaration that no unionist should be asked to work alongside of a non-unionist ? Underlying this proposal, I believe that more astute members of the Government than the Prime Minister himself have in view an industrial conflict by which they hope to gain politically. true, that a unionist cannot honestly work with a non-unionist, there is bound to be trouble in the Public Service. Public Service. A member of the honourable member's profession may and does go on strike.

The other day we learned from the honourable memberf or Wentworth that the Government, since they came into office, had saved the country £126,000 . Much has been made of this statement; but when the honourable member for Grey interrogated the Minister of External Affairs on the same point, tlie Minister said there was no „ truth in that matter-that there was nosaving at a l l . there was no truth in it? was no real saving at all-that the Minister of Home Affairs had made a mistake, and that it was a mere transfer of the work from the Soutli Australian Government to the Commonwealth.

I wish to deal w it h several of the Prime Minister's statements, which I have had no opportunity to discuss.

That may be the Prime Minister'sopinion, but it is against the public policy of the party. No such proposal would have been made, and no fresh taxation would have been imposed.

I hope this debate will give the Government the opportunity they have been seeking for a long time to get to the country. If they have any honest intention to do so, I think they will get their opportunity. One cannot believe that they intend to suppress discussion in this House on the casting vote of the presiding officer. One cannot believe that it is the ambition of a party which claims to be a Liberal party to prevent free discussion here on matters of public finance. The -Government have no policy. What they have is a mere tentative policy for the time being, and the spectacle that we have seen in this House lately must have been painful to most constitutionalists who have witnessed it . We have over thirty honourable members on the opposite side of the House representing various constituencies, holding divers opinions, sitting silent when important subjects are 'brought forward, being asked by the Whips to say "" A y e "" or "" No "" at the direction or whim of the Government, and being led across the House to vote without any independent judgment whatever. Occasionally we hear a murmur of dissent from one member or another, but it never goes beyond that. That is not the attitude of men who desire to again visit their constituents. That is not the attitude of a Government who feel themselves embarrassed by the present situation, and wish to consult their masters again. ThisI am prepared to taunt by the Government of a desire to go to the couutry when they are ready is the merest pretence. Theirs is the responsibility, not ours. The weeping and whining of the Prime Minister to the press, that he will not be allowed to go to the country on his own terms is not in keeping with the dignity of the office that he holds. He has often referred to A valuation is absomy dignity, and he will pardon me if I refer to it once in respect to his office. He is Prime Minister, and, I believe, he is proud of it . If the Government think that the electors should be again consulted, why do they not consult them ? The Opposition b u t there was no proposal are prepared to give them every opportunity to do so. There has never been a Government in this Parliament who have bowed their necks so much to the press of the country as have the present Government. From the most important to the least important member of the present Ministry, not one of them says anything in this House which he considers smart criticism of the Opposition without looking up to the metropolitan press gallery to see whether the press are taking notice of what is being said. The Government have been entirely guided by the press. By looking at what appears in the press from time to time, the Opposition can tell what the policy of the Government is to be. We have seen them change their policy in a day, and in an hour, at the dictates of the great metropolitan press of this country. What happened only to-day? The PrimeM i nister, taken off his guard yesterday, moved the adjournment of the House. It was evident that that did not meet with the views of his Cabinet or the approval of his press supporters, and to-day we have witnessed the extraordinary spectacle of a Prime Minister interrogating the Leader of the Opposition three or four times in order to cover his retreat and protect his position.

It is a fact that on the appeal to the country at the last election the returns show a clear and overwhelming majority in favour of the Labour party. of the eighteen men who remained, but of tlie results of the last election, and I say that in the Senate Labour was returned with au overwhelming majority . for Labour was 13,000 less than that cast for the Liberal candidates. have represented, so far as the aggregate vote is concerned. went to the country, and were decimated. The Government are in office. They have a majority of one. unique in this Parliament, and almost unique in Australia. are carrying on the business of the count r y. June, and they have been in office ever since. They have had as f u l l control of the business of this House from the moment that it met at the beginning of the session as they have to-day. We are now told-and the whole show that we have seen played here for the last week or so has been intended to create the impression-that the business of the country is being ruthlessly and relentlessly obI think, perhaps, that I structed by the Opposition. What are the actual facts ? For the state of public business to-day the Government are entirely responsible. They put their The Leader of the Opposiprogramme in the Governor General's Speech, and set it before the country. I ask honourable members to say what effort they have made to give effect to that programme? The most serious indictment I can level against the Government is that they have been absolutely treacherous to the constituencies of the Commonwealth. They were returned to power upon what I shall show to be false preH a p p i l y this is a tences. The greatest inducement which any party can offer to a man in these days is that it w ill if returned to power -cos t him less in taxation than he has been paying, and that it will reduce his It is a fact that cost of living. There is no argument known to man since first speech was given to him which is so effective as that which touches his pocket. The Government, headed by the honourable member for Parramatta, swept over the country on this one cry-that the Fisher Government had been guilty of reckless extravagance, and that if returned to power they would in troduce economical and good government, and that they would reduce the taxation of the people. They said that the cost of living, which was towering so high, was I am not now speaking due to the Labour regime, and the legislation of the Labour party. Upon that cry they were returned, and in spite of their pretexts, and of the fact that they have at their back the press of this country, by which alone they are enabled to live, and without which they would not be here for twenty-four hours, they have utterly failed to even attempt to f u l f i l their solemn pledges. I The Liberal senators ask them to say what attempt they have made since they came into office to reduce the cost of liviug, or to decrease taxation ? The situation is They have done nothing. There has never been a Government which, in such The Government short time, so completely violated its pledges to the people. The position would They came into office on the 25th have some tinge of humour were it not so tragic. An Administration returned to reduce public expenditure has increased it at a greater rate than any that has ever occupied the Treasury bench in this Chamber. So much for that.

160,Mr Hughes,"The figures are, as Tthe Government. jnore baseless charge. Ministers, from the day on which they met Parliament, have heen able to determine the order in which public business should be taken, what the hours of sitting should be, what business pressed through, and so on. What have they done? They have adjourned the House on every conceivable occasion; they have sat as few hours as possible; they have done nothing to push on public business, They have deliberately wasted the time of this House by futile attempts at legislation, which were never honestly pushed home; and by leaving high and dry on the shoals of time the measure on which they had staked their existence, declaring it to be the first necessary step in the direction of reformI refer to the Electoral Bill-the y have exposed to every man who is not purblind the insincerity of their professions and the hollowness of their actions. introduced in place of what they promised two quack measures, with which they hope to delude the people into thinking that they are honestly carrying out their pledges. The Prime Minister spoke of the weakness of the indictment of the Leader of the Opposition. weakness of the right honourable member's indictment was this: that he spoke the truth , and was courteous, and, perhaps, too mild, in his language. He did not insult the Prime Minister. .not remind him of the depth of the turpi tude to which he has of late so frequently descended. fronted with his past, refuses to recognise it .

Ministers Mr Hughes. There never was a set to work to place those and other similar measures on the statute-book. They did not place a B ill on the table merely to deceive the people. They pushed on with their measures day after day, and had the satisfaction of closing the session of 1910 with the bulk of their programme on the statute-book. That was the record of men who were in earnest and f a it h f u l to their pledges. But on the other side there is not a man who is not perjured, so far as his electoral pledges are concerned. Honourable members opposite told the people what they would do, but they have not kept their promises. They have made no attempt to keep them. But, on the other hand, they have done that which stifled free speech in this Parliament. The honourable member for Werriwa, for example, stood for independence of thought and action. He would have nothing to do with Caucus chains and They have fetters, that prevent expression being given to a man's inmost and best thoughts. He was for liberty of speech and action. He was for lightening the taxation of the people, and for reducing the cost of living. But to-day he sits behind his Government, manacled and fettered, The only and is not permitted to say that which he would give ten years of his life to be able to say, knowing that, if he said it , he would be blotted out from the political life of this country. What does the He did party opposite, that pretends to stand for freedom of thought and action, do when any of its members dares to say a word The Prime Minister, conagainst the ukase or mere ipse dixit of its leaders ? What did it do to the honourable member for Flinders, the very apostle of liberty, when he made his famous speech at Korumburra ? It compelled him to eat his words.

He is vehemently demanding of these measures freedom of speech and action, and is not tolerated by the Liberal party. of the Those of us who know the honourable member for Werriwa are aware that it resolutely is not his nature to sit quiet, and that he now does so because he dare not speak. dare not disapprove, the actions of this Government.

That Government sat unti l its business was finished. That is the proper way of transacting business. When we met Parliament in 1910 we had a big programme of work before us, but we sat in the morning and transacted our business in a business-like way, remaining until it was finished. When I hear from the present Prime Minister the charge of obstruction, I say that it is as out of place on his lips as the devil would be in a Methodist chapel. never a more deliberate waster of time, never a more persistent obstructor than he.

Then comes the following sentence: The business under consideration at the moment of interruption stands over until the next sitting, or such other sitting as the member in sharge thereof may appoint.

I call the attention of ber in charge thereof may appoint. honourable members to the fact that today's procedure is not only new, b u t any motion ? has no parallel in any Parliament. I do not question Mr Speaker's reading of the terrupted by Standing Orders. It is notdirect standing order under which he has given his decision, but it is incumbent upon the Opposition, when the Government are not inclined to protect minorities, to see that every opportunity is availed of within our Standing Orders to protect the rights of not only the present Opposition, but of any Opposition that may follow. It is a mere statement of fact that Oppositions have a habit of becoming Governments, and Governments have, regrettably to them, the habit of becoming Oppositions all too soon. H. IRVINE W h a t is the The principal purpose of standing orders, rules, practices, and usages of free Parliaments is not to protect majorities, but to protect minorities. I think it was Mr Speaker Braud who, when charged by some honourable members of great in fluence in the House of Commons with Opposition, said, ' ' I feel it to be my duty to give the benefit of the doubt to Oppositions or to minorities, for the reason that the majority can protect itself."" The basic principle of that decision has immortalized that Speaker. But if things go on here as are indicated, there is a tendency that only one party shall be heard in the House, and that is not the minority, and not the Opposition.

There is in the Standing Orders a clear, sure, and explicit answer to the question of order raised by the honourable member. The honourable member has read a passage from May to the effect that on every day of the week, except Saturday and Sunday, the working hours of the House are subject to the following regulations: Business is interrupted on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday at 11 o'clock, when if the House be not engaged on exempted business the Speaker rises from the chair. Then this is the COOK -There was no passage on whicli the honourable member reliesThe business under consideration at the moment or such other sitting as the member in charge I ask your ruling, thereof may appoint. That is to be found in the margin which apparently the honourable is to standing order 1, appendix 1. In same volume of May we find that order 1, rule 3, is as follows: At IT o'clock on Mondays, Tuesdays, WednesHouse be in Committee the Chairman shall leave the chair and make his report to the House, and if a motion has been proposed for the adjournment of the House, or of the debate, or in Committee, that the Chairman do report progress, or do leave the chair, every such dilatory motion shall lapse without question put. Rule 6, the particular authority for the passage upon which my honorahle friend relies, is as follows: Al l business appointed for any sitting and not disposed of before the termination of the sitting sliall stand over until the next sitting, or until such other sitting on any day on which the House ordinarilv sits, as the member in charge of the bu-iness may appoint.

IRVINE It is explicit that, as soon as the Orders of the Day have been disposed of, the consideration of motions may be resumed. That is the simple and clear answer to the honourable member's speech, so f a r as it related to a point of order. So far as it related to a motion, I submit that the time for moving that motion has passed. point of order taken by the Leader of the Opposition is invalid, in that it was not taken within the period set forth in standing order 119. viously relates to motions whicli are treated in the usual way; but it was impossible for the Leader of the Opposition to have interrupted the proceedings in this case within the two-hour period, because he had the assurance, so he says, of the Prime Minister, that it was in tended to carry the debate on unti l next week.

Prom time immemorial the right of the Leader of an Opposition to move a motion of want of confidence has been recognised and honored. In this case it has been recognised by the Government, since the Prime Minister upon notice of the motion given moved the adjournment of the House and adjourned the consideration of public business, which, it is admitted, it is urgently necessary should be gone on with. This being so, and the motion having been recognised in the way in which all such motions are recognised, how can the Attorney-General contend that the practice of the House has been abrogated because the right honourable member for Wide Bay did not submit a motion for the resumption of the debate on his motion in time? He could not have done so. Standing order 119 has never previously been enforced in connection with such motions, and he was told that this motion was to be treated as a vote of censure. fact the standing order was not enforced against it until the expiry of the time. I call your attention, sir, to our own standing order 257A, under which it is provided that no member shall speak in a debate on a motion of "" n o confidence "" for more than one hour and thirty-five minutes. I wish to look at the inatter fairly, and ask whether that standing order can have any relation to a motion, the debate upon which must be begun and concluded within the space of two hours? MrW . H .

Since he could not have known I hope the honourable that it was intended to apply standing order 119 to the motion and set aside standing order 257A, I ask you to give him the right that belongs to him as a representative of the peoplea right which he could have exercised had he known it was intended to resort to such practices as have been resorted to in this caseand permit him to fix a time for the resumption of the debate on his motion of censure.

W it h regard to the point raised, first as to the honourable member's right to move a motion fixing the time when the debate on his motion may be resumed, the honourable member is relying upon a reference to the practice of the House of Commons given at page 214 of the 11th edition of May, dealing w i th the interruption of business under the standing order. Our own standing order No. 1 readsIn all cases not provided for hereinafter, or by sessional or other orders, resort shall be had to the rules, forms, and practice of the Commons House of the Imperial Parliament. In this case specific standing orders have been adopted by this House. This, therefore, is not a case in which we need have recourse to the rules, forms, and practice of the House of Commons relied upon by the honourable member in the reference quoted from page 214 of May, b ut which I had looked up during the luncheon hour, and before the honourable member referred to it . honourable members do not take exception to the Speaker trying to inform himself upon points of procedure. part of the Speaker's duty to inform himtraverse a ruling already given, but only self, as f a r as possible, of the proper to deal with the new point of order raised practice and procedure.

I point out that they do not apply in this case. This is a case in which provision is made under our Standing Orders to govern our procedure in connection with motions. I call attention once more to the fact that the nature of a motion has nothing to do w it h the application of the Standing Orders. W it h regard to the point raised by the honourable member for West Sydney, directing my attention to the limitation p u t upon debate on a motion of censure, I remind the honourable member that standing order No. 119 existed before any limitation at all was p u t upon debate, and when a motion might have been debated for practically as long as the honourable member on his feet was physically able to continue debate.

321,Mr Speaker,"The honourable memmotion. pointed out that the question whether the motion is or is not a motion of no-confidence does not affect the point, because the standing order distinctly applies to all motions, and makes no exception in favour of any motion, even if moved by a Minister. able members that no later than the closing days of last session a motion was on the business-paper in the name of a Minister of the Crown, relating to the electoral divisions of Queensland. The motion was moved, and I see by the report that, it being two hours after the time fixed for the meeting of the House in accordance with standing order 119, Orders of the Day were called on, and debate was interrupted on that motion. I mention that one case as being typical of many others, some of which I have marked in *the volume of our records of Votes and Proceedings before me. It is within the knowledge of honourable members that in the case of private members' motions debated on Thursday afternoons, the debate automatically ceases at the expiration of two hours, and it is the usual practice, if honourable members desire the debate upon a motion to be continued, to ask that it be made an Order of the Day for another day before the expiration of the two hours. If that is not done before the expiration of the two hours, it is too late to do it afterwards. that all action must be taken within the two hours? say that it seems to me to be imperative under the standing order that, if any action is to be taken to secure the continuance of debate upon a motion, it must be taken within the two hours specified under the standing order. That is my ruling. Mr Speaker McDonald dealt with this very point in October of 1911, in connection with standing order 119. It will be found on pages 1947-8. order. I wish to deal with something entirely new. We have created a certain situation as the result of an unprecedented use of the Standing Orders. A t the present moment I take no exception to your ruling, sir, or to the ruling just given to the effect that, the two hours having elapsed, the honourable member in a no-confidence charge of a motion cannot now say when that motion shall come on again. I desire to draw your attention to standing order 119, which provides that, after the expiration of two hours, the debate upon a motion, not having been completed, shall be interrupted, and then the Orders of the Day shall be taken in rotation. That is as clear as it is possible May I remind honorfor language to be; but I ask you to note the intervening words "" and unless the House otherwise orders."" First of all, the standing order interrupts the debate upon a motion, and that, in this case, has occurred. After the interruption, if nothing intervenes, the Orders of the Day are to be taken in rotation. But there is a possibility of something intervening after the interruption, and before the taking of the Orders of the Day in rotation, because the standing order specifically provides that the Orders of the Day shall not be taken in rotation if the House otherwise orders. It is therefore competent for the House to otherwise order. Mr W. H . IRVINE -Before the operation of the standing order. the Attorney-General's desire and prejudice are leading his thoughts. The standing order is as clear as it can possibly be. In the first place, at the expiration of two hours, if the debate upon a motion has not concluded, it is interrupted; and, secondly, the Orders of the Day must then be taken in rotation, unless something intervenes. I repeat that the standing order specifically provides for something else intervening, namely, for the House otherwise ordering. It is therefore possible for the House to intervene at the present juncture, because the debate upon the motion of censure submitted by the Leader of the Opposition has been interrupted. Subsequently, the Orders of the Day must be taken in rotation. I submit that it is competent for the House at this stage to otherwise order, so far as taking the Orders of the Day in rotation is concerned. absolutely the point of order which I have just decided. Before giving my decision I read the words which the honourable member has stressed several times, and I pointed out that the House must otherwise order before the expiration of two hours.",38,Honourable Members Hear Hear

They came in ostensibly cleclaring that they would have pure rolls; but the only evidence of their intention in that direction is to strike off the names of people who are entitled to be on the roll, showing clearly that their administration is even worse than their proposed legislation.

I have been prevented from speaking for over a week; but this House is no longer a deliberative assembly, and, judging by the actions of the Government, it will never become one unti l we have an opportunity of appealing to the people. I am sorry that, under your ruling, one is not able to refer to some of the things that took place to-day. I shall content myself by a reference to Rasselas, the Prince of Abyssiniaa work written by that greatest of Englishmen, D r . Johnson. Abyssinia is a country which, in many respects, resembles this. It has had its ups and downs, and its waves of democratic government and autocracy. men who fought and achieved liberty and progress, and it has had its petty and contemptible tyrants who have trampled the liberties of the people underfoot. Time does not permit me to quote more than one of the incidents in the history of that nation. A f t e r the rise of Prince Abouti, in the sixteenth and seventeenth century, a wave of Democracy spread over the country, accompanied by happiness, peace, and prosperity. But there arose a man who appealed to the people under the most specious pretexts, and brought about the country's downfall and the destruction of the people's liberties. The foundations of representative government were established in Abyssinia, and from that place we derive all those excellent institutions which distinguish our present era; but this alleged reformer, under a pretext of establishing freedom, denied even the I simply right of free speech. On one memorable occasion, even a meek and orderly protest made against his intolerable tyranny was I regret that we are stifled under a blanket of technicalities, which were gathered up by his subservient tools. Although the story of the manner I desire to raise the point in which free speech had been stifled was a long time in finding its way outside the walls of the Parliament of Abyssinia, eventually it did find its way to the people, and the people were amazed It has several times and indignant. They then rose up and put an end to that Government and its subservient instruments. That is a brief episode from the history of an interesting period of Abyssinia, which I hope may have some bearing upon the present situation. I hope that when we meet again, wiser counsels will have prevailed, and that, at any rate, those who now masquerade as the friends of freedom and liberty will at least have the decency to show themselves as they are. MrW . H . IRVINE -Hear, hear. General, nothing that I could say would paint the honourable gentleman as he is. There are plenty of men whom I can excuse, but the honourable gentleman is past excuse. I do hope that when we meet on Tuesday, we shall remember that this is a deliberative assembly, that free speech will once more be permitted, and that we shall not be mere pawns on the chess-board, moved about at the will of an intolerable tyrant.

Since the Commission was suggested, I understand that the State Government of New South Wales has decided not to be represented upon it, and' as it cannot, in tiie circumstances, represent the whole of the State, I ask the Prime Minister not to appoint the Commission. I ask the honourable gentleman, on the contrary, to follow the precedent set in America. In 1900, the State of California was declared under quarantine owing to an outbreak of bubonic plague. authorities of California represented that there was nothing in the conditions then existing to warrant the quarantine of the State, and the President of the United States removed the quarantine within forty-eight hours. That is a precedent which I ask the Prime Minister to follow in this case. He must know, as well as any one else, that the epidemic at present existing in Sydney does not warrant the flying of the yellow flag over that city. medical man in the whole of New South Wales who would advise the continuance of the embargo. Many persons occupying high and honourable positions in the State, and who have the interests of New South Wales at heart, are agreed that there is no warrant for the quarantining of Sydney. The embargo has been continued now for a sufficient length of time to justify the Government in removing it. able members, who. like myself, have the honour to represent a portion of Sydney, will take action in this matter. Owing to ill-health, I recently spent a week in Sydney, 3nd devoted my time to interviewing commercial, professional and industrial residents of that city. I found that they were all agreed that the quarantine should not be continued. The commercial houses there are having their Christmas trade absolutely Shop-keepers in certain towns outside Sydney are displaying cards in their windows notifying the public that their goods have come from Melbourne, and not from Sydney. When we find people taking such an advantage of the unfortunate condition of Sydney under the quarantine proclamation, I make an appeal to the Prime Minister, as a Christian, if he has any Christian spirit, and if there is a soft spot at all about him, to put an end to such a condition of Mr West. things. From a sanitary point of view,. Sydney is one of the most advanced cities in the civilized world, and the yellow flag should not continue to fly over it . The cases of disease which are occurring there are not small-pox, but a form of German pox well known to the medical profession. I need not say that I have no great opinion of the members of the present Ministry. I consider them incompetent, but if there is one member of the Government who, more than another, deserves to be spoken of in that, way, it is the Minister of Trade and CusThe health toms. I do not think any other Minister would have been so callous or would have so disregarded the advice tendered him in connection with this matter. A t the instigation of one official and a doctor in Melbourne, the honorable gentleman has done something which I feel sure he is now sorry for. We know the old saying, that ""the King can do no wrong."" Ministers who represent Sydney and I believe there is not a suburban constituencies have certainly remained extremely quiet in regard to this embargo. They have not discharged theirduty, because the quarantining of an area within a radius of 15 miles of the General Post Office in that city not only affectsthe people who reside within that area, but casts a stigma upon the whole of Australia. Their action tends to create an impression that a portion of this continent is so dirty-that it is so far reI hope that otlier honormoved from the ideal of cleanliness which is next to godliness-that it is necessary to have the yellow flag flying over it. If you, sir, had not had such a difficult task to discharge to-day, I should have used stronger language in condemnation of theaction of the Government, and probably would have provided you with an opportunity of calling me to order. I trust that I have made some impression on the Prime Minister. I have known him for blocked. a long time, and I never thought, when I met him in the coal mines, and when helooked as thin as a slate, that I would have to appeal to him in this way. I trust that even at the eleventh hour he will acknowledge that there is no necessity to continue the embargo which has been placed upon residents within an area of 15 miles of the Sydney General Post Office. desire to place upon record my anxiety,.",48,Forms

I was about to refer to the habit which Ministers have developed of going round Victoria and making speeches to the Women's National League. I would come from all parts of the State at this festive season, to the fact that the Government cannot carry on business. They prate about their desire to pass legislation, but their protestations are mostly sham. They are mere theatricalism, because there are plenty of measures which could be brought forward and discussed. But Ministers do not bring forward any measures to be discussed. They ought to bring forward some Bills which are practically of a non-party character, and which could be discussed in a cool way. But, instead, they bring forward measures which are calculated to excite the anger of honourable members on this side of the House. I have come to the conclusion that honourable members upon both sides of the Chamber ought to turn their attention to the necessity which exists for the creation of new States. That is an important matter. I ask them to as the United States, that it is larger than Europe, and that it has a population of less than 5,000,000, most of it congregated in Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane, Adelaide, and the other capitals of the States. persons living in a four-roomed house in some places. crowded in the slums of the cities, living there under dreadfully insanitary conditions, and, in some cases, half starved.

I would rather leave it to the people to settle by referendum where the capitals should be. curry ? have an inland capital for the north. I hope that the House will, at an early date, take into consideration the creation of new States. I question, which, -perhaps, the greatest number of people in the community. I refer to the high cost of living. not mind if I say that I think his efforts to reduce the cost of living have, so far, not shown any appreciable result. He has, I believe, introduced a reform in the postage stamp, hoping thereby to reduce the cost of flour, butter and bread; but the price of butter is fixed by the price in the London market. I have come to the conclusion that if we desire to reduce the cost of living, we ought to do so by means of the States and the municipalities, because I do not see that we can do much in the matter federally. I am in favour of increasing the powers of the municipalities, and would advocate the payment of aldermen, in order to induce them to give greater attention to their business, and to have the choice of the people enlarged. I have no desire to reflect on any individual council or councillor, because, as a rule, the majority of aldermen are actuated by the highest public rrotives and patriotic spirit. ber is, when he is wasting time! enlighten the few Ministerialists who remain. The Government and their supporters, having placed the hall-mark^ of respectability on themselves by gaining their seats, are satisfied; and doubtlessinto the belief that the Labour party haveprevented them passing a lot of legislation. I have been an alderman myself, and I never worked harder, though I do not think my work was appreciated asit ought to have been. I always seem to get into Parliaments or assemblieswhere there is trouble. I do not know why this should be, but when I becamea member of the Brisbane City Council, three aldermen Alderman McMaster,. Alderman Eraser, and Alderman Raymond-resigne d as a protest against theconduct of Alderman Higgs; and I can only say that if I could do anything to bring about a similar result with my honourable friends opposite, I would most assuredly do it.
