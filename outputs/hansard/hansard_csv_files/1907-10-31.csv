Petition Received And Read. Duty On Potato Flour. Following Letter","In the Argus of this morning we notice you moved that potato flour should be reduced from 3d. to £d. per lb., which was the old duty. We note the Minister struck the item out. Not 'quite understanding how we stood, inquiries were made at the Customs House this morning, .nnd we now find that potato flour is included as ""starch flours, dutiable at a j d . per l b . "" Therefore, the position is worse than ever, the former Government proposal of 200 per cent, having been practically increased to 250. We would point out that this potato flour is used for manufacturing purposes only, as far as we know. I wish to know by whose authority duty is now being collected on potato flour, seeing that that item was last night struck out of the Tariff, and, although starch .flours are dutiable, there is no authority for the collection of duties on potato flour at the rate fixed for starch flours. Committee, when we were' dealing with, the proposed'duty on potato flour, that I was willing to permit the item to be struck out, so that when we had under consideration the duty on other starch flours * we might deal with tbem all together, as in the Kingston Tariff.

These articles are written by a special reporter ; and I quote the followingThe whole of the country embraced in the Camden electorate, extending from the mean angle to Liverpool, is experiencing the rigours of an exceptionally severe drought. respects, it is asserted that the districts have never previously passed through such a time of tribulation as is now being endured'. . . Mr members 'know that in the South Coast and F. W. A. Downes, M . L .

In 1905 there is a record of 20.25, and in 1906 it f e l l to 18.08. inches have been vouchsafed, and of this only 1 inch has fallen during the past four months. A very serious aspect of this continued absence of adequate replenishing supplies of moisture is that the ground has never been thoroughly saturated for three years, and the water supply has generally become more and more limited. The creeks upon which farmers away from the river frontages have been dependent have stopped running, and in most instances the large holes in the teds of these' watercourses have also dried up. . . . The dairy cows and other stock, as a general thing, look better than might be, expected. the careful way they have been nursed by their owners. hand-feeding has been followed without intermission practically the whole of the year, and, generally speaking, the stock have not been allowed to get into hopelessly low condition. How much longer this can be kept up is the problem.

South Coast farmers are regular buyers, and they are called upon to pay high prices for very poor stuff. Mr Fuller. I do not know whether that was Tasmanian fodder, but I know from experience that some of the stuff offered forsale is very poor indeed. Last, week' prices as high as j£6 ios. per ton were paid in Sussex-street> Sydney; and it will be admitted that that is a pretty high price. If they do not buy, their good cattle must starve to death, and it is an open question as to which policy is likely to result in the greatest loss. In several In other worjds, the question is whether the greater loss is involved in buying fodder or in allowing the cattle to die. Honourable Camden districts was originated what has proved to be a great national industry in New South Wales and parts of QueensHis carefully-kept rain records for land.

The honourable member, and others who live in the Western District of Victoria, have no idea what a country becomes when there is no grass with which to feed the cattle.

When last this question was discussed in a former Parliament, the circumstances were different from those which at present exist; the Tariff having been passed, and Parliament having no right, by remitting duties, to discriminate between the States. South Wales asked for the remission of the duties, and the Prime Minister did all he could to persuade the authorities of the other States to agree to their suspension for a certain period; but three or four of them refused to do so. liament is engaged in framing a new Tariff, and can determine whether the proposed duty should be agreed to, and, if so, when it should come into force. favour of entirely removing the duty on hay and chaff, nor do I think it necessary to suspend it for twelve months; I think that its suspension for six months would be sufficient. official of high repute, who has given great attention to the cycle theory, we 'shall next year enter upon a really first-class season, to be followed by several others. who know the central parts of that Statethe Riverina district-ar e aware that rain, to be of value, must f a l l at certain periods of the year.

I plead with the representatives of the States which are more fortunately situated at the present time than are New South Wales and Queensland. should plead with the Minister. too; but he is in the hands ofr the ComThe mittee, which must decide this matter. I ask honourable members to consider the special circumstances of the case. No one To-day, milk can deny the seriousness of the present drought. During the last drought the loss of stock-was enormous. No doubt some loss was inevitable, but a great deal more stock would have been saved had fodder been easily obtainable. imported ? Zealand. According to the Minister's statement, the revenue paid on importations I of hay and chaff amounted to only^3,67o. During the last drought, although hay and chaff were exceedingly dear, as they are now, cereals were much cheaper than they are at present, and were used-whea t especially-for keeping animals alive, so many ounces or pounds being allowed p.er animal. As the Committee has agreed to the duty on cereals, we can give relief only by suspending the operation of the proposed duty on hay and chaff. I ask the representaNew tives of South Australia, Victoria, and Tasmania to remember that the drought will affect not only the large pastoralists; farmers are also suffering. Surely the farmers in the more favoured parts of the Commonwealth should be prepared To-day, however, Parto forego this protection for a time, in order that, their less fortunate brothers in the drought-stricken areas may be benefited. The honourable member for I am not in Parramatta quoted from Coghlan figures showing that as the result of the last drought the sheep of New South Wales were reduced from 63,000,000 to about 30,000,000.

In this connection the farmers are not producers but consumers; many of them are compelled to purchase hay -and chaff to keep alive not only their sheep and cattle but the horses which they must employ to put in another crop. Their position is very serious, and since we now have an opportunity to come to their assistance we might fairly agree to a suspension of» this duty. But instead of suspending it, as proposed by the honourable member for Franklin, for twelve months, I think it would be better to move that the suspension should extend until ist May, 1908. I am hopeful that a further suspension will not be necessary, but if at the end. of the period I have mentioned the drought has not broken up we shall be able to take a more drastic step. The honourable member for Parramatta, when referring to the high prices of hay and chaff, forgot to mention that those prices are being obtained not by the producers but by some merchants who have cornered our fodder supplies. As a matter of fact, chaff in Adelaide is selling at from £ 3 5s. to £ 3 ios. per ton, whereas in Sydney those prices have been nearly doubled. This shows that a corner has been formed in New South Wales. T should like to aim a blow at the Combine.' There is no warrant whatever for anything like the prices now being demanded. A few men have manipulated the market, and, having cornered chaff and hay, say in effect to the purchaser, ""These are our prices, and you must pay them."" imports would correct the trouble. tirely correct the trouble, but they would tend to minimize it. drought cargoes of grain stuff entering Sydney Harbor could not find a purchaser except at the ring's prices. the duties were suspended it would be possible for farmers to obtain supplies direct from other places. On the occasion of the last drought many stock-owners in the drought-stricken areas of New South Wales were able to shift their flocks to the eastern part of that State, where good supplies of grass were obtainable at a fair price. _ At the same time those in the drought-stricken areas of Victoria removed their flocks to the southern part of the State', where grass lands could be leased at a reasonable rate. But on this occasion even the grass has been cornered, and exorbitant prices are being levied. I know of a case in which 30s. per acre is being paid for a six: months' lease of grass land. Such a pricecould be paid only in respect of a certain, class of stock. It would be impossible to lease land at so high a rate for the grazing of ordinary flocks. In the Deniliquin district, where stock-owners have been paying highprices for breeding ewes in order to raisetheir flocks to a normal level, we have today the sorry spectacle of thousands of sheep being driven to the freezing works to be boiled down for the little tallow Obtainable from their carcasses. This has to be done because fodder cannot be obtained at a reasonable price. It' is a national calamity that such a state of affairs should prevail. I intend at the proper time to move that the duty shall be suspended! until ist Mav, 1908. few moments ago I said, by way of interjection, that the present high prices of fodder were due to the rotten climate of New South Wales rather than to this duty. That was an unfortunate expression, and lest it should be taken to indicate on my part a want of sympathy for the stock-owners of the States where the drought is being severely felt, I wish to explain that my desire was simply to point out that the present high prices were not due to this duty. The duty of is. per cwt. has very little effect on the price. the extent of is. per cwt. that it does not. The unfortunate occurrence of a drought, and not the mere imposition of this duty, has been responsible for the increase in prices. When hay and chaff are selling at £ 6 per ton in Sydney, there is nothing to prevent prices being regulated by importations from New Zealand or any other country having' surplus supplies. No one recognises more fully thanI do the deplorable effects of a drought on the people generally. I intend to vote for this duty for the reason that I assigned for the vote which I cast yesterday in favour of a duty on potatoes. When Federation was established, it was understood that the farmers would receive some protection, and, as I told the electors that I should support-the existing duties', I intend to do so. This duty is not of much assistance to the farmer, but since he con'siders that he is entitled to it, he can",24,Imports

Instead of suspending the duty for twelve months, I think it would be better to give the Minister power to suspend it when occasion arises. No advantage would be gained by suspending the duty for six months if a drought extended over three years. In some circumstances, if we had to wait for Parliament to suspend the duty, all the sheep in New South Wales might die before action could be taken. think it would be fair to place such a responsibility upon the Minister? If Tasmania were enjoying a good season while the other States were suffering' from drought, the suspension of the duty would be received with a howl of indignation on the part of the farmers of the island State. the Minister would hesitate in such circumstances to suspend the duty. He would know that he would be fully justified in taking that action if the price of chaff went up, as it has done, to £ 6 or £ 1 a ton. The duty could be re-imposed as soon as the price fell to about £ 4 . per ton. We have heard a great deal about the existence of a ring in New South Wales. existence during the last drought, and it has never been removed. it, but that is no reason why the farmer should be penalized. I have been charged with inconsistency, and ""my attitude may afford another opportunity for the honourable member for West Sydney to play the part of Satan reproving sin. I feel, however, that I am perfectly consistent in voting for this duty, because I am acting in accordance with my electioneering platform, and, at any rate, in accordance with what I consider to be the dictates of justice. recognised fact that a considerable portion of Australia is very frequently in a condition of drought, and, therefore, it is of no use making any arrangement merely to meet the circumstancesof the present year. In New South Wales alone, sheep were reduced by the last drought from about 61,000,000 head to about 28,000,000 head. that that loss extended over several years ; but in one year the loss was about 18,000,000 sheep, and if we value these at £ 1 per head, we get some idea of the tremendous loss, not only to the owners, but to the community generally. Doubtless by making fodder more accessible some sheep might be saved in time of drought, but, ' as a matter of fact, owners who are beyond the railway service do not attempt feeding, removing their stock, if possible,, to districts' where there is grass. Indeed, there are owners of millions of sheep who have decided that in times of drought they will not attempt feeding, but will, depend on moving them, if it be possible, by railway, the State allowing a rebate of 75 per cent, on the ordinary freight I know that in tbe past some stock-owners, instead of taking their stock by railway, have moved them by road, and carted hay for feeding; but much ir* that way cannot.be done, unless, of course, hay is at a very reasonable price. Those who do attempt feeding stock in times of drought are mainly those within 300 miles of the coast; and in those districts where smaller areas are held. Some honourable members seem to think that the farmers most affected are those who produce grain for sale; but, as a matter of fact, the stock-owners and wool-growers-no t big squatters with capital at their backs, but men in a small wayfeel more acutely any shortage in the supply of fodder. During the last drought these people made great efforts to feed their stock, seeing that they could not do much in the way of moving them 'about, owing to the prices charged for pasturage in more favoured districts. We have been informed to-day that as much as 25s. or 30s. an acre for six months was paid for paddocks leased for the purpose of feeding starving stock. Those who are fortunate enough to have such paddocks are now following the example of the ring of which we have heard, and are taking advantage of other people's sufferings in order to make profit for themselves. In my own electorate I find great extremes; there are places with very good pasture, and other .places with less pasture than could be found in Bourke-street, and any spare grass is eaten up by grasshoppers. I wish to emphasize the point that, unless some relief is given, either by a remission of the duty or the empowering of the Government to suspend it, stock-owners do not intend to attempt much feeding during I know the coming drought. ence of the high prices charged during the last drought has' caused. stock-owners to determine, as a policy, that they will",25,Imports

Many who did make, some attempt to preserve their stock during the last drought lost everything, not having sufficient capital if the drought is going to .be as severe as behind their backs to cany them successfully through. We ought to remember that all over the world there is a threatened shortage of cereal supplies; and here, in the antipodes, our situation may be worse than that of other countries, seeing that in a time of great scarcity we"" should have to depend on ourselves, or,it may be, on New Zealand. Our local supplv is sufficient under normal conditions, but,unfortunately, there is no great demand until what may be called a universal scarcity arises. So long as stock-owners can shift their stock to grass country near the coast they will not buy fodder, and, only a few weeks ago, when I was in my electorate, I found that the whole of the available railway trucks had been engaged for the purpose of removal. Only on rare occasions does a drought extend to the coastal districts; and the people of Victoria, as compared with the people of New South Wales, do not know what a drought is. In Victoria, a farmer, who has a tank capable of holding a four weeks' supply, thinks there is a drought if there is no rain for a month; but in New South Wales it may not rain for four months, and at one place there was no rain for seven years. little rain for seven years on the coast near Sydney! western district, I should like deal with the circumstances of those who have dairy herds in the coastal districts. greater value, and feeding is resorted to: from ? when a drought reaches those districts, it is a very serious calamity for the whole country; and the question arises whether the local supply of fodder is sufficient, and whether some means should not be devised for obtaining fodder supplies from outside. Our only chance in this respect is, I think, in New Zealand. . land are as high as they are here, owing to the drought there. that our present prices are not due to Tariff influences, but to a world-wide shortage of supply; and I am afraid that we shall not be able to rely on New Zealand some people suppose. In dealing with this Tariff we are, I suppose, legislating tor a number of years ahead, and doubtless a suspension o.f this duty might afford some slight help, though I am afraid it would not 'reduce prices very much. But although prices for stock were extremely', high (some time a.go, they are rapidly falling. The price of fodder is increasing, whilst that .of stock is decreasing, owing to the fact that the small owners are being compelled to dispose of their stock to prevent them dying of starvation. The position is a very serious one. A great deal has recently been said in reference to the establishment of rings and combines. But it seems to me that such organizations are inevitable under the social conditions under which we live. What is the complaint of the producer to-day? Is it not that the middlemansecures the major portion of the profit? Irrespective of whether or not a duty is levied upon fodder, a combination will endeavour to make all that it can out of that conunoditv. I should like the Treasurer to recall what happened when the memorable drought of iqo2 was in progress. Upon that occasion practically everybodv, with the exception of the Commonwealth Parliament, did what they could to assist our stock-owners. The Railways Commissioners carried fodder at freights which ' involved them in to aloss, and moved starving stock from place to place at very low rates, whilst the Commonwealth Government collected"" from Here, the animals are of tbe stock-owners £500,000 by way of Customs duties. most of that money back again. that. It is our duty to assist the stock-owners in time of disaster, and to make the burden imposed upon them as light as possible. In mv judgment, the best way out of this difficulty is to place fodder upon the free list. If that course is notadopted we ought to vest in the Executive tbe power to suspend the operation of this duty. The latter mav nnt be avery workable plan, and I think that Parliament will be veryi loth to adopt it. Nevertheless our stork-owners ought to know definitely what is to be done, so that they may make their arrangements accordingly. I repeat that",26,Imports

Sir WILLIAM LYNE (Hume-Trea surer) [4.23] -The honourable member for Parramatta has made some observations as to the losses sustained by New South Wales during the great drought of 1901-2-3. I wish that he had referred to figures for years further back. I intend to show the Committee the losses of stock sustained by New South Wales when there was no fodder duty operative in that State. In 1891 New South Wales possessed the largest number of sheep that she has ever had, namely, 62,000,000. Bad seasons were experienced, and, as a result, in 1894, the number of her sheep had been reduced to 56,000,000; in 1898 it had declined to 41,000,000; and in 1899, to 36,000,000. Honourable members will observe that these losses were sustained before the imposition of the Commonwealth Tariff. that the number of her sheep was reduced by 26,000,000 at a time when the stock-owners were at liberty to buy their supplies anywhere, conclusively proving that the absence, of a duty had no effect in the saving of stock. it had. Sir WILLIAM LYNE emphasizing the point which I made previously. New South Wales has not since sustained such a big loss, in sheep. The operation of the duty upon fodder has had no effect whatever in that direction. [4.27] -In quoting the figures which he did regarding the losses of sheep sustained in New South Wales, the Treasurer attempted to convey an entirely wrong impression of my remarks upon this subject. WhatI said was that the losses in sheep were sustained in spite either of the .duty upon fodder or of the supplies which were available in Australia. I declared that stock died simply because there was not sufficient fodder to keep them alive. When sheep .are perishing by millions, it is absurd to impose a duty upon fodder merely for the purpose of making it dearer, and consequently more difficult to obtain. that the honourable member for Darling has it is evident that no one could tell the suggested the proper method of dealing Committee, with the expectation of being with this item, namely, the placing of it believed, that the fact that millions of upon the free list. The suggestion that the sheep, and thousands of the cattle, are in operation of the duty should be suspended danger of perishing, and that the primary is open to all sorts of objections. In the first place, it would really amount to an intimation to persons in advance of what the duty would be upon a certain date, a course of procedure which is opposed to all rules of Customs administration. Then, in the absence of a settled policy, there would always' exist in some of the States a feeling that an injustice had been done to them. We had an illustration of that feeling a few years ago, when a strong remonstrance was entered by those States which possessed fair supplies of fodder against the proposed suspension of the duty upon that commodity, whilst others were suffering acutely from drought. I would also point out that contracts have already been entered into upon the assumption that we should have a continuity of policy, and that, if the operation of the duty upon fodder be suspended, these contracts will be unduly disturbed. I hope that the Committee will It will thus be seen remit the proposed duty. The Treasurer has quoted figures with a view to showing that under Inter-State free-trade we are making the abundance of one State minister to the scarcity of another. If that be so, casual suspension is destructive of the very object of Inter-State free-trade. But it seemed to me that he failed to I did not say that prove his case by the statistics which he cited. He mentioned that, in I am merely 1902-3, 6,065,000 cwt. of hay and chaff were imported into New South Wales. The local production was 4,866,000 cwt., making the supply in that lean year -10,913,000 cwt. In the previous year, which was a much better one, the local (Parramatta) production of New South Wales was 9,452,000 cwt., but it and the importation amounted to 1,000,000 cwt. less than in 1902-3. What do those figures show? grass in the later year. of hay. and chaff having to be purchased by some of those hard pressed, to take the place of grass.

We are trying to induce white people to come to this country; but if .some of the speeches which have been made to-day get into the press of the world, persons abroad will regard Australia as a magnificent place, to keep away from. One of our newspapers, which is very Australian in spirit, has gone so far as to brand certain persons who have besmudged the Commonwealth as the ""stinking-fish "" party. I do not say that there, are any members of that party in the Committee, but I deprecate hysteria in this matter. Would it not be better to calmly face the facts? Western Australia is sending chaff to the eastern States; South Australia. has had a good rainfall, and has plenty of grass ; Tasmania has plenty of grass, and a large part of the continent is in splendid condition. But many of the speeches which have been made this afternoon might lead persons to believe that Australia is an abominable place. It is because of similar speeches in the past that the tide of immigration has flowed so strongly to Canada, although no member of Parliament, notwithstanding that the country, for several months of the year, is covered with ice and snow, so that stock have to be fed, thinks of drawing attention to the circumstance.

The high price of labour in New Zealand has enabled them to get better prices, but not famine prices. There would be something in the contention of those who ask for the suspension supplies of cheap produce from New Zearland; but under present circumstances there is not much justification for it. Still, I should be willing to empower the Government to remit this and other duties if exorbitant prices were being charged by those whom tHey protected.

It has been proposed by the honourable member for Franklin that the impost shall be suspended for a period of twelve months, but the honourable member for Riverina has urged that a six months' suspension would be sufficient. As a matter of fact, it may be found necessary to suspend the duty for two years in order to meet the exigencies of a drought. Our desire is to pass a Tariff that will stand for a number of years, but' we must not lose sight of the fact that after the Tariff has been passed we shall not be in the same position as we are to-day to make special provision to meet the exigencies of a drought. if necessary, extend the proposed suspension. could do that. The Treasurer, a few moments ago, quoted figures whichi showed that, even under free-trade in New South Wales, there had been enormous losses of stock owing to drought. That is admitted; but, nevertheless, it is obviously the duty of Parliament, in a matter of such great national concern, to minimize the loss as much as possible. I shall vote for the duty proposed; but, at the proper stage, I shall move the addition of the following provisoProvided that when the wholesale value rises iabove £ 6 per ton at the chief ports of entry of and largely interested in farming pursuits; any State, the duty shall be remitted.

As a general rule, any measure of protection cannot apply to such products; the only time at which a duty does apply is during a shortage, and when that shortage is naturally being taken advantage of by the shipping ring and produce merchants to regulate prices. I am prepared to admit that those to whom I have just referred will regulate prices whether there be a duty or not j but because they choose to make the necessities of Australia their opportunity that does not justify the Government in asking for £ 1 per ton out of the proceeds of the exploitation.

Australia is large enough, and sufficiently self-contained, to enable the farmers to put aside any such selfish desire for spoon feeding. I speak as a protectionist when I_.say that I do not think that any protection is required in the case of fodder. I shall support the proposal of the honourable member for Franklin that the duty, if imposed, shall be suspended for twelve months, and I ask the Treasurer to adopt the suggestion. qf the honourable member for Franklin is in the interests of Australia generally. Who will benefit by such a duty as that proposed ? Certainly not the farmers, who, on the contrary, will have to pay an increased price in consequence of its imposition. The honourable member for Maranoa told us that if this duty be imposed he will have to pay an extra £ 1 per ton for his fodder. It is all very well to pose as the protectors of the farming industry, but who are suffering from the present drought? honourable members seem to f a ill o recognise that there is a drought; but I can say that all through my district sheep are being sold from the shears down to is. per head, owing to there being no grass; while at the same time farmers have to pay £ 7 per ton for adulterated hay-chaff. paid""? To other farmers. Melbourne farmers who, two or three months ago, sold hay for £ 2 or £ 3 per ton, have now to pay £ j for it in an adulterated state. In my opinion, this duty is not a protectionist proposal ;because protection ought to mean protection to each and every one of .us. The duty is neither more nor less than a tax on the primary producer, and I am certain that the farmers do not' desire it . not surprised at free-traders opposing this duty, but I am surprised that farmers' representatives should desire to penalize all farmers because certain farmers in their own districts are suffering from drought. duty does make a difference? thing that we require, it is some fixed policy I do not think in regard to protection. When Federation was adopted, it was on the understanding that all the States would benefit in some direction or another. We in Tasmania were told by the advocates of Federation that the Union would form an outlet for our produce on the mainland, especially in times of shortage. Now, however, when there is a shortage-for which we are all sorry-it is suggested that the duty should be removed, and that the produce which South Australia, Western Australia,^ and Tasmania have for sale must compete with proauce allowed in free of duty from other parts of the world. That, to my mind, The proposal is a very one-sided kind of policy. The undertaking in regard to the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta survey has been carried out, and I contend that the equally binding promise in regard fo protection to Tasmanian industries should be respected. The honourable member for Franklin used very strong language when he described this duty as blood money, and asserted that Tasmanian producers were living on the mis J fortunes of others. The honourable member should be more careful about the lanMany guage which he uses. Farmers resemble other traders in this respect-the y sell in the best market for the best prices they can secure. I suppose that if a man had his house burnt down, and had to have it rebuilt, the honourable member for Franklin would call the money paid for the rebuilding blood money? parallel. produce merchants; and -may be because the honourable member looks at these matters from a different point of view. The honourable member for Parramatta told us that a large number of sheep died during the last drought; but that loss, I contend, was due to the difficulties encountered in conveying fodder to where the stock were located. I know that many people, in Queensland, for instance,, lost thousands of sheep because they were hundreds of miles from any railway, and if they could have got fodder for nothing in Melbourne or Sydney it would have been of no use to them.

May I add that the lot of artisans in our big cities Sir WILLIAM LYNE The prices which under a protective policy is, to say the least .of it, a much more enviable one than is that of those settlers in the country who I am aware of that. That have to battle with the adversities of nature, who are beset with pests upon every side, and who, just as they have a prospect of securing a splendid harvest, sometimes find almost every blade of wheat destroyed. Surely we can exhibit as much sympathy with these persons as we extend to those who have a comfortable roof under which to work, and who are never afflicted with bad times, because people will always smoke. I suggest that the present affords us an opportunity to show a certain amount of practical sympathy with a great struggling I only industry. Letus suppose that a great catastrophe occurred to the manufacturing industries of Australia. Surely protectionists would come to their rescue, and assist to tide them over the crisis. I think that even free-traders might do the same without any sacrifice of principle, because calamities ought to wipe out all fiscal distinctions.

268,Mr Fuller,"This is what theappears to be hampered by its limited supplies of rolling stock. There is thus a difficulty in meeting the immediate demand for assistance, at any rate to a satisfactory extent. But in another direction the Commissioners have shown themselves not unmindful of fhe requirements of starving stocky and not slow to amend their regulations in special cases. One of these regulations says that the reduced rates fixed for this emergency shall not apply to places within 100 miles of Sydney, and it is obvious at once that there are excellent grounds for that limitation. In ordinary circumstances, when the country is visited by drought,the parts within that radius of Sydney have no reason to ask foT special concessions. This is especially the case on the South Coast, which has been in the habit of getting a very fair supply of rainfall. But just now and for some time past this rule does not apply. The drought is exceptionally severe there, and we had a pitifu l tale to report the other day about the straits to which the Dapto dairy farmers were reduced. Dapto is on the south coast, about 60 miles from Sydney. The cost of hand-feeding is so high that they find it less costly to let their stock perish, hoping to buy more when the season changes and the rain comes. It looks like a cold-blooded calculation, but we are bound to believe that such a resolution would not be come to except under pressure of the direst necessity. If honourable members had the same opportunity as I have, to know the class of stock thatr is being allowed to perish in this way they would readily understand my feeling in this matter. In these circumstances the Railway Commissioners have seen fit to adapt themselves to the requirements of the occasion, and amend their 100-mile regulation. 'They are applying their reduced rates to districts within 25 miles of Darling Harbor, to bring the afflicted Illawarra and Camden.'districts witfiin the reach of succour. That step evidences the liberal .spirit in which the Commissioners construe their duty to the State and to the public. They are pledged to run the railwavs on a sound basis as acommercial concern, and free from political and local influence. But they are broad-minded enough to recognise that fhe .showing of a large credit balance at fhe end of the financial year, especially in these days of railway prosperity, is not the be-all and end-all of railway management. The whole community is made up of stockholders in our railways. They aTe meant primarily for the public Service, for facilitating settlement, and for helping the primary producer, who pays-the expense of running them. It is the Tevenue derived from him and the money he puts into circulation that -gives us our returns from traffic and passenger trade. aTe good with him everything is satisfactory.. But when the seasons are adverse it is but right that he should get all the assistance the railways can legitimately afford him. That is the position taken up by the Railway Commissioners of New South Wales, and in the circumstances I submit that if the Treasurer recognises how necessary it is that those engaged in the dairying and pastoral industries-tw o of the great primary industries that are keeping the Commonwealth going at the present timeshould be supplied with fodder at a reasonable price, he will at least accept the amendment of the honourable member for Franklin, and agree to the suspension of the duty for twelve months. very much surprised by the statement of the honourable member for Laanecoorie that we have in Australia enough fodder to tide us over the next twelve months. I think that we are face to face with one of the worse droughts that we have ever experienced. Even in some of the best parts of the Western District, where the rainfall is usually generous, the effects of the long spell of dry weather are being felt, and it is idle for any one to assert that we have in Australia a twelve months' supply of fodder. of the quantity necessary for our flocks and herds. Those who live in Melbourne and other large cities, where there are beautiful parks and gardens that are freely watered and always look green and refreshing, have no idea of the state of fhe country. One has only to travel between Melbourne and Sydney to realize how severely the people on the land are suffering. bourne and Bacchus Marsh. who recently acquired from fhe Government land in the Melton district, near Bacchus Marsh, will not obtain this year any return from their properties. They will have no crop, and they have not enough feed for a -donkey. I do not regard this as a protectionist duty; we might just as well impose a duty on wool or coal as levy a duty on hay and cha'ff. As a matter of fact, except during a drought, we export large quantities of produce. Are we not trying at the present time to open a market in England for compressed fodder? Have we not exported compressed fodder to Manila and the Cape? It is only during When times a drought that we need to import a little fodder, and the farmers in the more favoured districts, who are obtaining £ 7 and j£8 per ton for their hayi, should be prepared to extend some consideration to their suffering brethren in the drought-stricken areas of the Commonwealth.

277,Mr Thomas,"of benefit to the farmer, dairyman, and small agriculturist generally, it is a detriment; and the only advantage gained is in the shape of increased revenue by already wealthy States. there is bound to be a shortage in grass and fodder, unless we are favoured with an abnormally wet summer. The Treasurer has been very liberal in quoting figures showing the large decrease of stock in New South Wales prior to the imposition of a Tariff; but the honourable gentleman did not tell us that that decrease was brought about by the rabbits, which practically -drove the stock from the western district, and which are now operating in the central district where, fifteen years ago, its presence in Australia was not regarded as of much consequence. son for the decrease is the discovery by stock-owners that it is not a good principle to overstock-that be computed by number but by quality. There has been a large expenditure in the direction of perfecting the sheep and dairy and other herds, and the animals, though smaller in number, are of considerably tetter quality. fore, to permit them to perish in a drought season. after long and expensive experiment; and if losses are occasioned by drought, they cannot be replaced as previously by merely breeding up numbers. when Treasurer, stated in bis Budget speech, after the imposition of the former Tariff, that the whole of the financial arrangements with the States for 1902-3 had, to a certain extent, been upset, because of the large amount of revenue received in consequence of the fodder duties. published in Hansard, Vol. XV., 2621, Sir George Turner showed that the increases under this head were, in New South Wales, £148,884; South Australia, Australia, £6,575seen that the fodder duties operated not only in New South Wales and Victoria, but over the whole of the Commonwealth, owing to the importations that were then found necessary because of the drought. There is no reason,, unfortunately, to suppose that such a duty will never operate again; the probability is that it will operate, and very speedily. that this is a revenue duty, I. have only lo refer honourable members to theBudget Mr Thomas Papers laid before us by the Treasurer himself when he made his Budget statement for the current year. I there find figures showing that the revenue deSo far as we can judge, rived from the grain and fodder duties in 1902-3 for the whole of the Commonwealth totalled £ 5 9 7 , 7 1 9 ; and in 1903-4 it was £ 2 6 5 , 2 1 9 . Then, with the recurrence of good seasons in 1904-5, the revenue sunk to £ 2 9 , 0 0 0 , while in 1905-6 it was £ 3 1 , 0 0 0 , and in 1906-7 £ 2 2 , 0 0 0 . Under normal conditions, the Treasurer expects to receive something like £ 2 0 , 0 0 0 from this source; and such a reduction, as compared with the receipts for 1902-3, shows the character of this taxation. If I cannot appeal to the Treasurer, who is so thoroughly imbued with protectionist prinA further reaciples that apparently he is prepared to ride them to death, I may, I think, appeal to some of my brother Labour representawealth is not to tives who are protectionists, but who, I hope, will regard this question from a sensible point of view. Is it reasonable that the whole of the community, and particularly the toiling small farmer and dairyman, or the man with only his horse and It would not pay, therecart, should bear this heavy impost under exceptionally trying conditions? In good Perfection has been gained only seasons, possibly, these men would not mind bearing an additional charge, if the duty then operated, but, as I have already. shown, that is just the time when the duty Sir George Turner, does not operate. It is flying in the face of facts to contend that the duty does not operate in time of drought, and that it is not a charge which falls very heavily on people who are ill-prepared to bear it .

Item 71,-Honey, Jams, and Jellies; including Calves' Foot but not Meat Jellies,, per lb., 2d. this duty on general principles, but I think it just as well to give a few details in justification of my opposition. The duty has been increased beyond the recommendation of i£d. per lb. by the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission, and is £d. more than the duty imposed under the Tariff of 1902. In 1906, the cash value of the importations of jams and jellies was £8,270 odd, of which £8,125 represented the importations from the United Kingdom Right through this debate we have paid much attention to the products of the Old Country, and it has been urged that it is the foreigner whom we are to tax. It appears from the figures, however, that we have little to fear from the foreigner, so far as jams and jellies are concerned; and, in my opinion, no matter what duty we impose, practically the same quantity will be imported from the United. Kingdom, because the importations consist of special brands, for which a certain section of the public are always prepared to pay the higher price. We are told by experts that jams Bamford, F. W. consist Of 50 per cent, of sugar; and jam Wilson, J. G. manufacturers may, therefore, complain Quick, Sir John that they have to pay' an Excise duty of 3s. Harper, R. per cwt. My own opinion is that a duty of Maloney, W. R. N . id. per lb. is quite sufficient, but I am conMcDougall, J. K. tent to revert to the old duty of i j d . I Crouch, R. A. should like to hear some reason from the Wise, G. H . Treasurer why it is proposed to increase Mathews, J. the duty on jams and jellies by 33$ per Salmon, C. C. cent., considering that, according to the information we have received, sugar has decreased in price. So far as honey is concerned, I regard the duty as a sham one. Honey is largely exported from Australia, and I suppose that in no part of the world is a larger quantity produced. The imports of honey during 1906 amounted to only £ 2 7 in value, whereas the value of the exports amounted to over'£1,000.

I think that the very' strongest reasons should be advanced before we agree to any increase whatever in the old rate of duty. I need scarcely point out that matches are used quite as freely by the poor as by the rich, and that the proposed taxation upon them would, '.in the aggregate, represent an 'enormous sum. Under the old Tariff, the revenue collected upon matches totalled £41,000 annually. I do not suggest for a moment that under the proposed rate the revenue would be increased in a corresponding ratio with the increase of the duty. If it did, £120,000 would be taken out of the pockets of the people of Australia every year. The probability is, however, that more matches will be made locally, and fewer imported, and I have made an' ! allowance for that, though I cannot say , what the difference between the present and future importations will be. I do not speak of my own knowledge, but I have if on good authority, from persons engaged in purchasing matches wholesale, that there is an arrangement of the London makers, General of whose establishment the local factoryTariffU .

He pointed out that, under the old Tariff, the people of Western Australia, in 1904, paid £4,971 to encourage the manufacture of matches elsewhere, But that only £ 1 9 worth of our I would remind the Committee output had been sent to that State. Tfie proposed duties are really much higher than' they appear to be. The old duty was equivalent to 25 per cent, ad valorem, and the cost of importation to 15 per cent., the total being 40 per cent.; whereas the proposed rate is equivalent to 75 per cent., and the protection, adding 15 per cent, for the cost 'of importation, to 90 per cent. But it must be remembered that the boxes generally contain only between forty-five and fifty matches, and each box is-charged as if it contained 100 matches. on the average between eighty and ninety matches. from forty-five to fifty. It may be asked why do not importers increase the size of theii boxes? I believe that that has been tried, but that the public willnot buy the larger boxes,' finding them inconvenient. Therefore the duty, while nominally is. 6d. per 100 gross of matches, is really .equal to 3s. per ioo gross. ] Sir WILLIAM LYNE,-The duty is less than one-tenth pf a penny per box.",44,Pairs

Better far for Australians to leave the manufacturing of this very useful and necessary little article .to the over-populated centres of London and the Continent, than to tax the poorer classes here, who are far and away the largest consumers of it, to* the extent of somewhere approximating ,£83,000 annually (which it will amount'to under the new duties), to foster an industry (?) which is a menace to the health of its operatives and the wage earnings from which do not amount to more than ^3,000,' or thereabouts, per annum (vide evidence of manager of local factory before Victorian Tariff Commission, 1S95, pages 341 to 343, of Second Report of Board). The profits made by the local factory must amount lo over ^10,000 per annum since the late rise in prices, to which, later, if the increased duties become effective, and the price accordingly increased, a further ^13,750 per annum, or thereabouts, is likely to be derived, or at least ^23,750, which will go to, and be spent in, London. Recommendation -That the duty be 6d. per gross on the basis of boxes containing 50 vestas or less, and 6d. per gross additional on 'boxes containing each additional 50 or portion of 50 vestas. If the preferential policy is approved, that 3d. per cross be conceded imports from the l-Jnited Kingdom, such preferential proposal would about level up the cost to the consumer here of . the foreign and .United Kingdom produce, as the produce of the United Kingdom is. quoted about 3d. per gross higher than the Continental produce.

382,"Mr Wilks (Dalley) [9,23]","The hon-|Continent of Europe. Here is strong evidence that the public of Australia have to pay according to. the duty. If a duty of .is. 9d. be (imposed, imported matches will be is. 9d. per gross dearer; while the same manufacturers will be able to sell the locally produced article at i d . per gross cheaper, so that the Australian people will have to bear a burden equal to is. 8d. per gross. locally manufactured article been increased since the imposition of the duty? turers have done worse, inasmuch as they have ceased to take orders, only completing those taken prior to the introduction of the Tariff. The honourable member for Yarra cannot, I think, defend this industry, seeing that, so far as capital is concerned, it is not an Australian enterprise. and May are just about to open a factory in Australia. May are in combination with Messrs. Bell and Company in the Old Country; and we may take it that these firms are not coming 13,000 miles in order to cut each other's' throats. The two firms practically regulate the price of matches for the whole of the world, whether the matches be manufactured in Great Britain or in Europe. have here a little information orable member get it? annoyed than the Treasurer if every time he read a speech in this chamber he was asked where he obtained his information. At times the honourable gentleman throws on the table compilations of facts and figures relating to, it may be, preferential trade; and I may say that, although I have a shrewd suspicion where his preferential trade arguments are manufactured, I have never been rude enough to question him on. the point. WhatI desire to .read is information supplied, not by any free trader, but by a Victorian Tariff Commission in 1895, ho, w m their report, sayI t will be remembered that when safety matches were made free of duty, the tax was left on wax matches, neither for revenue nor protective purposes., but to discourage their use, as it was considered that in this country, ordinary circumstances he is opposed* to they were a. source of danger. It will be seen that the duty was proposed, not to protect Ihe industry, but to discourage the use of wax matches in Victoria. But fashion has overridden legislation; and. notwithstanding any danger which may attach to their use, the public insist on being supplied with wax matches. The report from which I have quoted says furtherThe result of the duty has been to encourage the establishment of a local factory. A well known firm of British makers has found it more profitable to manufacture in the Colony than to pay the Victorian duty. The tax has, therefore, had a wholly unlooked-for effect. It must, however, be stated that, apart from the establishment of this factory, tbe tax has failed as a prohibitory measure, wax vestas being so generally in demand that large quantities were imported notwithstanding the heavy duty. Again, let me emphasize that these are not statements of importers, but of full blooded protectionists on the loyal soil of Victoria. Again' Taking all the circumstances of this industry into consideration, we do not think it is of sufficient value to the country to warrant the large loss of revenue which will follow its development; but we cannot overlook the fact that the duty has remained on vestas for a long period, and that directly it is proposed to take advantage of the protection afforded an outcry is raised for its repeal. In face of all this information, does the Treasurer really think that he has anything to fight for? Is the industry a desirable one for Australian women? made a suggestion, meeting honourable I members half way. stances, the Treasurer's offer would be a very fair one. I understand it to be that the duty shall be reduced to is. and 6d. That is a very fair offer upon its face. The honourable member for North Sydney has made out a very strong case in favour of a reduction of the duty upon this commodity. He pointed out that the Government propose an increase in the old rate of more than 300 per cent. I ask the Treasurer whether he would like to see the women of Australia engaged in this industry ? Undoubtedly it is one that. we ought not to encourage. Under ordinary circumstances, the honourable member for Yarra, who is a strong protectionist, would have risen to defend the duty proposed. the honourable member's statement.

392,Mr Wilks,"I am surprised to hear the Combine in the United Kingdom, and they own the factory which is conducted by Messrs. Belt and Co. in Australia. The honourable member for North Sydney, who is a cautious man of business, has estimated that under the operation of a duty of is. gd. per gross of boxes, the Commonwealth will take about £ 1 4 0 , 0 0 0 annually but But after making a most liberal allowance, it is clear that the amount of taxation involved would be at least £ 1 0 0 , 0 0 0 . In view of that fact, I ask the Treasurer to accept the amendment which has been submitted. orable member for Maranoa read a' letter from an importer, in which its author requested that a duty should not be imposed upon matches. read, but a statement. a statement from an importer, who protested against the imposition of the proposed duty. Then he declared that the match industry was not a desirable one to establish in Australia.

I shall oppose strongly the proposed increases* The honourable member for Maranoa has' very forcibly presented most of the arguments against the Ministerial proposal, having left me, therefore, nothing to say; but I should like to ask the Minister why he wishes the duties increased. He has told us that the A section of the Tariff Commission recommended an increase. No doubt if the Chairman of the Commission were present he Could give us a reason for the recommendation; but I cannot find any in the report or minutes of evidence. The only witness examined on the subject of matches was a gentleman who, from his name, I suppose to be of French extraction-Ceci l John Reginald Le Mesurier-wh o was also examined in regard to the duties on sugar, cocoa, coffee, bacon and hams, biscuits, butter and cheese, candles and soap, milk,, jams, pickles, sauces, rice, and other things.

D.. Wood, or other, per gross, is. 6d. The higher duties will particularly affect the working men of Australia, who use matches so largely. We have already increased the price of tobacco byimposing higher duties on it , so that tobacconists now no longer give away matches to purchasers of plugs, and the effect of these duties, if carried, will be to make matches dearer. Match-making is such a dirty and unhealthy trade that we should be well content to leave it to the people of Norway, .Germany, and other countries. not object, to benefiting by the sacrifice of his fellow beings in other parts of the world. that they must earn their living in this way, by all means let us assist them; but let -us not encourage the establishment of such industries in our midst: A protectionist told me last night that our manufacturers are going the wrong way to work ;^ that by obtaining heavy duties they will' encourage others to enter..the .field, and by-creating competition will cut .their :qwn throats, '-.Y want.

429,Mr Glynn (Angas) [10.5],"When the If we prohibit imports we shall not helpcircumstances the Minister will have a little more consideration, for the revenue, which would be affected by the imposition of a lower duty. there is one item in the Tariff that is more absurd than another it is this. There is no evidence to support it , and no attempt has been made by the Minister to justify it. For the sake of this industry, which at the best is a bad one, giving employment to only a limited number of hands, at an average wage of about 14s. 3d. per week, we are asked to impose a duty equivalent to i j d . per dozen boxes of matches Last year, there was paid by way of duty on safety matches £ 1 8 , 0 0 0, or £ 4 1 , 0 0 0 on the combined imports of wax and safety matches. It may be argued by some honourable members that the local industry has tended to reduce prices. I have quotations showing, however, that from the outset the price of the local matches has been just below the margin of the duty. An increased price, therefore, has been clearly paid by the users. If I had my way, I should make the manufacture! of matches a prison industry. It seems absurd to tax the whole of the community to the extent proposed by the Government in order to encourage an industry which is chiefly carried on by girls, and which must ultimately have a detrimental effect on the health of those engaged in it. I shouldcertainly be prepared to prohibit the introduction of wax matches into Australia, since they are highly dangerous ; I could point to cases where lives have been lost as the result of the striking of a wax match. The old duty afforded substantial protection to the industry. The report of the Chief Inspector of Factories of Victoria deals with the number of hands engaged in the Richmond factory, where match-making, as well as the manufacture' of fire-kindlers, is carried on. It is difficult to ascertain the number of hands actually employed in each branch, but I find that in the combined industries there were, on the male side, two employees receiving a wage of n s . 3d. per week, seven employed at 7s. 8d. per week, five at 8s. i d . , one at 17s., three at 15s. 8d., one at 16s., ""one at 20s., and seventeen at 35s. sd., or a total of thirty-seven. The female employees are as follow :-On e at 7s. per week, eleven at 7s. i o d . , thirty at 1 os. 7d., twenty-three at 12s. 3d., twentysix at. 13s. 4d., twelve at 13s., twelve at 13s. i o d . , and twenty-three at 16s. n d . ; (Meats, &c). or a total of 138.

There is evidence that we do not produce the kind of article which it is proposed to tax. We export to Germany the heavier article, which is made from the entrails of sheep. But the-class of casing which the Australian prefers is the lighter pig casing, which is imported from the United States. The imports and exports are fairly evenly balanced. The imports were worth £41,925, and the exports from Australia £42,915, of which £34,728 went to Germany. This duty will penalize the Australian butcher. It was proposed in the Kingston Tariff to impose a duty of 2d. now if we go to a vote at once. burning protectionists are anxious to admit sausage skins free. According to them, Australia can produce electrical machinery the most complicated in the world, but cannot make an ordinary sausage skin.

The packet tea comes chiefly from India, where it is put up by cheap labour, in packets manufactured by and covered with labels printed by cheap labour. If we deal in this way with packet tea, it will be necessary, to be consistent, to deal similarly with other items. [12.14] I should like to see the importation of packet tea prohibited. Surely we can put up into packets the tea that we require. But little supervision can be exercised over tea imported in packets, whereas tea imported in bulk can be easily examined. Prior to Federation tea which was allowed to enter the free ports of New South Wales was not permitted to enter South Australian ports, being considered unfit for human consumption. tea is prevented by the Commonwealth Customs Act. ment is disposed of, I intend to move' to prohibit the importation of packet tea. be carried the honourable member will not be able to do that. honourable member for Hindmarsh contends that packet tea should be prohibited from coming here, because it is put up by coloured labour, but to be consistent he should refuse to drink tea, because it is all the product of coloured labour. of the best tea that comes into this market is imported in 10 and 20-lb. packages. I do not think that we should put a duty upon it. [12.18] I think thattea should be brought to Australia in bulk, and packed here. It is undoubtedly easier to supervise the importation of bulk than of packet tea, while we have persons who are trained in the art of blending, which needs special professional skill. The duty will not be. a tax on tea, but it will create employment.

I think it is unnecessary that I should say anything further in support of the amendment. to know if the honourable member for Hindmarsh is in order in moving this difference of i d . amendment. The original resolution submitted wasThat duties of Customs and Excise be imposed have been doing, and an increase in that according to the following' Tariff, to come into direction would involve a great deal of operation on the 8th August, 1907, at 4 p.m. Victorian time. I do. not think that prohibition or absobuyer of tea has not the slightest idea of lute exclusion of an article of import is whether he is obtaining a good or an incovered by that resolution. In the cirferior article, and the statement is made cumstances, I do not think the amendment' again and again that since the removal of is in order. honourable member for Hindmarsh is proposing a prohibition of trade, whilst the Tariff has been framed, not with the intention of prohibiting trade, but for the statement is perfectly true in respect of purpose of regulating and controlling it. Act, we can prohibit the importation of any article.

Even if it can be so submitted, there should be some consider a-' tion for those who .have shipments of packet tea in transit. I am sure it is not the honourable member's intention that they should be compelled to send that tea back whence it came. in order that the packets may be opened, and the tea re-shipped in another form. In my opinion, the proposition is not in order. that to accept the amendment moved by the honourable member for Hindmarsh would be to open the door to the insertion of amendments of all kinds in these columns, and that there would be no finality to the debate. In the circumstances, I rule that the amendment is out of order. to effect the purpose I have in view by moving to substitute "" 2 02."" for "" 20 lbs.""
