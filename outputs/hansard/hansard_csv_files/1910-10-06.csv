A.m., And Read, Prayers.","NEW ZEALAND GRADUATED in this morning's newspaper thatSir Joseph Ward stated that most of the money best qualifications for the duties required required for defence purposes was raised from those who could afford it , and who had something to lose. He intended to bring down a graduated income tax and a charge upon the banks, which would mean an extra revenue amounting to £110,000. Will the Acting Prime Minister obtain copies of the Bill, and of the Act, when passed into law ? I think, with Sir Joseph Ward, that the taxation which he has foreshadowed is that which should be introduced for revenue purposes. In other words, instead of making our land tax primarily a revenue tax, it should be a progressive tax of such a nature, as to cause land to be subdivided. obtain for the honourable member copies of the measure to which he refers. day's Age that Mildura is not a compulsory area under the Defence Act. Will the Minister representing the Minister of Defence say what is the reason for the non-inclusion of Mildura, and what would"" be the probable cost of including that district? informed me that he intended to ask this question, and I therefore had a conversation with .the Minister on the subject. His reply was that Mildura and many other places of equal importance are, for the present, excluded from the operation of the Defence Act, either on account of the scattered distribution of the population, or by reason of the expenditure involved for instruction at such, distances. The number of men available for training under universal service is comparatively small. Training will be extended to such areas at a later date as may be found practicable. representing the Minister of Defence inform me as to the qualifications required of an area officer? notice of the question, though I am aware that it is the Minister's intention that the appointments shortly to be made shall be temporary in their nature, and that themen who will ultimately control these areas shall, if possible, be graduates of the Military College.

In the Senate the second reading was passed, but the measure was not proceeded with owing to difficulties in Committee. tive power to do anything? the honourable member presently. I want to point out the importance of a Department of Agriculture to a -nation. great exemplar we have is the Department of Agriculture in the United States. Speaking of the Department as a wholeand it is a great Department which has existed in a Federation with a national Parliament, and a series of State Legislaturesa Commission recently reportedAgriculture has derived more benefit from the establishment of the Department of Agriculture and from its administrative work than from any other Federal legislation. The annual injury to f r u it and grain from the ravages of insects would probably be double what it is now but for the work of the Department. Its experiments in proving the adaptation of crops to climates and soils have developed agriculture into a science, and alike benefited the industry and the country in general. In the report for 1907, which may be seen in the Parliamentary Library, the Secretary to the Department stated that it was very difficult to express in dollars the value of its work to the farmers and the nation; but that as the result of an attempt to do so, they found that the total value of the material results to the nation come to about $232,000,000. According to the report for 1906The work of the Department of Agriculture has already had results which valued at hundreds of millions of dollars annually, and yet the Department feels that it has barely crossed the threshold of its mission of discovery and education. Co-operating to the same ends are sixty experimental stations in fifty-one States and territories, the sixty-three agricultural colleges, thousands of farmers institutes meeting yearly, many agricultural periodical publications, and new and instructive books. Then there is a new line of work which is so productive of results that it is constantly extending, and that is the demonstration farm, the encouragement of individual farmers to change their agriculture so as to multiply their yields and their profits, and thus affoTd object lessons to other farmers. Thus it appears that forces are now at work which will very considerably increase the production of the farms within a generation, and which promise to continue the increase indefinitely. He who would write the last chapter of the progress of the agriculture of this country must await the procession of the centuries. The United States Department affords to I was asked us an example of co-operation. WhatI am contending for is, not the establishment of a Bureau of Agriculture that will supersede the work which is done by the States, but the establishment of a Department that will co-ordinate the work which is done by the State Departments, and, in addition, undertake certain classes of scientific work to which I shall refer presently. It is essentially national in its operation, and can be better undertaken by a National AdThe ministration. member propose to deal with the State experimental colleges? with the States, and the Commonwealth Bureau will simply co-ordinate, gathering together the reports of their experiments and experiences and producing a national report showing the progress of experiments which have taken place, and when a National Scientific Research Board is constituted it will co-operate and work through them in carrying out' experiments. I want to refer now to another important branch of work which is being done, in which the Department of Agriculture in the United States is co-operating, and that is the important question of the conservation of natural resources. President Roosevelt summoned a Conference of State Governors, who were accompanied by three expert advisers. It was attended by Justices of the Supreme Court and also by members of the House of Representatives and the Senate. The object of the Conference was to deal with the question of conserving the natural resources. It met, and came to important conclusions, and then a Commission was appointed, which presented to Congress the first inventory of the natural resources of a country which had ever been compiled. The importance of this subject to the people of the United States may be gathered",19,Bureau Of Agriculture

This shows that in a country like the United States there will, within twenty years, be an entire exhaustion of the timber supply; and the President desired to direct attention to the fact that their continuance as a nation, and a force in the world, depends on the conservation of their natural resources. The agitation has extended to Canada, where similar investigations are being made. We, in Australia, are, of course, living practically in a virgin country; and we have to consider the conservation of our resources, though, many people speak as if these were absolutely inexhaustible. Now, however, that we are really beginning to occupy the continent, and we see how the natural resources of other nations have been wasted and depleted, there is cast upon us the solemn duty to take what steps we can at this time ""to prevent like disaster.

In 1907, there was a Conference of State officers, representing all the States except Queensland, on the Bounties Bill, then before Parliament, and in the report of that Conference it is statedIt will not be disputed, therefore, that the forestry question is of national importance to Australia, and in placing the facts of the case on record the Conference passed the following resolution :"" We are strongly impressed with the urgent necessity for effective action to conserve the timber resources of Australia, and to make provision for future requirements. We believe that much might be done by action on the part of States Governments adapted to the needs of their respective States."" In view of the terms of the Constitution the matter is respectfully submitted for consideration by the Commonwealth Government. in the next breath that we have no power to do anything. correct, because we have some power. Recently, Dr. Domin, Professor of Botany at the University of Prague, visited Queensland for the purpose of studying forest distribution, and the utility of the timbers of that State, and he is reported as savingThe climate of Queensland is, I think, more advantageous for the growth of timber, as the trees grow slower, and their wood is accordingly of a better quality. I think that the forests of Queensland, brought under a good system of forestry which would regard all that has been done in the forestry of Europe and also in the tropics, would surely become an asset of great value for the increasing population of Queensland. I am sure that it will become, with the lapse of time, evident to everybody how important are the forests of Queensland, but I am rather afraid it will be too late, and, therefore, I regard it as a lucky circumstance that you take such an interest in the question now, when it is not too late, although very necessary to make some final arrangements and plans. I do not think it would be best to keep the forests everywhere they are to be found. In some localities it is, of course, preferable to allow them to pass, and in some other localities again to cultivate them, as they will give, under certain circumstances, at least a fairly good profit. In a new prosperous country like Queensland it is. quite natural that the forests are not looked after as they ought to be, but it is a duty to look to. the future, and to avoid such things as happened in other States of Australia where the natural forests have been in some parts destroyed in a most careless manner. Besides, there cannot be any doubt if the forests were allowed to pass there would be a great change in the whole district which was timbered before, and it would be extremely difficult, if at all possible, to reconstruct the original conditions. Dr. Domin points out that in Australia there is practically going on a criminal destruction of our great timber resources,, and he urges the absolute necessity of having regard to the future.

If that trade grows in the future as it has in the past, we shall, at no great discising their powers for the common good. tance of time, have to face the problem of how to obtain adequate supplies. It is necessary that the Commonwealth and the States should co-operate, and, as is being done in tlie United States, Canada, and other civilized countries, secure a proper inventory of our natural resources, with a view to their conservation. The Commonwealth could give the lead, and secure uniformity of action. between the United States and Australia? tinct parallel. The honourable member for Hindmarsh very properly asks, in effect, what practical results can be accomplished by the creation of a Commonwealth Department of Agriculture. As I said before, I do not think it advisable, nor ""ib it even suggested, that the Commonwealth should interfere in any way with the existing State Departments in the work they are doing. Under the Constitution, ""however, there is a division of powers as -between the Commonwealth and the States, and several previously exercised by the -States in connection with their Departments -of Agriculture have passed over to the -Commonwealth. It is in regard to these powers that we as a Commonwealth require expert advice. Generally speaking, the work of the Department of Agriculture -consists of four divisions-administrativ e .and regulative duties, research and investigation, educational work, and the obtain""ing of information in regard to foreign -markets. -of Socialism that could be thought of! will have an opportunity to explain himself presently. to do with exports and imports, and, of -course, includes quarantine.

By way of illustration -. as to oversea quarantine, the power rests with the Commonwealth, but with the States there remains the duty of mapping out districts and making regulations to prevent the spread of disease in orchards within a State. The Commonwealth has to exercise its power to keep disease out of Australia, while the States exercise their power to prevent disease from spreading from orchard to orchard and from State to State. In regard to stock, there is now co-operation between the States, and I ascertained only yesterday that Victoria, New South Wales, and Queensland have agreed to notify one another of any outbreak of disease. I am informed that Victoria has been able to notify the other States that, within the Victorian borders, there is no notifiable disease; and that certainly speaks well for the administration of the State. These diseases include anthrax, pleuro-pneumonia, and tick infestation. So that the Commonwealth exercises its power to keep these diseases out of Australia, whilst the States try to confine them to specific areas, and so enable them to be completely exterminated. In the United States of America the subject of diseases in animals The administrative work has and plants forms an exceedingly important branch of the work of the Agricultural DeUnder the partment.

Then, again, the question of controlling exports and establishing agencies abroad to open up foreign markets for Australian goods relates to the Department of External Affairs, and is entirely within Commonwealth jurisdiction. who read yesterday a very able and interesting article which appeared in the Age will know that some very pertinent remarks were' lately made by the High Commissioner as to the necessity of having commercial agents appointed abroad to investigate foreign markets, and report upon them for the benefit of Australian producers. I have received information from people who have recently been abroad as to the importance, not only of establishing agents in England, but also as to the desirableness of looking for fresh markets in Canada and the United States of America. I think that the Minister of Trade and Customs has received some communications on that subject, and has been urged to appoint some one in Canada to look for markets for our goods. Much has also been said as to the necessity of developing our Eastern markets. some of the other States, at present have commercial agents in the East. Mr .GROOM I gather, however, that the opinion of those best qualified to speak is that it would be better for the Commonwealth to have an agent representing all Australia rather than to have agents for the different States. scope of the honourable member's motion. Honourable members may reasonably ask me what powers we possess comparable with powers which are being exercised in other countries in connection with the Department of Agriculture. United States of America, the control of the exports is entirely in the hands of the Department of Agriculture, which publishes bulletins with reference to foreign markets, and sends agents abroad to investigate plants growing in different countries, in order to ascertain to what extent they can be adapted to the needs of the United States of America. These experts have taken back important lucerne and other plants, the cultivation of which it is stated has added greatly to the material wealth of the United States of America. To my mind, the work which the Commonwealth Department of Agriculture should undertake should be restricted to scientific research. Opinions that have been received from the States indicate that some of their Governments recognise that that would be legitimate Those honourable members work for the Commonwealth to undertake. Mr Swinburne, of Victoria, reported that, in his opinion, scientific research should be undertaken by the Commonwealth. The Hon. A. H . Barlow, writing on behalf of the Queensland Government-hi s letter is, I think, in the records of the Department -sai d that, recognising that such a Department was for the public good, he was willing to co-operate with it ; and Mr Perry, the new South Wales Minister of Agriculture, stated, in a speech which he delivered, that he would have no objection whatever to the Commonwealth undertaking scientific research work. That is a matter which is entirely within our powers. Many industries in"" Australia are at present combating diseases affecting plants and animals. When the preceding Government were in office, they received a request from representatives of several industries asking them to undertake scientific research work. Representatives of South Australia, Victoria, and New South Wales concerned in the fruit-growing industry drew our attention to diseases affecting apples, and asked the Commonwealth Government to appoint experts to make investigations. From Queensland,. our attention was drawn to diseases affecting the sugar , cane, and the Government were asked to appoint special officers to investigate that matter. Mr McAlpine, the Victorian Government expert, reported to his own Government that he thought a certain disease affecting potatoes was a matter for investigation by the Commonwealth. If honourable members will look at the work that is being done, In the especially in the smaller States, they will see that entomologists and other experts who have been appointed have so many ad-, ministrative duties cast upon them that they cannot devote the whole of their time to investigation work. a special Department for the purpose.

73,Mr Groom,"We ought to have athemselves. We have made a beginning in diseases affecting human beings, in connection with the Tropical Institute at Townsville; a leading scientist of very high repute has been appointed to investigate those diseases, and the Commonwealth has assisted by granting a subsidy of .£750 a year. The work is being conducted by a Committee appointed by the Universities of Australia. But we should carry that scientific work further, and appoint qualified officers to investigate diseases which are not local in their evil effects, but may injure all States alike. diseases know nothing of State boundaries. 1 If a disease affecting plants or stock breaks out in one State, and spreads over the border, it becomes a very serious menace indeed to the prosperity of Australia as a whole. Take, for instance, the ravages of the tick pest, which extended from the Northern Territory to Queensland, and right down to New South Wales. We now learn that Irish blight, affecting potatoes, has spread to several States. No one State should bear the burden of investigating these matters. essentially a national concern. Only by making it national can we pay salaries adequate to secure the services of experts chosen to investigate them. Unless we are to secure the very best men available, we ought not to bother about the matter at all. We want only the very best. say that Irish blight is in all the States of the Commonwealth? of the States. The scientific investigation should be conducted under the authority, and at the expense, of the Commonwealth. If a discovery is made, and a method of eradication pointed out, the application will depend upon the States, which, I am satisfied, will be glad to fall into line. will not. people's pockets, and when it can be shown that there is a remedy, I am sure that the States will take the necessary action. WhatI have described is exactly what is occurring in the United States of America at the present time. The Bureau of Agriculture investigates, and after the research work has been carried out, and a method of dealing with diseases has been discovered, the States do the rest by administrative action. Thus diseases are coped with adequately and properly. My point is that the Commonwealth and the States should cooperate, the Commonwealth undertaking the scientific investigation, and leaving the States to administer, thus conducing toivards eradicating diseases from the continent. What position ought we as a nation to occupy in this matter? Are we going to lag behind, and be heedless of the progress made by other countries? Are we to be the only country that is not going to conduct original research on its own lines, or shall we do everything we can to promote the advance of science in AusMany of these tralia? We have our own problems to cope with, many of them peculiar to ourselves. We should surely bring to bear the highest scientific knowledge we can command to effect a solution of those problems. If honourable members wish to .have some idea of the work that is being done in other countries in connection with entymology alone, I invite them to look at the report in the Times of the International Congress of Entymology held in Brussels, from ist August to 6th August. It will be seen that we have a great deal It should be to learn on this matter. To show the serious consequences that may follow from the ravages of pests, I will read a short extract from the reportDr. H . Skinner, delegate of various American learned societies and institutions, gave a brief but interesting account of the history of entymology in the United States of America during the last one hundred years. The loss due to insects alone in the United States of America amounts to millions of dollars annually. The State of Massachusetts has spent a million dollars on its campaign against the gipsy moth, which has devastated 100 square miles, and done some 50,000,000 dollars' worth of damage, and the United States Government has appropriated 300,000 dollars to the work of confining its damage to the locality, and preventing its spread to adjoining States. I am glad to say that here in Australia we have not so very many of these pests, but we have sufficient of them, and they are serious enough to demand Commonwealth action. It is obvious that, if we prevent pests from spreading, we shall increase the material results to the farmers and fruit-growers. Fruit-growing in Queensland, which was formerly a thriving industry, was, in some districts, practically destroyed through the operations of the fruit fly. If that pest were investigated and eradicated it would mean a very large increase in the fruit production of Queensland. Another matter to which my attention was drawn yesterday in this State was the importance of the export'of soft fruits. It was pointed out to me that experiments made here show",23,Bureau Of Agriculture

77,Mr Groom,"It is a matter that affectsthat it is possible to keep soft fruits, such as apples, pears, peaches, apricots, &c , in cold storage from three to six months. But the exporting of soft fruits is a more serious problem. Look at what it would mean to us in Australia if an export trade in this direction could be developed. We should bring science to bear upon the problem, and see whether we cannot obtain some solution, realizing that if we did, it would mean a tremendous gain to all the States. In the first instance the Commonwealth should confine its attention entirely to scientific research, and in that way it could do a great deal for the advancement of Australia. The educational agencies may well be left to the States; but reports of a general character, such, for instance, as the report relating to the Congress on Dry Farming, now being held in the United States, as well as information of importance to agriculturists, sent out from time to time by the High Commissioner might be distributed by the Commonwealth Government with highly beneficial results. the States? should' be left agricultural education in their public schools, colleges, and universities, the Commonwealth undertaking only such matters as it may successfully carry out for the general welfare of the community. If we confine our attention at the outset to research work, we shall greatly add to the material resources of Australia. An investigation of the conditions of living in the tropics would alone be of great importance. The taking over of the Northern Territory will make the establishment of a Federal Department of Agriculture absolutely necessary, and my belief is that even before we take it over we should at the earliest opportunity appoint experts upon whose assistance we may rely in its development. We shall have to obtain the best advice that experts can offer as to the policy most suited to the development of the Territory. Undoubtedly we shall have to build railways, to liberalize land settlement, to consider irrigation schemes, and to establish experimental farms. In the early stages of the control of the Territory by the Commonwealth we shall need to settle there immigrants who may be ignorant of its conditions, and the assistance of experts will be necessary to advise them of the best methods of agriculture. It is, therefore, essential for us in every way to keep this matter to the front. I hope that the House will affirm the motion, and that its adoption will lead to the establishment of a Bureau which will increase our knowledge, improve the conditions of living on the soil, and add materially to the wealth and resources of Australia. [11.34] I wish to express the pleasure I have derived from the address just delivered by the honourable member for Darling Downs, although a motion of this kind ought really to be superfluous. Surely no Government, having at heart the true interests of Australia, would neglect so important a factor in its development as the establishment of a Federal Bureau of Agriculture must be. Such an institution is quite as necessary to the advancement of the interests of Australia as is a land tax. By imposing a land tax we shall secure land for the people, and by establishing a Bureau of Agriculture we shall teach those who go upon the land how to obtain from it the best results. Those who have read of the rural industries in the Old World, as well as in the United States, must recognise that in that respect Australia is as yet in its infancy. We have not attempted to put the land to anything like its full use, but have been skirmishing with it, so to speak, just as the people of the United States did in the early days. New areas are taken up, and, for the most part, only the easiest possible method of obtaining some return from them is adopted. No serious attention has been given to intense culture. By the establishment of a Bureau of Agriculture, however, we shall mark out for ourselves a great work of education. I was rather sorry to hear the honourable member for Darling Downs say that he would leave to the States the task of educating the people on questions relating to agriculture. In that respect we need a national system. We must have in the markets of the world a name for Australian products, and Australian education in this direction must be uniform. Many honourable members fear to intrude upon State rights in this direction, but in the real life of production and export no man can afford to limit his vision within any State boundaries. I think that we shall need in the future to be even unificationists in this matter. a good word.",24,Bureau Of Agriculture

From the first we have clamoured loudly about the marvellous extent of our natural resources, but our neglect of those resources has been almost criminal. of that neglect has been due to the quib. bling of the States over non-essentials, while real essentials have been overlooked. During the present session the Government have been overwhelmed with heavy work. They have had to deal with important measures demanding immediate attention, and I can well understand ""their failure to' bring forward a Bill providing for the establishment of a Bureau of Agriculture -sponsible. He regards this proposition as I strongly hope, however, that before another session passes such a measure will have been placed on the statute-book. During the reign of the late Government this proposition was submitted to the House, and I viewed it as one on which there could be no party feeling. always approved of it, and trust that the Government will see' fit to include it in their programme for next session. that they will provide for a complete system of scientific research and education, and that attention will be given to the desirableness of having Commonwealth agents in the principal markets of the world. Competition is becoming very keen, and we might well follow the example set us by enterprising German producers who send their products to all parts of the world. We have more wonderful resources than has Germany, and should do our best to develop them. Australia has such a wide range of climates that it can bring forth produce of every kind. tain parts of Tasmania are almost frozen, whilst the far north of Queensland is deep in the tropics, so that Australia is capable of raising products peculiar to every temperature. This is a magnificent subject for a debate, and with preparation one might make an exhaustive speech upon it. have not collected any data, but have read with interest all questions relating to it, and am certainly very thankful to the honourable member for Darling Downs for the amount of good work he has put into the preparation of his speech, and the f:.cts which he has provided for our information. honourable member who has just resumed his seat says quite properly that it would member to criticise them. If there be one be possible to overwhelm the Committee with data and material relating to this subject. the state of the House.

The honourable member for New England properly remarked that one might occupy many hours in its discussion if one could conceive that there were any opponents, but it is unnecessary to touch upon more than one or two salient points. For one of these the honourable member for Herbert is rein some way connected with "" unification,"" another of those blessed words which my honourable friends opposite are fond of using. But there could not be a better illustration of the necessity of an entirely Federal policy than there is in I have this regard. ^ It is one of those subjects on which both the Commonwealth and the States can operate in the same sphere not I hope only without injury to each other, but with manifest gain. No work calls for more strictly local treatment than agriculture in many of its phases. The infinite variety of circumstances and conditions in 'Australia make it imperative that there should be investigation, experiment, and actual work in every one of the States. This makes uniformity impossible. At the same time the Federal principle is paramount, because unless all these research works are linked together and federalized, they will be costly and fail in their effect. Consequently, this affords an ideal illustration of the necessity for loyalty to the Federal In winter cerprinciple. man should do me the honour to read my Bill. trust we shall have an opportunity to discuss it.

In fact, the area of investigation is so wide that Ministers need haye no hesitation in making a beginning. They can scarcely begin wrong wherever tbey begin, seeing that there is so much to be done, and so many opportunities for all kinds of useful work are afforded. With such guides we should pick out some of our own most advanced enterprising and promising young men, and let them complete their training in the agricultural colleges of America and elsewhere. We have a good deal to learn in this matter from India. I had an opportunity of seeing most of the achievements in irrigation in that country. They are well worthy of study, and many of the products of the country are worthy of study, especially for cultivation in the Northern Territory and Papua. We could, I think, gain many valuable wrinkles from Hindustan. I merely wish to add my expression of appreciation for the work done by the honourable member for Darling Downs, who for many years has made this subject a special study, and to urge upon the House what should need no urging, and that is that this great work should be undertaken with all expedition and the utmost promptitude. I have no desire to occupy time unnecessarily in this debate. many speakers who have preceded me that the subject is a very big one indeed. I am thankful to the honourable member for Darling Downs for the exhaustive address he has delivered this morning. There is much more that the honourable gentleman could have said, but I have risen to endorse the greater portion of the remarks he has made, and, in common with other honourable members, to urge upon the Ministry to take this matter seriously into consideration in the recess. that we are to have no recess. done, I have no doubt we shall be patriotic enough to remain here to do it ; but I hope that when we re-assemble after the recess one of the principal items on the business paper will be a proposal to deal with this question, perhaps, more elaborately than has been suggested -by the honourable member for Darling Downs. It will be admitted that our neglect of our timber resources has been criminal. In Victoria, I suppose we have been greater offenders in this regard than have the people of any other State in Australia. We have no natural pine in this State, and we should, many years ago, have planted pine trees; our mountain sides should now be covered with great pine forests. We have neglected that most important work. I propose to make a quotation from a memorandum, drawn up in connection with a measure proposed for the establishment of a Bureau of Agriculture, by the honourable member for Darling Downs. In a few words, it shows what it is possible to do by the proper working of a Department of this kindMr John Foster Fraser, in America at Work, page IOI , says-""To my mind the Agricultural Department of the United States is the most usef u l organization in the world. It does not do ' all it sets out to accomplish, but the machinery is there and the enthusiasm is there."" I should like to say that in this matter we need aithusiasrri, and I believe that in the majority of the members of this House, as well as in a large proportion of the community, both men and women, we have enthusiasm for the development of our natural resources. "" Above all-and this is the point-it is practical to the American. The results of experiments spell dollars. It is thorough."" In further confirmation of this view the Honourable J. M . Rusk, formerly Secretary to the Department of Agriculture, in the UnitedI agree with the States, writes as follows :"" In concluding the review of the work done under the several divisions in this Department since the date of my last annual report it gives me pleasure to state, and I say this advisedly, that each one of the more than a dozen divisions whose work I have reviewed has returned in actual value to the country during the past year far more than the entire annual appropriation accorded to this Department."" We should launch out in a Department of Agriculture. I prefer that it should be called a Department rather than a Bureau. I am prepared in this matter to go further than is proposed by the honourable member for Darling Downs. I am not one of those who are afraid to encroach upon what may be regarded as the province of the States, but I quite recognise that, in order that the work of an Agricultural Department may be efficiently carried out, it will be necessary to act in co-operation with State authorities and State experts. Before this Parliament comes to a close I expect we shall have passed a measure to provide for the taking over of the Northern Territory, and in that Territory alone we shall have ample scope for the work of",27,Bureau Of Agriculture

To carry out experimental work in that Territory, and show that very many tropical plants can be grown there successfully, it will be necessary to import men who know something about tropical agriculture. I would suggest also that an Agricultural Department might be called upon to carry out boring operations.

He, doubtless, knows a great deal more about Central Australia than I do. orable member might have some particular part of the country in his mind. rally to a part of the Commonwealth which is sometimes characterized in the press, and by ill-informed speakers from the platform, as desert country. I entirely disagree with that description of the country, because, while Providence has not blessed it with surface water, I believe there is plenty of water below the earth in that part of the Commonwealth. Agricultural chemists now play an important part in ngriculture, and we shall need chemists to analyze the qualities of our soil, and inform our farmers as to the constituents which they require, to enable them to produce prolific crops. We know that the mineralized artesian waters are, to some extent, destructive of plant life, but I believe that they may be so treated by chemists that they may yet be utilized for irrigation purposes. In the past, considerable narrowness and parochialism has been displayed by the Premiers and other representatives of the States, because they regard any effort made by the Federal Parliament, or by Federal members in this or any other direction, as an encroachment upon their particular preserves. We have, however, power under the Constitution to do certain things, and I hope we shall avail ourselves of that power, in the interest of Australia and of the very large numbers of people who will come here to help us to develop the resources of this country, which I consider the greatest in the world. I feel sure that the Minister will not take a narrow view of the question. I hope that he will reply in a favorable tone, and promise, on behalf of the Government, that next session they will introduce a Bill to carry out to a large extent the matters developed in the speech of the honourable member for Darling Downs.

A kindred subject relating to the question of dry farming was afterwards brought forward by the then honourable member for Echuca, now Senator McColl, and subsequently the honourable member for Darling Downs not only mentioned it as a private member, but, when Minister of External Affairs, about twelve months ago, introduced a Bill dealing with it.

Although, subsequently, the project was intermittently mentioned in the press, no official intimation of intended Federal activity was forthcoming until September, 1908. month, it will be remembered, Mr Deakin circularized the State Premiers, and' invited their careful attention to a memorandum on the establishment of such a Department, prepared by his colleague, the Attorney-General. In this document, Mr Groom dealt exhaustively with the arguments in favour of a Federal Bureau, and in doing so, traversed the history of the United States, Denmark, and the Australian States in an endeavour to prove the necessity for such a Department. At a later stage the "" Bureau of Agriculture B ill "" was introduced to the House of Representatives.

Then Mr Jenkins the representatives of the States. opinion of the State Premiers is practically the same to-day as it was when this report was made. with the unificationist member for Herbert, that it is quite possible that the State Premiers are keener to-day on trying to safeguard what they consider to be their rights, and preventing the Commonwealth doing anything with regard to any of their functions, than they were in 1905. Besides Mr States cannot do, or which they could not Jenkins, the then Premier of South Australia, there were Mr Butler, also representing South Australia, Mr Daglish, of Western Australia, and Mr Evans, of Tasmania, every one of. whom strongly opposed the proposal.

The Minister of Agriculture in New South Wales protested at the time against the Commonwealth Parliament doing .anything in the .direction of the Commerce Act provisions. as the Minister proposes to take I do not wonder at that gentleman objecting. the Customs Department, the New South Wales Minister of Agriculture objected, just as the States object to-day to the Commonwealth Parliament exercising any of its own functions. Every honourable member will admit that we have the power to enforce the Commerce Act, and I am pleased to think that every member of this Parliament, and most of the people connected with the industries which are affected by the Act, would rather be under one undivided control, and know that the regulations in force were uniform throughout Australia, than they would be under the control of the several States. But, unfortunately, the States themselves do not take that view of the question. Very often State Departments do their utmost to fan the flame of discord, and to create in the minds of persons who are subject to the regulations which have been framed under the Commerce Act a suspicion against the Commonwealth which is administering them.

175,Mr Fuller (Illawarra) [12.35],"Ithe Bill will enable a fund to be created out of net profit to meet this liability, in the event of an institution getting into difficulties. The Bank of New South Wales may be mentioned as a typical case. Its shares are of the nominal value of £ 2 0 paid up, and carry a 'reserve liability of ,£20 each. Should the bank meet with disaster, and go into liquidation, each shareholder would be liable for £ 2 0 in respect to every share which he holds. The Bill, however, enables the bank to create out of its net profits a fund to cover this liability. It may be asked, "" Why should Parliament relieve shareholders of their liability in respect to shares? "" My reply is that that is not being done. All that the Bill does is to permit banking institutions to create out of profits a fund to cover the liabilities of their shareholders. When it becomes law, a banking institution may decide either to pay to its shareholders a dividend of, say, 15 per cent., or to pay, say, 10 per cent., putting the balance to a fund to meet their reserve liabilities. Under clause 6 the profits thus put aside must be invested in Government securities. This arrangement really improves the position of the creditors of the bank. not proposed until the establishment of a national bank had been mooted? question, but the proposal seems to me a good one, in the interests of both shareholders and creditors. awakened up too late. the consideration of the House. Now, if a bank should get into difficulties, its shareholders would be liable for the amount of the uncalled capital, or other reserve liabiliAugust. 1910, he wrote as follows:ties, and it frequently happens that persons who are solvent when they purchase bank shares are unable, fifteen or twenty years later, at a time of commercial crisis, to meet their liabilities, and, instead of being able to pay 20s. in the £ i , c an pay only 5s. or ios. When this occurs, a bank's creditors, of course, suffer. It is not intended to relieve shareholders from liability. The Bill provides that, on the passing of a resolution at a general meeting, confirmed by three-fifths of the shareholders, money may be set aside out of the net profits for investment in Government securities, at compound interest. After a number of years-the period will depend upon the amount set aside-the fund thus instituted will.become large enough to cover the reserve liabilities of the shareholders. In the tenth number of Hansard, issued diis session, tables will be found which show the manner in which sums thus set aside would increase at certain rates of interest. I wish to make it clear that the money thus set aside must be part of the net profits made by the bank, which would otherwise be paid directly to the shareholders. Clause3 contains a definition of "" net profits "" which was inserted at the instance of a senator, but I propose in Committee to submit an. amendment which, in my opinion, will provide a better one Honourable members will observe that the fund is to be placed in the hands of trustees, who will be created a separate corporation. There are to be not more than five or less than three trustees, and not more than one of them can be a director of the bank concerned. It is not necessary that a director should be a trustee of the fund, but it is provided that not more than one of the directors can be a trustee. The money will be invested in Government securities, and the fund will accumulate until it exceeds the amount of the uncalled capital and the liabilities by 10 per cent. There are other provisions made in connection with the position of trustees, but these are merely of a routine character. The matters to which I have referred really comprise the whole of the objects for which the Bill has been introduced. I have been requested by Senator Walker to refer to the opinions which have been expressed by well-known leading men in connection . with the measure. The first letter is from the Honourable F. E. Winchcombe, M.L.C., of New South Wales, who is the head of a woolbroking firm, and has been chairman of the Sydney Chamber of Commerce. In a letter dated the QUI DEAR SENATOR WALKER, I have carefully read the Commonwealth Banking Companies Reserve Liabilities Bill as now before the Senate, and I think the matter has therein been reduced to the simplest and safest possible form. When this scheme was first initiated I had my doubts as to its practicability. I was afraid it would not be possible to absolutely detach the fund from the control of the bank or institution concerned, and yet have it available for the shareholders in case of need. This, however, has been accomplished, and all necessary safeguards are provided in the Bill. In view of the fact that the Bill makes it .

Under .date the 9th August, .1910, he writes as follows :DEAR MR . WALKER, I have carefully perused the Bil l for an Act to be cited as the Commonwealth Banking Companies Reserve Liabilities Act 1910, and consider it a very excellent proposal, and one which in the interests of the general public should be adopted. Experience has shown that the calling up of uncalled capital or in like manner, the reserve liability on shares, produces not only hardship, but in some cases, the sudden demand cannot be met, consequently the provision of putting aside as a special reserve in special securities and under independent control assures to the public doing business with the bank that a proportion, and ultimately it may be all, the liability of shareholders is already in hand and available in case of need. As this special reserve cannot be made available like an ordinary reserve for the business of a bank, it is the same as if a shareholder had deposited so much per share of his liability in the hands of trustees. Those doing business with the bank cannot suffer by the proposed legislation; but on the contrary, the position of any bank adopting its conditions is strengthened, and in that way the public generally is further protected. Yours sincerely, ALF . W. [150]-2 tects the shareholders. E. WINCHCOMBE. the shareholders, it will also protect the general public who do business with the banks, as I explained a few moments ago. When difficulties occur, and shareholders are called upon to pay up, it frequently means a .great hardship to them, and in many cases they cannot meet their liabilities.

WALKER, I have copy of your Bill re Reserve Fund for Shareholders in Companies whose shares have a liability such as the banks, Australian Gas Company, insurance companies, &c. I think your Bill an excellent one. I wish you every success in getting it passed. Yours faithfully, That is when the Bill was in its original form, and referred to all companies, but as I have already explained, it refers now to banking companies only. letter is from Mr John R. Jones, of 109 Pitt-street, Sydney, under date the 9th August, 1910Dear Sir,I have read your "" Bill for an Act authorizing any joint stock banking company formed or incorporated in any State to form reserve funds for the express purpose of providing or accumulating 'funds to protect the shareholders in such banking companies against their liability in respect of the uncalled capital or reserve liabilities on their shares, and to provide for the creation of corporate bodies in which such reserve funds may be vested."" I think it very desirable to have a Bill of this sort, and am certain that if the reserve 'proposed under it had been in existence at the lime of the bank crisis in 1893, the panic, which was caused chiefly through a lot of timid shareholders forcing their shares on the market from fear of being called upon to pay up the reserved -liability, would not have been so accentuated. Apart from the above, I am of opinion that the confidence of depositors would be increased by the fact that the reserve liability of shareholders was assured, and they would not be so anxious to withdraw their deposits. Hoping you will succeed in getting your Bill through. Yours faithfully, JOHN R.

WALKER, In the rush of business yesterday I overlooked writing you about the Bill you propose to introduce regarding accumulation of special reserves to enable banks to ultimately hold in Government securities an amount equivalent to the liabilities of shareholders under their shares, and thus provide that in the event of a crisis this fund would be able to pay up calls, and at a heavy calls in other respects, they would be relieved of this. My feeling is that the proposal is a very excellent one, and 1 am sure would tend to give better security alike to customers and shareholders of the banks, as such a fund once substantially established is a much better protection to banks' customers than the reserve liability of shareholders, who at a time of crisis would probably be unable to meet their calls. BAIN. I wish you every success with the Bill. Yours sincerely, P. T. TAYLOR. The next letter is from Mr Littlejohn, The next whom I am sure the honourable member for Gwydir has frequently heard of in commercial circles in Sydney, and also in connection with its Chamber of Commerce. August, 1910, Mr Littlejohn writes in these termsDEAR MR . WALKER, I am obliged to you for affording me a perusal of your Bill to authorize the formation of reserve funds within any joint stock banking company, for the protection of shareholders against liability in respect to uncalled capital and reserve liabilities on their shares. He then refers to the clauses one by one, and concludes with these remarksSpeaking in general upon this matter, I think that this B ill, if passed into an Act, will establish a much greater degree of confidence on the part of investors generally in public companies, though profits will be reduced until the reserve is established. Had such provisions been in force at the time of the failure of several banks in 1893, the shareholders of several of the banks, such as the Australian Joint Stock Company, would have been saved much harda satisfactory footing would doubtless have been accomplished much more speedily.

200,Mr Archibald (Hindmarsh) [2.30]. Way In Which Certain Clauses Of The Land,"any way calculated to cause uneasiness; but there is another feature of the measure which I do not like. What is the position, so far as the banks are concerned, in relation to their staffs ? ' From information given to me in my own State, I understand that not recently, but during the last twenty years, there has been a tendency to increase the salaries of the managers and higher officials of banks, while, at the same time, the claims of the junior or the general staff have been ignored. Bank employees all come within the category of ""gentlemen,"" and they have to maintain a certain social position. But there is the tendency, as I have pointed out, to be utterly indifferent to the claims of the men who are in that position. quired, or, at any rate, something to secure an increase in salaries. whether a Wages Board is required, but salaries ought to be increased. I desire to point out to honourable members, who are more familiar with banking directors than I am myself, and who, being of conservative spirit, ignore claims for Wages Boards or reforms of that character, that when a measure of this kind is before us it is only fair that we should have some guarantee that the supposed fund is not to be created by the sweating* of bank employees. In my belief that is the way in which the fund will be created; and honourable members on this side would display a want of common sense, in view of their knowledge of the world, if they did not realize that there is that danger, and that the men affected, by reason of their surroundings, cannot agitate .for their own relief. Bank employees are not like men engaged in many other occupations, who can voice their opinions in spite of their employers; and I ask honourable members on this side to be very careful in dealing with this Bill unless there is a guarantee of the kind I have suggested. Personally, unless there is . some such guarantee I shall be very cautious in my support of the Bill. I do not think that the real reason for the introduction of the measure has been laid before us. The real object of the Bill, in my belief, is to make bank shares the best gilt-edged securities in Australia; and I am led to that opinion, because, although this measure is new to me, proposals of the same nature are not new. In my own State of South Australia, the question has been referred to by one or two gentlemen, who point out that there are numbers of persons who have been interested in and associated with banking all their lives, and that there are sections of the public who follow up this class of investment. „If the holder of a great number of bank shares dies, his property is administered by trustees for the benefit of his children; and we know that trustees, while they do not"" worry much about men or boys, do worry a good deal about women beneficiaries., The average man thinks that his sons, if they have any grit in them, will be able to battle for themselves after he has gone; but he is naturally very anxious about his daughters. ' It is very essential that an investment which he makes for the benefit of his family on his decease should be guarded as closely as possible, and that, I believe, is the primary reason for the introduction of this measure. When a man desires to make an investment for the benefit of his family, he is anxious to obtain gilt edged securities, and he usually invests in Government securities, for they are the soundest that any one can hold. Unfortunately, however, the interest upon them is not as high as that usually obtainable by way of dividends on bank shares, and it seems to me that one of the objects of this measure is to make such a form of investment a gilt-edged security, and equally as sound as Government stock. I do not complain of an effort being made in that direction. No one could complain of the action of a man who tried to make his investments as secure as possible for the benefit of those who were to follow him, and all that we need trouble about in this connection is to guard the interests of the general community. It would have been well if such reasons as these had been given for the introduction of the measure in another place; but, as a matter of fact, totally different reasons were advanced. One favorable feature of the Bill is that it is merely permissive. We are not asked to enact by it that shareholders of banking companies shall be compelled to create a trust fund. The creation of such a fund will be entirely optional, but I am inclined to think that most of the banking companies will adopt the scheme. In the event of this Bill being passed, and one or two banking companies availing themselves of its provisions, I am confident that others will soon fall into line. I am doubtful, however, whether the public will be more secure under",37,Jones Ship And The Re Establishment Of The Bank Upon

The honourable member put it banking companies and to bank staffs. The very fairly that the paramount question nationalization of banking would result in for this Parliament to determine is whea reversal of present reforms. Nowadays, ther or not such a course is for the benefit we are diminishing the purchasing power of the general public.

205,Mr Greene,"It is a reserve to thegreat extent, be collected. But the tendency of late years has been for such shares to pass into the hands, not of wealthy men, but of people who are absolutely dependent upon the dividends derived from them for their subsistence. Consequently, the reserve liability upon these shares, which was supposed to be a guarantee to the public of the solvency of the institution concerned, if it went into liquiever, only fair to the banking institution dation, has, to a great extent, disappeared. Inasmuch as the shares of our great banking institutions have passed to a very great extent from the hands of wealthy men into those of people who are absolutely dependent upon their dividends, the reserve liability upon them, if it should ever be called up, would be found to be practically a negligible quantity. the great necessities for this legislation is that, if a banking institution went into liquidation, the reserve liabilty could not, to a great extent, for that reason, be collected. Not only would it ruin those individuals who hold the shares, but the general public, who are widely interested in our banking institutions, would not benefit. The object of the Bill is to enable any institution which likes to take advantage of it to build up out of its profits a fund, exceeding by io per cent, the full amount of the uncalled capital and the reserve liability, if any, on the shares. The honourable member for Hindmarsh said that, if we could give some guarantee that the Bill would benefit the public, and that the bank clerks would not lose by it, he' would be almost prepared to support it. sible for any one here to give a guarantee as to what the directors of the banks would do regarding the staffs. If it is desired that throughout Australia the staffs shall share to a greater extent than at present in the profits derived by the banks in the course of their business, that must be secured by legislation of an entirely different character. Even if we do not pass this Bill, it will not affect the position of the staffs of the banks, nor if we do pass it do I see that it will affect them. I admit that, in many cases, the remuneration of these men is not as much as it ought to be. I do not say that that is absolutely a general rule, but cases have come under my notice, as an old banker, in which I do not think that the employee has had altogether a fair deal. I think something might be done in that direction, and I Mr Greene. should not oppose legislation designed to> give a fair living wage to any man in Australia. orable member leave the bank because the wages were so small? count of my health, but I never regretted the day that I left the bank. It is, howwith which I was connected to say that it treated me very well, and that I have nothing whatever to complain of. I do not see how this legislation can affect that matter. We cannot incorporate in the Bill legislation dealing with the working conditions of, or wages paid to, the banking staffs. This fund can be built up only One of by the express will of the shareholders,, who will, at their periodical meetings, decide whether they are prepared or not to put aside a particular amount for the building up of the fund out of the total profit which the bank has made. Under the Bill there are two other sources upon which, it is permissible to draw for the fundOne is the premium on shares which maybe issued during the life time of the bank. It is perfectly fair that, on a new sharer being issued, any premium paid to the bank shall immediately go to the fund, because the new share would be protected to the full extent of the old share. bank would be increased as well. shareholders would be increased to the fullextent of the new share. The other sourceIt is practically imposfrom which the banks can draw is the recovery of bad debts. When a bank finds itnecessary to write off a bad debt, it must be written off out of profits. Consequently,, if a bank recovers a bad debt, which occasionally happens, and that goes into its profits, it is perfectly legitimate to draw upon it for this fund in whatever percentage the shareholders regard as just and equitable in the circumstances. I. commend the Bill to the House as one which I feel sure will assist the public in any time of crisis, because it will to a great extent prevent the fall of share values. In any timeof panic nothing intensifies the trouble so much as the fall in the values of the shares of the different financial institutions, and that fall is to a great extent caused by the recognition on the part of the shareholders of their liability under the reserve liabilities on the shares.

If the shareholders know that there is a reserve behind them, which they have built up themselves out -of their own profits, to the full extent of 'their liability, the causes of panic will be not help feeling that I had not earned the greatly mitigated, and the people will have an absolute assurance that, if any of the banking institutions do go into liquidation, the full amount is available to meet the whole of the reserve liability on their shares. This is a Bill the potentialities of which very few men, even those with banking experience, like the honourable member for Richmond, can foretell. I can hardly estimate them, and I am sure that if the .strenuous times through which we are passing permitted honourable members even to Tead through the debates that have taken place, in the other House, they would view ihe Bill with a certain amount of trepidation. I was once, as a unit of the Labour party, taken greatly to task by a bank -manager in this community. Criticising the White Australian policy, he asked why we kept people out of Australia, and instanced the Chinese. I told him, in reply, that, if Chinese bankers and banking methods were introduced here also, I might not object to the others coming, because, as -I pointed out to him, the Chinese law prothe Trustees Company, inside of it. vides that when a bank fails the directors and managers shall be decapitated. My friend the banker, who had passed through 4he "" boom"" crisis here, did not appreciate the suggestion, and the rest of the conversation was postponed to a future date. There is no doubt that the moneys of the reserves are not placed properly. When the -crash came, where were the reserves? It was not only poor people who suffered. As one who has had seven years' banking experience, let me tell the honourable member for Richmond that the vast majority of those who own shares in banks belong to the middle-class and the well-to-do. I do not know a working man in my constituency who owns bank shares, especially when he has to pay £ 1 0 or £ 1 5 each for them. It was not the workers who made a boom in banking shares and ran the prices up to fabulous amounts, but it is the workers who are always robbed when a crisis comes. As an old bank clerk, loving my first employer, as I suppose it is in my nature to be loyal, I have no personal complaint to make of my treatment. Honourable members might be astonished to know that after four months of real hard work, for which I did not get a penny a week, I was informed that if I lined up at the counter before 10 o'clock in the morning I could draw £ 4 3s. 4d. I was so impressed by the dignity of banking I could money, and did not deserve it. I even got into trouble for not calling for that allowance. The late Mr James, however, told me that if I kept him back in his work, by failing to draw my cheque, he would report me.. Needless to say, I was never threatened with a report afterwards. What became of the leserves of all the banking institutions in the crisis? They vanished like die th taiest tissue paper cast ; into a furnace. Tnat was our system of banking. I protest against giving any body of shareholders .power to remove a trustee. Seeing that it is the money of the people that is at stake, the trustees of the financial institutions should be appointed by Parliament or by the Government, and should not be removable at the whim of any combine of bank directors or coterie of banks. If the Bill goes into Committee, I propose to move that the trustees shall be appointed by the Governor General in Council, which will prevent any particular nominee being made a trustee. We see to-day in Melbourne the mighty Commercial Bank with another bank, called Mr Joske is the manager of the latter, and its city address is the Commercial Bank. This company has so little bowels of compassion that it is trying to grab £12,000 left to the charities of Melbourne. It is not content to accept what it would willingly have accepted at one time, and if a Committee is appointed by this or the State Parliament to investigate its affairs, it will be found that this bank within a bank is trading under false colours. Honourable members must be aware that persons unfit to be trustees have been kept in office, though known to be unfit, because men possessing capital could make money by keeping them in their positions. The history of the frauds perpetrated during the banking crisis has been written in the blood of human beings. Thank goodness, this Government, by its note issue legislation, will remove the power of these banks. Commonwealth bank is established. bank must come.

The honourable member for Ballarat and the honourable member for Flinders expressed the opinion that it was dangerous to vest such excessive powers in any one man, and, therefore, the Government have chosen the two senior permanent heads of the service as members of a Board, of which the Commissioner will be the chairman, and the majority of which will decide. The merits and the scope of the clause depend on its interpretation by the Commissioner, and it is hardly likely that the Court will be, or can be, called upon to interpret or construe its meaning. The clause applies to all cases of genuine hardship, where the taxpayer is more or less the passive agent who has been overtaken hy misfortune; and it is very obvious that we -cannot permit any or every kind of inability to pay to come before such a Board.. It would not be wise to enlarge the scope of the clause, which I may say has been taken bodily from the New Zealand Act.

The point is, however, that for the first year or two there may be a great many of these applications, and no doubt should that prove to be the case, the Government will consider the reconstruction of the Board. I do not take the sternly Spartan legal view of the honourable member for Angas in regard to cases of bankruptcy or insolvency; on the contrary, the only question I would raise in that regard is as to the words "" suffered such a loss,"" which might be construed as pointing to some class of cases to be hereafter strictly defined, outside which class no release could be given. scrutinize the clause too closely, because I assume that the words are wide enough to cover one of the most familiar, and, yet, one of the gravest, occasions of loss, namely, drought. emphatically do that. floods, and droughts are named. and kindred ills are covered. covered, anyhow. tage. AlthoughI am not for a moment denying that a great deal is to be said for the view taken by the honourable member for Angas, I am content to err on the side of charity. We owe consideration to all special emergencies and disasters which appeal to us all. These ought to appeal to us since, in the natural order of events, great hardships must occur in many cases, involving the temporary, if not the permanent, ruinof ourfarmersorsettlers. It is agreatadvantage that their cases should lie provided for; but if men less arduously occupied than the Secretary to the Treasury, and the Comptroller-General of Customs, could have been found to do this work for a year or two, it would have been an advantage. It would then have been possible for these questions to be disposed of, not only justly, but rapidly. Time is often the essence of the contract in such cases, and if men of greater leisure, as well as equal standing, could have been secured, a marked improvement would have been made in this clause. I do not think that the clause will be of any great service to a man who is bankrupt or insolvent. A remission made to a taxpayer so situated would inure to the benefit of his creditors, and not to himself. Such a remission would not enable him to make a fresh start. If this clause provided that, in the case of a man who had become insolvent, the tax payable should be made available to enable him to make a fresh start in life, there would be some justification for it ; but, under the clause as it stands, no very great concession will be made.

239,Mr Glynn (Angas) [3.50],"Paraparagraph b, I think it would be well to insert at the beginning of it the words, "" without just cause shown by him,"" so that the clause would provide that any person who, "" without just cause shown by him,"" refused or neglected to give evidence should be liable, and so forth. There seems to be no provision made for payment of the expenses of witnesses. the Commissioner should have power to summon a man to give evidence before him, although he may not be a taxpayer, and that the man should not be entitled to say that he is unable to attend, owing to some just cause. A man might be unable to attend before the Commissioner because of inability to pay the expenses of attendance. The Attorney-General mentioned last night that no provision is made for the payment of the expenses of witnesses under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, but, at the time, objection was taken to the omission. I move That the words *' without just cause shown by which he has given notice. him,"" be inserted before the word "" refuses,"" paragraph *. ' glad that the Attorney-General has consented to an amendment to protect a witness, who has not been paid his expenses I intended to move the insertion of the words, "" after being tendered a reasonable sum for his expenses,'' but the amendment just moved by the honourable member for Angas will overcome the difficulty. A witness without means who has not been paid his expenses will have to inform the Commissioner by letter that he has not the means to enable him to appear before him. It is highly necessary that some such amendment as this should be made. When we were dealing with the clause giving the Commissioner power to summon witnesses, this objection was taken, and, as the honourable member for Angas has pointed out, the power to summon does not relate merely to taxpayers. require a bookkeeper or some other employee of a taxpayer living in a remote part of a State to appear before him, and he may find it impossible to attend unless he is paid reasonable expenses. I would draw the attention of the Attorney General to section 105 of the New Zealand Act, under which power is given to make regulations prescribing the scale of expenses for witnesses, and would urge him, when we are dealing later on with the provision relating to the making of regulations, to provide for a similar power. Under this clause any person who wilfully makes a false return affecting his own or any other person's liability to, or exemption from, assessment of land tax, will be liable to a penalty not exceeding ;£ioo. It is rather arbitrary that I should like to ask the Attorney-General why, if such a penalty is considered sufficient punishment for so heinous an offence, it should have been thought necessary, under clause 44, to provide for the forfeiture of a man's land, if the Commissioner is not satisfied with the taxpayer's valuation of it, and notwithstanding that the valuation may be perfectly bond fide so far as the taxpayer himself is concerned. The penalty in this case shows that that for which clause 44 provides is beyond all reason, and I hope that the Attorney-General will keep in mind this comparison when he is submitting the further amendment of There is a possibility of hardship occurring under this clause, and it can be obviated only by a prior amendment. Sixty days are allowed from the time of notification until the return is made, but there are some parts of Australia where communication by post is delayed for months.

That gives an alternative. I shall also move to amend sub-clause 2, which deals with the onus frobandi, as indicated by the Prime Minister, so as to make it read as followsWhere the value stated in the return is less by 25 per centum or more than the value found by the jury the value shall be presumed in the absence of evidence to the contrary to have been understated with intent to defraud. J shall be glad if the Committee will follow those amendments so that they may understand the shape in which the clause is to appear. It will now, I think, take an unexceptionable form, and meet many of the objections previously raised against it. I do not suppose or hope that it will meet the objections of some honourable members, but even if the clause got down on its belly and crawled along they would still say that it was holding its head too high. I trust, however, that it will meet with the general approval of all reasonable beings, of whom, I am sure, there is an overwhelming majority in this Chamber. A number of things will have to happen before any of our unfortunate fellow-citizens can get into trouble under it. They must go ""before a jury of their fellow-countrymen. Their fellow-countrymen must find out one thing in particular-that there has been, in fact, an undervaluation of 25 per cent, or more. That is to say, instead of the Commissioner assessing the value, it is the jury that will have to assess .it. Of course, the jury, in respect of this matter, will, like other juries, have to find the facts from the evidence put before them. Part of that evidence will, of course, be the evidence of the Commissioner himself, and the evidence of witnesses called either by the' Commissioner or the taxpayer. On that the jury will have to find whether, as a fact, there has been undervaluation to the extent of 25 per cent, or more. If there is no evidence to the contrary, the onus is on the taxpayer to show that there has been no fraud. That is a perfectly fair proposition. It even appears to place the Commissioner and the Commonwealth in some respects at a disadvantage, but I emphatically say that no man can complain if under this clause he gets into trouble, because the clause does all it can to get him out. If . he persists in being unable to convince the jury, and in being unable to produce a shred of evidence, I think it is about time something happened. honourable member wants it. Surely the possession of property ought not to subject a man to being put in the dock ? property-owners. I suppose, after all, the world is divided into sinners and saints, irrespective of whether they have crowns of gold or hobnailed boots, and that if you yarded-in all the persons that came up to the top of Bourke-street you would get at least fifty-one rich men in every hundred sinners. The mere fact that they have property raises a curious presumption as to where they got it. As in the case of a man found on premises with articles for which he is unable to account, the onus is on him to explain how he got them. This clause will provide, in the clearest possible .way, that the taxpayer shall be first of all asked to give a fair and truthful valuation of his land. member expect every owner to be an expert valuer ? is not trying to see what is right in this matter; he is only trying to find a way to get round the clause. I am sorry for that, because I thought the honourable member would have appreciated it in its new form. One of the chief reasons for amending it was to insure that those gentlemen who criticised it in its former shape would cease to do so; but it seems to have been labour in vain. The only case in which there is a presumption of fraud resting on the taxpayer is when the jury have found, as a fact, that there has been an undervaluation of 25 per cent, or more; and when, secondly, the taxpayer is unable to rebut that presumption by any evidence to the contrary. If both those conditions are absent, the onus is on the prosecution, as usual, to establish the charge. If , however, they are both made out, the onus is on the taxpayer, but not otherwise.

Clause 69 provides that, whoever aids, abets, counsels, or procures, by any act or omission, or is knowingly concerned in the commission of an offence, shall be deemed to have committed it, and shall be punishable accordingly. Therefore, all concerned as legal advisers, valuators, or in other ways, in the making of a valuation which is 25 per cent, below the Commissioner's assessment, may be put on their trial in the manner provided for by this clause. The honourable member for Angas has pointed out that a person put on his trial for undervaluation is presumed to have undervalued with intent. evidence to the contrary. tion is 25 per cent, below the Commissioner's assessment changes the onus of proof of intent from the Crown to the person charged. Presumably, this provision is based upon that in the Customs Act-section 255 of which enacts thatIn every Customs prosecution the averment of the prosecutor or plaintiff contained in the information, declaration, or claim, shall be deemed to be proved in the absence of proof to the contrary, but so that(a) when an intent to defraud the revenue is charged the averment shall not be deemed sufficient to prove the intent, and (4) in all proceedings for an indictable offence or for an offence directly punishable by imprisonment, the guilt of the defendant must be established by evidence. Where an indictable offence is charged under that Act, the guilt of the defendant must be established by evidence, intent having to be proved by the Crown. That should be the provision in this Bill. The value of land is purely a matter of opinion; but if a valuation is 25 per cent, under the assessment, the onus of proof of intent to defraud is shifted from the Crown to the defendant. Yet it is the general .practice in criminal cases that the person charged shall have the benefit of any doubt. I cannot find any precedent for this provision in the New Zealand law or in the law of the States. the publican under the New South Wales Liquor Act. Is not the principle the same here? wrongdoing. Any person who attempts to defraud should be punished; but when a person is charged with a serious crime, cam* ing with it such a penalty as the forfeiture of his land, the onus of proof of guilt should be on the Crown. As to the constitutionality of the provision, that is for the Attorney-General to decide for himself. He knows the .serious consequences of putting unconstitutional clauses into a measure such as this. Prime Minister and Attorney-General) [4-3o] -Clearly the onus is thrown on the taxpayer only where the valuation is 25 per cent., or more, under. The honourable member now suggests that, whether a man undervalues wilfully or otherwise, if he did not undervalue to the extent of 25 per cent, or more, he ought not to be punished, and, in my opinion, that would be a most infamous state of things. The honourable member for Darling Downs, on the other hand, has just declared that if a man deliberately attempts to defraud, he ought to be punished; and the suggestion of the honourable member for Angas discloses quite a new morality. Hitherto a man might not steal in small quantities, but only in large quantities, and now it is proposed to reverse that. A man if he fraudulently undervalues to the extent of 10 per cent., though his estate be worth £1,000,000,. and a serious loss of revenue is caused thereby, is not to be punished. charged under clause 66, but I wish to prevent forfeiture. Committee ought not to accept the amendment, which practically amounts to an encouragement of undervaluation to the extent of 24 per cent. The honourable member for Darling Downs contends that the taxpayer will be practically branded as a criminal because of this clause. throws on him the responsibility of establishing his innocence. Mi. HUGHES I submit that the honourable member is in error. The amendment of the honourable member for Angas seeks to provide that, unless a man undervalues to the extent of 25 per cent, or more, the onus shall not be placed on him.

What doubt remains? for Angas asked at what stage would the taxpayer know the jury had found that the undervaluation was 25 per cent, or over. apply it must be established, as a condition precedent, that the taxpayer has undervalued his estate 25 per cent, or more; and, to that end, the preliminary proceeding will be in the nature of an assessment. The onus on the taxpayer is only to prove that there is no fraud, and, therefore, the proceedings may go on without interruption. This clause does not deal with undervaluation per se, but only with undervaluation with intent to defraud, and only when undervaluation with intent hss been established does the penalty follow. The fact that the jury finds undervaluation to the extent of, say, 50 per cent., only throws on the taxpayer the onus of proving that he undervalued legitimately, and a man who has no reason to offer must be in a bad way. He has not to offer conclusive proof, but only sufficient to shift the onus from his shoulders to the Crown.

In a valuation case, what is there to prevent a jury saying that they are satisfied there has been undervaluation, and the case going on? All these issues are beside the point, which is: Does this or does it not place the taxpayer in an unfair position? I submit that it does not; and all we have to see is that every party, including the Crown, gets a fair deal. dent for such a clause in a Land Tax Bill? will experience the greatest difficulty in Marks Act and the Customs Act of Great Britain such provisions are established principles. under our Customs Act.

The Attorney-General has said that he desires to give taxpayers under this Bill a fair deal. We have to take him at his word, and I ask him to consider seriously whether they, will have a fair deal under this clause. The honourable member for A.vgas proposes that the undervaluation complained of shall be, at least, 25 per cent., but the Attorney-General holds that able, since it would exempt a man who had undervalued his land to a smaller extend, but with thq actual desire of defrauding the revenue. I take it that the object which the honourable member for Angas has in view is to provide that the undervaluation shall be a substantial one. The Attorney-Generaldoes not seem to appreciate the fact that land values fluctuate to a remarkable degree, more particularly in districts far removed from settlement. The honourable member for Maranoa has pointed out that at the end of a drought land is worth next to nothing, and that twelve months later, after a good season, its) value may increase by 100 per cent. I wish to impress that fact on the mind of the Minister in charge of the Bill. Another point which I do not think he realizes is that land-owners, as a class, are far removed from centres of population, and .are, on the-whole, simple-minded men.

AlthoughI have followed very carefully the debate on this Bill, I find myself quiteunable to say with any degree of cermeasure, and I know of no Act from which tainty what improvements may be deducted in determining the unimproved value of a block of land. I do not know that it is clear that a reduction may be made in respect of the cost of scrubbing, ringbarking, and so forth; and the average land-owner will find himself sorely puzzled in preparing his return. Under this clause, men and women may undervalue their property without any intention of defrauding the revenue, and, because of that undervaluation, may find themselves in the dock. They will be subjected to what, in the opinion of the average man or woman, is an absolute outrage. I have no sympathy for a guilty man, but I do not think it fair to put a man in the dock, and to place him on his trial, on the mere supposition that he is guilty. guilty if he has evidence to prove his innocence. a man may be subjected to the indignity of being placed in the dock before he can bring to bear satisfactory evidence to prove his innocence. This is a most extraordinary provision, and, taken in conjunction with the clause providing for forfeiture of land in the case of wilful undermitted by the Government, in order to susvaluation, is positively dreadful. Treason is the only other offence for which a man in the British Dominions may be stripped of his possessions. At one time, a murderer on conviction was deprived of his possessions, but nowadays treason is the only offence in respect of which such punishment may be meted out. With my knowledge of land values, I have no hesitation in saying that, notwithstanding that a jury might consider that a man had committed an offence under this clause, the undervaluation might be quite unintentional. The clause will cause terror to the landowners, because of the knowledge that if they inadvertently undervalue their pro1 perty they may be stripped of their possessions and placed in a criminal dock. The amendments proposed by the Attorney General will make the clause worse than it was. I feel strongly on this question, but we are in the hands of the Government, and I can do no more than enter mv protest. It is plain that this drastic penal legislation is without precedent in any other Land There is no mention in the marginal notes that it has been taken from any other the penal clauses relating to forfeiture and onus of proof could have been taken. feiture of goods? member refers to a provision in the Customs Act. My contention is that there is no precedent for this legislation in any Land Tax Act. The Attorney-General has scarcely stated fairly the object which the honourable member for Angas has in view in submitting his amendment, and which is ' really to define the offence of an undervaluation with intent to defraud. If the amendment be agreed to, it will define in concrete form the offence which the Crown will have to prove in order to launch a case before a jury. In other words, it will make an undervaluation by at least 25 per cent, the test and standard of an intent to defraud. The same test and standard is to be found in sub-clause 2 of clause 65, which provides thatWhere the value stated in the return is less, by 25 per centum or more, than the value as assessed by the Commissioner, the value shall be deemed to have been understated with intent to defraud until the contrary is proved. Therefore, according to the Bill as subtain a charge of intent to defraud there must be an undervaluation to the extent of, at least, 25 per cent., and the honourable member for Angas simply requires that it shall be stated in the indictment that there has been an undervaluation to that extent with intent to defraud. It is evident that the Government did not intend to make an undervaluation of 2, 3, or even 10 per cent, an offence punishable by these drastic penalties. According to the Government's own proposal, there seems to have been some margin provided for, and in dealing with the valuation of land it is only just that some margin should be allowed for a difference of opinion.

287,Sir John Quick,"The honorableunfair to compare the valuation of land, as dealt with under this taxation scheme, with the value of goods as referred to in the Customs Act. The valuation of goods as dealt with under the Customs Act relates to transactions of which there are written records, probably in the possession of the owner or obtainable from certain warehouses. found at the port of export or the port of entry, and it seems to me to be easier to trace the value of goods there than it is to determine the value of land, which, after all, may depend upon the opinion of valuators whose views may differ. This deals with a special class of offence, and, even if the amendment be carried, there will still be abundant provision under clause 66 for the punishment of any person who, by wilful act, default, or intent, evades or attempts to evade assessment or taxation. The honourable member for Angas merely proposes to throw the onus of proof upon the Crown at the beginning of the prosecution. It seems most absurd to provide that there shall be two stages of the prosecution, the first requiring the Crown to establish an undervaluation of 25 per cent., and the second, when that has been proved, throwing the onus of proof on the defendant. It is best to throw the onus of proof on the Crown throughout, especially in a case involving criminal elements, as under this clause. A case of undervaluation cannot be compared with the cases of stealing mentioned by the Attorney-General. In the latter case, you are dealing with concrete acts or omissions of a tangible character that can be ascertained and proved. Where, however, you are dealing with a matter of opinion, it is hard to fasten criminal intent on any person. It would be very hard to establish a criminal liability for matters involving merely a difcome to all the credit attaching to itference of opinion, without that difference of opinion having actually resulted in defrauding the revenue. [5.2] -The Attorney-General has repeatedly justified this and similar provisions by referring to the Customs Act, and it has just as frequently been pointed out to him that there is no similarity between Customs fraud and the undervaluation <for assessment purposes of land under this Act. The Minister of Customs knows very well that there is almost as much difference between the two cases as between daylight and dark. It is impossible in Customs transactions to get at the real facts of the case where the Customs House is situated, because they can be ascertained only at the port of shipment. It is, therefore, necessary, in order to guard against fraud through the Customs, to throw the onus of proof of innocence upon the importer. The case of land valuation is entirely different, because the land is here, and all the evidence can be obtained close at hand. There is, therefore, no analogy whatever. The very drastic nature of the tax must provoke a determination on the part of the landowner to get as low a value as possible, because, especially under the higher grades of the tax, a man will be stripped of practically half his inheritance. that he will underestimate the value of his land? a danger, it is provoked by the drastic rates of tax that the Government are imposing. The land-owners are being treated as they are not treated under land taxation measures by any other Parliament, so far as I know, in any British country. There has never been anything so severe or drastic suggested outside the shadow of the red flag of the extreme wing of revolutionary Socialism. I have heard similar treatment suggested in such quarters, but never in a responsible Parliament. whether it is through the land tax or through the Customs. It is a crime in both cases. a robbery in the sense covered by the instances quoted by the Attorney-General. There is also the other principle, which seems novel and original, and in respect of which the Attorney-General is quite welthat a man shall be arraigned before a jury, and then, after the jury has determined the question, he can act in his own defence and try afterwards to establish his innocence. All the way through the penalties and difficulties are entirely disproportionate to the offences. proportionate to fraud? fraud, let the fraud be punished, but let the Government prove the fraud. prove it.",50,Australian Industries Preservation Bill

297,Mr Hughes,"The Government have toGovernment prove it in a straightforward ' way, and not put these cases, when brought before tbe Court, on all-fours with offences against the Customs Act. There is no justification for introducing these novel and extreme provisions. The Minister is going to harass the landed community of Australia in a fashion that he and his Department will regret, not once, but as long as the Act remains unrepealed. that before. Attorney-General will hear it again a hundred times, as long as the Act endures. He admits that he has no precedent for this provision in land-taxation instruments created by any other Parliament. Department is to be created, taxation is to be double-banked, that of the Commonwealth being imposed on top of that of the States, and the Bill is being made as difficult and burdensome as possible to the land-owners of the community, while all the wav through it the Attorney-General is assuming that they are likely, not in exceptional cases, but generally, to practise roguery. Mi. FENTON A great many of them will not be called upon to send in returns at all. where the trouble comes in, and that is why I speak strongly. The great bulk of the land-owning community will suffer oppression under the Bill all. the days of their life. The keen men, who' have had a commercial training, and who will go into the Law Courts, will get out of it, but the more simple-minded of the community, the land-owners who have not had a commercial training, will suffer, and continue to suffer. They are the people that should be protected, under this measure, but they are the very men who will be penalized. wish to protest most strongly against the way in which the penal clauses have been drafted. Where it is a question of land values, there is a far greater possibility of a miscarriage of justice than where the question is a simple one of fact. The Attorney General has said over and over again that it is simply a case of a man valuing his own land and that the owner should be the best judge of its value. really the question I should admit at once that the Attorney-General was perfectly right, but it is not the question. The question is the unimproved value of the land, which is a very different matter. favour of the taxpayer. taxpayer. It is an arbitrary determination of what, in that man's opinion, the unimproved value of the land is. This cannot be reduced to a question of absolute fact. It must remain a matter of opinion, after all. In a case known as Black's case, which went before the Land Appeal Court of New South Wales, a homestead selector asked for leave to convert under the Act. The Crown valuers put the unimproved value of the property down at £12 an acre. The man appealed to the A new Land Board of the district, and brought forward valuers who estimated the unim-' proved value at £ 4 per acre. The Land Board fixed it at £ f i an acre. The Crown appealed to the Land Appeal Court at Sydney, and finally the unimproved value was determined by the Court at jQ& an acre. Therefore, the highest Land Court in New South VVales declared that the Crown valuation was 33 per cent, higher than it ought to have been, and that the valuation of £ 4 , fixed by expert men who had lived in the district all their lives, was 100 per cent, too low. I know another case where three shires met at one corner. There were three separate valuers valuing the land of those shires. At the point where the shires met the land was all of identical value, but the unimproved' value determined by those three men was £ 1 2 , £ 1 0 , and £ 7 per acre respectively. There you get at once the wide difference of £ 5 per acre in the opinion of experts regarding land which' was all of identical value. These cases only go to show how difficult it is for men, however expert, to arrive at the true unimproved value of land. It is more or less a fictitious thing It means the arbitrary 1 fixing of a value which, in point of fact, has no real existence, and that is the great"" difficulty. If a man asks me what I want' for my land I can tell him the value I place upon it. If this were a question of the improved value I could understand the At-torney-General desiring to go the full length of these clauses to meet under-estimates. When, however, it is a question of the unimproved value, which only the If that were most expert men can really determine, the situation is entirely different, and I object to these clauses being drafted in this",51,Australian Industries Preservation Bill

304,Mr Greene,"It is all against thedrastic fashion. * I should not. object so much if the question were one that had already been 'determined by a competent Court, and if then the man were placed on his trial. for the Commissioner to determine that the value is 25 per cent, too low, whereupon he can at once place the man in the position of a criminal, and make him stand his trial before a jury of his countrymen. Why could not a man be proceeded against under clause 66, if necessary? No one should be treated as a criminal until a prima facie case has been made out against him by the Crown. This clause should not apply until a Court had determined that the value stated by the owner was 25 per cent, too little. for, the Bill would be much'less drastic. I do not think that any honourable member would like to be put into the criminal dock, as if he were a murderer, for merely differing from the Commissioner as to the value of his land. The Bill makes it an indictable offence to submit a valuation 25 per cent, below the value determined by a jury, who may have no knowledge of values at all. When a case goes into Court, the Crown will have the assistance of legal advisers and expert witnesses, and can use all its great influence to obtain judgment against the man who has to rely on his own knowledge of values. It is a most difficult thing to determine the unimproved value of land. Terang, a farmer bought a block of land adjoining his own holding for £ 8 0 an acre, but other land of exactly the same quality realized only £ 5 5 an acre. _ That farmer might rightly claim that his land was worth no more than the land of like quality which fetched £ 5 5 an acre; but, were he to value it at that sum, he would run the risk, under the Bill, of being put into the dock and tried by a jury for submitting a valuation more than 25 per cent, below the trut value, which might be held to be the amount which he himself had paid. There are sufficiently heavy penalties in the Bill without the provision for forfeiture. A fine of £500 may be inflicted, and the offender may be compelled to pay treble the tax. If forfeiture is provided for, however, a bond fide purchaser for value may find, after he has bought land, that it is liable to forfeiture because of an under-statement of its value by the previous holder. Land transactions cannot be carried on under difficulties of that kind. Would any wise man take the risk"" of buying land which might, unknown to him, be liable to forfeiture? Surely this provision will greatly depreciate the value In this case it is simply left of land. It must be remembered that it is very easy to make a mistake in a valuation. The other day the Government valuation was 50 pei cent, below that of the mortgagee in respect of a piece of land resumed for a cordite factory. Under a provision such as that in the Bill, the Minister of Defence could have been put into the dock for making an undervaluation. Why should we provide several, heavy penalties in addition to forfeiture to punish men for making innocent mistakes ? I do not think that there will be enough jurymen, Crown proseI f that were provided cutors, and Judges to deal with all the cases that will come into Court during the next five years. As the honourable member for Angas has said, the more severe you make penalties, the more crime increases Already by many persons Jhose who own land in this country are looked upon as criminals, although the States have encouraged people to buy land, and in New South Wales and Queensland have pressed it on them. Nothing is more difficult than to arrive at the unimproved value of land. Who could say what is the unimproved value of the land on which this building stands ? The building itself cost about £750,000, but it would be difficult to say what its value was if it became vacant by the removal of this Parliament to Yass-Canberra, and was no longer required for its Recently, at present purpose.

Are honourable members ready to prosecute 50 per cent, of the population, because the other 50 per cent, will not be interfered with ? It seems that it will take half of our population to keep the other half in gaol if the Bill is passed as it stands, and there will not be enough gaol accommodation for those whom our legislation will make criminals. Attorney-General does not appear to recognise that he is taking a departure, not without some precedent, but still a wide departure from all ordinary processes of taxation. A State, for its own maintenance, requires to levy on its subjects; and the almost universal practice is for the States to undertake the work of assessing the individuals responsible. If this system were followed here we should be relieved of all the many very serious considerations laid before the Ministry in consequence of the proposed new procedure. The Commonwealth, for its own sake, seeks to shift the burden of responsibility of determining the payments to be made by tlie taxpayer on to the taxpayer's own shoulders. Having in this way removed the responsibility from where, in my opinion, it ought to rest, the Commonwealth ought to treat the taxpayer with the utmost consideration, since it imposes on him obligations which he does not desire, and for which he may be imperfectly prepared. He is called upon, not to value his property in the ordinary way, but to conduct a calculation, making a deduction for the valuation of improvements, in regard to which he may be biased or otherwise incapable of presenting accurately. This means often a very complex problem, very open to honest differences of opinion. He has then at his peril to arrive at a certain price: and if he does not come within -a certain distance of the bull's-eye is liable to be penalized as a criminal and suffer accordinclv. If this calculation of values and deductions were of his own seeking there would not be justification for complaint; but, inasmuch as this is a task from which many would willingly escape, and for the performance of which' they would in many cases be glad to pay, vthy should not the Government afford relief to all who intimate that, not desiring to form, or not being capable of forming, an opinion themselves, they would like some responsible officer to be deputed to make an official valuation for them on payment of a reasonable fee? Why should our people, nolens volens, be saddled with technical and arduous responsibilities carrying drastic penalties, and, what is worse to many, a reputation of criminality because of honest mistakes. It is speedier, cheaper, and more convenient for its officials, for the Government to transfer this onerous responsibility, and doubtless a number of taxpayers will prefer to undertake it ; but there must be in Australia a very large number to whom a safety valve of the kind suggested would make their task much simpler, while giving the Government all to which it is entitled, and permitting the amount due to be settled, as ordinary questions of taxation usually are, by the action of the State itself through its officers. Prime Minister and Attorney-General) [5.35] -In reply to the criticism offered, I trust I may be permitted to cite a few cases in which the onus of proof is placed on the defendant. First, as a general principle, we have it laid down in Stephen's Digest of the Law of Evidence. . . . the burden may in the course of a case be. shifted from one side to the other, and in considering the amount of evidence necessary to shift the burden of proof the Court has regard to the opportunities of knowlege with respect to the fact to be proved which may be possessed by the parties respectively. That extract is peculiarly relevant to the matter before us, because the question of fraudulent intent must be one within the knowledge of the defendant. Then Taylor on Evidence, page 349, sets forth a vast number of statutes in which this principle is affirmed. It applies to all cases where, in the nature of things, proof is extremely difficult or impossible unless the onus is thrown on the defendant. It embraces all sorts of criminal charges, quasi criminal charges, and cases for the recovery of penalties under any Act.

""-a well-known offence; and I have no sympathy with a man who tells a falsehood. The honourable member for Ballarat made JOHN FORREST A taxpayer who a forcible point when he declared that the Government were placing upon land-owners a burden which they themselves should shoulder. The Government call upon landowners to value their own landa duty which ought to be performed by the Government themselves-and they declare, in this Bill, that if a valuation made by a land-owner does not correspond with that made by the Commissioner, the former may be subjected to heavy penalties. I fail to see why this Bill should provide for so many penalties in addition to those which already prevail under other Acts of Parliament. Most Land Acts provide that in the case of undervaluation an appeal may be made to a Court, and the unsuccessful appellant has usually to pay the costs. That is the procedure ordinarily followed in connection with municipal and income tax valuations, and I have not heard of any one suffering a serious injustice from it. We have a land tax in operation in Western Australia with an exemption of £200, and the whole country has been valued. In the first year of the operation of that Act the assessments were based upon the valuations of the owners. In the second year, however, the valuations were reviewed in some cases by the Department, and any man found to have undervalued his land was required to pay additional taxation in respect of the two years' period. cases of undervaluation? Western Australia at the time, but I think that a great many occurred. In the first year the municipal valuation was as far as possible generally followed. For the most part, the municipal valuation is based on the rental and not on the unimproved value, but in some cases the municipalities have the option of taking 4 per cent, on the unimproved valuation or the actual rental value. There has not been any friction in Western Australia, and it seems to me that the books of the Land Tax Department of that State will be available for the purposes of this Bill. The unimproved value in Western Australia has been ascertained by the Taxation Department there, but whether it will meet with the approval of the Commissioner to be appointed I do not know. We object to this provision, not because of any sympathy with those who are guilty of fraud, but because of the difficulty in which it will place many innocent persons.

327,Sir John Forrest,"I was not inhe may be dragged before a Court and subjected to great indignity. should consider it a terrible indignity to be placed in a dock and to be called upon to answer a charge of fraud merely because, as the owner of a piece of land, I had placed upon it a valuation which in the opinion of the Commissioner was too low. Such treatment does not savour of British fair play. The Minister has forgotten the indignity that an innocent man would suffer in having to defend himself against a charge of fraud, and I appeal to honourable members to take care that no one is subjected to such treatment. I should be quite willing to pay any reasonable taxation, and if I were dissatisfied with the decision of the Commissioner I should appeal, but I . would strongly object to the indignity of being placed on my trial for an indictable offence merely because I had made an honest valuation, although it might be one which happened to be below die Commissioner's estimate. I object to the use of the word ' indictable'' 1 in this clause. I do not know that it means very much, but it is generally associated with a criminal proceeding. Indictable offences are usually tried before a Judge and jury, and the person charged is placed in the dock, and is, as a rule, liable to imthat a great many of the clauses have been prisonment. This clause does not provide for imprisonment, and I am informed by those learned in the law that the use of the word ""indictable"" is unnecessary. The Attorney-General has failed to show that there is any precedent for this drastic form of legislation. He has quoted certain laws prevailing in England and other countries, under which the onus of proof in some cases is cast on the persons charged. But he has not shown that such a provision exists in any land or income tax Act in force in Australia or New Zealand. We do not need to have read to us essays on British jurisprudence; we want the Attorney-General to show where, in any New Zealand or Australian Act, such a provision as this appears. Why should he make this Bill more drastic than any similar law in Australia? example of Great Britain, and that is a caucus when they set out to devise fresh good one. gard to land taxation. I that there is no such provision as this in a land or income-tax Act in Australia or New Zealand. Then, again, this is a class law, which will apply only to persons owning land the unimproved value of which exceeds £5,000. Why should the Government assume that such persons are dishonest, and that it is necessary to have ultra-stringent provisions to compel them to obey the law ? There is no reason why we should attack the interests of individuals to a greater extent than is necessary. Most of those who voted for the Labour party will escape this taxation, and I fail to see why the Government should insult in this way the persons to whom it will apply. The Attorney-General has insulted them, not only in his Bill, but continually by word of mouth during this debate. The provisions of this clause are exceptional, and I strongly object to them. I complain, not of the drastic provisions relating to treble taxation, so much as the attempt on the part of the Government to do that which will be offensive to the class of persons in Australia who own land exceeding the unimproved value of .£5,000. Numerous references to the New Zealand Act appear in the marginal notes, showing taken bodily from, or suggested by, that measure. The Attorney-General has also repeatedly referred to if as a justification .for many provisions that he has asked us to pass, but I see no reference to it, or any other Act, in the marginal note to this clause. It would be very interesting to know where the Government got these beautiful penalties from. The person who devised them ought to have lived in the Dark Ages, when torturing was a fine art. We may presume that the caucus has seen and approved of them, and, if so, I hope that the people will observe what gentle masters they are now being ruled by. If there is anything more extreme or drastic to be conceived than this clause, I should like to see it. I am only surprised that, after ordering the forfeiture of the land, the clause does not direct that the owner should be executed, or soused in boiling oil.

Title agreed to. Bill reported with amendments. Sitting suspended from 6.2Q to 8 p.m. of External Affairs) [8.0] I move That this Bill be now read a second time. This BiU is introduced at the earliest possible moment, not only because of its importance, but because it is necessary, if the Commonwealth intend to accept the offer of South Australia, that we should make up our mind at once. This we owe to South Australia, because the agreement between the honourable member for Ballarat, as Prime Minister, and the late Mr Price, Premier of the State, was entered into some four and a-half years ago, and it is quite time we arrived at a decision. The Government and Parliament of South Australia are placed in a somewhat unfortunate position, seeing that they cannot make their plans in regard to expenditure until they know whether the liability for the control of the Northern Territory is to remain with them or to be assumed by the Commonwealth. Further, we have to remember that, on the part of a considerable minority of the people of South Australia, there is much antagonism to the handing over of the Territory, and there is a constant agitation for the repeal of the State measure which provides for the transfer. So long as the matter is held in abeyance, so long will that minority be a source of trouble j and the State Government are never sure that at any moment a repeal of the agreement may not be brought about. During the present session there was a motion in the House of Assembly with that object, and at the present time a similar proposal is before the Legislative Council. What the result may be it is, of course, impossible to say; but it is well known that there is a majority in the Legislative Council, and possibly in both of the State Houses, of opinion that the Commonwealth is not very time some definite action was taken. It is felt that it would be much better for South Australia to know that she has to face the responsibility of controlling the Territory, while there are not wanting those who believe that a great mistake is being made in handing over this portion of Australia to the Commonwealth. It will be seen, therefore, that there is every reason to deal with this measure at the earliest possible moment. Perhaps the strongest reason of all for passing it is that in the meantime the development of the Territory is entirely suspended. The Northern Territory represents about one-fifth of the Australian continent; and ever since the agreement, to which I have referred, was entered into, no land has been parted with except on annual permits, which are most unsatisfactory, seeing that with such a tenure we cannot expect occupiers to do much in the way of improvements or stocking. As a matter of fact, they merely get off as much grass as possible in a year, and then leave; and altogether, no conditions could be less favorable to develop-",59,Pairs

349,Mr Batchelor,"It is hardly worthwhole area of Australia; and this vast extent of country is practically uninhabited, containing only some 3,000 people, including Chinese. We know that elsewhere in Australia there is no considerable portion not fitted for successful occupation; and, guided by that fact, without using any extravagant language-without indulging in any glowing periods as to its possibilities and probabilities-I think we must all realize that in the Northern Territory there must be a vast extent of country capable of supporting a considerable population. The Territory comprises an area of 523,620 square miles, and lying, as it does, closer to the Eastern Archipelago than any other part of Australia, it is dangerously inviting to any of the Eastern nations that might desire to settle upon it. The only genuine right to a country is that which population, effective occupation, and settleover 40 inches, almost wholly in the north? ment give. As to the climate of the Territory, we find that there are as many divergent views as there are in regard to its potentialities. Whilst a considerable proportion of it is within the tropics, on the whole the humidity is less than that of almost any other tropical region. That suggests that white men can work there, although they are unable to do so in other countries in similar latitudes. The dry. ness of the climate 'will certainly assist in its successful occupation. The rainfall is by no means scanty.

The area with an average annual rainfall of less than 10 inches in the Northern Territory is about one-third of the area with a similar rainfall in Western Australia, and less than half that in South Australia. Then, again, it is shown that the area with an average annual rainfall of from TO to 20 inches is, in the case of Western Australia, 397,416 square miles; next comes Queensland, with an area of 251,150; whilst the Northern Territory is third on the list with an area of 181,298 Mr Batchelor. square miles. New South Wales has an area of 118,685 square miles with a similar rainfall. For an average annual rainfall of from 20 to 30 inches, Queensland is first on the list, and then come Western Australia and the Northern Territory in the order named. Queensland has also a very large area with a rainfall of from 30 to 40 inches, whilst the Northern Territory has by far the largest area under a rainfall of over 40 inches. That area comprises 83,826 square miles, as against 50,260 square miles in Queensland, 13,629 square miles in Western Australia, 11,156 square miles in New South Wales, 4,777 square miles in Victoria, and 222 square miles in South Australia. 83,826 square miles in the Northern Territory, with an average annual rainfall of area with that rainfall in Queensland is also on the coastline. The Government Resident's annual report for 1909 shows that there was a rainfall of 64.47 inches at Point Charles lighthouse, in the extreme north; 59.21 inches at Port Darwin; 52.13 inches at Brock's Creek; 33.50 inches at fine Creek; 33.12 inches at Katherine; 22.03 inches at Victoria River Downs; 21.26 inches at Bradshawsj 20.66 inches at Roper River; 26.69 inches at Borroloola; and 11.30 inches at Newcastle Waters, which is well towards the south of the Territory.

If further proof were wanting of the suitability of the country for carrying a healthy population, it could be found in the fact that the aborigines in the Northern Territory, both in physique and virility, are distinctly superior to those in other parts of Australia. Although, for the most part, they reside on the coastal areas, which are not so healthy as are other parts of the Territory, we have this splendid record of them. I do not propose to speak at length of the mineral possibilities of the Territory. Honourable members will recognise tiiat any statement that may be made concerning the mineral possibilities of a country must be rather hazardous, but a considerable number of geologists of repute have examined the Territory, and have declared without exception that important mineral developments are certain to follow the expenditure of capital, and the opening up of the country. Although, so far, the surface has only been scratched, not one mine having been put down to a greater depth than 200 feet-the Northern Territory has yielded £2,565,578 worth of gold, silver, and copper. All this has been found practically on the surface. reefs have been struck, but, as a rule, mining companies there have been overcapitalized, and have speedily come to grief. I wish now to refer briefly to the position of South Australia, as the present possessor of this huge extent of country. The Northern Territory was annexed to South Australia in 1863, and since then that State has controlled it. It must be admitted that, on the whole, its control has not been a success, but I do not know that any useful purpose would be served by inquiring into the reasons. stated. pose, is that the State of South Australia has not had sufficient money to develop the country. vious reason, but the principal cause of the failure of the State Government to effect any material development of the Territory has been the distance of the Territory, for all practical purposes, from South Australia. Distance, after all, is not a matter of mileage so much as of the time taken to get from one point to another. Although the borders are contiguous, the distance between the country in the Northern Territory with a good rainfall and the country in South Australia with a good rainfall-Adelaide, for instance-is greater than the distance of the Northern Territory from any other capital in Australia. The distance by sea from Adelaide to Palmerston is 3,500 odd miles, which is actually greater than from any other capital in Australia. When you apply the real test of distance, that of the time taken to get from one point to another, it is seen that the disadvantages which South Australia has had to face in controlling the Territory have been enormous j and, sometimes, in reflecting on South Australia's comparative failure, we have failed, I think, to make sufficient allowance for them. It must always be remembered that, between South Australia and the Northern Territory, there lies a desert, or as near an approach to a desert as Australia contains, a wide extent of country with an average rainfall of only 4 or 5 inches. The rainfall at Port Augusta is from 12 to 14 inches. thought. It rises a little in the Flinders Range, and then tapers off until you reach as low an average as 4 inches. In some years, no rain at all has fallen. From there on, right up to the MacDonnell Ranges, is an arid belt which, for all practical purposes, has separated South Australia and the Northern Territory almost as effectually as if they had been thousands of miles apart instead of their borders being contiguous. Not very long ago, when sending goods from Adelaide to reach the stations along the overland telegraph line it was necessary to despatch in one year the goods to be consumed in the next year. That is, they had to be sent a full twelve Many can be months beforehand in order to reach their destinations when they were required. In those circumstances, it can readily be seen that the hope which South Australians generally cherished of being able to develop this country has been frustrated by the fact that a large tract of desert had to be crossed. Some attempts have been made to bridge it. The railway has been constructed northwards from Adelaide 680 odd miles, and a line was run down from Palmerston to Pine Creek with the idea of meeting it, the ultimate intention being to link up the two ends and give communication right through from Adelaide to Palmerston.",62,Northern Territory Acceptance Bill No 2 Second Reading

General, on whose opinion we rely, says that it would not be contrary to the terms of the agreement. of the South Australian Government. South Australia, in taking over the control of the Northern Territory in 1863, did not understand what an obstacle to development lay in the intervening desert country. The existence of this barrier to communication prevented the Territory from being opened up as it should have been. But South Australia kept the country white, holder of any lease should his land be although, had she permitted the employment of coloured labour there, she could have made y^io,ooo.ooo and still have obtained the same terms as she will get if the Commonwealth takes over tlie Territory. She determined, however, to refuse to permit the employment of coloured labour, because that might have created difficulties which would not have been removed for many grant railways. the establishment of Federation, perhaps byreason of the desire on tiie part of some persons to become rich, or from fear that the Commonwealth would not develop the country, the Parliament of the State passed an Act empowering the Government to grant 90,000,000 acres for the construction of a railway. Fortunately, a Labour Premier, Mr Price, came into power shortly afterwards, and nothing was done. terms, it would have belonged to those who were to be given the land, the contemplated ""steal"" being one of the most gigantic ever perpetrated. It has been said that too much of the Territory has been alienated, and about the time when the railway proposal was under consideration, land was alienated on excessively easy terms to inview to facilitating that project. But of a total area of 353,000,000 acres,' only 473,809 acres have been sold, while over 99,000,000 acres are under pastoral leases, ning of from twenty-five to forty-two years. Then about 16,000,000 acres are held under annual permits. It has been objected that a great deal of the more easily developed country has been leased for, at any rate, long periods. But after ten years from the commencement of the leases the Government can, on giving two years' notice, resume possession, and in estimating the compensation to be paid, nothing is to be allowed for public expenditure, the enactment governing this matter readingIn computing the compensation to be paid in any case for loss or depreciation in the value of any pastoral lease, no increase of the value given to such lease by reason of any public works executed after the granting of such lease shall be included or taken into account.

Under the circumstances obtaining during the last ten years, I marvel that people have been found prepared to stay there at all. As to the agreement, . I think honourable members know very well what it is. speaking, it provides that the Commonwealth shall assume all the liabilities of South Australia in regard to the Territory, taking into account the cost of the line projected in order to connect with the Pine Creek line, and ultimately to form a tr*nscontinental line from Oodnadatta to Port Darwin. The total liability of the Commonwealth will be in the neighbourhood of £10,000,000, including, of course, £4,500,000 for the construction of the railway between Pine Creek and Oodnadatta. I must emphasize the fact that of that amount £8,008,000 is represented by actual railways, while the remaining £2.000,000 represents lighthouses, wharfs, and other public works for the purposes of development. penditure included in the £8,000,000? the agreement is concerned, no date is fixed for the construction of the railway, but it means obviously within a reasonable time. tbe Territory from South Australia ? velopment except the lighthouses and member does not need an answer to that wharves and at Palmerston. prospecting votes from time to time, and a considerable amount of exploration and survey work, which will prove of the greatest advantage to the Commonwealth. This work necessarily fell to South Australia, because, when the Territory was taken over by the State, it was not only unpeopled, but wholly unknown; and the acquisition of knowledge regarding the area has cost the State a large sum of money. South Australia hands over her interest in the Territory and receives not one penny in the shape of profit; there is nothing in the agreement proposing that a penny shall be paid more than the actual cost. be reimbursed the £70,000 a year lost on a raihvay within her own territory. not receive a penny more than the actual cost she has been put to in connection with the Territory. The line from Port Augusta to Oodnadatta would be utterly objectless and ridiculous except for the purpose of reaching the Northern Territory ; the. promised land was above the MacDonnell Ranges, in the well-watered country, which was known to be of very Briefly considerable value. The country further south to which the railway has already reached is such that no sane people would construct a railway to it except with some other object. As I was saying, South Australia gives up whatever interest she has in the Territory; and a consideration that weighs very much with many people in the States who oppose the transfer is that the State is also giving up any hope she might have of being one of the greatest States, territorially, in the Commonwealth. With this transfer South Australia will have to be content to number herself among the smaller States. That view may not have been recognised by honourable members, some of whom may regard the local expressions of antagonism as merely bluff; but the fact is that there is a considerable minority-it may be that they are now a majority-in South Australia who, on these grounds, object to the transfer. question.",65,Northern Territory Acceptance Bill No 2 Second Reading

Of course, South Australia is. not entirely giving up her interests in fhe Northern Territory; because, as a State of the Commonwealth, she will not only share in whatever benefits may accrue from the transfer, but also in all the liability in the Territory. As long as the line runs curred in the work of development. From the few remarks I have made, honourable members will readily understand that the short route between Pine Creek and Oodnadatta is regarded by the people of South Australia as representing a truly national line of railway. wholly in the Territory ought to prove a quicker means of development than any other line could; and honourable members need not jump to the conclusion that the route laid down in the agreement is favoured by the people of the State with any desire to drag the trade in their own direction. As I say, the South Australian people honestly believe that they are taking a national view in supporting this short route. disputed that a line wholly in the Territory must develop more of the Territory than any line which takes a short cut out of it. on the character of the soil ? Some parts of the Territory might be so barren that they could not be developed. the only country in the Northern Territory possible of development is in a given direction, then the only justifiable railway would also be in that direction; but I think nobody will have the hardihood to express such a view, though there may be considerable difference of opinion as to where the best land is. It must also be remembered that there is a strong belief that the MacDonnell Range country contains very valuable mineral country, and that there is a good climate, with a good rainfall, and possibilities of development far greater than in any other direction. Any railway line bad thing, would it? which did not come down through the Territory would miss the MacDonnell would. If it would pay private capitalists Ranges altogether, and could hardly, thereto construct a railway in return for the cesfore, be regarded, as one calculated to sion of portion of the Territory, surely it develop the Territory to any extent.

The honourable member for Wilmot knows very well that the day has passed when any State in Australia would agree to a land-grant railway, except as a last resort. In conclusion, let me say that the responsibility of accepting this offer rests upon the Commonwealth Parliament. The terms are such that we may well ratify the agreement, and set about the work of effectively developing this huge area, which can be brought about only by a largely increased population. If we do so, we shall assert our right to hold the Territory, and to keep it white, to the enduring benefit of future generations of Australians. journed. Debate resumed from 21st September (vide page 3538), on motion by Mr Prime Minister, that there was a possibility That this Bill be now read a second time. -As I have already expressed my views on this subject, in discussing a motion recently before the House, I shall not take up much of the time of honourable members this evening. that this Bill should be dealt with and a decision arrived at without delay as to the policy of the Australian Parliament in regard to the sugar industry. land there has been a good deal of unrest and uncertainty as to what the permanent policy of Australia is to be, and before investing further capital in the industry many people are awaiting a definite pronouncement by this Parliament. Deputations have waited on the Premier of Queensland to ascertain whether the Government are prepared to make further advances for the erection of sugar mills, and there are in the State large areas available for sugar production; but they are not likely to be devoted to that purpose until the policy of this Parliament has been clearly laid down. In the Australian Sugar Journal for August reference is made to movements for the erection of new mills in the Johnstone River district, the Gympie district, and Central Queensland, whilst I understand that there is a similar agitation in die Bowen district. This shows that there is a strong desire on ""the part of landowners to engage in the industry. The Premier of Queensland, in reply to the deputation, which asked for further advances for the erection of new mills, saidThe Queensland Government had decided to advance no more money for such purposes while the fiscal conditions surrounding the industry were as at present. When those conditions were changed-and he did not think the present Bill changed themThat was before the amendment of the Bill now before us was introducedand the sugar industry was placed on the same footing as any other, then the Government could consider the matter. Subsequently a deputation waited on the Prime Minister, and an announcement was made that the first Bill was introduced in error, and that the policy for which this measure provides was to be part of a permanent policy for Australia. I would remind the Minister of Trade and Customs, however, that the policy announced by the Government is hardly that which seemed to be indicated by the statement of the of so framing a scheme that all would derive fair advantage from the sugar produced. That statement indicated that he had in contemplation some scheme that was going to adjust all the difficulties in connection with the industry, and which relate more particularly to the price of cane to the grower, the price of raw sugar, the emI t is highly desirable ployment of coloured labour, and labour conditions generally. There is also some unrest arising from the fact that the Government have not yet intimated whether In Queensthey intend to agree to the proposal that a Royal Commission shall be appointed to inquire into the industry.

I assume, however, from the Minister's announcement that we may accept this present legislation as part of the permanent policy of the Government. I desire now to ask the honourable gentleman if it is not possible for him to make the bounty equal to the Excise. That is the only point with which I propose to deal to-night. When provision was made by the first Federal Government for a bounty and Excise, a difference was made between the two on the ground that it.was desired to raise revenue. out at the time that a duty on sugar had been used as a means of raising revenue in several of the States, and that while having due regard to a protective policy, it was necessary under the first Federal Tariff to provide revenue for the States from this source. fixed at £ 3 and the bounty at .£2 per ton, so that £ 1 per ton was secured as revenue. That system resulted in the Commonwealth having to repay to the States in certain proportions under the Braddon section the revenue derived from tlie Excise duties; and having to provide for the bounty of it in a way that applies to no other inout of its own revenue. That, of course, was an injustice to the Commonwealth, but with the altered financial arrangements there is no longer any justification for maktion of making the bounty equal to the ing the sugar industry the only local revenue-producing industry of the Commonwealth, the tobacco industry alone excepted. It is estimated that the Excise for 1910-11 will produce a revenue of £97,425, whilst the cost of administering the Excise Act is estimated to amount to £6,031. the cost of administering the bounty system were exceedingly heavy there might be some justification for retaining an Excise revenue duty. When the cost of administering the whole Act amounts only to £6,031, what justification is there for a tax on sugar for purposes of revenue? Why not apply that principle to other industries? What an outcry there would be if an Excise duty were put upon the 'manufacture of woollen goods, furniture, jam, or any other article, for the white labour should be paid back. That purpose of providing revenue for the Commonwealth ! cause the Free Traders on that side of the House wanted to nullify the protective duty. that time in conjunction with the Free Traders on the other side of the House. There were then many Free Traders amongst the members of the Labour party. We kept the honourable member's party in power for nearly ten years. but the Tariff was an open question, and members on both sides of the House voted freely upon it. honourable member's old party, the present Deputy Leader of the Opposition, who moved to knock the duty out. a Free Trader may have moved to remove the duty, but when this House was first constituted, there were Free Traders on both sides. I think it was the general desire of the House that we should keep party politics out of legislation affecting a big inThe Excise was therefore dustry like this. I have no desire to introduce them now, and it was only the imputation conveyed by the honourable member for Herbert's interjection that called for my reference to the matter. The fact remains that the sugar industry is being taxed, and revenue is being raised out dustry. . There is a justficaton for the Excise of £ 4 upon the black-grown sugar, but I ask the Minister to consider the quesExcise on the white-grown .sugar. I am urging this absolutely from a non-party point of view, because, on these big economic questions, where the interests of the people as a whole are concerned, it is better to keep party politics completely out If of the discussion. white-grown sugar were to be returned there would still be £65,160 obtained from the black-grown sugar, so that the whole £97,000 would not go back. that. I can see no objection to continuing the £ 4 Excise upon the black-grown sugar. All that I ask is that so much of the revenue as is raised from sugar grown by will still leave some revenue, which makes the course still more justifiable. In the year 1905, the honourable member for Wide Bay saidThere is no justification either for the Excise or bounty, except the fact that white men are struggling in an industry which is not carried on by white men in any other part of the world.

That is the position, and 1 ask the Ministei to consider whether it is fair to grant only the presentbounty, and take away the remuneration from the producer of the raw material referred to by the present Prime Minister in that speech. In the year 1902, when the Excise was £ 3 , and the bounty proposed was £ 2 , the honourable member for Wide Bay moved to make the bounty £ 2 ios. In speaking to that motion, he saidIn the very first communication that I had with the Government I staled that in my opinion the whole of the Excise duty should go to the white grower, and I believe that if the electors of Australia were polled, that would be their view. That was the opinion of the Prime Ministei at that time. but it is not now. reason for that change of view. in favour of that view. voted for it at the time tested against it. honourable member voted for it. The honourable member for Wide Bay further said on that occasionI ask the Committee to give f u l l consideration to the matter, and if possible lo allow a rebate of 5s. per ton in the interest of Queensland growers particularly, and in my opinion in the interests of Australia generally. In 1905, the present Minister of Trade and Customs saidI am willing to extend to the growers of white sugar in Queensland a fair amount of protection, I will say that the Minister to his credit has always stood up to protect the industries of Queensland, and, in fact, of Australia, as a whole. of the members representing sugar districts voting for high duties on sugar, and low duties on confectionery. has been consistent, but I am glad to say that consistency has been found on both sides, and that there has been manifested a desire, on the whole, to deal with Australian industries on a fair basis. The Minister further saidand if we are not prevented from doing so by the Constitution, I should be in favour of increasing the Excise duly on black-grown sugar, and abolishing it altogether so far as the whitegrown product is concerned. He therefore did not want at that time to impose any tax on the white-grown product. The only way in which that can be accomplished is to make the bounty equal to the Excise. 184,000 tons this year, and if we had to give back an extra £ 1 per ton we should be about £150,000 to the bad on the transaction. figures the honourable member has presented to the House. I do not think it will work out in that way if the honourable member reckons the amount to be received from the Excise duty as a whole. Be that as it may, there is no getting away from the justice of the position Is it fair to tax and raise revenue out of the white sugar-growers' industry, and treat it differently from any other? The Minister further saidI t has been often staled that we are giving a bonus to the sugar-grower. But that does not fairly represent the case. As a matter of fact, the planters are paying the Excise duty upon their product, and are receiving three-fourths of the amount back in the form of a bounty. If honourable members had to pay their £400 a year into the Treasury and had only ^300 relumed to them, they would not consider they were receiving a bonus. I hope the Minister, in view of those expressions of opinion,, will consider whether he cannot give the relief I suggest to the white growers. He has been in North Queensland, and knows very well that the growers there have loyally tried to carry out the White Australian policy in the face of many difficulties. He knows, also, that they are now in the process of acquiring the freehold for themselves, and he ought, if possible, to give them every encouragement to enable them to do so. ber believe that the growers would get the extra £ 1 per ton? It would go into the pockets of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. member satisfied that the existing bounty reaches them? If it does not, why perpetuate this legislation? I think that if the extra £ 1 a ton is given to them, the white growers will benefit by it. This concession is also being asked for by the Victorian Government.

The question, therefore, concerns, not only Queensland and New South Wales, but will, this year, concern Victoria. I am not asking for consideration for any sectional reason. I base my claim on the justice of the case. Seeing that we have got rid of the Braddon section, that the Excise and bounty system is no longer depleting the Commonwealth revenues, and giving benefits to the States, there is no reason why we should not give some assistance to the sugar industry. If permanent legislation is passed by this Parliament, the sugar industry will, I believe, fulfil all that can be hoped of it. Certainty is needed for its prosperity in Australia. The conditions show that it is an industry absolutely natural to the country, and not artificial. We have the soil, the climatic conditions, and the men capable of making a success of it; and we, ask that this legislation be passed in order that it may be placed on a footing of absolute stability. The success of the sugar industry of Queensland and the settlement of a large population in the north mean a tremendous amount to the people of the southern States. Under Federation, we cannot benefit one part of Australia without benefiting the whole. The progress of one part of the Commonwealth does not mean the progress of one State only, but involves the advancement and well-being of the Commonwealth as a whole. Each industry is not merely a State industry now, but is, in substance and effect, become co-operative concerns, belonging to a national industry. We ask the Minister to see whether he can give this further concession, in addition to the legislation he has put forward. If he does so, I believe he will give great encouragement to the industry, and that, as a result of this legislation as a whole, more capital will be invested and greater prosperity result to the Commonwealth. hope the Minister will carefully consider labours. the advice tendered to him by the honourable member for Darling Downs. quorum. [Quorum formed.] said to-night about the reason for the condent by the prices for the crushing season ditions imposed by the Sugar Bounty Act; of igio, advertised in a circular issued, in but we have to legislate for the present state of the industry; and, therefore, need not consider the reasons for the difference between the Excise and the bounty, 0:1 which past legislation was based. The honourable member for Franklin, in putting in a word for the jam manufacturers and fruit-growers of Tasmania, said that while fruit-growers got only £ 4 a ton for their fruit, £ 2 2 a ton had to be paid for the sugar needed to convert it into jam. But I would remind him that the result would be 2 tons of jam, the value of which would be about £ 5 4 , leaving a margin of £ 2 8 to cover the cost of manufacture. That shows that there are other causes than the high price of sugar for the present stagnation in the jam trade. In 1906, the first year in which white labour conditions began to' influence the production of sugar, the output was 205,576 tons, on which the bounty paid was .£328,210, while in 1910 the output was only 200,689 tons, and the bounty £572,102, a decrease of 4,887 tons, and ' an increase in the bounty of £243,892. We have a right to inquire into the causes of this decrease in production. There are many varied interests to be considered, but, in my opinion, those of the growers are of first consideration. The Queensland Government has spent £394,000 on central sugar-mills, the farmers in the benefited areas having hypothecated their holdings to guarantee the supply of cane, their solvency depending on the success of the industry. The 6,108 cane-growers employ, in addition to their own labour, more than 30,000 hands. With reasonable legislation, these mills will the cane-growers. There are already cooperative mills; and there is no reason why the growers should not own refineries as well But the proposal that farmers should take up the work of refining has been laid, aside for the present, because, apparently, the majority of them are content with the present facilities.

That is to say, when such cane comes to the mill, growers will be immediately advised ; and if they continue to send in such cane the company may either refuse to take delivery or crush it at the request of the grower, and credit his account with nil. Apparently, the meaning of the last paragraph is that some farmers are growing worthless cane, and take advantage of the bounty, which is certainly not the intention of Parliament. The bounty is now payable at different rates for different districts, ranging from 6s. to 7s. 6d. a ton; I have been told that, in my district, the actual value of cane varies from 3s. 6d. to 14s. 6d. a ton; so that the pooling system puts the best land out of use. The honourable member for Capricornia has complained that the farmers have no means of checking tlie analyses; but the services of the Excise officer employed at each mill could be used for this purpose. Last year, we imported 79,000 tons of sugar, produced under cheap labour conditions shores. returned £1,025,668 item that the honourable member for Franklin referred. .to the duty of £6 a ton, the people of Australia had this year paid £.1,297,128 for the sugar industry, which would not have been paid if we had not grown a pound of sugar in all Australia. We have no guarantee that if there was no duty on sugar that amount would be saved to the people. has been contended by Protectionists, and I think with a certain amount of truth, that a policy of Protection should reduce the price of commodities; at any rate, we find that, even under Free Trade conditions, the cost of commodities is sometimes quite as high as under protected conditions. Australia has accepted a Protective policy, Mr Sinclair. I am pleased to say, and I do not see why we should single out the sugar industry as an exception. New Zealand is making an attempt now to supply herself with sugar, and a Bill has been introduced into the ties in the next three years at the rate of i d . per lb. on beet and sorghum sugar, meaning £ 9 6s. 8d. per ton as a straight out bounty, without any Excise conditions. I hope that this question will be discussed by honourable members, and decided without the slightest tinge of partisanship. This is a great Australian industry, the consideratinge of party politics. Under the new arrangements for financing the States, the Government have been placed in a position which will enable them to do justice to the sugar industry. Until the expiration of the operation of the Braddon section, the Government had to return to the States three-fourths of the Excise revenue collected on sugar. This, of course, is no news to honourable members; but I should like to point out that the Commonwealth Government have had to pay the f u l l amount of the bounty since the inception of the system. Now, however, the whole of the Excise goes into the coffers of the Federal Government ; and I claim that the amount collected on white-grown sugar should, as the honourable member for Darling Downs has claimed, go to the growers who have complied with the conditions with regard to white labour. The Minister himself has said, at another time, that to charge £ 4 per ton and give back £-$ is not much of a gift. The Excise and import duties honourable member's suggestion ?

472,Mr Finlayson (Brisbane) [10.13],"employed are also interesting. In 1905 there were 23,162 white labourers and 8,952 coloured labourers .engaged in the industrv; but, in 1909, the number of white labourers had increased to 36,619, whilst the coloured labourers had decreased to 2.325. Any system that will accomplish such a result must commend itself to those who favour the policy of a White Australia. No stronger appeal could be made to honourable members to enthusiastically support the proposal to extend the bounty system instead of allowing it to gradually disappear by means of a sliding scale until it ceases altogether in 1913. There is another aspect which has not yet been touched upon, and that is the tremendous advantage which the elimination of black labour has given to the sugar-growing districts. I have an intimate knowledge of two or three sugar districts, and may tell those who liave not had an opportunity to visit such places as Bundaberg, Childers, and Mackay, that the improvement in regard to business, morals, appearance and general development has been very strongly marked there during the last few years. That in itself should constitute a strong argument in favour of the Government proposal, I can remember a time when Chiiders was a veritable danger place for any one to visit, and when certain parts of Bundaberg and Mackay were absolutely unsafe, particularly for women, and often for men, after nightfall. That state of affairs has changed. Instead of the Kanaka shops which used to supply coloured labourers with inferior goods at sometimes inflated prices, we. now have substantial establishments doing a fair and legitimate business. Whilst coloured labour was generally employed, empty houses were numerous in these towns, and a white man had no difficulty in renting one; but with the advent of white labour, extensive building operations have been carried on, and yet it is difficult very often for a white man to obtain a home for himself. The reason is that the white labourer desires decent housing accommodation. He lives in a house instead of a hut or a tent such as is occupied by the coloured labourer, and he also desires better food and clothing. The consequence is that business generally has improved, and that instead of cheap Kanaka shops we now find substantial reputable business houses doing a good trade on proper lines. The improvement, morally, has also been so marked that one almost hesitates to suggest anything that Mr Finlayson. would in the least degree open the door to the re-introduction of the coloured labourer. gone up. the world. sugar has not increased as the result of our legislation. From personal acquaintance with sugar-growers now employing white labour, I know that they are enthusiastically in favour of the continuation of this system until the industry is placed on a fair fiscal footing equal to that of other enterprises. Sugar Refining Company can sell Australian sugar more cheaply in South Africa than it dees here ? honourable friend is simply putting a frivolous question; but it is a fact that most manufactures and products are dearer in the place of production than they are elsewhere. I hope that whatever difficulties there may be in connection with the sugar industry-and I know that there are many-the appointment of the Royal Commission of which, I believe, we are all in favour, will lead to the whole of the facts being placed before us, so that we shall be able to legislate in such a way as to establish the industry on a proper footing. This is neither a Queensland nor a New South Wales industry. It is a mere accident of circumstance that sugar is grown in those States. The question is not ivhether this legislation affects Queensland, but whether we are prepared to establish what is a truly national industry. I should I'Vp this Bill to be passed-as soon as possible for the reason that until it is law the industry will be hindered and hampered. The Premier of Queensland has repeatedly refused to advance money for the erection of crushing mills in the sugar districts, holdbig that until this legislation has been passed by the Commonwealth Parliament there can lie no guarantee as to the future of the industry. been passed he will have some other exru^e.

At Kidston could very well shelter himself, however, behind the statement that, although ihe assurance given by the Prime Minister and myself was very satisfactory, until the Bill was passed there could be no guarantee as to the actual position. 1 hope that this legislation will be quickly enacted, because it means that large tracts of country in Northern New South Wales and Northern Queensland will be immediatPly devoted to the cultivation ol sugar. The policy of a White Australia has been adopted by the Commonwealth, and there is no suggestion that it should be altered. In 1906 it was emphatically endorsed by Ihe people, and in the early part of this year it received a triumphant re-endorsement at the hands of the electors of the Commonwealth. If there was one plank in our platform upon which we insisted more vigorously than upon any other it was that relating to the maintenance of the White Australia policy. That was the first plank in our platform, and I particularly emphasizpd it during the election campaign. There may not seem to be a real danger of the re-introduction .of coloured labour, but it is not wise to wait until the enemy appears at our doors before we begin to prepare our defence. I am satisfied that unless we establish this industry permanently and solidly on the basis of white labour there will always be a danger of coloured labour in some form or other being introduced. Amongst the measures that the country expects of us, none is more certain of securing the endorsement of fhe people than is this. We claim to have been returned to pass a Land Tax Bill. That is one measure nf which 'we freouently spoke, but I repeat that the first plank in our, platform was the maintenance of the White Australia policy, and the two Bills relating to it now before the House will receive the hearty commendationof the people. Under the law as it now stands the bounty will automatically cease in 1913, and unless the Bill be passed the sugar growers will have no guarantee that it will be paid after that year. If we pass this Bill that time limit will be obliterated, and there will be no danger of the bounty suddenly ceasing at the end of 19,13. ' The bounty to the white grower, makes all the difference between being able to make a living by growing cane and losing money in trie enterprise. 1 f this' Bill be passed it will be possible for the growers' to'obtain [152]2 from the State Government advances for present many people are debarred from entering the industry, because it is useless to grow cane unless there is a reasonable prospect of being able to crush it. As the honourable member for Capricornia has pointed out, the arrangements in some districts are such that a mill will only lake cane grown within a certain area. What is known as the zone system is adopted. If the present time limitation be removed white cane-growers will be able to extend their operations, and I believe that in a very short time we shall see'a revival and an extension and development of the .industry in New South Wales and Queensland that will make us independent of outside supplies. It is most unfortunate that Australia, with its vast areas eminently suitable for sugar culture, should have to import an enormous quantity of sugar. producing enough to overtake the local consumption. The consumption of sugar is increasing very rapidly all over the world. There is a growing desire in Australia, and elsewhere, for sweet goods, and an increasing demand for the use of sugar in some form or other. that it is. ' Our jam industry is not a negligible quantity, and as our fruit production increases we shall have to use more sugar in preserving fruits. Its use for confectionery purposes must also increase. There is no limit to the possibilities of the .sugar industry, if we can give an assurance that it will be protected. Honourable memhprs have, perhaps, overlooked the fact that there is nothing at present to hinder a cane-grower from using any .coloured labour, even the lowest class of Chinese or Kanakas, that can possibly be obtained in Australia; although, if he does so, he. is handicapped. Therefore it .is to our interest, and is in accord with the foundational principle of the White Australia policy, to assist the growth of sugar-cane by white labour and to protect the white growers from the competition of blackgrown sugar. I hope we shall be able in the near future to extend this principle,not only to cover operations in .the field; but also operations ih the mill,, eliminating coloured labour, particularly Asiatic, from",74,Tudor

483,Mr Finlayson,"I do not know the sugar mills of Queensland. That is becoming a very prominent question. I hope I have shown that it would be wise to do away with the time limitation. It will simply mean that the growers will know that they can go on as they are now from the passing of the measure, and I am prepared to say that, perhaps within the next twelve months, we shall be able to so establish the industry and so hedge and protect it by our legislation, having the results of the proposed Royal Commission before us, that we will no longer need Excise and bounty regulations. The mere fact of Tariff protection will, I hope, be sufficient to guard it against the introduction of cheap-grown sugar from other countries, and help our growers, not only to overtake the Australian consumption, but also to get a share in the world's sugar trade. I regard this legislation as much more pressing than some of the matters that have occupied the attention of the House, and I only hope tlie Government will see the need for urgent action in connection with it, so that we may let the growers and workers, as well as the millers and the public, know that this Parliament is prepared to assist to establish any industry that will develop Australia on white labour lines. journed.
