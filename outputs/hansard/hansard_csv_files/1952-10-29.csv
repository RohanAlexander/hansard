Did that gentleman also say that any fear of a recession was only a phase due to false propaganda and a misunderstanding of the good corrective actions taken by this Government to attack an inflationary spiral ? First, is it in order for an honourable member to base a question upon what is undoubtedly a newspaper report? Secondly, has the Prime Minister any control over the matter to which the honourable member has referred? whether the honourable member for Bennelong is quoting from a newspaper report. Neither am I aware whether the Prime Minister has any control over the matter referred to. ber for Hindmarsh is quite correct in suggesting that I have no control over what appears in the newspapers, although in the present connection I am bound to say that I entirely agree with what I have read in the press. tion of the Minister for Health been drawn to reports that cattle of the Santa Gertrudis breed from Texas and other parts of the United States of America are being imported into Queensland for the purpose of testing whether they can be efficiently bred there?. Has his attention also been drawn to a report that cattle of this breed recently imported into Victoria have been found to bo infected with the scourge of warble fly? In view of the tremendous damage that this insect has caused to herds in other parts' of the world, particularly Europe, can the right honourable gentleman assure the House first, whether every step has been taken in Victoria to prevent the spread of the disease, and, secondly, whether similar action has been taken in Queensland? Finally, will he say whether any effective action can be taken to prevent cattle suffering from this scourge from leaving the country in which they have been bred? I have only a few Sir EARLEPAGE I shall examine the matter and give the honourable gentleman a complete answer to his question. planation to a question that I direct to the Prime Minister, I point out that I rise to order. some months ago I asked the right honourable gentleman a question regarding a case, which was before the High Court, that affected the taxation of supplements to. ex-servicemen's pay paid by employers during the war. The Prime Minister advised me in a written reply that the I am not aware of case to which I had referred, Commissioner of Taxation v. Fletcher Clarence Dixon, was set down for hearing by the High Court in September last. Can the right honourable gentleman now inform me whether the court has yet disposed of the case? If it has, what was its finding? If the case has not yet been heard will the Prime Minister use his best endeavours to have the matter finalized, in view of the number of ex-servicemen who desire to have their taxation accounts cleared up? has become of that case, and I do not know whether I should know, but I shall at once find out and inform the honourable member to-morrow morning if he will renew his question then. planation of my question, which is directed to the Treasurer, may I say that it has come to my notice that some wool growers, having deducted 40 per cent, when paying their provisional tax for 1951-52, have now received notices demanding the 40 per cent, that they have deducted, plus 6 per cent, interest for the period that they have withheld the 40 per cent. Are there any circumstances in which a taxpayer, whose income for 1950-51 included 10 per cent, proceeds from wool, is excluded from the 40 per cent, deduction provision, and are there any conditions under which interest can be charged by the Taxation Branch on the 40 per cent, deduction?'",13,Government Economic An D Financial Policy

20,Mr Turnbull,"B y way of extion is that taxpayers whose taxable income for 1950-51 included at least 10 per cent, from wool proceeds, are entitled to a right to deferment of provisional tax up to 40 per cent, without any conditions about the payment of interest. However, where taxpayers claimed the 40 per cent, deduction and did not satisfy the Taxation Branch that at least 10 per cent, of their taxable income was from the proceeds of wool sales, interest was probably charged in addition to the 40 per cent, of the amount of deferment. It is therefore the responsibility of those taxpayers to prove to the satisfaction of the Taxation Branch, where they have not done so previously, that at least 10 per cent, of their income came from wool proceeds. If they do so, no interest will be charged. If interest has been charged, when the conditions that I have mentioned are satisfied the interest will be remitted.

These men have written to me a letter in which they state that eleven Italians are to take their places and are to be employed on mowing lawns and similar work. The men concerned are prepared to perform such work, and they have their homes in that locality. Will the Minister ensure that the principle of preference to ex-servicethe fact that the majority of the Ausmen instead of 'preference to ex-enemy aliens will apply in this case? lems are involved in the matter that the honourable member has raised. The first relates to the transfer of the marine statement' of the professor directs section from Rathmines to Neutral Bay. That transfer will not involve the dismissal of any Royal Australian Air Force personnel. Such personnel, who are employed in the marine section at Rathmines, will be employed on similar work at Neutral Bay.

Those civilian employees were told, when they were originally employed by the AiiForce, that their positions were temporary only, and that when sufficient permanent personnel were available to take their places they would lose their jobs. ex-servicemen. MrM o MAHON of them are ex-servicemen. We are anxious to ensure that they obtain some kind of alternative employment, and shall do our best to see that they find such employment.

It is quite untrue that I gave that deputation an assurance of any kind. Following my normal practice, I heard what these gentleman had to say. They were quite representative people, and they had a case to put. I told them that that case would be considered, first of all by my colleague, commence on the 1st January. One the Minister for Territories, and then by Cabinet if he thought fit to bring it to Cabinet. That is the state of affairs. assumed and no promises made, except the very proper promise of full consideration of the views that they put. Minister consider it proper that representations should be made to this Government upon a matter that is being considered by the Legislative Council for the Northern Territory? Does he not believe that it would be proper to make such representations direct to the Legislative Council? Was the deputation of wealthy pastoralists that waited upon him arranged so that members of the Legislative Council appointed by the Government could be instructed to vote for the amendments of the law proposed by wealthy pastoral companies? speech delivered by the honourable member, I say that I have no knowledge whether the pastoralists are wealthy or not. I know that it is in accordance with the cant phraseology with which the honourable member has grown up to describe all pastoralists as wealthy, except when they vote for the Labour party. I want to state quite frankly that, subject to the limitations of time-ther e being only 24 hours in a dayI have never thought it proper to refuse to hear representations upon important matters from Australians, whether they be pastoralists or otherwise, or whether they be rich or poor. I propose to continue to observe that rule in the future, so far as for the Minister for External AffairsI can do so. ing for the Minister for External Affairs whether Australia is one of the nations represented on the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations? deal of pleasure to be able to inform the honourable member, and the House, that at the current session of the General Assembly of the United Nations Australia was elected to the Economic and Social Council for a term of three years to aspect of this matter which gives entire satisfaction, is that of the 60 members of the United Nations, 52 gave their first No obligations have been ballot votes to Australia.

JAMES HARRISON -Does the Prime Minister know of the view expressed recently by a former Chief Justice of the H i g h Court that it would be wise to invest the Commonwealth Parliament with power to make laws with respect to the terms and conditions of industrial employment, and then to establish a tribunal empowered to collect factual information and, acting thereupon, to deal with national matters on a national basis, instead of retaining the 50-year-old and out-moded conditions under which the only way we can get a decision upon anything related to the national economy is to await the creation of a dispute? If the right honourable gentleman is aware of that view, wil l he examine closely the principles that were outlined by the former Chief Justice, with a view to considering whether this would be an appropriate time to re-submit to the people at a referendum the principles that were embodied by the Chifley Government in the referendum of 1946, which were in line with the view expressed by the former Chief Justice? hardly a suitable occasion to debate constitutional amendments.

Airways Proprietary Limited. structure of that company is completely different fro m that of Trans-Australia Airlines. It is a proprietary company, incorporated in Victoria. holding of that company will be sufficiently indicated by referring to five corporations. They are Huddart Parker Limited, Union Steam Ship Company of New Zealand Limited, Holyman Brothers Proprietary Limited, Adelaide Steamship Company Limited, and the Orient Steam Navigation Company Limited. tions owns approximately shares, valued at 5s. each. company has a smaller shareholding. Having regard to the interlocking of those interests, which is well known, and which form what is known as the shipping combine, the effective ownership of Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited is vested in a trust or combination of overseas and interstate shipping interests. and the accounts of Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited are not open to public inspection. That, of course, is the right of the company, but honourable members should remember that that company is now asking the Parliament for an enormous grant of money for its own benefit. That alters the whole position, as the House will shortly realize. The company is entitled to take advantage of the law, as is any citizen, but I contrast that company with the organization of Trans-Australia Airlines, whose report and balance-sheet has been placed before the House to-day. It is impossible for this Parliament properly to approve tli is agreement without f u l l investigation -and there has been no investigation and none is intended-of the causes of the losses said to have been sustained by Australian. National Airways Proprietary Limitedi n recent years. matters that should be investigated. Another matter for investigation is whether, if the losses did occur, why they occurred. The sale of oil is the best example of the activities of overseas interests. The profits of That is Australian National oil companies operating in Australia The may be considerably reduced because losses which are not legitimate may be charged against them. There may be a very low overall profit shown in one The shareaccount, but a corresponding gain in some other account. Honourable members should remember that Trans-Australia Airlines is owned by the people, and Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited is owned by the shipping combine. this shipping combine ? 1,119,000 knows them and I have already named Another them. Since the Vend case in Newcastle, the honourable member has been aware of this shipping combine. I am not dealing with its legality, but with its effect. Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited has asked the Government for enormous financial assistance and is asking this Parliament to reduce the public business of Trans-Australia Airlines in The balance-sheet order to benefit the rival company. TheC i v i l Aviation Agreement B ill is designed to secure parliamentary approval of this agreement. The agreement has been reached by the Commonwealth and Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited. Trans-Australia Airlines is not a party to the agreement, because under clause 5 of the b ill The Australian National Airlines Commission constituted under the Australian National Airlines Act 1945-47 shall do all such things as the agreement referred to in section three of this Act provides that the Commission will do. That means that Trans-Australia Airlines has refused to become a party to this agreement, and the Government is now asking the Parliament to order that organization to carry out an agreement to which it is not a party. That is the essence of that part of this -bill. The bill will force Trans-Australia Airlines to act contrary to its own charter under the 1945 act, which defines its duties. D i d they really occur?

The agreement will compel the Australian National Airlines Commission to act in breach of its trust to the people as defined in the 1945 act, and under the new agreement it will play a part relatively subordinate to that of Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited. This agreement is deliberately designed to stifle the enterprise and initiative that Airways Proprietary Limited that will has made Trans-Australia Airlines such an outstanding National Airways Proprietary Limited cannot stand competition and has now asked the Government for protection.

The agreement was signed by the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies), and by Mr States ask for £4,000,000 for the purpose Holyman and Mr Declerek for Australian National Airways Limited. In the view of the Opposition, the agreement is completely unjustified. But there is one thing in it that puts responsibility for it fairly on the shoulders the of all honourable members in this House. That is, that the agreement shall be subject to the approval of the Parliament. The question is, dare the Parliament approve it after honourable members have fairly analysed it? The features of the agreement are startling and unprecedented, and out of all understanding from a fair business point of view. Clause3 of the agreement contemplates a loan of £3,000,000 to Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited by the Commonwealth Bank for the purchase of six heavy aircraft. Bank is the guarantor, and therefore this Parliament is bound to ascertain the precise purpose of the loan and inquire into the financial position of the company. Clause3 contemplates a loan of £3,000,000 by the Commonwealth Bank to Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited for the purchase of not more than six heavy aircraft; but if , in the future, Trans-Australia Airlines Dr. Evatt. should be authorized to purchase heavy aircraft, the Commonwealth undertakes to facilitate additional borrowing by Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited for the purchase of an equal The Government might either guarantee or lend the money to Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited. This is an odd and unprecedented transaction, but it is only part of a pattern to use Trans-Australia Airlines for the purpose of building up its rival. The total amount of loans to Australian National be permitted to be outstanding is not to exceed £4,000,000 at any time-w e can success.

The essence of this agreement, which is to be for a period of fifteen years, is that the Government will guarantee to Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited, in respect of airmails, substantial equality. The Government itself now carries its own airmails. The next point is that the holder of a government warrant shall have a free option as to the service that he will use.

If Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited desires to act in such directions it may not do so on its own initiative, but if there is a disagreement the matter in dispute will be referred to a chairman, who will be appointed by the Minister, and he will decide the issues. This proposed rationalization scheme is the very antithesis of active and competitive ai r services. On the contrary, it could prevent the development and extension of air routes in remote areas in which respect Trans-Australia Airlines has, up to date, done a very good job. This provision, clearly, is designed to establish and retain a new vested interest of a very valuable financial character for Australian National Airways Proprietary LimitedIndeed, the clause goes further and provides that Australian National AirwaysProprietary Limited may challenge any existing service on the ground that it is unnecessary, and thus bring such a service under review.

The Government is most punctilious about that provision, because the agreement provides that should an odd number of aircraft be made available, say eleven, the chairman of the rationalization committee shall decide to which organization the odd aircraft shall be made available.

I understand, too, that the new route charges will not be adequate. If the charges A leading Melbourne newspaper declared Airlines had yesterday that the deficit caused by the reduction would be charged against good old Consolidated Revenue, which means the ordinary taxpayer. That represents another huge, concealed subsidy to the private company. The transactions of Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited should be carefully scrutinized in order to determine whether the provibeen converted into a subsions of the draft agreement are just or profit. Australian National necessary, apart from other objections Limited has been that may be taken to them. Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited should not be exempt from having the that the Minister was not whole story of its business brought before to fix such charges. But a proper body for public inquiry.

It is imNational Airportant that the accounts of Australian Limited has carefully National Airways Proprietary Limited, Evatt. which show an aggregate loss of £427.000 sustained during the 30 months to December, 1951, notwithstanding its failure to pay air-route charges, should also be examined. On the surface, that loss seems to have disappeared in the year 1950-51. I have discussed the clauses of the bill in substance. ""What will be their aggregate effect? It is apparent that the Government's assertion that the draft agreement is aimed at the establishment of ""conditions of active competition"", to use the words of the Minister, is completely untrue. In fact, for all practical purposes, the agreement will put an end to real competition between Trans-Australia Airlines and Australian NationalA i r ways Proprietary Limited. Under the terms of its charter, Trans-Australia A i r Pioneer companies, such as AnsettA i r lines exists solely to promote an efficient and safe air service, not to make private profit. But Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited, according to its charter, is compelled to do its utmost to increase its profits for the benefit of its shareholders, the overseas and Australian shipping combines which control it. Politica l f a i r play and social justice are that the taxpayers will stand for it. H o n the only principles involved in this matter. There is no question of the relative merits of the personnel, either operational or managerial, of the two organizations. both organizations. Certainly, the Hying staffs of both Trans-Australia. Airlines and Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited are of the highest standard. I say so. without any qualification. The real issues at stake affect management on the highest level, and the policies of Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited and the Liberal Country party coalition which is responsible for this legislation. I say unhesitatingly that it is false to contend that the agreement, which will deprive Trans-Australia Airlines of an important pur; of its business and goodwill for fifteen years and transfer it to a rival organization, aims at securing active competition between the two organizations. The plan for crystal clear. Every aspect of the operations of Trans-Australia Airlines that can produce revenue will be affected by the agreement. Trans-Australia Airlines will not be allowed to retain any advantage such as a competitor normally tries to acquire over a business rival. It will not be permitted to develop new air routes if Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited objects, unless the chairman of the proposed committee gives it permission to do so. Time-tables may be foreshortened at the wil l of Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited, if it has the support of the chairman. The assessment of fares and freight charges-the life blood of such organizations-wil l be governed, not by the spirit of competition and rivalry, but by a procedure deliberately designed to prevent competition, under which the available market will be divided arbitrarily. ways Proprietary Limited and ButlerA i r Transport Proprietary Limited, will gain nothing under the terms of this bill. It is a measure to enrich Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited at the expense of Trans-Australia Airlines, other civil airline operators, and the taxpayers of Australia, and I do not think orable members surely can see that the bill provides that strict control shall be applied to routes, fares, and freight charges and to the acquisition of operatI assume efficiency in ing equipment. The provisions of the agreement are typical of the internal arrangements made by a commercial trust or combine to divide the available market for its goods or services. It reproduces the features of the typical international cartel, such as the oil cartel which we discussed recently when the House considered a bill to deal with Commonwealth O i l Refineries Limited. The principle of the agreement is not that of active commercial competition but that of the private cartel, the private trust, the private monopoly. The agreement is heavily weighted in favour of one profit-making element in the air services of Australia. -I stress the fact that Trans-Australia rationalization makes my point Airlines is not a profit-making organization. It has no object except to conduct an efficient, safe, and economic service for the benefit of the people. It has made large profits, not because it has sought profits, but because it has done its job well under its statutory charter. It can have no lawful object except to conduct an efficient service on the great trunk routes. Yet it is to be compelled, against its will, to carry out an agreement to which it is not directly a party and to join the proposed new combine. Why should one-half of the Government's air freight and airmail business be taken from Trans-Australia Airlines and handed to Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited? The whole principle of the postal system is challenged by such an arrangement. Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited, no doubt because of its close connection with shipping and other freight business, flew 14,000,000 freight tonmiles in 1951-52, which was almost twice as much as was flown by Trans-Australia Airlines, which flew 7,500,000 freight ton-miles. But what of passenger traffic? During the same year, Trans-Australia Airlines flew 320,000,000 passenger-miles, compared with 277,000,000 passengermiles flown by Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited. What justice is there in a provision that will compel the Government to surrender a vital part of its airmail and freight business to a private competitor while that competitor retains its ordinary freight business, whatever the source of that business may be? for the division of the freight business of Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited with Trans-Australia Airlines? ber's question anticipates my criticism. The figures that I have stated demonstrate that, notwithstanding a deliberately organized business boycott against Trans-Australia Airlines at the inspiration of Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited-a n elaborate boycott, dreadful in its intensity, of which everybody in the eastern cities of Australia knowsthe operation of Trans-Australia Airlines has been so efficient that, in 1951-52,. it assumed the lead in its race with Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited by no less than 43,000,000 passenger-miles. If a government is running a public utility in the public interest tralia Airlines has not been sold, everyin competition with a private company, there is no reason why that government should not employ its own utility for the purpose of transacting its lawful governmental affairs. What the agreement does is to force into the hands of a private company a half of the government business that should flow naturally and normally to a government utility, subject always to its efficient performance of the function of transport. When Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited makes these preposterous demands, it would be just as logical for Trans-Australia Airlines to demand that the shipping combines which control Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited should place a half of their air transport operations in the hands of Trans-Australia Airlines. That demand would be absurd. So is the demand of Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited, yet this Government has yielded to it, without thinking of the consequences. I want to know why it has done so. I go further, and say that what is being done by this agreement is unfair and unjust to Trans-Australia Airlines, to other private airline operators and to the taxpayers. The scheme of the Government is being unfolded. Instead of an open attack of the Commonwealth Oil Refineries Limited variety, where the Commonwealth's interest was completely sold out, we have a less direct and more stealthy approach. But the true aim is just the same, and is just as predatory. It is being carried into effect by a thoroughly vicious ' agreement. Everything that Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited could possibly have dreamed of gaining and more, appears to have been conceded. It was stated some time ago that the Minister for Civil Aviation( Mr Anthony) and a few other Ministers and backbenchers of the Government parties had successfully resisted all attempts to get rid of the Commonwealth's interest in Commonwealth Oil Refineries Limited or to sell Trans-Australia Airlines. But, during the Minister's absence abroad, Commonwealth Oil Refineries Limited has gone. Whilst the Commonwealth's interest in Trans-Austhing possible is being done to see that Trans-Australia Airlines will get as bad a deal and Australian National Airways",27,Second Reading

119,Dr. Evatt,"The honourable memProprietary Limited as preferred a deal as this Government can give. If the Minister for C i v i l Aviation were here, I believe that we should see a far stronger resistance to the forces in the Liberal party that stand for private monopolies, private trusts and private combines against public utilities. We know from the last speech of the late Mr Hughes on Commonwealth O i l Refineries Limited what he would have said about this agreement. I could not do better than to repeat his language. A very serious responsibility arises when proposals of this nature are placed before a responsible parliament-and it is not accidental that they are being discussed this afternoon. Honourable members who know of the widespread popularity and proved success of a great enterprise like Trans-Australia Airlines cannot support the agreement. It is quite wrong to suggest, as the Minister for Territories ( Mr Hasluck) has clone, that the success of Trans-Australia Airlines has been due entirely success has been due to a number of factors. Doubtless, the airmail contracts were a very important help initially, but they did not guarantee the support of the travelling public. The progress of Trans-Australia Airlines has been due to public confidence in the technical efficiency and the safety of the services it has provided. That is proved beyond doubt by the enormous increase of passenger mileage from non-governmental sources. Despite the business boycott organized by Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited, Trans-Australia Airlines leads the field in fair and open competition. Trans-Australia Airlines was most fortunate to acquire, under the nomination cf the honourable member for Maribyrnong ( Mr Drakeford) , when he was Minister for C i v i l Aviation, the services of MrA . W . because the Government owns them, Coles as its first and leading administrator. business genius. He devoted himself unsparingly to the task of trying to make a success of the new venture, and he succeeded. Trans-Australia Airlines showed superlative enterprise and initiative when it ordered Convair aircraft even before the first, flight of the new production unit. shocked its rival because the initiative was shown by a public utility. Sheer jealousy of that bold and statesmanlike step has poisoned the approach of Australian National Airways ProprietaryLimited to this matter. It was madeobvious in this House that the previous^ Minister for C i v i l Aviation, who is now the Australian H i g h Commissioner in London, and other members of the Government parties could never forget their political and jiersonal hostility to Mr. Coles because he supported the Curtin Government during the war-time. On one occasion, the present Treasurer ( Sir Arthur Fadden) said in a public speech, having previously referred to Mr Wilson, that Mr Coles would have to go. Mr. Coles did go in the end. He resigned. The people of this country do notbelieve in government utilities as an end in themselves or as mere political shibboleths. The platform of the Australian Labour party makes it clear that governmental intervention is sought by the to airmail contracts. Us Labour movement only in so far as it is intended to prevent exploitation or oppression of the people, or social in justices. That principle has won recognition in all British countries. The real question is how it should be applied. I say that the Menzies-Fadden coalition has a fetish against all utilities owned by the people, whether their operation be good, bad or indifferent. The pattern of its prejudice is clear. The Government ruined the shale oil industry at Glen Davis. It was responsible for the sell-out of the Commonwealth's interest in A m a lgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited. It proposes to sell the assets of the Commonwealth Handling Equipment Pool,, in which ex-servicemen in Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne have played such a prominent part. It proposes to do sodespite the fact that they are profitable Mr Coles is no less than a and efficient. The Government is trying to sell. machinery that belongs to the Joint Coal Board, which is a joint enterprise of the Commonwealth and New South Wales. That machinery, bought by Mr Chifley from the United States of America, has been directly responsible for the enormous increase of the producThat enterprise and initiative tion of coal from open-cut workings, but the 'Government will sell it as soon as it can do so. The people's interest in Commonwealth Oil Refineries Limited has gone. Trans-A ustralia Airlines is under an immediate threat, as is the Commonwealth shipping line, which the Minister for Shipping and Transport (Senator McLeay) is hawking round the world In the long run, Japan would not be excluded from the list of purchasers of that shipping line, because if it were sold to private interests, doubtless the Japanese would get some of the ships, in the same way as they got some of the ships that were sold by the Commonwealth in the 1920's. The uranium deposits in this country, which the Chifley Government nationalized for defence purposes, subject to just compensation, will never be safe -under the Menzies-Fadden coalition and its doctrine of laisser-faire, which means, in practice, private monopolies or trusts for private profit, regardless of whether the public suffers injustice, exploitation or oppression. So it takes the side of Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited and the shipping combines against the airline owned by the people. Much has been said by the Government about the worth of Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited in the aviation field, and I do not dispute it. The honourable member for Maribyrnong, however, knows how much public money was poured into aviation in this country. Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited derived great benefit from it. When I think of air services, I think of some names that were not mentioned by the Minister. I think of the true and. greatest pioneers-men Smith, Tjim, Hinkler, Keith and Ross Smith, and P. G. Taylor. They pioneered the airways of this country, but they received no financial reward. After a few years, some of them were on the beach. Over and over again, Government spokesmen have claimed that the Government is seeking only to promote active competition. primary agreement are not only to deprive Trans-Australia Airlines of a vital portion of its business, but also to limit real competition for fifteen years by preventing Trans-Australia Airlines from holding the Dr. Evatt. business lead which it gained fairly and honestly after years of efficient competitive services, despite the private boycott by Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited and carping criticism from Liberal party and Australian Country party politicians. Something was said by the Minister about a proposal for a single statutory corporation to amalgamate Trans-Australia Airlines with Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited. The Government has said that it rejected that proposal because it is opposed to monopolies. I deny that. The Government will accept or support trusts, combines or monopolies as long as they are conducted for private profit. What the Government is really opposed to is a public utility, whether it be a monopoly or not. It opposes such a utility because it is conducted in the public interest, and solely for the benefit of the public. But if private profit is the purpose, Government members bow down to any monopoly, trust or cartel, and appear almost ready to worship it. I have frequently advocated the principle of partnership between government and private investment in particular projects. Organizations that I have used to illustrate my arguments are Commonwealth Oil Refineries Limited and Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited. They were established, maintained and supported by outstanding Australian leaders of all political parties, including Hughes, Bruce, Scullin, Lyons, Curtin, Chifley and, until recently, Menzies and Fadden. One lesson that we have learned from the Government's actions in connection with like Kingsford Commonwealth Oil Refineries Limited and Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited is that, if similar projects are started again, a minimum safeguard must be the prohibition of the sale of the people's assets or interests in such concerns without their consent, expressed either at a general election or at a special referendum. There must be certainty in But the these great matters, to preclude instability objects of this pernicious caused not only by sell-outs like those in connection with Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited and Commonwealth Oil Refineries Limited, but also by the deliberate weakening or injuring of government investment at the mere will of the parliament of the day as illustrated in this case. It is ironic for any parliament, and especially for this Parliament, which has completely lost the confidence of the people, to try to bind future parliaments for such a period as fifteen years. When this proposal is understood by the people, they will condemn those responsible for it. I ask the Parliament to make the most searching inquiry into the facts that I have presented and the point of view that I have expressed. If that is not done, and if the Government continues to drive on at the dictates of private commatter all the conditions that make for mercial interests, to the prejudice of the public, a future parliament will be forced to right this wrong that is to be inflicted upon the people of Australia. I say, in conclusion, Labour party has carefully considered what should be done in connection with this proposal. I have called it a pernicious proposal, but that is an understatement. The Government has no mandate or support from the people of Australia to do this, as it well knows. That is why it has not sold Trans-Australia Airlines. In principle, the matter was decided by the verdict of the people of Flinders on the sale of the Commonwealth's interest in Commonwealth O i l Refineries Limited. I say, on behalf of the Labour party, that we shall take every available step to oppose the bill. If, notwithstanding that, the bill be passed, a future Labour government will frankly tell the people that the new parliament will not be bound by its predecessor. We shall take every lawful step to set aside this agreement. As a party, we shall undertake to restore the status and activities of Trans-Australia Airlines tc the position that they occupied before this measure was introduced. more evidence were required to show how demoralizing the ownership of public utilities by a government can be, it was supplied by the speech of the Leader of the Opposition (Dr. E v a t t ) . The right honourable gentleman has shown clearly that when this kind of problem is discussed in the House, it can demoralize the whole of the thinking of honourable members. Normally, the Leader of the Opposition states his case reasonably and fairly , but in this instance he was entirely unfair. This matter is really only a part of the political philosophy of honourable gentlemen opposite which is wrecking the whole of our economy. We must be careful that by retaining government ownership and control of public utilities we are not simply demoralizing the people as well as the Parliament. The agreement with which the measure deals can be taken as symbolic of the belief of honourable members on this side of the House that in connection with this private enterprise, initiative and integrity in public life should have f u l l play. It would be worthwhile for me, before I deal with the various issues that the that the parliamentary right honourable gentleman has raised, to refer to the purpose of the agreement. It is one of a series of measures. True, it is a compromise between those who would have preferred the field of civil aviation to be occupied entirely by free enterprise and those who are prepared to accept a measure of government competition with private enterprise in it. I consider that it is reasonable to doubt whether the objective of a f a i r field and no favour which is the aim of the agreement w ill be realized, and I am not sure whether it will be possible for the lion of public ownership to lie down with the lamb of private enterprise and be indifferent to what the lamb is doing. All the care that has gone into the drafting of the agreement, and all the ingenuity that has been used to ensure that the agreement will be sacrosanct for a period of fifteen years may be, as the right honourable gentleman has said, jeopardized by its being brought into the political arena as, he said, it would be at the next general election. We have tried to assure, by means of the agreement, that it w ill be possible for Trans-Australia Airlines to be kept in the strict path of open competition with private enterprise and not be in a position to monopolize the whole of the field. The remarks of the Leader of the Opposition about the favouritism shown to Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited are entirely false. The position should be approached fro m exactly the opposite direction. What",30,Second Reading
120,Mr Bland (Warringah) [4.13],"I fairlines were operating before Trans-Australia Airlines was formed, and where did Trans-Australia Airlines suddenly obtain the business that enabled it to achieve the results that it has shown ? Limited. Was not all that business taken from Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited and the other airlines that were in operation when Trans-Australia A i rflines was formed? Surely it is true that Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited was carrying mail, public freight and members of parliament up to the time that Trans-Australia Airlines was brought into the field and it was decided that it was to be given a monopoly of the carriage of mails, public officials and public freight. Then, instead of there being the desirable competition which it is the purpose of this agreement to make possible, we had in existence the very kind of monopoly of which the right honourable gentleman has complained. Trans-Australia Airlines was developing into a complete monopoly. If it had had to go out and look for business, as Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited and Ansett Airways Proprietary Limited have had to do, there would be an entirely different story to be told now about Trans-Australia Airlines. I wish to make it clear that, instead of undermining Trans-Australia Airlines, as the right honourable gentleman has said, the agreement will restore something like justice and equity, and will ensure that Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited shall have restored to it the right to carry some of the passengers, mails and freights that Trans-Australia Airlines now monopolizes. Only by doing so can we prevent a continuation of the kind of monopoly that the right honourable gentleman has mentioned It is well to consider the history of Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited. The firm of Holyman and Sons started steamship operations in Tasmania in 1870, and carried on a considerable business with the mainland. As time went on it became associated with Huddart Parker Limited, the Union Steam Ship Company of New Zealand Limited, and the Adelaide Steamship Company Limited. Later, when Holyman and Sons decided to go into the airline Mr Bland. business the shipping companies that had been associated with it before became shareholders in the new venture, Australian National Airways Proprietary Honourable members should remember that when Ivan Holyman set out to develop this undertaking he did not do so merely because he wanted to develop an airline organization. Honourable members who recall the tragic history of the Holyman family will know that Ivan Holyman set out to devote his future years to the development of a model airline, in memory of his elder brother, who was lost in the tragic Loina disaster in 1935. Ivan Holyman established this great enterprise and extended its operations over the whole Commonwealth. It is unfair of the Leader of the Opposition to sneer at the fact that the shipping companies to which I have referred are partners in it with Holyman. It is perfectly clear that an enterprise of this nature cannot be financed by the means used by ordinary industrial companies. It is necessary to deal in millions of pounds in order to ensure that the enterprise will be up to date and capable of meeting contingencies. It is, therefore, necessary to have access to infinitely greater funds that are drawn from sources entirely different from those used So finance ordinary activities. It was to be expected that the Orient Steam Navigation Company Limited would also be interested in associating an airline business with its shipping business. One of the unfair statements that the right honourable gentleman has made to-day was his insinuation that there is something sinister in this connection. There is a malignity in all this talk about whether private enterprise should make, profits. It misses the whole aim, because it is perfectly clear that unless there are profits to be made there will be no standard of living for people to enjoy there will be nothing but losses to be made up by the taxpayers until they are bled white, and there will be no progress or development in the community. Unless there is private profit the development of the community will be retarded. In his opening remarks the Leader of the Opposition directed attention to the provision governing the period for which the agreement was to operate. That provision is a cardinal feature of the agreement. assurance that the company will be able to plan its business over such a period the company might well consider that it would be of no use its going on with the business business. Rationalization is not being at all. The right honourable gentleman's iittack on the length of the period proposed in the bill indicates the degree to which party politics can play a part in destroying our economy. The fact that we intend to give to the pioneer airline of Australia an opportunity to re-establish itself, and enable it to obtain its share of whatever business happens to be offering does not justif y sneers. That is one of the ways in which we shall be able to ensure that Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited will be able to continue in existence and recover from the pressure that was exerted upon it by the previous Government in an effort to destroy it. It is not a proposal to give that company more than an equitable share of the available business. I should have liked the bill to include a provision under which the Postmaster General's Department would call for tenders for the carriage of mails, as was formerly normally done in the case of the carriage of interstate mails by sea. In the old days tenders for the carriage of mail by sea were under constant review. I should imagine that the same principle could have been applied in this instance and I believe that each of the airline comAirlines being independent, it panies should tender for the contract to carry mails. The Leader of the Opposition claimed that Trans-Australia Airlines, as a result of its own enterprise, initiative and in instrument by the political party in office tegrity, had been able to develop a very large business. It was able to do so, in truth, only because it had no competition. Had it had competition from Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited there would now be a different story to tell. I hope that a new story will be told when Trans-Australia Airlines is carrying out its operations in open competition with other airlines. The right honourable gentleman also condemned the proposed rationalization of the airline services. possible course for us to pursue in connection with this matter. Competition can exist to such a degree as to destroy all Unless there be an the several airlines, and rationalization is a means of ensuring that the airlines will each operate to the best advantage. It is a perfectly normal procedure in forced upon Trans-Australia Airlines, as the right honourable gentleman has claimed. It is to be achieved, in the first place, by agreement between the two parties. If the representatives of Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited and. Trans-Australia Airlines cannot agree then, and only then, will the chairman give his decision on the matter at issue. In the event of agreement between the representatives of the two parties there would be no necessity to call on the chairman for a decision. The Leader of the Opposition also mentioned the integrity of government. Integrity is precisely what we are trying to achieve by this measure. We wish to show that the association of government with business is always disastrous. The right honourable gentleman talked in terms of Trans-Australia Airlines being a statutory corporation which was a trustee for the people. How can it be a trustee for the people if it is to be compelled to do whatever the government of the day declares it must do? He said that his Government acted as if it were itself the people, and should therefore decide what Trans-Australia Airlines was to do. In other words, instead of Trans-Australia was being run as a government agency. There is no escape from the consequences of that. Once an undertaking is run as a government agency, it is used as an at the time to carry out its social policy. The idea of a trusteeship fades into the background, and all that happens is that the government decides to use the agency -in the words of the Leader of the Opposition"" in the interests of the people "", to do whatever it chooses. That is the line upon which much of the corruption that we have known in this community lies. Every honourable member knows that as the result of the establishment of almost every government-owned utility, there Rationalization is the only has been opened up the widest field for official and political corruption statement. exceptions the Opposition makes; the rule is clear. There may be exceptions to the rule, but it is perfectly clear that whenever there is an opportunity to make a gain at the expense of the public, the government-owned utilities are the means by which that gain is taken. Royal commission after royal commission had been appointed to clear up charges of corruption or charges of mismanagement. I return to the matter of the Government's integrity. During this sessional period, much time has been occupied with debates, urgency motions and questions about public utilities, such as government ownership of Commonwealth O i l Refineries Limited, or the Glen Davis undertaking. The capacity of a government to do the things which should be done will be destroyed if so much of the time of Ministers is occupied day after day with Cabinet meetings in order to decide policy in relation to banks, airlines, Glen Davis or Commonwealth O i l Refineries Limited. If so much of the time of the Parliament is occupied with those subjects, the things that really matter are neglected, because we do not get an opportunity to deal with them. That is the reason why we believe that there should be less government in business, and more business in government. which business intrudes into the work of government, and the constancy with which it intrudes, make us fear that the integrity of our whole political system is at stake. It is definitely at stake when we recollect the threat made by the Leader of the Opposition in this debate. The agreement set out in the C i v i l Aviathat it will provide a service for tion Agreement B ill 1952 will be ratified by the Parliament. On the basis of that agreement, Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited and Trans-Australia Airlines will do certain things. Yet the Leader of the Opposition has told us that this agreement, although it has been signed by the Government and w ill be ratified by the Parliament, will be reconsidered and jettisoned by the next Labour government. Do not honourable members see how such a policy leads to corruption ? Do they not realize thai is a frightful the taxpayers will be mulcted in order to pay for the cost of breaking the contract ? I do not care what I desire to refer for a few moments to the nonsense spoken by the Leader of the Opposition in recent weeks. He has frequently referred to the "" people's assets "", and insisted that there is something sacrosanct about Commonwealth O i l Refineries Limited, Trans-Australia A i r lines, or what-you-will. This is characteristic of the way in which Opposition members are tyrannized by abstract nouns. I shall examine these abstractions. Who are the people in this case? How did they acquire the assets? I ask any honourable member opposite, who has any grey matter at all in his head, whether he, as a member of the Parliament or as a private individual, has any more control over the assets of the Commonwealth Bank or Trans-Australia A i r lines than he has over the assets of the Bank of New South Wales or Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited? Who exercises the control over those assets? Where does the trusteeship lie? The Leader of the Opposition would be wise not to speak of parliamentary sovereignty, or trusteeship of the people's assets, because members of the parliamentary Labour party take directions from an outside body, which decides what is to be done with the people's assets. I point out that public utilities, far from being assets, are mostly liabilities. The way in It is futile to attempt to conceal the facts by saying that some public assets have made money. The truth is that the great majority of them have incurred losses. If honourable members will examine the causation of events, they will see that a government has set up an imdertaking in the belief the community. As a matter of course, it does not provide a service effectively or efficiently, and begins to incur losses. The taxpayer has to make up the losses, and his standard of living is thereby reduced. The stage, is reached at which the whole community is being debilitated by th° retention of so-called assets, which are, in fact, liabilities. Ultimately, there may be no way in which the losses can be made good. So, we are reminded of the Greek, or Christian, truism, that we must live",33,Second Reading

He is of hard, cold politics, even if the honornot interested in the business side. He able and learned member does not conhas made a political decision. The whole sider it to be so. I regard this decision of his speech was based, not on economics, as one of the most treacherous and coldbut on politics. He spoke in terms of blooded acts ever perpetrated in this having something merely for the sake of Parliament. The Opposition can refute having it. This is an occasion when we in a few seconds any claim that the should face the position realistically, and Government proposes to return to Ausdeclare that the Government should not tralian National Airways Proprietary operate utilities merely for the sake of Limited something that has been unjustly operating them. I remind honourable members that the measure on which we are engaged to-day is an act of retributive justice. The present Government is handing back to Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited what was unjustly taken from that organization by a Labour government in 1944, when Trans-Australia Airlines was established. The Labour Government at that time made a deliberate attempt, not merely to create a government monopoly, but to get rid of Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited, which had done all the pioneering work in this branch of civil aviation. Had Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited not done all that work, Trans-Australia Airlines would not have been able to function. When the agreein ent is operating, Trans-Australia Airlines will no longer be in the privileged position of having everything handed to it on a platter, but wil l have to compete with private enterprise for freight, mail and passengers. It will be the first time that Trans-Australia A i r cost of £650,000 each, except by obtaining lines has ever felt the stimulating effect He concluded his speech with a lecture on economics in relation to private entertaken from it. A t the outset, I shall discuss the economics of the matter, if the learned professor so desires. Can any honourable member uphold the contention that a company which has a paid-up capital of £1,500,000 is in a financial position to run, in conjunction with another company under cartelization, the airline services of Australia? Of course it cannot! It must lean heavily upon the Government, under the terms of the fifteen-year contract. If that be so, the fact is established that the control of major airlines in a community tends more and more to belong to the Government. If the House requires substantiation of that statement, I cite as examples the Irish Airlines, the consolidation of government airlines in Denmark and elsewhere, and the partially nationalized airlines in France, and many airlines in various South American republics. The reason is obvious. How can a company, with a paid-up capital of £1,500,000 in 5s. shares, acquire turbo-jet aircraft at a financial assistance from the Government?",36,Second Reading
123,Mr Haylen (Parkes) [4.40],"Th eWhy has the Government introduced this bill? Obviously, the Government has chosen this mean and miserable way to pay its political debts. In due course, this measure will be completely repudiated by the community. Australia Airlines is a. successful organization. I do not consider it necessary, for the purposes of this debate, to analyse the beginnings of Trans-Australia A i r lines or to contest even the statement of the Government on the reasons why it was established. ment of the day believed that Trans-Australia Airlines should be established, in the public interest, and, accordingly, it was established most fairly and adequately. A t that time, we were lucky enough to have a financial and business genius at the helm, and, in addition, a splendid, wise and considerate Minister for A i r . As the result of those happy circumstances, we established an enduring organization. Quite apart from the mere economics of the matter, the safety O lines are a by-word, and its service is excellent. chasing the buggy of history without any chance of overtaking it? The Labour Government decided, in its wisdom, to establish Trans-Australia Airlines, which has been successful and profitable. What is the reason for this mewling, mealymouthed attitude about what has been done to private enterprise in the pa3t? The present scheme is the result of a barefaced demand by private enterprise to be permitted to for m a cartel with a government utility in order to run the air services of the country. The record of Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited with respect to finance is not strong. As the Leader of the Opposition has pointed out, the organization has 6,000,000 shares, of a nominal value of ->f. each, and the paid-up capital is s . 1.500,000. He also pointed out the origin of this organization. s-ection of the transport industry, and has consistently fought for its monopoly on the seas. I remind honourable that there is nothing closer knit than a monopoly of shipping interests and this organization became a monopoly of overseas shipping Mr Hapten. The representation within the monopoly is very wide. The monopoly members are Huddart Parker Limited, The Union Steamship Company of New Zealand Limited, the Adelaide Steamship ComTranspany Limited, and the Orient Steam Navigation Company Limited. Within the organization are nominees, managers and others who hold about 1,500 shares each. When honourable members consider that matter they will perceive that the history of Australian NationalA i r The Labour Governways Limited is that it originated as a shipping monopoly and then transferred its activities to another form of transport. It must have known at some time or other that it would lose money through its airline activities, because the history of airlines throughout the world indicates that they must lean on governments. Therefore, honourable members will realize that it was a clear-sighted, laudable and decent action by the Labour government to establish a government-controlled airmeasures taken by Trans-Australia A i r line for the Australian people. The then government realized that no airline W h y is the Government could operate successfully without government assistance, and so it decided to establish its own airline. It did so, and Trans-Australia Airlines has been remarkably successful. The Labour party does not need to apologize for the establishment of the organization, or for its success, and it is ready to debate the matter with the Government on the hustings at any time. The previous Labour government saw beyond doubt that money must be put into private enterprise to enable it to keep going and it decided to establish its own airline in order that the air services of the country could be maintained on a proper and profitable basis. The Minister for Territories ( Mr. Hasluck), in his second-reading speech, spoke of pioneers. I suggest that the Government should give more consideration to the pioneers of the Northern TerriIt comes from another tory and the interior of this country, who fly their little aeroplanes into almost inaccessible regions, than it has given to members Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited. They are the real pioneers of aviation in Australia. Neither Trans-Australia Airlines nor Australian and local coastal lines. National Airways Proprietary Limited have ever considered developing that remote section of our airways because their hands are filled with their activities in the more populous part of the country. To talk of pioneers as the Government has done, is to pay scant courtesy to the real pioneers of aviation-Kingsford-Srnith, Hm, nothing out of aviation and gave everything to it. What: good will this bill do for Australia ? The agreement has a term of fifteen years, and it is merely another attempt by the Government to put the feathers back on to the plucked fowl, and to reverse Labour's policy. The only thing that the public is concerned about is that this successful, highly efficient airline should be maintained in its present form. The public does not want it to he sabotaged, and I use the word ' sabotaged"" because every line of the ! bill now before honourable members is malicious and is intended to act to the detriment of Trans-Australia Airlines for the benefit of Australian National Airways Minister some element of liberalism in his makeup, even though it may be deep down within him and is getting deeper as he becomes more experienced, probably thought along the lines that I have mentioned because his replies to interjections while he was making his second-reading speech were more caustic than usual. He realizes that something useful to Australia, is being sabotaged to honour a political promise. The Minister and the Government should learn that they cannot; turn back the pages of history nor roll back the scroll of time. There )-= no doubt that some, government ownership of our main air services is essential because of the money needed to operate the air services and because of their defence value. This bill is not relevant to our present time; it refers more to iiii era of some ten years ago. It has been suggested by some honourable members on the Government side that the amount of airmail business given to Trans-Australia Airlines find the quantity of freight carried have caused a loss of profits to Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited. If that is so, why is it that to-day Trans-Australia Airlines, because of the highly inflated price of petrol and other essentials, is also suffering a loss? How is it that the Government airline is feeling the strain of our present financial cirH inkier and others-wh o got cumstances? Airlin e operation is a millionaire job to-day, and cannot be handled adequately by Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited or any other private enterprise. The services, personnel, organization and management of Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited are above reproach. It is not a matter of dispute that the present company is efficient. The Opposition is concerned with policy; and we shall maintain our point to the very last speaker from this side of the House. Honourable members on the Government side made a charge that airmail business was given to Trans-Australia Airlines to the detriment of Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited. I remind honourable members that there is no indication that Proprietary Limited. The the Orient Steam Navigation Company for Territories, who has Limited intends to hand over its rights in the mails to the new Italian lines or other shipping lines that are now plying between Australia and Europe. The overseas shipping industry is knit in a very close combine, and that combine will yield none of its profits or privileges for the sake of private enterprise. Indeed, it will use all its endeavours to squeeze out. its competitors and destroy them. The Government will not concede that, for defence and financial reasons, the Commonwealth should nourish its own airline. Surely the Government should not allow our own air service to starve to death through lack of the nourishment of Commonwealth contracts? I suggest that Trans-Australia Airlines is an excellent example of a government organization that has prospered in competition with private enterprise, and which is now to be destroyed simply because it is an efficient competitor. My limited time does not allow me to speak of other aspects of this matter that are well worth investigation, and I suggest that, honourable members should judge this case in the light of a few extracts from the speech of the Minister who introduced the bill. The Minister for Territories saidI said curlier that the Australian internal air services were the finest in the world. Their excellence was, in the Government's opinion, due on the part of each organization to the competition which the other provided. A Labour government tried to create The Opposition does not accept that. competition between the air services to One company admits to losses, and the make them efficient, but now this Governreport of the Australian NationalA i r ment has decided that that good work lines Commission also admits to losses. shall be undone. members to read Hansard, in which that it hates the very word "" socialism "", they will see that when Trans-Australia has not hesitated to use this type of Airlines was being established every legislation to bring in a sort of socialism speech made from the then Opposition of its own.

Honourable that that 13 double-barrelled nationalimembers then sitting in Opposition were zation. The generous terms offered by f u l l of denunciations of the scheme.

The complete cynicism of the Minister for Territories is indicated by this statement, made during his second-reading speechActive competition could not be maintained if one of the two companies had a precarious existence, which depended on the policy of the government of the day. I invite honourable Therefore, the Government, which says The ordinary circumstances it could not get honourable members that although the the T suggest that when he is replying to the Government would have concern right back to the moment of its first successes in order to bolster up its failing competitor. Such retrospective legislation has never been heard of in this Parliament, and it is all the more difficult to understand when it is realized that honourable members do not know the financial position of Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited because it is a private company, and only an hour ago the Prime Minister, with a fine gesture and thumping himself on the chest, said he would not be a party to producing private documents. I suggest that if the Parliament is to furnish the money it will want to know the position of the company. To know the financial position of Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited is all the more urgent, because we already know the position of Trans-Australia Airlines. A f t er the Leader of the Opposition ( D r . not only on an ordinary commercial Evatt.) had demolished the pretentions of the Government, and had revealed its skullduggery about lending money and making retrospective charges, he drew attention to the hidden clauses of the agreement which will allow Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited to resuscitate its business. turned to the other clauses of the bill. If two companies an inquiry must be held. judgment in such a dispute-the Delphic Oracle of private enterprise, whose judgments, according to the professor from Warringah, must be everlasting? Nothing of the sort. We take it that a retired judge is to be trundled in on a stretcher. Most retired judges are over 70; and ouL of that collection the Government, if it runs true to form, w ill appoint for this purpose some one who, whilst he will do the job honestly, will not be a young man. matter on a judicial level, whether a certain figure is right or wrong. I am sure that the Minister for Territories would want a person of that type to do this job, because he found that a great administrator was worn out at the age of 63, and for that reason was unable to continue his wise administration in New Guinea. But on this occasion the Minister talks about wheeling in a nonagenarian to decide whether Trans-Australia Airlines or the Government's new whitehaired hoy, Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited, has a case. One concludes from the Minister's second-reading speech and from the remarks of the honourable member tor Warringah that the case against Trans-Australia Airlines is loaded. This agreement has been demanded by private enterprise. The Government should approach this problem in a common-sense way. Can the resuscitation of Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited as a strong force in this sphere fro m a defence point of view be sustained without expending money that belongs to the people and which should be used for the development of the organization that has already been established under the ownership of the people to provide air services, basis, but also in relation to defence? Is there any common sense in trying to resuscitate this private organization in this way? If there has been some squeezing in this matter, as has been alleged, has the Government itself looked into the question of compensation? This has Then he been a long and tortuous debate. I am sure that the honourable member for n dispute occurs between the Maribyrnong ( Mr Drakeford), who played a magnificent part in the estabAnd who is to pronounce lishment of Trans-Australia Airlines, will put these matters in their proper perspective. It is impossible to deny the fact that Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited, with all its business efficiency, is undercapitalized for the project in which it is engaged and, therefore, it must lean upon the Government for financial assistance. This proposal involves the destruction of Trans-Australia Airlines by Government supporters merely on the pretext of fulfilling an election Tie will decide, dealing with the promise. Honourable members opposite should forget their shibboleths because the people have long forgotten them. In Trans-Australia Airlines this country already possesses an efficient air organization. Throughout the world, the trend is towards government ownership of airlines, because of the relationship of such services to defence and also because private enterprise, under the competitive urge, eventually deteriorates into the practice of squeezing more and more freight and passengers into aircraft. I invite honourable members opposite to read the horrible statistics of air accidents in the United States of America that have been compiled as a result of impartial investiLeader of the Opposition, who stated gations, which showed that most aircraft accidents resulted from the anxiety of private enterprise to make more dollars regardless of the sanctity of human life. I mention that as something which could happen under the much vaunted system of private enterprise in this sphere. It has never been validly suggested that Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited might render a useful service from a defence point of view. On that ground the case in favour of Trans-Australia Airlines as the best organization in the national interest is unanswerable. already done good work in this sphere, and it should not be destroyed. In this matter the mumbling words of an accountant do not count. This is a matter of high policy. We must consider the value of Trans-Australia Airlines from the point of view of the defence and safety of this country as well as from that of its ability to provide an efficient transport service. Every provision that is contained in tinue to do, is to protect the people's the bill attempts in a miserable, subverassets.

I support with the warmest feelings of gratitude the remarks of the Labour's case clearly. He has left no doubt that Labour, when it is returned to office, will take steps to remedy the injustice that will be perpetuated under this agreement. Labour undertakes to investigate every angle of this agreement. The Opposition repudiates it now; and when Labour is returned to office, it will act in accordance with sanity and justice to insure that Trans-Australia Airlines, which was established by a national government in the interests of Australia, shall be sustained. The reason for the wrath that has been engendered among honourable members opposite in this debate is that they realize that this bill releases from socialization another valuable asset of the people.

Once an egg is scrambled it cannot be unscrambled. Trans-Australia Airlines and Australian National Airways Proprietary Ximited conduct the best air services in the world. .Australians who have returned from visits overseas have told me repeatedly that the air services in Australia are the best that they know. The Opposition has confirmed that view. Many former Labour Ministers, who were noted globe-trotters when they were in office, have said so. The agreement that will be approved under the terms of this bill w ill operate for fifteen years. The Leader of the Opposition has said, and doubtless he spoke for once on behalf of a unanimous Opposition, that, if the Labour party regains power, it will take steps to have the agreement set aside. amongst honourable members opposite, which is unique in my experience as a in Australia. Had they member of this House, points to the only danger in relation to the Government's plan. It represents a threat to the future of Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited. Should this Government be overthrown, which is unlikely, honourable members opposite, who have thrown away their right to vote as free men in order to pledge their support to socialism, would apply the pincers to Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited once more and try to force its aircraft out of the skies. Fortunately, the decision will rest in the hands of the The y showed a great people, and I think that they have learned fro m experience that the socialists cannot be trusted.

I Many crippling handicaps that were imposed on Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited by the Labour GoBoth vernment in order to give an advantage to Trans-Australia Airlines w ill be removed by this bill. Under the terms of the agreement, each organization will be given a substantial share of airmail business. That is a good provision, and I do not believe that any honourable member can honestly quibble about it. The late Mr Chifley said during the 194*9 election campaign that all he wanted was a f a i r go. This 'bill will give a failgo to the airline operators.

The private company was almost forced out of the air because the Labour Government refused to provide it with dollars for the purchase of new aircraft and replacement parts. The socialists were determined to own all airline organizations in Australia. One outstanding' item of evidence in support of that statement is the fact that Trans-Australia Airlines acquired five Convair aircraft, whereas Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited acquired none.

The honourable member for Capricornia ( Mr Pearce) has spoken of the pioneering work of Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited. The picture that he conjured up to entertain the House was that of a struggling pioneering company. Before Trans-Australia Airlines existed, Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited had received subsidies from the Commonwealth amounting to £2,500,000, and the Commonwealth had expended upon civil aviation projects, very largely upon interstate airports, a sum of £11,000,000. Those airports were used almost exclusively by Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited on its interstate traffic. A sum of £13,500,000 of public The let them remember that that company Airmade no expenditure of a heavy capital The honourable member for Capricornia",45,Opposition Members H E A R Hear
139,Mr Beazley (Fremantle) [5.29],"aircraft in use, Australian NationalA i r company, it was wise enough to settle ways Proprietary Limited bought eight Skymasters, and Trans-Australia A i r lines bought four Skymasters and four Convairs. Trans-Australia Airlines had Convairs as a result of the judgment of its management. If it had made the same decision as Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited, it would have had eight Skymasters. Personally, I do not feel nearly as secure in a Convair as I do in a Skymaster, due to a number of experiences that I have had in Convairs. I believe that four engines in an aircraft is an advantage. The point that I want to make about dollars is that, over a period of time, both companies made similar purchases of heavy aircraft. ""Why has Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited been selected as the company that should receive this most favorable treatment f r om the Commonwealth? It is entirely unreal to speak, as the Minister did, about the losses of Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited during the last few years. Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited is a subsidiary of a shipping combine. One of the shareholders in it is the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company, which made a profit of £19,000,000 last year. The Government is very keen to conceal the list of shareholders in the company. It is not true to speak of Australian National Aii-ways Proprietary Limited as having made losses, when it is, in fact, a department of a transport cartel. It would be just as logical to say that if the men's wear department of David Jones Limited made a loss, profits made by other sections of the firm should not be taken into consideration. I propose to speak bluntly about the which is to enjoy the advantage of being safety record of Australian National a private company, with its affairs conAirways Proprietary Limited, because 1 cealed from publication, whilst it is receivhave not the least doubt that if what can ing public money. If Australian National be said about that company could be said Airways Proprietary Limited had to go about Trans-Australia Airlines, it would to the market to get £4,000,000-and be said. Of all the airline companies in nobody here believes for a minute that Australia, Australian National Airways any one would subscribe £4,000,000 to it Proprietary Limited is the most unfitted -it would be a public company and its to receive favorable consideration from affairs would be made public; but, under any government. In the space of a comthis agreement, it will remain a private paratively few months, it had five company, as far as the concealment of its major crashes. When the relatives of affairs is concerned, whilst obtaining the deceased passengers attempted to sue the benefit of public funds. I say that it their claims out of court. If those crashes had happened to Trans-Australia A i r lines, they would have been invoked by this Government as a reason for disposing of the company, and we on this side of the House would have regarded that as an irresistible argument. The crashes began with the Amana and the Lutana. Then there was the episode at Mount Macedon. Last week, there was an episode at Mascot, about which the Minister will give no information, when an Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited Skymaster with 40 passengers on board crashed down on the runway. The safety record of Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited is gravely open to doubt. If the Government wanted to give favorable treatment to AnsettA i r ways Proprietary Limited, which has a record of nineteen or twenty years of perfect safety, it could have come to this House with a clear conscience and put that company forward as one that it ought to support. But nobody in this chamber can be satisfied with the record of Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited during the last few years. It is one of the worse records of any airline operating anywhere in the world, including the American companies, which have had some disastrous experience with Skymasters. The Government will not inform the House of the interests that really own Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited. It dare not discuss why a company with a safety record that is so bad has been singled out for such good treatment. It insists that there shall be no publication of the affairs of the company, could not get from private sources the loan tliat it is to get from this Government. The honourable member for Capricornia could think of no better way in which to deal with the argument of the honourable member for Parkes( Mr consideration of that, the Commonwealth Haylen) than to say that he was sneering at the fact that the capital of Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited was only £1,500,000. The honourable member for Parkes said that no bank would advance £3,000,000 to a company that possessed assets worth £1,500,000. He explained that, in ordinary banking practice, £1,500,000 of rapidly deteriorating assets of an airline would not be treated by any bank as satisfactory collateral security. The Government knows that. Therefore, it does not dare to impose upon the Commonwealth Bank an obligation to find £3,000,000 for this company, and it has underwritten the position of the company. We hear a lot said about private enterprise. It is assumed by the Government that this |)rivate company will be unable to repay the Commonwealth Bank and, accordingly, the Government itself has underwritten the ability of the company to repay. That is one of the most remarkable features of this agreement. The second extremely feature of the agreement is the manner for Trans-Australia Airlines, and travels in which it deals with landing dues. with it. Having regard' to the attitude Either landing dues should be paid, or that the Government has adopted, why they should not be paid. Nobody could has not Trans-Australia Airlines been honestly defend an intermediate position, sold ? We have heard a great deal of talk but the Government, in this agreement, about desocialization.

The company is virtually bankrupt. The honourable member for Capricornia said that it would have gone out of existence but for this effort to salvage it. Yet it is to pay a part of its landing dues, and, in is to call off its action in the High Court on landing dues. It does not appear tome that the company was very confident that it would win the case in the High Court. I am strongly opposed to the idea of landing dues being paid by any only airline in Australia, notwithstanding that a Labour government imposed them. Tf there is to be a waiving of landing dues*, it should be complete. The half-way proposal in the agreement is merely an effort to make it appear that the Commonwealth will get something from it. Ostensihl'y, the arrangement is that Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited will pay £337,000 to the Commonwealth, but, in fact, the Commonwealth has waived its claim to a sumof £600,000, and is to receive some of the money that it will lend to the company.. Every member of the Government parties who has spoken in this debate so far has attacked Trans-Australia A i r lines. Every honourable member on the right of the Chair attacks Trans-Australia Airlines except when-, it comes to interesting travelling. Then he votes with his ticket in the conduct of its affairs?

It does not matter pendence. The reason why Trans-Australia A i r lines has not ""been sold by the Government is a technical reason. But for the fact that we are .in .a transitional stage in the development of air services, Trans-Australia Airlines would have been sold. If it had been sold, the Government would have had to get rid of D.C.3's, Convairs a n d Skymasters, every one of which will be obsolete junk within two years. They would have had to be loaded on to a private company. W it h a change of government, a new government airline would have been formed, with a fleet consisting entirely of jet and turbo-propellor aircraft. Then, the company that was operating the ancient aircraft would have gone out of 'existence. Because we made it perfectly iclear that that would happen if Trans-Australia Airlines were abolished, the Government could not dispose of the assets of the company, because no other airline would wish to carry so much obsolete or obsolescent equipment. A great deal has been said about the alleged refusal of Labour governments to make dollars available to private airline companies. when the Chifley Government was in tion that there is a social aspect conoffice, eight new Skymasters were bought nected with the purchase of aircraft, by Australian National Airways Prowhether for a private company or for prietary Limited and eight major aircraft the Government.

Every year, new aircraft should be added to Australian airlines. That is one reason why it is extremely difficult for a private company, which is concerned exclusively with profits, to conduct air services. I do not think that profits should be a consideration in the operation of airlines. Safety should be the paramount consideration. If it is an enterprise which must be conducted at a loss, then I know very well what will happen. Private enterprise will get out of the field or, alternatively, the Government will have to subsidize it. No country makes a religion of private enterprise more intensely than does the United States of America, but the Civil Aeronautics Board in America is subsidizing private company after private company simply on the consideration that airline companies must constantly purchase new aircraft. That is a feature of civil aviation in America to-day. Between 1946 and 1949, socialization, but at least it is a recogniNew aircraft were spectacular.

141,"Mr Beazley ""","I agree that it is not more efficient in competition, honourable members opposite did not advance that as an argument for raising the standard of efficiency of Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited to the standard of Trans-Australia Airlines. No, quite the reverse! Trans-Australia Airlines had to come down to the standard of Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited! Trans-Australia Airlines imposes more stringent tests on its pilots than does Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited, and puts them through training school once every three months instead of once every six months, as is required by law. That is one of the expensive services undertaken by Trans-Australia Airlines that the Government has so far not dared to interfere with in order to bring Trans-Australia Airlines down to the standard of Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited. I turn now to the subject of the carriage of mails by air, about which honourable members opposite have had so much to say. Where is the sense or logic in assertbasis of strict comparison. ing that the carriage of airmails ought to be shared between two companies, when one of the companies is owned by the Government? Since the Commonwealth has to pay the cost of the carriage of the mails, why should it not pay itself for carrying them ? Is it the intention of the Government to give money away just for the sheer pleasure of giving it away, and in order to enable a private company to increase its profits; then, having increased Government, in an attempt to salvage the loss on the government airline, make the taxpayer carry the burden? Is that supposed to be a business like approach to this problem? ment robbed Australian . National Air£336,000, and the later profit of £205,799 ways Proprietary Limited of the mail rose to £341,000.

It is diture by its performance of services for not robbing anybody if it declines to the Commonwealth. We should like to renew a contract. If it was robbery know why Australian National Airways to take the mail contracts from Australian Proprietary Limited has been selected as National Airways Proprietary Limited, the company to share in this proposed then it is also robbery every time the rationalization, having regard to its Postal Department transfers a contract safety record over the last few years. Why from one mail contractor in a country was that safety record ignored? What area to another. It is no more logical to contend that half of the Royal Mail must go by Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited planes, and half by Trans-Australia Airlines planes, than it would be to contend that private truck drivers should carry half the letters from the Postal Department to the airport and government truck drivers should carry the other half. Such arguments from the other side of the chamber illustrate the intellectual level of the debate. I should like to hear from Ministers more about this agreement than they have yet been willing to disclose. If public funds are to be put into Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited, why should the Minister for Territories boast that the bill is based on an investigation the terms of which he will not reveal to the House? This is what he had to sayTo this end the Government arranged for an independent analysis of the financial structure and operating costs of both airlines on a He pointed out that Trans-Australia Airlines made a profit of £214,818 in 1949-50, whilst Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited showed a loss of £216,6S2 in the same year; and that Trans-Australia Airlines had made a profit of £205,799 in 1950-51, whilst Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited had made a loss of £10,221.

Every honourable gentleman opposite knows that it would have been adducing that record, if held by Trans-Australia Airlines, as an argument for the abolition of the airline and as a basis for claiming that government-run airlines were inefficient. The Government has not answered that question. stated why it will not publish the affairs of Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited. If we are asked to impose a special charge of £337,000 for the benefit of Australian NationalA i r ways Proprietary Limited, how can wa tell whether or not it is justified if we do not know the company's affairs. If we are asked to waive £450,000 due to the Commonwealth from Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited, how can we know whether that action is justified or not if the Government does not give us the facts? If we are asked to force the Commonwealth Bank, as we are asked to do in this bill, to advance £3,000,000 to Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited, how can we know whether the loan is justified if the Government refuses to give us the necessary facts on which our judgment could be made? The honourable member for ""Warringah ( Mr Bland) has at least had the logic to point out that this is not a business proposition, and also that it is not an effort of desocialization, as the honourable member for Capricornia ( Mr Pearce) claimed. Honourable gentlemen opposite have accused us of having, when in office, attempted to nationalize the airlines. That was undoubtedly the case, but the attempt was prevented because the H i g h Court declared the legislation to be invalid. I believe in the nationalizafor Territories, and Government speakers tion of airlines on the ground of safety, and because I hold that private profit ought not to be a consideration in the management of airways. If honourable gentlemen opposite like to quote me on that matter on every platform in the country, they are welcome to do so, because I have made that statement on every platform on which I have spoken about national airways. The idea held by honourable gentlemen opposite that the public is fervently in favour of a desocialization policy seems to me to be a great illusion. If I were asked my opinion of the public's feelings on that issue I should say that it does not favour either the destruction of private enterprise by the Government, or the flinging away of government assets to private enterprise. As I interpret the wishes of the community, the people are struggling to find a mediate position between the two posiIt has not tions taken up by the opposing sides in this Parliament. The agreement with which the bill deals is a scandalous one. An amount of £3,000,000 is to be advanced to a company which has inadequate assets and a poor safety record. A t the same time there is a deliberate concealment of the affairs of the company concerned by a government that has caused a most serious deterioration in civil aviation standard? over the last few years. The argument advanced by the Minister neither adequately described the bill nor justified the agreement. Back-benchers on the Government side have attempted to justify the agreement by all sorts of claims about the pioneering work of Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited, the untruth of which is apparent to anybody who has even a nodding acquaintance with the fact that subsidies were paid to the company by the Government before Trans-Australia Airlines came into existence, and who is also acquainted with the fact that the Commonwealth spent millions of pounds on civil aviation facilities, purely for the benefit of private companies, also before the inception of Trans-Australia Airlines. I do not think that any logical argument can be advanced to justify the bill. It is noteworthy that the Minister who followed him, have evaded mention of the terms of the agreement that are contained in the schedule to the hill, and have contented themselves with general statements about the agreement's f a i r ness. They have done so because they have flinched from a discussion of the actual clauses that provide for this scandalous advance of public moneys to a company that has no assets, and the waiving of its landing dues, irrespective of whether or not they were legally imposed. In the not-distant future this country will depend largely on aviation transport, and I consider that it is absurd to make either private or public airline companies pay petrol tax, and so raise the cost of the services they render. Since this Government came into office the price of petrol supplied to airline companies has risen from 3s. to 4s. 2d. a gallon. I consider that that is an extremely strong argument for remitting petrol tax to airline companies. I also regard the imposition of landing dues as no better than the medieval tolls that were charged on the highways. dues imposed on ships? for the Minister for Defence( Mr ways Proprietary Limited over a long McBride) to attempt to make that point against me. I have criticized the imposition of landing dues as an action of the Chifley Government. I am simply making the point that I do consider that landing dues should not be imposed. The Government, of course, has abolished them, but requires Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited to make a payment of part of the landing dues that it owes to the Government. However, as the company will be able to make the payment only out of money lent to it by the Government itself, that appears to me to be a completely indefensible proposition. I -certainly concur with the view of the Opposition that not the least scandalous feature of the bill is the attempt by the Government to bind future governments to this agreement for fifteen years. If there is any means whereby this utterly unjustified agreement, which the Government proposes to impose on its successors irrespective of what the people may -decide at general elections, can be evaded, I should strongly support its being -evaded. I consider that a royal commission should be established to inquire into this measure and all the circumstances surrounding it. It is noteworthy that all the forces that supported the Government at the 1949 general election, the private banks, the oil companies, and now this airline company, whose leader, Mr Walsh, was a conspicuous figure in the general election campaign, have been paid off, and I think the explanation might be found by an audit of party funds. Sitting suspended from 5.59 to 8 p.m. honourable member for Fremantle ( Mr Beazley) has referred to the safety records of Trans-Australia Airlines and Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited respectively. For a gentleman who pretends to have some experience and training in the search for knowledge and truth, and who has always led us to believe that he lays claim to be one of the more decent members of this House, he has uttered some of the most poisonous, malicious and false distortions that have been heard in this chamber. It is quite useless The record of Australian National Airperiod is an admirable one. I direct attention to the fact that in the period 1938 to 1948, it had a completely accident-free record. It is only by good fortune that Trans-Australia Airlines has had an equally good run since it was established in 1945. The honourable member for Fremantle, with a commendable regard for his own safety, recounted how he had had some nasty experiences in the Convairs operated by Trans-Australia Airlines. I suggest that upon reflection, he will agree that those experiences could, as easily as not, have ended in disaster. If he has any regard for the truth and statistical integrity, he must realize that the situation could change in the next week or fortnight, and that, on the law of averages, the accident rate of Trans-Australia Airlines could easily exceed that of Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited over the last few years. member intend to return to Western Australia by train? flying than the honourable member for Parkes( Mr Haylen).

154,Mr Freeth,"I remind the Houseservices for the public, but, at any rate, its introduction is necessary because of the avowed intention of the Labour party to rid Trans-Australia Airlines of any competition. The Labour party could not achieve that objective by the Australian National Airlines Act 1945, because of the ruling of the H i g h Court, but it has made no secret ever since of its intention slowly to strangle Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited, which i the major rival of Trans-Australia A i r lines. A few moments ago, the honourable member for Hume( Mr Puller) interjected that the Government proposed to sell out one of the people's assets. A great deal has been said in the last few weeks about the sale of the people's assets. That spurious and "" phoney "" slogan has been uttered ad nauseam by members of the Labour party. What are the people's assets? They are something which are of value and use to the people. Suppose the Government owned every factory, motor car, f a r m and every other material item in this country Opposition members not like these hard facts. I am merely asking honourable members opposite to think a little honestly about "" phoney"" slogan that they have been uttering in the last few weeks throughout the countryside. Do they honestly suggest that any asset or material item, because it is owned by a government, is of more value to the people than it would be if it were owned by private enterprise? An asset is of use to the country only for the services that it provides. Honourable members opposite who speak about the people's assets must admit that the undertaking at Glen Davis was a colossal liability. The Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt) referred in his speech this afternoon to the fact that the Government proposed to make available to Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited money that should have been made available to the States for various purposes. Does he suggest that we should continue to pour millions of pounds down the drain in order to maintain the so called asset of the people at Glen Davis? Strict accountancy alone should compel hiin to recognize the falsity of such an idea. I ask honourable members to consider whether the State-owned railways are such a colossal asset to the people. H a d they been run by concerns other than governments, would they be the liability to the taxpayer that they are to-day? Would they have been allowed to decay, and f a l l into the sorry state of disrepair in which they are today? Honourable members who represent electorates in New South Walesi n particular, know that the transport system of that .State is in a mess. I do not know whether they claim that various State governments pioneered many transport services for the benefit of country areas, and that is why the railways are not a paying proposition. The truth of the matter is that it is in metropolitan areas where population is densest and where services could he exected to be most profitable, that State transport services in general-ther e may be one or two exceptions-hav e fallen into a state of disrepair, for which there is no valid excuse. Bungling and inefficiency on the part of governments are responsible for that state interjecting, of affairs. The governments did not know how to handle the people's assets. The Opposition does In this legislation, we are ensuring permanent protection for the assets of the people against bungling socialist in this efficiency. I hate to think what would be the future of airlines in Australia with a government monopoly airline, a government that "" ran the show "" to suit its own political purposes. Postal Department? ber for Perth( Mr Tom Burke) can offer no proof that the Postal Department is 100 per cent, efficient. I consider that there is a case to be made out in support of a charge that there is gross inefficiency in many branches of that department, regardless of the government that is in office.

158,Mr Speaker,"Order ! I ask theagain this spurious slogan about the people's assets! I emphasize that assets are of use to the people only when they are used to their maximum efficiency. This bill is designed to preserve for the people of v\.ustralia competitive and efficient air services. One of the grave defects of any government organization which is not obliged to preserve a tremendously high standard of competitive efficiency, is that it becomes a plaything for political patronage. Honourable members opposite must be deeply conscious of that fact. I do not need to remind them of recent appointments to various positions because the government concerned had it in its power to make those appointments. Men were appointed to various positions, not for their skill or efficiency in particular directions, but because of their political services. I have in mind particularly M c G i r r , formerly Premier of New South. ""Wales, who was recently appointed to the position of chairman of the M a r i time Services Board of New South Wales. I do not know what sort of a sailor he was. I also have in mind the Honourable J . A . Ferguson, a prominent member of the Labour party, who has been appointed chairman of the M i l k Board of New South Wales, and Mr .1. M . Baddeley, a former Deputy Leader of the Labour party in New South Wales, has been appointed director of State Coal Mines. ment of Mr Cleland to the position of Acting Administrator of New Guinea. list are legion. I do not care which government has made the appointments. The tendency is obvious in government enterprises for positions to be filled by political patronage. The people's assets,' that honourable members opposite have spoken so glibly sipated in politically controlled undertakings. The Government that stands aside and watches the people's assets being dissipated is not acting as a responsible trustee. All governments should ensure that these assets shall be efficiently used, and even increased. Until the people's [123 ] L e t us not hear assets can be properly used, and they cannot under socialist control, business enterprises will be best left in the hands of those with the skill and experience of properly conducting businesses and making a profit. The Leader of the Opposition said time and again that the people's, assets would be dissipated because the Government intended to make enormous grants to Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited in order that that company should be put on the same financial footing as Trans-Australia Airlines. The right honourable gentleman was asked, at least twice during the course of his speech, to correct his statement that the Government intended to make grants to Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited, but he refused to do so. If he had read the schedule to the bill he would have discovered that the Government does not intend to make any grants at all the Honourable James to Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited. The proposal of the Government is merely to guarantee loans by the Commonwealth Bank to this organization. Opposition members interjecting, honourable members opposite do not relish hearing the facts about this measure, and I repeat that the facts are that Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited has been given, according to the agreement, permission to obtain a loan from the Commonwealth Bank, and the Government hasagreed to guarantee the repayment of that money. If Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited borrows the money from the CommonT h e names on the wealth Bank it will have to pay interest, and will ultimately have to repay the loan. Of course the Government will guarantee the repayment of the loan, but then the Government will have a mortgage over the assets of Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited so that the about, are disloan will be quite secure. There is no suggestion at all in the measure that Australian National Airlines Proprietary Limited will recklessly borrow the money, as the honourable member for Fremantle ( Mr Beazley) suggested, in order to pay landing dues.

Honourable members opposite will at least credit Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited with sufficient business common --ensc not to do that. The company will borrow money only if it can make the maximum profitable use of the money. Therefore, I suggest that the Commonwealth will be making a good investment to lend money which will provide good interest and ensure a better airline service for Australia. Mr ToJt BURKE -The Government Proprietary Limited. Again that is a should show honourable members the completely absurd proposition.

Mr Forde, who was then Minister able member for Wills( Mr Bryson) for the Army, commenced to quote that must maintain silence. report in the Parliament, and I think that you, Mr Speaker, asked that the document be tabled. When you did so, there opposite have made no secret of their was a frantic flurry among the members sinister designs on this private company, of the Labour Government to have it and they have never suggested that they declared a secret document. Since that are in favour of fair competition between time the document has not seen, the light the airline organizations. How else can if day. The reason for attempting to they oppose this agreement? Apparently keep it in obscurity is obvious, because honourable members opposite want the Mr Corbett later saidMr Forde is reported to have said that the to charge more than the price at which committee of which I was chairman recommended a national corporation.

All that it was attempting to wipe the private they have said to-day indicates that they airlines out of existence. The honourable have every intention, as the honourable member for Fremantle suggested that member for Fremantle candidly admitted profits should not be considered in the but as some of his colleagues were not operations of an airline, and that landing dues should not be paid. In other words, he suggested that the taxpayers, and I suppose that 99 per cent, of them do not use the airlines; should provide a luxury service with all modern conveniences for the people who do want to use them. I do not know whether the honourable member realized at the time the implications of what he said, but he should now realize how completely absurd his proposition was. Because the Government provides aerodromes and landing and other facilities for the airlines, honourable members opposite have suggested that the Government is already making a direct subsidy to Australian National Airways that because the Government constructs Mr Bryson interjecting, Government monopoly to operate without the slightest losses being incurred, and they need for air services.

I suggest that Australia w ill be much better off for the agreement that has been signed by the Government. [8.25] -On e of the most outstanding features of this debate has been the lack of enthusiasm for the measure displayed on the Government side. It is strange that many Ministers have been absent from the chamber to-day during the debate. No t one Minister has participated to-day, and so. far we have heard only speeches by obscure backbenchers on the Government side. We have heard from the honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Bland), who is one of the most barren debaters in the House and who, as a rule, contributes nothing worthwhile.

I suggest to him that if Trans-Australia A i r lines is an inefficient socialist enterprise, then how much more inefficient must Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited be to need the assistance of this bill in order to compete with Trans-Australia Airlines? The latter company must be a far more bungling enterprise.

183,Mr Hasluck,"The honourable memister who signed the agreement, even before the Parliament had given its assent to the measure, is Robert Menzies have thought that the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) would at least have had the courage to introduce the bill, but apparently that is not the case. The honourable member for Forrest referred to political patronage. That comes rather odd from him, because one might draw attention to the fact that there has been continual lobbying going on in Canberra ^for some two or three years. F o r the last two or three months Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited has employed a person f u l l time at the Hotel Canberra buying drinks and giving parties in the hope of influencing Government supporters. The lobbyist to whom I refer is at present sittingi n the visitors' gallery in this chamber to observe how assure the House that he is not watching me because he has not bought drinks for rue. 1 can only assume that he is watching some other honourable members. understand the remarks of the honourable member correctly, he is suggesting that honourable members on this side of the chamber have been influenced by some one outside in their attitude to this bill. That is a most serious reflection upon the conduct of honourable members. M a y lays down that if an honourable member makes a charge as serious as this charge is and cannot prove it, he should either be obliged to withdraw it or be dealt with by the House. Apparently, the Minister for Territories ( Mr Hasluck) objects to a remark that the honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr Clyde Cameron) has made. submit the honourable member's remarks are a part of the case that the Opposition is (making in this debate, and that it is opeu to Government supporters, if they are able to do so, to answer the contention that he is putting forward. of the honourable member for Hindmarsh The MinandI am afraid that he went farther than the honourable member for Perth( Mr Tom Burke) has indicated, because he said that a person was at present in the chamber watching honourable members for the purpose of influencing them. That is the sort of charge which I hoped I should would not be made in a debate of this kind in which tempers are likely to rise. The Minister for Territories ( Mr Hasluck) has submitted that, according to M a y , the House may call upon an honourable member who makes a charge of that kind to prove it. That submission is well made; but that is not a matter for me at this stage. It is a matter for the House. person to whom I have referred is not watching me; and I can only assume that he must be watching other honourable members. ""What is the composition of Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited? Let us look at the list. of its shareholders. Australian National honourable members behave.

CLYDE CAMERON -Although the taxpayers have been called upon to provide the sum of £2,500,000 in direct subsidies to this wealthy combination of shipping companies and have made available no less a sum than £11,000,000 to provide for its benefit aerodromes and navigation facilities, they now find that they must provide a further £4,000,000 in the form of a. guarantee to this company in order to enable it to continue operations and compete against Trans-Australia Airlines, which the honourable member for Eorrest( Mr Freeth) described as a "" bungling, inefficient, socialist enterprise "". The funny thing about this proposal is that although the Government is able to find this sum of £4,000,000there is a possibility that it will supplement this amount with a further £2,000,000 or £3,000,000-it cannot find any money at all to enable the States to provide housing for the ordinary, little people. The Minister for Territories in his second-reading speech saidAfter the most earnest consideration, the Government adopted a scries of principles which followed from its basic policy that the major internal services should be conducted under conditions Briefly these principles are(1) Each operator to be given a proper and substantial share of airmail. (2) Government business to be freely available to both airlines. (3) Each operator to be assisted financially to acquire new heavy flying equipment. Let us examine those principles. The first is, "" Each operator to be given a proper and substantial share of a i r m a i l "" . Why should Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited be given any share of airmail at all? The conduct of airmail services is a government responsibility, and if the Government already controls an capable of transporting mails, then surely, it is bound to use that service for I summon the part to do so would be much the same as a person who owns a motor car hiring a taxicab whenever he wanted to be conveyed anywhere. The second principle that the Minister enunciated was, '""' Government business to be freely available to both airlines "". What would Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited say if the Government introduced a measure in order to compel the shipping companies, which, in the main, constitute that company, to make freely available to Trans-Australia Airlines a share of their shipping business? In that event, they would be horrified and would scream that such a proposal constituted unjust interference with private enterprise. The third principle that the Minister stated was, "" Each operator to be assisted financially to acquire new heavy flying equipment"". On what ground can any one say that it is a function of a government to provide financial assistance to any private enterprise? If ' private enterprise is so much to be desired, because it is so much superior to socialism, as Government supporters suggest, why does not this p r i vate enterprise finance itself? One of the arguments that Government supporters always advance in support of private enterprise is that it saves the public from having to provide finance for socialized undertakings. Members of the Liberal party merely say that they believe in competition, yet, under of active competition. this measure the Government proposes to force Trans-Australia Airlines to hand over half of its government business to Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited. The handing over of such business could be justified only if it can be shown that Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited provides a cheaper and better service than Trans-Australia Airlines provides. service ? needs to be shown that Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited air service which is provides a Abetter and more competitive service than Trans-Australia Airlines provides.

196,Mr Clydecameron,"No ; it has no right to be given a share of government business that is now handled by Trans-Australia Airlines. of the fittest is the basis of business competition-the organization that is most capable of providing an efficient service will survive. If Government supporters really believed in competition, they would realize that the Government is not justified in any way whatever in introdducing this measure under which it proposes to enable Australian NationalA i r ways Proprietary Limited to interfere with the time-tables or air routes that Trans-Australia Airlines may decide to observe or inaugurate. If Trans Australia Airlines desires to provide a new service in any area, or to improve an existing service, it should have a perfect right to do so without being obliged to consult with Australian"" NationalA i r ways Proprietary Limited at a l l ; and the latter company should have the right to take similar action without being obliged to consult Trans-Australia A i r lines. Under this measure, Trans-Australia Airlines is to be prevented f r om hiring, or purchasing, aircraft from any government subsidiary, such as.Qantas Empir e Airways or British Commonwealth Pacific Airways, but no provision is made in the bill to give to Trans-Australia Airlines a similar privilege in respect of the hire, or purchase, of aircraft from subsidiary companies of the shipping combines that constitute Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited. This measure, as the Leader of the Opposition ( D r . Evatt) has so ably pointed out, is completely one-sided. Under the proposed agreement Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited is to be relieved of the obligation to pay the sum of £679,000 in respect of air route charges, which that company became indebted to pay during the period of five years ended the 30th June last. Trans-Australia Airlines has paid regularly during that period. Litigation against Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited for the recovery of that sum for air route charges in respect of which the company has defaulted, was commenced in 1947, but it has not been proceeded with since the present Government assumed office. It would be interesting to learn why Survival members of the Liberal Party are showing such great compassion and tender feeling for Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited.

I have said enough to indicate that the bill deserves much more careful consideration than can be given to it in this Parliament. I agree with the honourable member for Fremantle that a royal commission should be appointed to examine all aspects of the agreement to which the bill refers. The full implications of the document cannot be brought to light in the course of a debate in this chamber. Therefore, the agreement should be carefully studied by some competent authority with power to call witnesses and demand, if necessary, the presentation of bank accounts of persons and organizations. A searching public inquiry should be made into the affairs of Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited, which, up to date, has refused to make information about its financial transactions available to the public.

It will withdraw from the wealthy shipping companies, which have refused to disclose their financial affairs or even to state whether they have earned profits or sustained losses, the concessions that will be given to their airline company under the terms of this bill. Trans-Australia Airlines will then once again be able to operate profitably and to continue to provide safe and efficient transzations and pass the machines to their port for the people of this great country. Mr FA1HHALL (Paterson) r/8.52] If ever we witnessed a demonstration of the Russian propaganda technique, we did so in this House earlier to-day, when the Leader of-the Opposition (Dr. Evatt) accused his opponents of his own crime. The right honourable gentleman has complained because a statutory corporation is to be made to obey the behest of the Government. Plainly, the Australian National Airlines Commission was established as an instrument of socialism. The Labour Government at the time apparently hoped to hide behind the corporation and prevent its misdeeds from being rectified by a succeeding government. The Leader of the Opposition put a novel construction on the Government's proposal by suggesting that the taking of business from Trans-Australia Airlines would involve a denial of fair competition. In the circumstances, it is reasonable and proper for us to ask the right honourable gentleman whether the taking of business from Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited in the first placeI refer to the airmail business that was given to Trans-Australia Airlines on some arbitrary basis, which involved charges that were certainly in excess of the rates that would Airlines, which is not under attack. We have been fixed by means of open tender -wa s not, in fact, a denial of fair competition. The Leader of the Opposition based a great deal of his criticism of the proposal on clause 8 of the agreement, which provides that neither the Australian National Airlines Commission nor Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited shall purchase aircraft without obtaining a certificate from the chairman to be appointed under the agreement. He declared that this would hamstring Trans-Australia Airlines. But he knews well that the Government has interests in Qantas Empire Airways Limited and British Commonwealth Pacific Airlines. We may reasonably judge the Labour party by its behaviour when it was in office, and we have every reason to believe, therefore, that a future Labour government would not hesitate to buy aircraft through either of the organicousin, Trans-Australia Airlines, to the detriment of Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited. Thus, if the provisions of clause 8 were not included in the agreement, the whole purpose of this measure might be defeated. I pass lightly over the shedding of crocodile tears by members of the Opposition who have lamented the fact that organizations like ButlerA i r Transport Proprietary Limited and Ansett Airways Proprietary Limited will be denied entry to the field in which Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited and Trans-Australia Airlines operate. The whole purpose of the Labour Government's action in establishing the Australian National Airlines Commission was to prevent any private company from continuing to operate interstate air transport services. I support the bill because it will maintain competition. I believe in competition, and I have no apology to offer for my statement that I should prefer to have seen competition in the field of interstate aviation between two privately owned companies. However, we must accept the facts as we find them, and I pay tribute to the quality and efficiency of the -service given by Trans-Australia may be thankful for the constitutional limitations that prevent Trans-Australia Airlines from establishing a national monopoly of civil aviation. Rather than such a monopoly, I should prefer to have one corporation with 51 per cent, of its shares owned by the Government. The interests of the owners of Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited, whoever they may be, must be preserved. This Government has a responsibility to those who have subscribed the millions of pounds of capital in that organization. Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited was developed with the aid of private capital. The source of that capital is of no concern to us. It is not a crime for anybody to invest capital in an enterprise in Australia, except, of course, in the view of honourable members opposite. Trans-Australia Airlines was established for the purpose of eliminating competition and establishing a monopoly. That fact was made clear by the honourable member for Maribyrnong ( Mr Drakeford ) when, as Minister for C i v i l Aviation, he introduced the measure under which the Australian National Airlines Commission and Trans-Australia Airlines were established, with the following words:In introducing this measure for the nationalis at the present time or wil l be in the ization of interstate airlines . Of course, there was no reason for us to be astonished by the Labour Government's action. The policy of the Labour party always has been to introduce complete socialization. This Government gladly accepts the responsibility to ensure that the reward of the initiative and courage of private enterprise in developing air communications in Australia shall not be extinction by a government corporation backed by all the resources of the nation and aided by a perversion of administrative responsibility in the hands of a government hostile to private enterprise. This agreement represents an attempt to equalize competition Airlines, the government undertaking, and Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited, the privately owned organization. It provides that the two organizations shall share airmail business and other government business and that finance shall.be made available through government channels, or with a government guarantee, to Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited for the purchase of heavy flying equipment. I remind my complaining friends opposite that there is a need for the Government to make such financial provision only because the confidence of private investors has been undermined by persistent Labour attacks. I do not believe that equitable competition between a government organization and a private organization in the same field is possible. The Government now proposes that the Australian National Airlines Commission shall pay taxes. This is an empty gesture, in fact, but at least it will give us an opportunity to compare, on something like equal terms, the economic results of the operations of the two organizations. An y suggestion that the> two services will be brought into equaF competition by that device would be a« mere fiction. It is not necessary for Trans-Australia Airlines to show any profit upon the capital invested in it. We know that the Treasury w ill meet any deficit that it may sustain. Therefore, there is no penalty for inefficiency in the operation of Trans-Australia A i r lines. I do not intend to imply that there future inefficiency in that organization. I pointed out a moment ago that Trans-Australia Airlines is not under attack in this bill. But it must be realized that a loss incurred by private enterprise in any field of endeavour is a guarantee that investors will deny it further accretions of capital. That circumstance alone in d icates the colossal gulf that separates a; government organization from a private organization in the field of airline operations. The Labour party suggests that the Commonwealth, having established Trans-Australia Airlines, is obliged to protect its own undertaking, because it is responbetween Trans-Australia sible for the expenditure of public money. I suggest that a greater responsibility rests upon the Parliament. It is a responsibility to protect the principle of impartial government. That principle is always in great danger when a government goes into business in this way. Trans-Australia Airlines is not to be destroyed. It w ill not be destroyed unless it cannot meet the fairest possible competition that this Government can ensure. P a i r competition is a hazard that private entrepreneurs are always willing to face. The aim of the Labour party is to destroy private enterprise in the airlines field by the power and patronage of a government. Labour knows very well that private enterprise does not flourish except in an atmosphere of confidenceconfidence that it will be able to carry on its business in a f a i r field with no favour, and that it will not be plagued from month to month or from year to year by doubts about the whim of some government that is unfavorable to it. The honourable member for Parkes( Mr Haylen) said that the airlines industry is a big capital industry and, therefore, is suitable only for conduct by governments, because only governments have access to the capital required. 1 remind the honourable gentleman that the ability of private enterprise to secure the considerable volume of capital that is required for the operation of airlines has been destroyed by the threats of the Labour party. Those threats have been made not only in this field. During the last week, the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company Limited, which is prepared to expend £50,000,000 or £60,000,000 upon developmental work in this country, has been threatened with a virtual expropriation of a half of its capital investment. What confidence can investors in this country have when there is any prospect that a Labour government will be in office? The members of the Labour party, having destroyed the confidence of investors, say, as socialists always do, that private enterprise has failed, and, therefore, that the government must step in. The honourable member for Parkes said also that the aim of private enterprise is to make profits. There is nothing very criminal about that. I suggest to my friends opposite that if there is one thing that this country needs more than anything else, it is large accretions of investsqueeze. ment capital. Since we are either unwilling or unable to produce that capital ourselves, we must look for it overseas. It must come either from private investment or from the pockets of the taxpayers. Let honourable gentlemen opposite ask the taxpayers which course they would prefer the Government to adopt. I ask my Labour friends also to bear in mind that SO per cent, of the employment in this country is maintained by private investment. For every job in industry in Australia, somebody in private enterprise has invested £800. For every job in this country, £800 has been invested in plant, land, buildings, tools and so on. If we want an expanding economy to Mr Fairhall. take up the unemployment which is the hobby horse of honourable gentlemen opposite, we must have more private investment in business. If the members of the Opposition study this matter a little further, they will find that it is no accident that wages are highest and conditions are best where capital investment is high. Nor is it an accident that capital investment is higher where profit is higher. If my friends opposite want to study facts, let theni look at the output of some industries in America, where wages, capital investment and profits are high. Becau-v of those factors, and owing to the operation of capitalism in a market that permits adequate profits to be made, thAmerican economy is supporting a half of the world. It is Labour's continued attack upon private investment and the returns from that investment which constitutes the real attack upon the public interest. This agreement is an unfortunate compromise. Nobody says that it is perfect, but, having regard to the very difficult position in which the Government was placed, it was the best solution of the problem that could be found. It will be profitable to draw some conclusions from the position with which the agreement attempts to deal. It is a plain warning t j the people that a government does not need to pass a law to crush private competitors, but needs only to use a government enterprise, backed by the resources of the Commonwealth, and to practise a little unscrupulous use of administrative power to complete the economic The late Herr Hitler, of unhappy memory, had a perfect recipe for the destruction of private enterprise. He called it economic annihilation. He applied the same kind of squeeze as that which, but for a High Court decision, the Labour party would have applied to privately owned airlines in this country. The circumstances that have made the agreement necessary are a plain warning to the people of this country, who voted out socialism in 1949, that, despite a certain amount of washing of hands after the general election of that year, social ism remains the platform of the Labour party. The honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell), who is playing a waiting game for the leadership of his party, has made no bones about the fact that his belief is that broadcasting, insurance, banking socialized. That is a warning which the people of this country should keep well in mind. The position in which the Government found itself in relation to these two airmatter that will be looked at carefully lines demanded' this agreement. demand arose only because of the dangers that are inherent in government participation in business enterprises. Nc Liberal government could stand aside and see a private enterprise wantonly destroyed in the pursuit of socialist policy. Of course, we have some reservations about the provisions of the agreement. We know very well that, if this Government tries to protect its legislation by a long-term agreement, it will evoke, as it did this afternoon, the threat ship of the Australian Labour party gave that another government wil l attempt to upset the agreement. This battle may inflict some deep wounds on the institution of .parliamentary democracy. But, finally, the decision of this matter will rest upon the good sense of the Australian electors. They will have to make up their minds whether we shall have in this country a socialist police state or a demoquestion has to be determined ultimately cratic free enterprise economy. I repeat that the bill does not represent an attack upon Trans-Australia Airlines. Nothing is to be destroyed, except, perhaps, the policy of economic annihilation, which the Labour party has instituted in connection with Australian National Airlines Proprietary Limited. Labour has talked about selling the people's assets. D i d the people of this country ever demand that money should be taken from their pockets by taxation and invested in an airline? The capital for Trans-Australia Airlines came from the pockets of the taxpayers, as will the additional moneys that the organization will require to enable it to remain in this field in competition with private organizations. The charge has been made that we have no mandate for what we are doing at the present time. Let anybody search the records as diligently as he like?, but he will find no shred of a manwealth has participated over the years date for the establishment of Trans-Australia Airlinesi n 1945. If the Labour party were entitled at that time, under the general powers of a government, to establish Trans-Australia Airlines, this Government is equally entitled to take and transport should be this step to protect a private enterprise that pioneered air services in this country. The Labour party, in opposition, tries to prevent the passage of this measure by empty threats. I suggest that this is a The by the electors at the next general election. looked at it recently. can use the result of the Flinders by-election in an attempt to justif y almost anything, but nothing w ill alter the fact that this Government is charged with a responsibility to introduce impartial legislation, and to correct a wretched situation to which the intense partisanrise. The Government accepts that responsibility gladly. I remember that, quite recently, the honourable member for Watson( Mr Curtin) said in this chamber that the Labour party is pledged to run Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited out of the air, purely in pursuit of a socialistic policy. If this on the basis of socialism versus democracy, I have every confidence' that the Australian people will know where their best interests lie. honourable member for Patterson ( Mr. Fairhall) talked a great deal about capitalistic investment in private companies, but he omitted to state why, in his view, the Parliament should agree to this bill. He side-stepped the main features of the agreement. W i l d statements about Labour and socialism will not hide the faults of the measure. I oppose the bill. I think it is the most outrageous piece of legislation that has yet been introduced by this Government. It is one of a series of bills, each of which was a little worse than the previous one. I remind the House that quite a number of the business organizations in which the Commonwere not purchased or established by Labour governments.

223,Mr Bkyson (Wills ) [9.12],"Th eLimited were not purchased by a Labour government, but we have been told that those investments by the Commonwealth represent the worse form of socialism and that, by them, the Labour party hopes to be able to control the whole of the industrial and commercial life of this community. A Labour government was not responsible for the purchase by the Commonwealth of 51 per cent, of the shares of Amalgamated Limited and 51 per cent, of the shares in Commonwealth Oil Refineries Limited, but a Labour government was responsible for the establishment of Trans-Australia Airlines. In the case of Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited, the Australian people will get something back after the sell-out, because the shares owned by the Commonwealth have been sold at a fairly reasonable price. The taxpayers of Australia will also get something back from their investment in Commonwealth Oil Refineries Limited. But in relation to Trans-Australia Airlines, which was established by the Labour party, this Government has adopted the policy, not of selling'the undertaking to private enterprise, but of strangling it slowly. The actual effect of the agreement will be that Trans-Australia Airlines, as we know it now, will bo slowly done to death. The agreement will prevent the development of that airline and transfer the business that it now carries on successfully to a private company which is owned by a shipping monopoly whose only interest in airlines is the profit that it can make out of them. Instead of the taxpayers getting back their capital, which has been invested in Trans-Australia Airlines, all of it will be lost. Honourable members opposite have told us all sorts of fancy stories about this matter. It is significant, as the honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr Clyde Cameron) pointed out, that the measure was introduced by, and is in charge of, the second most junior Minister of the Government. Not one Minister has yet risen to defend the bill or explain why it was introduced. Evidently the senior members of the Government have run for cover, and have left the job of endeavouring to convince this House and the people that the agreement is fair to young, inexperienced backSlr. Bryson. benchers of the Liberal party who are babes in politics, and do not understand the political situation, but who have been taught a few little lessons about the evils of socialism and now come here like parrots and repeat the lessons able gentleman may not use such terms. Parrots or birds of paradise or any other ornithological species have nothing to do Wireless (Australasia) with the measure. "" parrots "". I shall leave birds out of the matter, but I remind you, Mr Speaker, that the speeches of the Government backbenchers to-day have all had a similar ling. To listen to them was like listening to a gramophone record being played again and again. In fact, the honourable member for Forrest( Mr Freeth) sounded as if the record had become cracked, and the needle were repeatedly jumping back to the same place, because he reiterated the same phrases over and over. We have heard from honourable members opposite the argument about fair competition. I shall use the Minister's own figures to make a point in relation to that matter. He made the following statement :By .194.4-45 the passenger miles then heing flown on regular routes were approximately 130,000,000. B y June, 194G, this figure had increased to 228,000,000 passenger miles. I remind the House that not all of those passenger miles were flown by Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited, but were flown by other companies also, as the Minister's statement later made clear. He said that by the 30th June, 1952, the number of passenger miles flown annually had increased to 756,000,000. Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited had an equal opportunity with Trans-Australia Airlines to capture the additional traffic available. The Minister's statement that in the year ended the 30th June last Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited had flown 277,000,000 passenger miles, whilst Trans-Australia Airlines had flown 320,000,000 passenger miles, means that airlines other than Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited and Trans-Australia Airlines flew about 105,000,000 passenger miles in that year. So whilst small companies such as Ansett Airways",65,Opposition Members H E A R Hear

225,Mr Bryson,"I withdraw the termProprietary Limited, Butler Airways Limited and MacRobertson's Airways Limited were able to increase the number of passenger miles that they flew, Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited achieved only a small improvement. In seeking a reason for that fact we are justified in asking whether Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited is being operated on such good business lines as is Trans-Australia A i r lines or Ansett Airways Proprietary Limited, or any of the other small companies that are not coining cap in hand to the Government to ask for agreements or financial assistance to enable them to carry on. Mr CJ'-ATCEY -The shipping companies -do not own those other companies. appears to me that the shipping companies are not good airline operators, and their airlines cannot stand up to competition. available to any airline operator, and the operators who got the business offering were those that could offer the most attractive service to customers. Trans-Australia Airlines was able to provide a better service than was Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited, and so it obtained most of the business That was available. Probably most honourable, members know that many big business boycotted Trans-Australia Airlines for .a number of years, and it is possible that a number of them is still adhering to such a policy. I have met individuals connected with big industrial organizations who have informed me time after time that they would prefer to travel interstate by Trans-Australia A i r ways Proprietary Limited was necessary lines, but that their firms have instructed them to travel by the aircraft of Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited or else go by train. industrial organizations have boycotted Trans-Australia Airlines in relation to the carriage of freight. In the not very distant past I found that on certain days of the week copies of the Melbourne Herald were obtainable in the Parliamentary Library by about 7 p.m. on the day of issue, hut on other days they were not available, and could not be obtained until the following morning. I sought the reason for this anomaly and discovered that copies of the paper were available in the Library on days on which Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited had operated an afternoon service to Canberraf r o m M e l bourne, but on days when that company was not operating such a service, although Trans-Australia Airlines was operating one, copies of the Melbourne Herald were not delivered in Canberra. The reason was that the Melbourne Herald was one of the firms that were boycotting Trans-Australia Airlines. So there has been a great deal of unfair competition which has been directed against Trans-Australia Airlines and not against Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited. W it h that form T h a t is so. It of unfair competition operating in its favour Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited could have captured plenty of new business if it had been Increased business was operating in a business like manner, and Trans-Australia Airlines, and not Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited, would now have been languishing, and there would have been no argument about the carriage of interstate mails by air, because that business would only be a small part of the additional business that Australian NationalA i r ways Proprietary Limited could have obtained by efficient methods. It is organizations in Australia because Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited has definitely failed as an airline operator that it was not able to capture additional business. The figures that I have cited are staggering. They show not only that the establishment of another major airline company in addition to Australian NationalA i r to meet the existing demand, but that some airline operators require to smarten up their business methods. Trans-AusMany tralia Airlines delivered the goods and has done its job successfully despite its having had to face the most unfair competition. The Government is now prepared to jettison it simply because it has succeeded and has become one of the most efficient business organizations in Australia, in order to ensure that a company owned by private interests, most of which operate from outside Australia,",66,Opposition Members H E A R Hear
226,Mr Bryson,"shall make increased profits. So as to produce that result the Government asks us to authorize an agreement whereby the taxpayers will subsidize this private company to a greater degree than ever before. M -J. BOWDEN so in order that the company will be able to make profits to pay to overseas shareholders who are raking off much larger profits at present than they are entitled to. The honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr Bowden) has interjected to the effect that no subsidies have been paid. I do not know whether it is worthwhile to explain the situation to him, because I do not think he is capable of understanding an explanation. I shall point out to him something that is known to all other honourable members, which is that between 1936 and 1945 Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited received the equivalent of more than £2,000,000 in subsidies from the Government. to explain the matter to the honourable gentleman, because he has heard it explained in this House many times in the past, and if it has not registered before it will not register now. We have heard a great deal from the other side of the chamber about the unfair tactics of socialist governments in relation to air travel in this country. Let us examine the provisions in this agreement for financial assistance by the Government to Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited. We are told that wr> must enter into this agreement to ensure f a i r competition and efficient airline services and so that the companies will be able to compete f a i r ly against each other. But what do we find? The first proposal in the agreement is for the Government to guarantee a Commonwealth Pank overdraft of £3,000,000 to Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited in order to enable that company to buy new aircraft. I suggest that every other company in this country has required 'additional capital in recent years. organizations have increased their capital in recent years, in some instances by two or three times, but I have no recollection of any trading concern having come to the Government, cap in hand, and asked it to guarantee an overdraft. As the honourable member for Paterson( Mr. No t a penny! Fairhall) has said, they obtained the money they needed from private investors. I mention, incidentally, that we have seen private transport services competing against the State railway systems, without asking for Government assistance. They found the necessary capital for themselves. Every other kind of business organization that has required additional capital has obtained it from private investors. W h y , then, should this company, which is owned by some of the biggest shipping combines in the world, that have capital to burn and are making millions of pounds of profit every year from shipping and other activities, come cap in hand and ask the Government to guarantee an overdraft of £3 000,000 so that it can buy half a dozen new aircraft in order to compete against the Government's airline? That is, in effect, what is being done. This generous Government says, "" We shall lend you £3,000,000. If Trans-Australia Airlines buys more than £3,000,000 worth of new equipment, we shall lend you an additional £1,000,000, and you need not begin to repay it until after the expiration of ten years. We shall also reduce your ground charges, although Trans-Australia A i r lines has been able to pay the f u l l amount and show a profit on its operations"". According to the scanty information given to the House, I find that in the last couple of years Australian NationalA i r ways Proprietary Limited has refused to pay ground charges amounting to between £800,000 and £900,000, and has shown a loss on its operations in that period. Because of those factors, the Government now says, "" If you will pay one third of the amount you owe, we shall not ask you to pay the other two-thirds, and shall enter into an agreement with you so that, in future, regardless of what it costs to provide the necessary equipment and services for the operation of your aircraft, we shall charge you only 50 per cent, of the existing charges"".

The Government claims that it desires to strengthen Australian NationalA i r ways Proprietary Limited by reducing its costs and lending it money so that it wil l be able to compete successfully with Trans-Australia Airlines. Clause7 of the agreement relates to the rationalization of air services. What is meant by that proposal? Services will be rationalized in such a way that competition between Australian ' National Airways Proprietary Limited and Trans-Australia Airlines will be abolished. One suggestion which has been made is that it is uneconomical for Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited and Trans-Australia Airlines to send planes from say, Melbourne to Syduey, or from Melbourne to Perth, at approximately the same hour. rationalization of services is that if Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited despatches a plane at S a.m. f r om Melbourne to Sydney, Trans-Australia Airlines will despatch its aircraft at 11 a.m. or noon, so that one service will not compete against the other, and each aircraft will have a f u l l complement of passengers. rationalization, the traffic will be divided beween the Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited and Trans-Australia Airlines. This week, Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited w ill make all the daylight flights, and Trans-Australia Airlines will make all the night flights.

If he wishes to leave Melbourne at 8 a.m. next Thursday, he may have to travel by the Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited service. Clause8 of the agreement relates to the hire or purchase of aircraft. If the Trans-Australia Airlines service becomes more popular with the public than the Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited service, despite all the restrictions that will be placed upon it, and Trans-Australia Airlines desires to buy a new aircraft, the Government is prepared to lend any amount up to £1,000,000 to Australian National Airways Proprietary Limitedi n order to enable that organization to purchase a similar aircraft. In that way, Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited will be saved from slipping too f a r behind Trans-Australia Airlines.

It is quite a possibility that if the Government succeeds in selling those ships, we shall see them under the Japanese flag successf u l l y competing for business on the Australian coast a couple of years later. We must take precautions against such a happening. This Government is definitely setting out to destroy the assets of the people. I use that phrase deliberately, because the young and inexperienced honourable member for Forrest thought he was very clever in asking what are the assets of the people. have pleasure in informing him that Trans-Australia Airlines, the Postal Department and the Commonwealth shipping line are assets of the people. While those assets are owned by the people, they will be controlled and conducted in the interests of the people, and not in the interests of a small body of capitalist monopolists, such as the small group of shipowners who now control Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited. I, as a representative of a section of the people, will do my best at all times to ensure that the assets of the people shall be protected, and that the people shall obtain the f u l l value of them. If the proposed agreement in this bill comes into operation, it w ill be only a short time before the shipping combine will control all air services in Australia. When that combine has complete control over Australian air services, as it has succeeded in gaining control of the shipping around the Australian coast, we shall find that a valuable asset of the people has gone, and that an individual who wants to travel by air or send freight by air will be ""bled w h it e "" by excessive charges. The first and only consideration of the combine will be bigger and better profits for its shareholders. If the young member for could remember what happened in 1924 and 1925, he would have a knowledge of our experience with the Commonwealth those days. ment purchased a number of vessels, which performed a fine service for the people, particularly Mr Bryson. In competition with private enterprise, the Australian Commonwealth Line of Steamers kept fares and freights down. Eventually, an anti-Labour government sold those ships for a fraction of what they were worth. The government received about one-half of the purchase price, and the balance of the money has not yet been paid. The honourable member for Forrest should study what happened in those days, because many of his constituents are primary producers. As( Mr Freeth) soon as the Bruce-Page Government sold the Commonwealth-owned ships, in the I late 1920's, private shipping companies increased the freight on wheat carried between Australia and England by from 25 per cent, to 35 per cent., and the freight on wool by more than 25 per cent. If the Commonwealth-owned ships arc again sacrificed by an anti-Labour government the primary producers, whose alleged representatives are present in this chamber honourable member to bring his remarks somewhere within the scope of the bill. alleged representatives of the primary producers advocate the giving away of Trans-Australia Airlines. If this Government disposes of the Commonwealth owned ships, the primary producers will be the first to suffer. I am not making a prophesy. I have merely been giving the honourable member for Forrest a brief lesson in Australian history, which he failed to learn in the past. Unless the Parliament rejects the proposed agreement, the successful government-controlled airline will pass into the hands of a combine. I oppose this bill with all my strength.

235,Line Of Steamers In Mr Fairbairn (Farrer) [9.43],"opinion, he should get in touch with his colleagues in the State Governments of New South Wales and Queensland, because they have sold, or are in the process of selling, many things which the honourable member would call the "" assets of the people"". T need only mention that the New South Wales Government has found it necessary to sell the State brickworks, and proposes to allow private enterprise to rebuild the Hotel Kosciusko, which was destroyed by fire. In other words, the Labour Government in New South Wales believes that such concerns can be conducted more efficiently by private enterprise than by a government. undertakings hitherto conducted by the States are being sold, because socialist enterprise has been quite incapable of running them efficiently. But this Government is not selling the assets of the people. It is protecting the assets of the people, and is selling socialism. The honourable member for Wills has complained that the Government is relying on its supporters on the back benches, instead of on Ministers, to carry on this debate. All I can say is that if the Opposition members who have spoken so far are to be regarded as the big guns of the Labour party, the calibre of later speakers will be pretty small. The honourable member for Wills, in company with other Opposition speakers, considers that Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited has failed as an airline operator. The honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr Clyde Cameron) believes that Australian NationalA i r ways Proprietary Limited should get new business only if it can provide more cheaply a service similar to that now conducted by Trans-Australia Airlines. I know that the honourable member for Hindmarsh has a particular interest in aircraft. According to him, you get into the aircraft at Parafield, take six dramamine tablets and become violently ill , and leave the plane at Canberra. He should realize that there is more than that to the operation of an airline. He has said that Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited is not operating its services as cheaply as is Trans-Australia Airlines. If he will examine the figures, he will find that his statement is incorrect. I think I can show that in almost every case Government produce the document? honourable member for Maribyrnong produce the document in 1945, when he was the Minister for A i r ? produce it. Prime Minister, Mr Forde, was asked to produce the document. It is a fine Various distinction. Every increase of fares and freights that has occurred in recent times has been brought about by Trans-Australia Airlines. In 1945 Trans-Australia Airlines took over Guinea Airways which operated an air service fro m Adelaide to Darwin. That air service was taken over by the simple process of refusing to renew Hs licence and offering to buy it. Within three months of that action the fares on the Adelaide-Darwin route were increased by 50 per cent. I now refer honourable members to a report that was tabled in this House to-day and which indicates that the fares of airline operators were put up by 15 per cent. The honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr Clyde Cameron) asked why Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited did not charge less for its services. Honourable members should know that airline companies are not allowed to charge less than the fixed amount. If honourable members will read the report about airlines operations during last year they will discover that T rans-Australia Airlines made representation for an increase of 15 per cent, in their charges a considerable time before Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited agreed to that rise. The report readsAt the beginning of the financial year, costs had already risen so greatly beyond the levels on which the tariffs then existing were based that an early increase in fares of 15 per cent, was fully justified in order to maintain profitable trading conditions. The matter was discussed with the other major operator in Jul'V 1051 and it was obvious that the impact of rising costs was felt similarly by the Airline. However, agreement fn adjust the fare structure by 15 per cent, was not reached until A p r i l , 1952.",70,Opposition Members H E A R Hear

239,Mr Fairbaien,"The DeputyTherefore, far from Trans-Australia Airlines assisting the public by maintaining cheaper services, it is rather the private airlines that are trying their utmost to keep fares down. They are doing so because they know that they will only get the business necessary to keep them going if they can give the public the service they require at a price that will compete with the fares charged, not only by Trans-Australia Airlines, but also by all forms of rail, road, and sea transport. The Opposition has made great play about what it has called the Government's attempt to undermine Trans-Australia Airlines. The one thought in the minds of honourable members opposite seems to be that at all costs the general good of the Government airline should be maintained and that the good of the general public does not need to be considered. When this Government assumed office, it could have done several things. It could have taken no action at all about airlines, in which case it was certain that Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited would have been forced out of operation and Australia would have been left with one airline which could have charged whatever viso that it would still have been competing with road and rail transport and would therefore have had to charge economic fares. However, the Government decided that it would be far better to maintain competition between our two big airlines. The Government could have amalgamated Trans-Australia Airlines and Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited into one large company, but decided against doing so. The Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt) said to-day that the Government had no mandate for the action proposed in the bill. I refer him to the joint policy speech by the Government parties that was delivered before the general election in 1949. On. other occasions copies of this speech have been very evident among honourable members opposite, but to-day they have been conspicuous by their absence. In the ioint policy speech the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) saidAs for the Government airlines, which were Another means used by the Opposition to designed by the Chifley Government to bring monopolies (and failed to be so only because J f r . Fairbairn. of a High Court decision) we shall put them on a true competitive basis with no preferences either in cheap capital or dollar expenditure. The intention of the Labour party was perfectly obvious. It wanted to arrange for complete nationalization of our airways, and when it failed to do so becauss of the H i g h Court, it attempted to do so by other and more subtle means. The means that it adopted was to give all airmail business to Trans-Australia Airlines. When the honourable member for M a r i byrnong ( Mr Drakeford) was introducing the Australian National AirlinesB ill in 1945, he claimed that the amount that was then being paid to Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited to carry airmail was about 50 per cent, more than what it cost to carry the mail. At tliat time he saidIt can be demonstrated that nil payments for the carriage of mails on a poundage basis at present rates constitute a subsidy of at least 50 per cent, of the payment that is made. At that time Australian NationalA i r ways Proprietary Limited was being paid .025d. per lb. a mile. Its total payment for the carriage of airmail was £155,000 a year. Now, the charge which we were told was 50 per cent, too high, is it liked, with the propaid to Trans-Australia Airlines, and it has increased to .06d. per lb. a mile, and brings in £600,000 to Trans-Australia Airlines. on that matter, but I do suggest that this sum is a direct subsidy to Trans-Australia Airlines, which makes it impossible fo"" Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited to compete with that organization. The Government intends to divide that amount almost evenly between the two major airlines, and I ask the Minister for the A r my ( Mr Francis), who is at present at the table, to tell the House how much of that money has already been paid. I have been informed that sonic time ago Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited received a letter from the Prime Minister stating that mail business would be given to that company immediately, but so far T believe that very little has been so given. It is time that the promise was implemented. drive Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited out of the airline",71,Opposition Members H E A R Hear

241,Mr Fairbairn,"I stand correctedbusiness was to impose exorbitant landing charges. 1 would be the first to admit that we spend enormous sums of money on aerodrome construction and maintenance, and on other aircraft facilities. This year the cost of air f acilities will be more than £11,000,000. That sum will be made up of £4,000,000, which will be expended on works, the remainder being expended on maintenance and air facilities. Honourable members may consider that a proportion of that sum should be paid by Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited, and I believe that that company is quite prepared to assume responsibility for a proportion of it. Then the question arises, what should the proportion be? Australian NationalA i r ways Proprietary Limited has stated that since its inception in 1937 it has paid £3,780,000 in primage and duty on petrol alone, and also £3,000,000 in income tax, pay-roll tax, and other taxes.

Narrandera aerodrome should be an all weather landing field. Under this bill, Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited will be asked to bear a share of the cost of making the aerodrome into an all-weather field, even though it does not believe that such action is necessary. Another example which may be considered by the honourable member for Maribyrnong, is the case of the aerodrome at Warrnambool, in Victoria. About £100,000 is to be spent there on aerodrome construction. Warrnambool is close to Hamilton and in the event of the Warrnambool field not being serviceable, the Hamilton field could be used. Eventually, of course, the air service to Warrnambool w ill be put out of business by the Victorian railways, if that organization puts in an efficient diesel-electric service. The Victorian railways have already arranged a diesel-electric service to Benalla, and have put the competing air service out of business.

243,Mr Fairbaien,"Now we shall have to spend an enormous amount of money to construct a suitable aerodrome in Western Australia. It is time that we looked into the policy that causes the unnecessary expenditure of large amounts of money. I consider that the only work necessary at the Fairbairn aerodrome, at Canberra, is to increase the apron way, but it is intended to expend £40,000 on improvements. I recommend that the Government should obtain the services of a recognized expert on civil aviation, so that we shall be able to obtain the benefits of his experience about the building of aerodromes. In a country of this size we cannot expect that all our aerodromes will be permanent all-weather structures. When Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited was operating in the Kimberleys, it built an aerodrome for £100. That was the cost of grading two runways at right angles to each other. Yet that aerodrome was sufficiently serviceable for the company to carry 5,000 head of cattle from it in one year. We must abandon our policy of enormous expenditure, and we should invite a man of international standing, such as Dr. Plesman, of K.L.M., possibly the most eminent aviation expert in the world, to come here and advise us about aviation matters. should invite Air Vice-Marshal Bennett, who is an Australian and was operating the British-South American Airlines for some time, or some other eminent authority. came to Australia and showed us that only one of the 238 works proposed by the Department of Civil Aviation was unnecessary, the saving would pay for his services. If that were done we should have a sound policy. At present, Australian National Airways Limited is obliged to pay air route charges without being given any say in the expenditure of that revenue. The third method that the Labour Government used to fight Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited was to provide that Government business should be handled entirely by Trans-Australia Such a provision is unfair. Consequently, this Government proposes to give to holders of a Government warrant the option of travelling by either service. Sir. Fairbairn. Evidence is not wanting that many departmental officers are antipathetic to Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited. That attitude must be broken down. Indeed, Ministers could set an example in that respect by patronizing the organization which they really believe suits them better. Labour's fourth method in fighting against Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited was to make dollars available and to grant import licences to Trans-Australia Airlines whilst refusing such facilities to the private organization. Whilst the Labour Government financed the purchase ' of Convairs for Trans-Australia Airlines it refused to permit Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited to purchase additional aircraft from overseas. I have made is incorrect, I apologize; but I have been informed on good authority that when Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited sought a permit to purchase DC4's overseas the Labour Government rejected its request. That government also greatly assisted Trans-Australia. Airlines by relieving it of the obligation to pay income tax. Labour's attitude towards Australian National Alternatively, we Airways Proprietary Limited will be completely altered under this measure. The Labour Government in its fight against Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited adopted a policy under which If a person of that type Trans-Australia Airlines provided a service in areas in which services were already being provided by private companies and in which the traffic offering was not sufficient to warrant.the introduction of an additional service. In such instances, Trans-Australia Airlines said Proprietary to the private operators, in effect, "" We are going to knock you out"". happen ? the average person would prefer to travel by the more modern plane, Trans-AusAirlines. tralia Airlines placed a DC3 aircraft on a service from Townsville in competition with a service that was already being provided with a private company called Tacar.

Tor instance, Trans-Australia Airlines is listed in every telephone directory under the entry, "" Australian National Airlines Commission "". It is so listed in the directory for Canberra and for every other centre, but the fact is that the commission is in Melbourne and has no officers in any other city, or town. The idea in listing Trans-Australia Airlinesi n telephone directories in that way is to confuse people who might naturally assume that the number shown beside it is the number for Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited, which is commonly known as "" A . N . A . "" . I know that certain persons who intended to ring Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited have been confused by that entry and when they have asked, "" Is that A . N . A . ?"", have been answered in the affirmative. deceit. members opposite have made great play on the safety factor. My colleagues have dealt adequately with that aspect. Surely members of the Opposition realize thai no aircraft is permitted to take off unless it complies with the regulations which are enforced in respect of every aircraft. For instance, I should not be allowed to take off in my own aircraft with a load in excess of 2,000 lb., or if the centre of gravity of the aircraft were less than twelve inches or more than 21 inches from the leading edge of the mainplane. An airworthy certificate must be issued in respect of an aircraft before it is allowed to take ofF, and the regulations require that each aircraft shall he fitted with proper wireless equipment and shall not be overloaded. Obviously, no aircraft operator would be so foolish as to try to break the law. He realizes that he cannot afford to do so because of the risk that he may lose his licence. The Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt) is preventing Trans-Australia Airlines from continuing its pioneering work. That was a remarkable statement, because I have not been able to ascertain any instance in which that organization has done pioneering work except in providing u service to Corowa and a service to a few places in the Gulf country. The main pioneering work in civil aviation in this country has been done by private companies. Recently, Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited achieved one of the greatest pioneering feats in this sphere in any part of the world when it established the air beef service in the Northern Territory and Western Australia. Airways Proprietary Limited jumped in oil that service after the MaeRobertsonMiller Aviation Company Proprietary Limited bad pioneered it. National Airways Proprietary Limited is planning to extend that service to an enormous degree. That company intends to purchase in England Blackburn is deliberate freighters, which are capable of carrying loads of up to 26 tons, to replace the Yes . Honourable Bristol freightors which have a capacity of only 6 tons. That is the latest evidence of pioneering work on the part of Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited. Trans-Australia Airlines is not engaged in similar activity. The Leader of the Opposition, who is a lawyer, said that if and when the Australian Labour party is returned to office, it will immediately reverse this programme. I am not a. lawyer, but I have been informed that, legally, this agreement will remain binding upon any government that succeeds the present Government, just as it will remain binding upon Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited. RecentlyI made inquiries in respect of an agreement that related to a lease to which the Government was a party, and I was informed that Queen's Counsel had given the opinion that even if the present Government decided that the terms of the lease were unsatisfactory, it could not break the lease without the consent of the other party to it. I thoroughly agree said that this Government with the provisions of the hill, which I believe wil l be the means of giving to Australia an excellent standard of competition between our two existing major airline organizations.",74,Opposition Members H E A R Hear

251,Mr Fairbairn,"AustralianAustralian Labour party makes no apology whatsoever for saying that the present position of Trans-Australia Airlines should be maintained. members of the Australian Labour party have always advocated, and as far as possible, have implemented the principle that transport services should be publicly owned and controlled. We are not alone in holding that view. Eminent figures in other announcements in conformity with that principle. F o r instance, Viscount Bruce, when he visited Australian in 1947 saidThe apostles of private enterprise realise that there are certain activities-suc h as transport, electrical power, and ether vital serviceswhich should be controlled by the State on behalf of the people as a whole. No one would suggest that Viscount Bruce is a supporter of the Australian Labour party. Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) saidFew people would have any quarrel with government control of railways, or tramways, or water supply, or such other great public utilities. Therefore, members of the Australian Labour party are not alone in advocating that the present position of Trans-Australia. Airlines should be maintained. The object of this bill, which, of course, is sugar-coated, is ultimately to eliminate Trans-Australia Airlines. months past the future of this organization has been in the melting pot. Various propositions have been canvassed in public by interested parties which have utilized every conceivable method to attack Trans-Australia Airlines. Over a period of months, inspired articles were published in the newspapers with the object of implanting in the public mind the idea that there is no need for the existence of two major airlines. It is apparent that Government supporters in this chamber hold that view. A certain amount of kite flying was indulged in by these interested parties in order to learn the trend of public opinion on this matter. First, it was rumoured that sell Trans-Australia Airlines to private enterprise. As such a proposition would mean the establishment of a monopoly in civil aviation, the public reaction, which was instantaneous, was [10.8] -The adverse, and consequently the Government dropped that proposition as though it were a hot cake. The second proposition that was put forward was that The Trans-Australia Airlines and Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited should be amalgamated. That proposition also caused a public outcry because the general feeling, as it still is, was that it was difficult to see how the public in terest could be served by such a merger. political parties have made Everybody realized that Trans-Australia Airlines was operating successfully, and that the danger of a monopoly was inherent in such a proposition. Gallup polls showed conclusively that the public would not have anything to do with a merger. Even the newspapers, of which nine out of ten support this Government, opposed that proposition in no uncertain terms. F o r instance, editorials were published in Melbourne On the 24th July, 1943, the newspapers warning the Government that it would do a great disservice to the country if it brought about such an amalgamation. The Government was obliged to jettison that proposition. All the time, however, the Government has had at the back of its mind that, ultimately, it must dispose of Trans-Australia Airlines. Consequently, it has now introduced this bill under which it proposes, not to dispose of Trans-Australia Airlines, but to hamstring that organizaF o r many tion by handing over half of its governmental business to Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited. The Government's avowed objective is the destruction of Trans-Australia Airlines. It is all very well for Government supporters to sav that there is room for the two major airlines. I have no doubt that if the Government had been able to get its way in the first instance, it would have taken action to destroy Trans-Australia A i r lines, but desisted from doing so only because of the public outcry that was raised in protest against such a proposal. However, it is patent that the ultimate objective of this measure is to destroy the people's airline. I have not the slightest doubt that, should the present Gothe Government intended to vernment remain in power for four or five years longer, Trans-Australia A i r lines would cease to exist. Fortunately, that will not happen, because the people will certainly change their government",75,Opposition Members H E A R Hear
252,Mr Bird (Batman),"eighteen months hence, and the security of Trans-Australia Airlines will be assured. Trans-Australia Airlines was established six years ago in very difficult circumstances. As the honourable member for Wills( Mr Bryson) has said, an unofficial boycott was imposed upon it by many business houses, whose principals considered that the Government should not have entered the field of air transport. Scurrilous attacks were made on the organization, both inside and outside this Parliament. when the Australian National Airlines Commission decided to buy aircraft of a certain type, members of the anti-Labour opposition at the time declared that the machines were dangerous and would crash. Those machines have flown many millions of miles without accident. Members of the anti-Labour parties did everything possible to sabotage public confidence in the young airline. Nevertheless, Trans-Australia Airlines emerged triumphant from its trials, and to-day it enjoys the complete confidence of the people. No other commercial enterprise of that nature has achieved such a meteoric success in such a short space of time against such obstacles. The organization stands high in the public esteem. It is a shining example of a successful government enterprise, and it renders a service that is unsurpassed in Australia. This bill will stultify its future development, and will n u l l if y much of the good work that it has already done. The Government realized that it could not attack Trans-Australia Airlines on the ground that it usually selects for its condemnation of government enterprises. Its standard complaint, as we know, is that socialized enterprises do not make profits, and. therefore, must be sold to private enterprise. That argument does not apply to Trans-Australia Airlines. point of view, the organization that should be sold is Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited, which has not paid its way. The Government has decided to make a pretence of placing Trans-Australia A i r lines and Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited on a competitive basis. In fact, it intends to impose restrictions upon Trans-Australia Airlines for the deliberately calculated purpose of making its operations unprofitable. This is intended to be the first step towards its ultimate destruction. As soon as its operations are conducted at a loss, the way will be made clear for its sale to private enterprise. The main fault of Trans-Australia Airlines in the eyes of the Government and its supporters is that the organization has been too successful. Had it not been so sucessful, it would not have become the target for the attacks of F o r example, Government supporters to-day. Its success has aroused envy and jealousy amongst Government supporters. They do not like successful government enterprises, which confound the principles that they have espoused for the benefit of vested interests. The confidence of the people in their own airline organization is undoubted. The volume of passenger traffic handled by Trans-Australia A i r lines is the best barometer of public confidence. B y that standard, it is forging f a r ahead of Australian NationalA i r ways Proprietary Limited. Because it enjoys the confidence of the people, the Government has deliberately planned a surreptitious and furtive method of assassination. The Minister acting for the Minister for C i v i l Aviation engaged in specious reasoning in his second reading speech. He referred to the straitened financial circumstances of Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited, and said that the company had to be fortified by a government guarantee. The Labour party has legitimate reasons for its opposition to that contention. The proposition is most unbusinesslike. It is ridiculous for a so-called business government to suggest that 123 members of this House should pass judgment on the proposal without familiarizing themselves with the relevant facts. We have not F r o m that been able to ascertain the true financial position of Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited. Surely we are entitled to examine its balance-sheets before we are called upon to give our decision."" I doubt that the straitened circumstances of the company envisioned by Government supporters are a reality. A quick examination of the list of shareholders of the company, to which reference has been made by previous speakers, is sufficient to engender the gravest doubts on the subject. poverty-stricken organizations. consist of five affluent shipping companies, which have long waxed fat on the profits that they have won from the Australian people. They have paid large dividends to their shareholders consistently year after year. We may be pardoned, therefore, if we are sceptical of the Government's National Airways Proprietary Limited is in financial difficulties. dangerous precedent wil l be established by the Government if it guarantees the overdraft of Australian NationalA i r ways Proprietary Limited for a large sum. I submit that the company should be placed in exactly the same position of that of a man who applies to his bank manager for an overdraft. Such an applicant is required to explain his financial circumstances and to satisfy the manager that he wil l be able to repay the loan that he seeks within a specified neriod. He is subjected to a most searching inquiry. That is the proper procedure, bers of the Government and their colleagues agree with me on. that point because they constantly praise business like practices. However, they tell us that it is a different matter when the Parliament is asked to act in the role of bank manager to Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited. They say that we must not inquire into the company's financial circumstances before we agree to guarantee its overdraft. But we have every right to demand that the method of doing business that is followed by the Commonwealth Bank and the private banks be followed in this instance. The companies Australian National Airways Limited command an immense tion of capital. their resources aggregate. The total must be at least £30,000,000, although it is probable that they far exceed that amount. Surely these shipping companies could have provided an amount of £3,000,000 without calling for a government tee. The Government's proposal does not make sense, and it will not make sense to Mr Bird. the Australian people when they learn all the circumstances. It is the height of absurdity that the Government should Those shareholders are not assist the rival of Trans-Australia A i r They lines. I have been interested to hear the unusual arguments that some of the protiigonists of private enterprise in this House have employed in order to support the Government's plan. The bill represents a very poor compliment to private enterprise. Honourable members on the Government side of the House frequently suggestion that Australian tell us that the main qualities of private enterprise are a sturdy self-reliance and A very a wholesome independence. They say that business should sink or swim by its own efforts and should not be dependent upon government benevolence. But, in this instance, we are told that a private commercial enterprise cannot survive without government support. Therefore, I consider that the bill is a poor tribute to much-vaunted private enterprise. The position would be Gilbertian if it were not so serious. Gilbert never in his wildest flights of imagination envisaged such a ridiculous situation as will arise under this bill. If he were alive to-day, he would certainly conceive a comic opera that would surpass any of his previous and I know that memefforts. This Parliament will be recreant to its trust if it passes legislation that will weaken Trans-Australia Airlinesi n any way, because Trans-Australia. Airlines has the whole-hearted support of the people and the Parliament has a duty to them to ensure that this fine enterprise shall not be, strangled. The history of the organization records a steady process of expansion year after year in all phases of its activities. It enjoys the confidence of the airtravelling public. Last year the honourable member for Maribyrnong ( Mr. Drakeford) asked the Minister for C i v il that own shares in Aviation to disclose the percentage of Proprietary passengers to available seats carried by concentrathe aircraft of the three major airlines in Goodness knows what Australia. The Minister replied that the percentages were as follows:Per cent. Trans-Australia Airlines. . 70.9 Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited. . 02.1 Ansett Airways Proprietary L i m iguaranted . . . . fil Those figures show that Trans-Australia Airlines was more popular than were the two private companies. The details of passenger-miles flown by Trans-Australia Airlines aircraft, which other honourable -members have mentioned, prove that the government undertaking has a more satisfactory record than has Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited. Trans-Australia Airlines carried 670,000 paying passengers in 1951-52, which represented an increase of 9.9 per cent, over its total for the previous year. Those results have not been achieved merely by accident. They are due to overwhelming public confidence in Trans-Australia A i r lines. The organization has become an essential part of Australia's transport system. The Minister acting for the Minister Proprietary Limited received from the for C i v i l Aviation referred to seven prinGovernment ciples upon which the bill was based. I 3,368,000 lb. of airmails. In 1950-51, shall refer to each of those principles, Trans-Australia because the reasoning by which the Go£540,000 for carrying 5,694,000 lb. vernment seeks to support them is quaint, of to say the least. according to the Minister, is that every tralian National Airways Proprietary operator should be given a proper and Limited. I remind the House that in substantial share of air mail business. 1943-44 wages were lower than in 1950-51. Government supporters Trans-Australia Airlines is successful and petrol was much cheaper. In addition, that Australian National Airways Prothe network covered by Australian prietary Limited has been failing because National Airways Proprietary Limited all airline is carried by the government was much smaller than that eovered by airline. T point out that, during the last twelve months, the revenue earned by Trans-Australia Airlines from the carriage of airmails has represented only 7.2 per cent, of its total revenue. The expense of the Australian people, and was financial success of the company has been charging greedy prices.

Trans-Ausmate reason why the existing arrangement tralia Airlines is also a government in should not be altered, but the Governstrumentality, conducted in the interests ment, in its frenzied endeavours to do of the Australian people. Y e t it is to be the best that it can do for its friends, is treated savagely. H a l f of its airmail prepared to take a half of this lucrative contract is to be taken from it and given business fro m Trans-Australia Airlines to its rival. For seven years, Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited had a contract from the Government to carry airmails. On the termination of the contract, the Government had every right to give a fresh contract to another organization, if it so desired. In the business world, it frequently happens that one firm loses a contract and that the contract is given to another firm. The Government had a very good reason for giving the airmails contract to another organization. When the contract terminated, Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited was charging an exhorbitant price for the carriage of airmails. That is the main reason why it lost the contract. In 1943-44, Australian National Airways £7S3,000 for carrying Airlines received airmails. Trans-Australia AirThe first principle, lines charged less than did Ausdeclare that Operating costs were also lower, and Trans-Australia Airlines during the last four years. I repeat that the main reason why Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited lost the airmails contract was that it was profiteering at the and to give it to Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited, with the idea that, in three or four years, Trans-Australia Airlines will go out of business and the way will be open again for Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited to raise the charges for the carriage of airmails to the level that obtained in 1943-44. Unfortunately, in this proposal to share the carriage of airmails, the Government is actuated not by motives of common sense but by the motive of assisting Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited, regardless of the damage that may be inflicted upon Trans-Australia. Airlines in the process. The second principle stated by the dangerous for the Government to inauguMinister is that Government business rate this practice. It is quite clear that should be freely available to both airthe Government is determined to help its lines. I find it difficult to follow that friends in their campaign to smash line of argument. Surely a government Trans-Australia Airlines, regardless of should give its busines to its own airline. the methods used. Private enterprise, as far as possible, keeps business within its own ranks. If a firm has a subsidiary company, it gives Minister referred was that the level of airits business to its subsidiary whenever it route charges paid by airline operators is possible to do so. That is common should be substantially reduced. There sense and accepted business practice. is something humorous about that. AusTherefore, whenever possible, Governtralian National Airways Proprietary ment business should be given to Limited has not paid a brass farthing in Trans-Australia Airlines.

That is the prepared to do so. It is supposed to be a purpose of Australian National Airways law-abiding firm, but it connived to evade Proprietary Limited under present cirthe law. It said that it thought the law cumstances. It will utilize all possible was unconstitutional, and stated that it means and methods to achieve its purpose. was not prepared to pay air-route charges This is one method of doing so. The until that matter had been decided by the Government is not prepared openly to High Court. For some reason, the case assist Australian National Airways Prodid not come before the court. Apprietary Limited to force Trans-Australia parently, the Government kept it back.

It wanted to devise undertaking, it will say to the people that methods to assassinate the people's airthe undertaking must be abandoned. The third principle stated by the Minister is that each airline should be assisted financially to acquire new heavy flying equipment. That appears to be a most illogical approach to the problem. Why give financial assistance only to Australian National Airways Proprietary Mr liird. Limited? Why not assist all other private airlines? They have an equal right to assistance from the Government. They have no wealthy shipping companies to back them. On a basis of equity and justice, the Ansett company and other airlines have a far greater right to assistance from the Government than has Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited. My strongest objection to giving any financial assistance to Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited is that the biggest shareholders in the company are wealthy shipping interests. I must emphasize, even at the risk of being called to order for indulging in tedious repetition, that it is extremely The fourth principle to which the line. The honourable gentleman's time has expired. It is evident that members of the Opposition are endeavouring to give the impression that this bill is designed as an",76,Opposition Members H E A R Hear

254,Mr Davidson (Dawson) [10.40],"attack upon Trans-Australia Airlines. The honourable member for Batman( MrB i r d ) admitted that his statements that it was an attack upon Trans-Australia Airlines verged upon tedious repetition. I assure him that these statements were not only tedious but also entirely false. The reverse is the case. As that charge has been made, let me point out that Trans-Australia Airlines was established by a Labour government as a socialistic enterprise, for the purpose of smashing one of the pioneer aviation companies in Australia. There is no question about that. have admitted in this debate that that is so. They have gone as far as to say that, when they are returned to power, whenever that may be, they will reverse the action that the Government is taking to protect both companies, and will revert tc their original plan. It is a matter of history that that plan was frustrated. Nevertheless, the Chifley Government did not abandon its basic purpose that Trans-Australia Airlines should operate in such a way as gradually to force the other company out of business, and so enable it to achieve its socialistic objective, despite the ruling of lished. It has recognized the great serthe H i g h Court. I want to place upon record my opinion that Trans-Australia Airlines, as a result of the splendid work of its staff and management, has become a very successful enterprise, and must be continued in its present form. I know that that opinion is held strongly by honourable members on this side of the House. Therefore there is no foundation for the cheap sneers of honourable gentlemen opposite that the bill is designed to smash Trans-Australia Airlines. When Trans-Australia Airlines had been operating for some time, it became possible as a result of the very fine work of its staff and of the increasing demand for air services throufhout Australia, for the two major companies to operate side by side, to the great advantage of the people of Australia. In my opinion, as a result of the developinent of a second company, there was an improvement of air services. Having said that, I point out that the basis upon which Trans-Australia A i r lines was established remained unchanged. The intention of the Chifley Government was that ultimately Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited should be unable to continue in business. If this Government, which believes in fostering private enterprise and in f a i r competition, had permitted the present state of affairs to continue, it would, either directly or indirectly, have followed the policy of its predecessor. It is obvious that, in introducing this measure, the Government is acting in conformity with the policy upon which it was elected. If it had permitted a state of affairs to continue in which one company had an unfair advantage over the other, ultiHonorable gentlemen opposite mately Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited would have been forced out of business. The position that would have existed then would have been that for which the Chifley Government had planned. There would have been one big monopolistic airline in Australia. I have no hesitation in saying that monopolies of any kind, either private or governmental, are anathema to this Government. We will not tolerate the existence of either. In this measure, the Government has set out to rectify a state of affairs in which a monopoly, either government or private, would eventually have been estabvices to aviation in Australia that have been rendered by pioneer companies, foremost amongst which is Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited. The Government has said, in effect, that it will not tolerate any action that would mean that an organization such as Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited could be crushed as the result of government policy. Another purpose of the legislation is to preserve for the people of Australia the fine service that has been established by the management and staff of Trans-Australia Airlines. That is a brief summary of the objects of the legislation. The Opposition has criticized the Government's proposals. It seems to me that its criticism stems from the desire of honourable members opposite to prevent the people from realizing the real truth about this measure. It is the same kind of attempt as is often made by honourable members opposite to mislead the people about the real meaning of the Government's actions. The honourable member for Batman, in such tedious repetition as he himself referred to, charged us with having the avowed objective of smashing Trans-Australia Airlines. He said that the bill "" sowed the seeds of ultimate destruction of us examine some of the provisions of the bill, in order to ascertain the nature of the seeds and to judge whether or not they will have the result that the honourable member has forecast. The main provision of the agreement to which the bill is intended to give approval is that government business will be shared equally between the two major airline companies. That is to say, when members of the Parliament or Government employees travel by air, they shall have the right to select the service by which they will travel. Is there anything wrong with that proposal? After all, is it not right that members of the Parliament and public servants should be given the opportunity to choose how they shall travel? Why should they be instructed that they must travel by a particular air service? Honourable members opposite have had a lot to say about freedom of choice. The rule, previously in force, that members of the Parliament and government employees might not choose the air service by which they would fly, was nothing but a socialistic proposition and was directly opposed to the free choice of individuals. So that seed is obviously a very infertile one. The bill also provides that the carriage Trans-Australia Airlines and any other of mails shall be shared between the two air service that might later be included major airline companies, and it may be in a similar agreement. So there we have shared possibly with other companies in another most infertile seed! Finally, the the future. It is interesting to note that bill provides that Trans-Australia Airalthough the honourable member for lines is to pay taxes. That may be said Batman contended that those provisions to be a new departure, but, after all, was would have the effect of smashing Transit not a result of a provision of the Australia Airlines, almost in the next original arrangement that, although breath he said that the loss of airmail Trans-Australia Airlines did not actually business would mean nothing to pay taxes, all its profits went into the Trans-Australia Airlines, because it Consolidated Revenue Fund? Transrepresented only 7 per cent, of its total Australia Airlines might find it a relief business. According to that honourable to become a taxpayer rather than to pay member, while Trans-Australia Airlines all its profits into government revenue. will not be concerned about having its Those are the main provisions of the bill, mail-carrying activities cut in half, the which the Opposition regards as the seeds loss of that business will smash it. that the Government is sowing which will Another A'ery infertile seed! I turn now to route charges. After a Airlines. considerable investigation by a committee it was decided that, in the interests of the by the honourable member for Batman and Mr Davidson. development of civil aviation throughout Australia generally, and particularly in outlying areas, and in view of the increasing costs of operating air services, it was Trans-Australia Airlines"". Let reasonable for the Government to reduce route charges to give a fair opportunity not only to Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited, but also to Trans-Australia Airlines and other companies, to operate at a reasonable profit and so be able to develop in consonance with the i: creasing demand for air services. Mr Drakeford interjecting, Adermann) -Order! The honourable member for Maribyrnong ( Mr Drakeford) must remain silent. He is stating his ideas now quite explicitly. question. seeds which will apparently smash Trans-Australia Airlines! The Government's proposal to give financial assistance, first of all to Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited, to ensure that aircraft used in the service of the people shall be up-to-date, has aroused the criticism of the Opposition. I do not see that any charge can justly be levelled against any government that sets out to ensure the provision of the best possible services for the people. Eurthermore, this so-called seed is also available to result in the smashing of Trans-Australia. I believe I have shown the statements",80,Sentatives Agreement B I L L 1952

257,Mr Davidson,"Anothe r of the other honourable members opposite to be nothing but sheer balderdash. The honourable member for Batman has also contended that, as a result of the operation of Airlines cannot possibly succeed. He referred in one breath to the meteoric success of the airline, and in the next breath said that as a result of the operation of this measure that company must inevitably f a i l . The two statements do not seem to be consistent. If honorablp members opposite care to ask members of the staff of Trans-Australia Airlines whether they believe that Trans-Australia Airlines will f a i l as a result of this measure they will very soon find their minds disabused of that false idea, because my impression of the opinion of the members of the staff of Trans-Australia Airlines, many of whom I know, because I always travel by Trans-Australia A i r lines, is that there is no need to fear that which he was a supporter, because it made this measure will in any way affect the successful operation of the airline. They would also tell honourable members that they would not mind if any other company were to share the carriage of mails, or other government business, with Trans-Australia Airlines, because the^ are confident that their own initiative, capacity and efficiency will enable them to continue on their present successful course. I consider that the statements, made in this House for political purposes, in honour bound to observe. It is, therethat Trans-Australia Airlines must f a i l as a result of the operations of the measure, will be strongly resented by members of the staff of Trans-Australia Airlines. I suggest that honourable members opposite take opportunity to check my assertion when they next come into contact with members of that staff. The honourable member for Fremantle ( Mr Beazley) made other criticisms of the measure. He criticized the provision under which the Government, in his own words, will "" give a grant"" to Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited. thing that we proposed to "" g i v e "" that company an amount of £3,000,000. That statement is entirely incorrect. We thing to Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited. guaranteeing a loan to it to the amount of £3,000,000. A t the same time, themeasure contains certain provisions under which Trans-Australia Airlines might be this measure, Trans-Australia placed in a similar position should the necessity arise. The honourable member also said that it was scandalous for the Government to propose a long-term agreement. Apart from the fact that it is perfectly obvious that a company of the size of Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited, which will require to expend many millions of pounds in the years to come in order to operate efficiently, must have some long-term security, there is a point that the honourable member for Fremantle has apparently missed completely. When he accuses this Government of doing a scandalous thing by tying future governments to a long-term agreement he is, in effect, condemning the Chifley Government, of agreements to which this Government became heir, and which in many cases have stultified Australian progress. The Minister for Commerce and Agriculture great difficulties in relation to the development of our primary industries because he is heir to a number of long-term agreements that were effected by the Chifley Government, in which were laid down conditions that this Government was fore, foolish for members of the Opposition to criticize us because, in order to give security to a valuable institution, we have entered into an agreement to which, if by any mischance they are ultimately returned to office, they would be forced to subscribe. It has been enlightening and interesting to hear honourable members opposite continually reiterate the assertion that immediately they attain office they will scrap this agreement. Such assertions will at least let the electors know what is likely to happen if the Labour party should regain office. He said it was a terrible The honourable member for Fremantle attempted to make disgraceful and scandalous play, to use adjectives that he himself used, with the safety factor in air do not intend to give anytravel. He stated that the safety record of Australian National Airways ProWe are simply prietary Limited was one of the worse in",82,Sentatives Agreement B I L L 1952
258,"( Mr Mcewen) Has Faced, And Faces,","the world. I say that that was a disgraceful statement, because it cannot be sustained by proof, and also because it will cause, entirely without basis, a certain amount of distrust and disquiet in the minds of people. I recall that, when the Chifley Government was in office, and the honourable member for Maribyrnong ( Mr Drakeford) was Minister for Civil Aviation, questions were asked by members of the then Opposition about certain things that had happened in relation to Convair aircraft, soon after they were first used in this country. The then Minister for Civil Aviation was at great pains to charge the members asking such questions with the desire not only to discredit Trans-Australia Airlines, but also to cause a feeling of disquiet in the minds of the people generally. He condemned such actions. The statement made by the honourable member for Eremantle is of a much graver nature than were those questions, and should never have been made. criticism of the Department of Civil Aviation. all, the safety of our airways is primarily in the hands of the Department of Civil Aviation, and, secondly, in the hands of the mechanics who service the aircraft and the pilots who fly them. It is disgraceful to level such a charge against a company for the purpose of gaining political capital. To suggest that the Department of Civil Aviation is not carrying out its job in relation to the proper supervision of safety precautions; that the mechanics would service aircraft in such a manner as to make flights dangerous, and that the pilots would fly aircraft in such a way as to endanger their own safety as well as that of the people flying with them is utterly deplorable. It is a regrettable fact that on a few occasions in the past, Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited was unfortunate enough to suffer accidents of the sort that are associated with every kind of transport. To suggest that the fault lay with Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited is, in my opinion, a great deal more scandalous than anything with which the honourable member could charge the Government. I am convinced that the real motive of the opposition of honourable members opposite to the bill is their disappointment that the Government is carrying out one of the pledges on which it was elected to office, which was the breaking up of socialist enterprises and the encouragement of free private enterprise. Apparently, they were beginning to believe that the Government would let them get away with one of their chief socialist enterprises. They are bitterly disappointed because their hopes have not been realized, and are trying to do everything in their power to discredit the Government, and create a false impression in the minds of the people about our objective. One of the principal pre-election promises that we made in 1949 was that we would encourage the development of private enterprise. We are honouring that promise, and shall continue steadily to carry out that policy, whilst at the same time refraining from any mad destructive action in the opposite direction. I commend the bill, because I consider that it is one of the finest pieces of legislation that the Government has yet introduced. Mr W. M . BOURSE (Fawkner) f 11.1 J -The honourable member for Dawson( Mr Davidson), like other Government supporters who have spoken 'on this bill, was obviously ill at ease when he tried to defend what must surely be regarded as the most scandalous piece of legislation introduced during the current session. The honourable member did not analyse the provisions of the bill, or attempt to justify them, or give us reasons for their insertion in the legislation. He merely picked out small, irrelevant and unassociated scraps from speeches of previous speakers, and proceeded to answer those points without relating his remarks to the really basic provisions of the legislation. Sally or two. Mr W. M . BOURKE -Yes, he put up a few of his own making, and proceeded to bowl them over.

He then mentioned that Trans-Australia Airlines and Australian NationalA i r ways Proprietary Limited would share mail contracts and government business, but it was most noticeable that he skimmed over the really outrageous provisions of the legislation, which undoubtedly constitute a grave public scandal. under tralia will guarantee the overdraft of Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited, and, in certain circumstances, will actually make advances to that organization. Dawson did not mention those matters, or analyse their dangerous implications. I propose to examine the bill clause by clause, which he failed to do. TheC i v i l Aviation Agreement B ill 1952 is a remarkable piece of legislation, which contains only five clauses. The first is the short title, and the second informs us of the date on which the measure w ill come into operation. Clause3 reads as follows:The agreement madY between the Commonwealth and Australian National Airways l'roprietory Limited, being the agreement a copy of which is set forth in the schedule to this Act, is approved. The agreement coiitained in the schedule has a currency of fifteen years. In this innocuous-looking clause, we have a very dangerous principle. The Government, which represents for the time the people of this country, has entered into an agreement with a commercial organization. That agreement is to continue for fifteen years. Opposition members take serious objection to the agreement, but it cannot be altered. The agreement is a binding contract between the Commonwealth of Australia and Australian NationalA i r ways Proprietary Limited. No matter how vehemently and definitely the people may indicate their opposition to this legislation, this agreement w ill continue. If represents people on this matter, decides later to terminate the agreement or refuses to continue some of its scandalous provisions, Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited will have ground for legal action against, and wil l be able to obtain compensation from, the Commonwealth. Therefore, that clause is dangerous. The Government knows that its popularity with the people is rapidly receding and that it will meet its fate next time it faces the electors, yet it is binding the Commonwealth of Australia to an agreement so that future governments w ill be committed to a course I refer to the provisions of action of which they are not likely to which the people of Ausapprove. The introduction of such a principle in legislation is dangerous and undesirable. Clause4 of the bill reads as follows:The Commonwealth may give such guaranThe honourable member for tees, and make such advances on loan, as are provided for by the agreement referred to in the last preceding section. That clause introduces another remarkable departure from established practice. The Commonwealth is not merely guaranteeing the overdraft of a private commercial organization, but is actually agreeing, in certain circumstances, to advance money to it, despite the fact that the organization has practically unlimited financial resources at its disposal. However, the Commonwealth, under this clause, assumes authority to give guarantees, or make advances to this commercial organization. The last clause of this short bill is as follows:The Australian National Airlines Commission constituted under the Australian National Airlines Act 1945-1947 shall do all such things as the agreement referred to in section three of this Act provides that the Commission will do. This is another really amazing principle being written into legislation. The Australian National Airlines Commission, which conducts Trans-Australia. Airlines, is declared to be bound by the provisions of the agreement, to which it is not a party. To say that such a provision is astonishing is to put the case very mildly indeed. The commission is not a party to this agreement, yet it is being coma Labour government, which pelled to accept conditions which the intentions of the wil l clip its wings, reduce its volume of work, and strengthen its competitor. I have examined the seventh annual report of the commission, which was laid on the table of the House thi» afternoon. In that document, this instrumentality expresses its views on the Government's airlines policy. Of course, those views are very guarded. One would not expect that such a corporation would criticize Government policy. But it is clear, when we read between the lines, that the commission is by no means happy about the action that the Government is taking in this bill. The commission states, in its report:Associated with the Government's decision Airways Proprietary Limited in order to is a direction that airmail which previously enable the company to purchase six had in the main been carried by T.A.A. shall Vickers Viscount aircraft. be shared between T.A.A. and A . N . A . Pty. point that occurs to me, when I examine Ltd. on the routes where they are competing. Another paragraph to which I draw Commonwealth Bank has been made an attention reads as follows :The Commission has throughout made it whether it desired to be a party to it or clear that transference of portion of the airnot. mail will have an unfavorable influence on its overall finances, and must affect the ability of Trans-Australia Airlines to itself bear the cost of unprofitable but highly valued developmental services, particularly in the Gulf Country and Channel Country of Queensland. As I read that paragraph, I detect a clear protest of the commission against the reduction of some of its profitable business, and a warning that its finances will be affected, and that its capacity to carry on developmental work, which is of great importance in the outlying parts of the country, will be curtailed. I shall complete the paragraph, so that I shall not be accused of taking matter out of context. It reads as follows:We have been assured that special provision will he made to meet any loss on these services in future. The bill makes no provision for a special payment in order to enable Trans-Australia Airlines to meet any loss on these services in future, and we can only come to the conclusion that, if as the result of being deprived of governmental business Trans-Australia Airlines ceases to operate on a profitable basis, as it has been in the hist three years, the provision to enable the organization to carry on its developmental work in the outback areas will be met by a subsidy from general revenue. In other words, the Australian taxpayer will be called upon to foot the bill, and make good the losses that will be incurred as the result of the Australian taxpayer Mr W. M. Bourke. being called upon to subsidize Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited. I desire to pay some attention to the financial aspects of the agreement. This matter was barely mentioned by the honourable member for Dawson. This amazing agreement provides that the Government shall guarantee the repayment to the Commonwealth Bank of loans not exceeding a total of £3,000,000 which will be made by that bank to Australian National The first that clause, is that it appears that the indirect party to this arrangement, Mr HA WORTH -Ho w does the honourable member know that? Mr W. M . BOUPuKE I presume that the Commonwealth Bank has been instructed to make this advance of £3,000,000 to Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited. We do not know whether the company has adequate security for such a loan, because £3,000,000 is a considerable amount of money. The paid-up capital of Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited is only £1,500,000. According to the Minister's second reading speech, Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited has been making losses over the last few years which amount to approximately £400,000. On the inadequate information that has been given to the House, the lack of security is such that any bank would look twice at such a proposition before it would be prepared to advance the considerable sum of £3,000,000. A few moments ago, the honourable member for Isaacs( Mr Haworth) asked how I know that the Commonwealth Bank has been made an unwilling party to this arrangement. If the bank was prepared to advance that sum of money on a straight-out business basis, and the security was available, there should not be any need for the Government to give the guarantee. The fact that the Government has felt itself constrained to guarantee that amount indicates that, in normal circumstances, the bank would not be prepared to take the risk. The next clause in the agreement is even more astonishing than the previous one. There is considerable justification for the assumption that, even with the Government's guarantee, the company may have difficulty in obtaining finance. In order to enable Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited to replace its present aircraft as they become obsolescent, a further advance up to a total of £4,000,000 will be either guaranteed by the Government or, if the finance is not obtainable on that basis, the Government actually agrees to advance the money on loan from its own revenue. Mr W. M . BOURKE lous clause. The agreement is to the effect that during the next ten years Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited will be entitled to draw under Commonwealth guarantee or loan up to a maximum amount of £4,000,000. In most agreements under which money is to be advanced, or guaranteed, there is a considerable amount of detail about the method of its repayment. However, in this agreement the only such provision is that the money advanced or guaranteed shall be repaid by regular instalments in the shortest time practicable, but in any event before the expiration of the period of the agreement in fifteen years time. I maintain that the action of the Government is unprecedented, in so guaranteeing or contributing money out of its own resources to enable a company to purchase modern aircraft to carry out its operations. The most scandalous part of the proposal is that this company which the Commonwealth proposes to subsidize, is not a pauperized company, because its shareholders are mainly wealthy shipping concerns which could quite easily find the £4,000,000 if they so desired. Any one of the five shareholding shipping companies that control Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited could probably find £4,000,000. order to substantiate this argument I propose to refer to the balance[124] sheets and financial records of these shareholding .companies. The Government should advise the House why such discriminatory treatment should be given to these shareholders, in the light of the fact that they could supply the money themselves. Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited is a proprietary company registered in Victoria, with a paid-up and issued capital of £1,500,000. There are a number of small minor shareholders in the company, but the five major shareholders are shipping companies, each of which holds 1,119,636 5s. shares. One of the shareholding companies is Holyman Brothers Proprietary Limited, but no information is available about its financial resources because it is a proprietary company. Another shareholding company is A scandalous provision! Huddart Parker Limited, and, without It is a scandagoing into full details of its financial position, it has assets valued at £5,145,170, and of those assets, shares and debentures in other companies are valued at £1,400,000 and cash and bonds at £1,254,310. Therefore, that company has sufficient money on hand to subscribe over £1,000,000 to Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited. Moreover, this concern made a profit last year of £255,000 and paid a 12 per cent, dividend on its shares. The Adelaide Steamship Company Limited, another major shareholder in Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited, has fixed assets valued at more than £4,000,000, and government securities, bank deposits and cash on hand of £1,190,482. Therefore, that company also could immediately obtain more than £1,000,000 in cash, and subscribe it to Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited. The other two shareholding companies are the Orient Steam Navigation Company Limited and the Union Steam Ship Company of New Zealand Limited. They both have resources worth millions of pounds at their disposal, and both are subsidiaries of the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company, the assets of which run into tens of millions of pounds. Therefore, honourable members will realize that we are dealing with a In shipping combine that is .one of the wealthiest groups operating in the world. The assets of the Orient",84,Sentatives Agreement B I L L 1952
262,Mr Daly,"Steam Navigation Company Limited, according to a British shipping finance book that I have studied, were valued at more than £12,000,000 in 1949-the latest figures available. Of that sum, government and other quoted securities which could be immediately realized were valued at £4,9SS,000. Honourable members will perceive that this company alone could subscribe to Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited the £4,000,000 which the Government intends to advance to it. The assets of the Union Steam Ship Company of New Zealand Limited are valued at more than £7,000,000. Therefore it could make its contribution. The Orient Steam Navigation Company Limited and the Union Steam Ship Company of New Zealand Limited each possess enormous assets, including tremendous cash resources, and t!u;y are practically wholly owned by the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company whose assets are valued at more £11,723,685 invested in government stocks. It could subscribe £4,000,000 to Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited from its liquid resources. What is the reason why the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company and the other shipping companies do not intend to put money into Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited? Is it that they do not regard it as a good investment? I suggest that honourable members on the Government side might answer those questions. It is astounding that companies which these sovereign independent States had to own such huge liquid resources should not place before the Commonwealth Grants make them available to their subsidiary Commission, an agency of the people, company in order that National Airways Proprietary Limited should be permitted to carry on. I suggest that they should be happy to able member's time has expired. invest their surplus funds in one of their own subsidiaries. In view of the facts that I have put before the House, the Government should explain why it has guaranteed money which the shareholding companies of Australian National Airways Proprietary very well afford but apparently will of the honourable member for Eawkner rot advance. Despite the fact that ( Mr W. M . Bourke), but his logic was the Australian posing to make this and unjustified Mr W. M. Bourke. resources of Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited, it has not placed the financial position of the company before the Parliament. Honourable members, as the representatives of the people, are being forced to give the sanction of the Parliament to these amazing financial arrangements in the absence of any information about the financial position of the company itself. That is an astonishing state of affairs. If Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited should convert itself into a public company and invite the public to subscribe to its capital, it would be obliged under the law to make it3 financial position public and to publish its balance-sheets so that the public could be informed about its assets and liabilities. In this case the Government, which represents the people, is putting money into Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited, but there is no clause in this astonishing than' £39,000,000, including agreement to provide that the company shall reveal to the representatives of the people, and consequently to the people, anything about its financial position. If the Government proceeds with this legislation it should at least lay before the Parliament full details of the financial position of Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited. The Government has ample precedent for such an action. Recently, the House adopted a measure under which assistance was granted to the States of Western Australia, South Australia and Tasmania. In order to become entitled to that money, Australian full details of their financial affairs. Sitting suspended from 11.30 p.m. to 12 midnight. Thursday, SO October, 1952.

He member for Dawson( Mr Davidson) who, he said, was not at ease in defending this measure and alleged that other Government supporters were speaking under difficulties when they defended the bill. I can disabuse his mind of these fears. in supporting this measure. cerely welcome its introduction. general provisions, which have been well known to members of the Government parties for some considerable time, have been received by Government supporters with unanimous approval. The measure can be understood only when one considers it against the background of air services in Australia. It sets out to right a wrong that was done by the clumsy attempt on the part, of the Chifley Government to socialize airways in this country. The first attempt was by legislation and the H i g h Court declared the relevant measure to be ultra vires the Constitution. Following that setback, the Chifley Government, dismayed and angered by its inability to ride roughshod over the Constitution, proceeded to achieve its objective by stealth. It established Trans-Australia Airlines with the declared'intention of driving Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited out of the air. The honourable member for Paterson( MrF a i r h a l l ) directed the attention of the House to a plain and unvarnished statement made by the honourable member for Watson( Mr Curtin) that the Australian Labour party was out to drive Australian National Airways Pro prietary Limited out of the air. That peculiarly damaging admission by that honourable member will not be forgotten either in this House or outside it. The issue before the House is socialism versus private enterprise, and that to lend money to Ausissue is posed for honourable members in a particularly clear form. Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited was doing extremely well in the early post-war years. A t that time, it was well able to cope with increasing traffic and to maintain a high standard of service. It had a safety record that was more than comparable with that of the best air services in any other country, and it The honourable ran its service economically. It carried the country's airmail and developed a then criticized, the honourable freight traffic; and, in addition, pioneered new routes, in which sphere it had done more than its share in the early days of civil aviation in Australia. Then, in 1946, the Chifley Government, adhering to its harmful doctrinaire policy, determined to nationalize air services. WeI have no hesitation know that its first attempt failed I sinwhen it was challenged in the H i g h Its Court. Subsequently, that Government determined to nationalize air services by the back door method. The dispute which had occurred between the private operators, of which Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited was only one, and the Chifley Government, arose, if my recollection is correct, over the payment of charges by the Chifley Government for the use of aerodromes. The private companies successfully challenged the validity of those charges in the court. The Chifley Government, piqued at it e inability to do as it liked with private enterprise, decided to drive them out of the air. A situation then arose similar to the one created by the Chifley Government's attempt to nationalize the private banks. The Government placed more and more onerous obligations upon the private banks until, eventually, one of them successfully contested its latest and most harmful attempt to control them. Mr Chifley then announced that he would nationalize the lot. Thus began the eclipse and downf a ll of the Australian Labour party in this Parliament. It was a similar attitude of mind that moved that dictatorial Government to endeavour to drive private operators out of the air. Having failed to achieve outright nationalization, it deliberately, stupidly and obstinately brought about created a situation from which there could be no satisfactory exit. Thus, if members of the Opposition object to certain aspects of this bill they have only themselves to blame. By establishing Trans-Australia Airlines with the object of driving Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited out of the air, the Chifley Government, but for the intervention of the people at the ballot-box, would very soon have been left in undisputed possession of the airways of this country. Do the people desire that air services should be nationalized ? Do they desire that the Government should have a monopoly of such services? I say emphatically that they do not. A study of the Australian nationalized railway system and of the nationalized road transport services in some of the States, reveals the effect of over-capitalization, over staffing, the subordination of efficiency to the political search for votes, an inability to keep abreast of the times and a steady and inexorable decline. The people of Australia recoil with horror from the prospect of the air services in this country being brought under the same dead hand of bureaucratic control, unenlivened by even a semblance of competition. And they rightly ask whether the present undoubted high standard of Trans-Australia Airlines could be maintained if it were given sole possession of the air. Members of the Opposition have not been unduly scrupulous in their search for sticks with which to beat Australian National Airways Limited, which, to them, is a symbol of sturdy independence and which, in their Marxist zeal, they are determined to crush. Fremantle ( Mr Beazley), in a speech which did him little credit, compared the safety record of Trans-Australia Airlines with that of Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited. I was sorry to observe that other honourable members opposite made a similar comparison. The fact is that Australian aviation, as a whole, has a very high and enviable safety record that has not been achieved by air services in any other country. I earnestly hope that that record will be fully maintained in the future. But, in the field of aviation, the possibility of human error is always present, not only in flying operations but also in the maintenance of aircraft. There is always an Mr Osborne. element of chance. Consequently, I listened to those comparisons of safety records with dismay. ""Whilst the record of one company is unblemished and that of the other is very high, the balance between the two could bo altered by misfortune practically overnight. Honourable members will do well to remember that Australian safety records in civil aviation are very high. Sordid comparisons of the kind that honourable members opposite have made savour rather of tempting providence. The making of comparisons did no credit to honourable members opposite. I emphasize that the purpose of this bill is, as far as it is possible to do so, to right a clumsy socialist wrong. The honourable member for Parkes( Mr Haylen) used the notorious metaphor of his socialist superior and suggested that one could not put the feathers back on a bird that had been plucked to make a Marxist triumph. One cannot completely rectify a wrong. I repeat that if the bill contains provisions of which members of the Opposition do not approve, they have only themselves to blame. The introduction of this measure has been rendered necessary in order to right a wrong that Labour perpetrated in defiance of the Constitution. The Chifley Government established a situation to which there could be no satisfactory conclusion. But in this situation, the present Government has Proprietary done remarkably well in reaching this agreement with Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited which it now asks the Parliament to ratify. The agreeThe honourable member for ment will ensure that Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited shall be enabled to continue operations assured, as far as it is possible to provide such an assurance, that it will compete on equal terms with Trans-Australia Airlines. I say as far as it is possible to provide such an assurance, because I doubt whether fair competition is really possible between a government organization and private enterprise. When two great enterprises, one of which is government controlled and the other is controlled by private enterprise, exist side by side, the advantages that lie with the government organization are so great that I doubt whether it is really possible to provide effectively for fair competition. However, so far as the Government can ensure such competition, it seeks to do so by this measure. succeed remains to be seen; but this bill is an attempt on its part to do so. Therefore, the measure should be commended. As the honourable member for Fawkner did, I propose now to examine the agreement. I draw from it very different conclusions from his. First, the agreement is to operate for a period of fifteen years. The honourable member for Fawkner objected very strongly to that and argued that this Government should not seek to bind future governments by concluding an agreement operative for a period of years. But, when the Opposition adopts the wholly reprehensible tactics of declaring that whatever the Government does to-day it will undo to-morrow, I consider that the Government is entirely justified in endeavouring, when righting this socialist wrong, to give some assurance of continuity to the company concerned. The agreement is entirely justifiable in those circumstances, and, if the Opposition objects, it should blame its own dishonourable tactics. The agreement provides for the financing of the purchase of new aircraft by Australian NationalA i r ways Proprietary Limited. This provision binds the Government not to lend, but to facilitate the borrowing by Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited of £3,000,000, in the first instance, and other sums later, the total not to exceed at any time £4,000,000, for the purchase of aircraft. The company must pay current rates of interest for the money. T stress the difference between this treatment of Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited and the Chifley Government's action in providing Trans-Australia Airlines with millions of pounds of capital entirely free of charge. millions of pounds? cult to answer the honourable member's -, question because the greatest care was taken by the Labour Government to disguise the total amount invested in Trans-Australia Airlines, and also the early enormous losses of that organization. likely to find the truth unless somebody high in the ranks of the Labour party Whether it will w ill take him into his confidence. The Chifley Government took great care not to take the country into its confidence, and it used a l l the skill and cunning of which it was capable in order to conceal the cost of the enterprise. The agreement next deals with the thorny subject of outstanding air route charges, in which the dispute between Australian Nationa l Airways Proprietary L in i it e l and the Chifley Government had its genesis. I hope that the matter will be satisfactorily and permanently settled by the agreement, which appears to be likely. The Government undertakes to share its airmail business equally with Trans-Australia Airlines and Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited. The honourable member for Hindmarsh had something to say on this subject, and I shall comment on his remarks later.. If there is to be any competition between the two organizations, it is obvious that airmail and other government traffic must be shared equally between them. The agreement also includes a provision to ensure that, if the Government has any new or second-hand aircraft for sale, it w ill offer them equally to the two organizations. Next, there is a very important provision, which is wholly to the advantage of the Government. Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited undertakes, in effect, that it w i ll not sell its aircraft without the permission of the Government, and that it will retain them for service in Australia. I impress upon the House the importance of that undertaking by the company. Before the execution of this agreement, if Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited had decided to go out of business, liquidate its assets, and sell its aircraft on the world market, it could have done have' been left without adequate proI find it very diffivision for its air services. The only alternative that the Government would have had, in those circumstances, would have been, in effect, to commit an act of confiscation by refusing to allow the company to take its aircraft out of the country. Such an act would have been The honourable member is not of very doubtful constitutional validity.",88,Sentatives Agreement B I L L 1952
265,Mr Clyde,,91,Cameron Ho W Many So Very Profitably And Australia Would
266,Mr Osborne,"I remind the House that this provision is entirely in favour of the Government. It provides us with important safeguards against the loss of air services, which did not previously exist. Finally, the agreement provides that, if the. Government declares a state of emergency, the whole of the air services of Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited, including not only its aircraft, but also its hangars, workshops and equipment, shall be at the service of the Government. That is a very useful and sound provision for the benefit of the country. This debate has raised in clear form the issue of socialist enterprise against private, or free, enterprise. I by no means hold the view that government control cannot be justified in any circumstances. There can be at times, in certain fields, good reasons for government intervention in business undertakings. Furthermore. 1 believe that there are some fields of enterpeople, because it means the withdrawal prise in which a government monopoly is justifiable. This is traditionally held to be so in Australia. For example, I refer to the Postal Department. Communications generally are accepted as being a proper field for government enterprise. The Opposition contends that all transport is in such a field, but I deny that contention. Because thp history of railways in Australia has been one of government ventures, that is no reason for supposing that air transport must follow the same course. A government has no right to interfere with any private enterprise which caters satisfactorily for the public need and does so profitably and efficiently. That is the test prietary Limited, for which this agreewhich we should apply to determine whether or not socialization is justifiable. the Government owned an airline it must Governments do not and cannot make profits. They do not and cannot create wealth and prosperity. They spend money, they lose money and they interfere with the creation of wealth and prosperity, but, almost without exception, whenever they put their hands on any profitable business, that business declines and becomes a charge on the revenue so that it is supported at the expense of the taxpayers. This leads me to another matter. Mr Osborne. The honourable member for Paterson( Mr Fairhall) reminded the House of the parrot cry which we hear with monotonous regularity from the Opposition"" Hands off the people's assets"". How often do we hear the Opposition raising this nonsensical and meaningless cry? What are the people's assets? Is a socialist enterprise conducted at a loss an asset of the people ? The reverse is the truth. One of the assets of all Australians, including members of the Opposition, is the right, by the exercise of their own skill, energy and enterprise, to share in the profitable use of the nation's resources. Those resources are much more profitably and efficiently used by private enterprise than they can be by any government through the medium of socialized industry, bureaucratically controlled. Once this truth is accepted, every unnecessary interference with independent initiative and effort is seen as an attack upon the assets of the of one more undertaking from the general pool of profitable enterprises from which we all draw our wealth and prosperity. Every act of socialization is, therefore, an attack on the assets of the people. These things must be kept in mind if we are to see this agreement in its true perspective. If we do not keep them in mind, we shall fall into the fallacious thinking of which the honourable member for Hindmarsh has been guilty to-night. The honourable member criticized the division of airmails between Trans-Australia Airlines and Australian National Airways Proment provides, and he stated that because look after it and ensure that all airmail traffic was carried by it. I hope that honourable members are able to see the fallacy of such an argument. If his argument were accepted, there would have to be a bolstering up of every socialist enterprise by other resources of the Government. The Government would be obliged to divert all its airmail to Trans-Australia Airlines in order to bolster up its own socialist enterprise. If that process were followed to its conclusion it would mean inevitably that all enterprise would fall under government control. We should then have a Communist state, to which socialism in practice inevitably leads. I know that problems still confront the air services of this country. I think it not improbable that some rationalization of individual services may be necessary to prevent wasteful competition between the two major organizations. I know that the use of aircraft from overseas services on the internal services of Australia during periods when local aircraft arc laid up will be necessary in the cause of efficiency. There are other difficulties in connection with the future operation of this agreement which arise from the fact, as I stated earlier, that the advantages are so heavily on the side of the Government enterprise that I doubt whether f a i r competition can be definitely assured. I know that difficulties of this kind must be watched. I ask the House, however, to remember that the situation arises from the wrongful act of the Chifley Government when it tried to nationalize our air services, despite the lack of constitutional power to do so. This bill is a real start to deal with the problems of our internal air services. Those problems were greatly added to by the wrongful act of the Chifley Government, to which I have referred. I hope that the bill will be received by the country in that spirit. I assure the Opposition and the people at large that honourable members on this side of the House are very determinedly behind the measure. a.m.] I am reminded by the attitude of honourable members opposite that conscience does not prevent one from doing wrong; it merely spoils the enjoyment associated with wrongdoing. Conscience causes the guilty to look for all kinds of excuses for their wrongful acts. The honourable member for Capricornia ( Mr Pearce) repeated what has now become the stock excuse of honourable members opposite, when he stated that because Trans-Australia socialized it was now necessary to desocialize it. Stripped of all subterfuge, the fact is that the Government is bent on the destruction of Trans-Australia Airlines. The conduct of an air transport organization is far beyond the capacity of any private company, no matter how great it may be. The sooner honourable members opposite appreciate that fact, the sooner will this nonsensical talk about socialized industry cease. Everybody knows that, from the very inception of air transport, air services have had to be nurtured by governments. Subsidies in the way of essential amenities have had to be provided. It has been revealed that some of the subsidies and amenities which have been provided for air transport services in Australia have cost approximately £13,500,000. That sum takes no account of the cost of providing meteorological data and essential safety devices. So fa r in this debate, nothing has been said about that matter. A i r transport is not merely a matter of flying an aeroplane from one point to another, nor is it a mere matter of the cost of petrol, landing fees, and so on. The huge subsidiary organization which is essential is so important that it cannot possibly be overlooked in a debate such as this. The arguments presented by the M in ister for Territories ( Mr Hasluck) and other honourable members opposite seem to me to have produced every paradox that one could imagine. If the honourable member for Capricornia and other reactionary conservatives opposite really believe that the Government had no right to enter the field of air transport, as it has done, why do not they also apply that argument to other services, such as educa[12.29 tion, the Postal Department, railways, and irrigation, to mention just a few? I point out that education in this country was a going concern before the Government decided to step into the field. Could any honourable member opposite imagine anything more horrible than a socialized education scheme? Yet such a system is in operation throughout the continent, and honourable members opposite do not object because education is not a profitable enterprise. Precisely the Airlines had been same argument applies to the railways. Other forms of transport were in operation in -this country before the railways began to function. W h y is it that there is no objection to socialization of our railway system? Could",91,Cameron Ho W Many So Very Profitably And Australia Would
267,Mr Andrews (Darebin),"it be that tbere is no profit to be made from essential developmental works? Let me ask the members of the Australian Country party why it is that no squeal has been raised about irrigation works, in which the Commonwealth is playing a very important part at the present time. Irrigation works were undertaken in this country long before the Government participated in them, but it became necessarj for private enterprise to vacate that field because it did not have the capital required to enable irrigation systems to be developed adequately. Irrigation has been socialized, but the Government does not claim that that is an undesirable form of socialism. It has become customary for honourable gentlemen opposite to use the word "" socialized "" in a derogato bolster a very shaky concern, the protory way. Nationalization has little or nothing to do with socialization. Why cannot Government members face that fact, and be honest about the matter? Nationalization could be a step along the road towards socialization. If honourable members opposite regard nationalization as a dangerous step, why do they condemn it on some occasions and condone it on others? Why do they condone nationalization when it is applied to the postal department, educational services and irrigation works, and condemn it when it affects a company that could get a pay-off from the use of the public moneys, as Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited will do under this measure ? We know that about £4,500,000 was required to establish Airlines. That investment was made in the interests of the public. The Chifley Government invested money in Trans-Australia Airlines as the servant of the people of Australia. It did so, first, in the interests of rational national developTrans-Australia Airlines and Austrament, for which only the State could find the necessary capital; secondly, in the interests of defence and the safety of this panies that are competing to serve country; and, thirdly, in the interests of progress in air transport. At that time it was not envisaged that as much money would be expended upon air services as has actually been expended. Trans-Australia Airlines had its struggles in the early stages cf its development. Those struggles have been referred to in the Mr Andrews. course of this debate. Ultimately, it became very successful. Now that the time has arrived for the next rational step to be taken, I say advisedly that this Government intends to strangle Trans-Australia Airlines and to prevent the progress that might have been made either through that organization or through the private company which has now been amalgamated with it, to the very great advantage of the private company. The money that is to be found for the private company should be made available instead to Trans-Australia Airlines, to enable it to advance and to take advantage of the progress that science has made in the field of air transport. But, because of the action that the Government has taken gress of Trans-Australia Airlines will be stifled. What is proposed is completely paradoxical and ironical. The progress of the people's air service is to be halted to bolster what is virtually a bankrupt private company. That company is being bolstered by the people's bank, backed by the people's government. Even though I do not like the political complexion of the present Government, it is the people's Government because it has been elected by the people. Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited is being further bolstered by the arrangement under which it will carry a half of the airmails. That is being done to enable this enterprise to keep its head above water. The socialized bank Trans-Australia and the socialized postal department are being used as bladders to keep the pirate afloat. People who travel on government warrants have a significant place in these proposals. Honourable gentlemen opposite have given the impression that lian National Airways Proprietary Limited are the only airline comtheir convenience, but that is far from the truth. Advice should be tendered, for instance, to the Pioneer Tours organization to the effect that it should present a claim to the Government that members of Parliament be given an opportunity to travel in its coaches instead of by rail. Such a claim would lie no more ludicrous than what is proposed in this measure. I can see no reason why the Mayne-Nickless organization in Victoria should not claim to he permitted to compete with the postal department in carrying airmails from various airports to post offices. That would be no different from what is proposed in this bill. If that is the principle that is to be applied, I see no reason why companies of the type to which I have referred should not present, claims along those lines. Wo have been told that the arrangements in relation to the transport of mails and passengers have been made in the interests of f a i r competition. There is to be an equal division of the carriage of airmails. In the last twelve months. Australian prietary Limited carried double the volume of freight that was carried by Trans-Australia Airlines, but it will be noted that no arrangement has been made for Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited to divide its freight traffic with Trans-Australia Airlines. It appears that this is a very one-sided bargain. It might almost be described as one-way traffic. There is to be equality of purchasing power between the two companies. Arrangements are to be made concerning the purchase of aeroplanes and other equipment. This provision will be enforced whether there is good or indifferent management of the two companies. I think it can be f a i r l y claimed that, of the two companies, Trans-Australia superiority in management. also to be an agreement in relation to time-tables, and if no arrangement can be made between the two bodies in relation to a particular matter an arbitrator is to decide the point at issue. Australia Airlines is the only party that could lose by such arbitration. This arrangement seems to me to be analogous to an arrangement between the robber and the robbed. As has been stated already in this debate, Trans-Australia Airlines has an enviable safety record. In this connection the Government could not criticize Trans-Australia Airlines, which has played a larger part than any other company in creating confidence, in air travel. It has had no major accident since its inception. I agree with Government supporters that it is most unfortunate that accidents have occurred. I believe that all companies take every possible precaution to prevent accidents. That is natural. But TransrAustralia Airlines compares more tfoam favourably with Australian NationalA i r ways Proprietary Limitedi n this respect.. Why has no honourable member opposite explained why Australian National Ai? 6 ways Proprietary Limited was selected to enjoy this very precious g if t from the Government? It seems to me that persistent representations have been made by this company and that the constant dripping has worn away the stone. The Government has delayed for as long as possible the destruction of a very National Airways Prosuccessful national enterprise. Undoubtedly certain people have reminded the Government of its obligations to them. No one has attempted to explain why a socialist enterprise is to be used to guarantee the continued existence of what is virtually a bankrupt private; enterprise which can only continue ira business with the aid of government warrants and mail contracts. The Minister for Territories ( Mr. Hasluck) humorously remarked that the Government had rejected the request by the principals of Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited! for amalgamation. He claimed that the Government only wished to rationalize air services. These are Airlines has a marked high-sounding phrases. What does There is the Minister mean by "" amalgamat i o n "" and ""rationalization""? The Government appears to find it convenient to use the term "" rationalization "" to describe the conversion of a tottering private Transenterprise into a socialized enterprise. It is obvious that the Government is merely fulfilling its obligation to certain interests. Attempts appear to have been for arbitration made in the Postal Department to terminate the services of private contractors as rapidly as possible. This move seems to have met with the support of the public. Yet, after providing millions of pounds for experiments in the field of meteorology and for the provision of airfields, the Government appears to be content"" that the benefit of these services should go to private enterprise. The Government's duty is to recoup its expenditure on experimental services as rapidly as it can and it can only do that by operating its own air services. Instead, it has resolved to give all that it can to a private industry which is not able to stand on its own feet. The Government's action is completely indefensible and honourable members opposite have been unable to justify it. The Government wishes to pay for the support that it has received from private enterprise. It will be difficult for it to offer any explanation of its actions when next it has to face the public. This will be among the actions on which the public will judge the Government harshly when next it goes to the polls. a.m.] -The Government's intention is to prevent the airways from becoming a monopoly either of the government or of private enterprise. All honourable members on this side of the House believe it to be important to have competition, wherever possible. We have heard from honourable members opposite statements about the people's airways, the people's bank, the people's this and the people's that.. We hear exactly the same kind of statements from Communist China, whose leaders speak of the people's republic, the people's court, which is chopping off thousands of heads every day, the people's this and the people's that. These are stock phrases of the socialists and, as we learned from our friend, Mr Willie Gallacher, the president of the British Communist party, the only successful end to socialism is communism. Honourable members opposite have painted for us a dreadful picture of the terrible things that will happen to Trans-Australia Airlines as a result of the operation, of this measure. The Government has nodesire to wipe out Trans-Australia Airlines. We consider, however, that Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited, which pioneered major air servicesin Australia, should have the opportunity to' run in fair competition with Trans-Australia Airlines. We are told that the Government subsidized AustralianNational Airways Proprietary Limited'to the tune of £13,500,000. That is a ridiculous--statement. The amount or £11,000,000 that was expended on airfields wa3 not expended only for the benefit of Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited, because the air-fields on which that money was expended are still in existence to-day and have been improved considerably. In those days, it was thought cheaper for the Government to subsidize private air companies than to start doing the job itself, otherwise such airlines would not have been subsidized. When the Chifley Government wanted to nationalize the country's airways it was prevented from doing so by the High Court, and reacted as it reacted on every other occasion on which it was halted in its move towards socialism. Finding that it could not achieve nationalization in one (Gwydir) [12.55 way, it decided to establish a government airline, and put other airlines out of business by making it a monopoly. Why do the socialists want a government monopoly of such public services? The answer is simple. A government cannot run anything efficiently under conditions of fair competition. If the State railways, for instance, had to meet fairly competition from private enterprise they would have to improve their efficiency. The whole trouble with the socialist is that he cannot face fair competition. Now we are being told that Trans-Australia Airlines will not be able to operate successfully because of this measure, but will be gradually pushed out of business. Why should Trans-Australia Airlines be pushed out of business under fair competition any more than the Commonwealth Bank will be pushed out of business under fair competition? The socialist cannot bear competition because he cannot afford to have any measuring-stick available to enable the people to compare the efficiency of socialist enterprises with that of privately conducted enterprises of the same kind. When the Chifley Government established Trans-Australia Airlines it started to run Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited off the airways. The honourable member for Batman( Mr Bird) forecast that the extension of Trans-Australia Airlines' services will cease as a result of this measure. He mentioned that Trans-Australia Airlines was opening up services in the",93,Cameron Ho W Many So Very Profitably And Australia Would
268,Mr Treioar,"Channel Country of Queensland. W h y is that airline opening up such services, when there is already a private service operating profitably there? It wants to run that service out of business, even if it loses in the process. The Government airline, however, does not mind operating unprofitably, because it knows it can f a l l back on the taxpayer. We saw the ruses adopted by the Chifley Government to disguise the losses made by socialized airways. I wish to make it clear that we have nothing against Trans-Australia Airlines, but we object to a government enterprise fixing its books in such a way as to hide losses by writing up stock in hand to much more than the real value. That action was taken under the Chifley Government, and attention was drawn to it by the auditors. The honourable member for Fremantle made a statement to-day of which he should be very much ashamed. He sought to depreciate the safety record of Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited. sought to throw doubts on the reliability of some of the aircraft used by Trans-Australia Airlines. l i e attempted to give the impression that the Convair aircraft used by Trans-Australia Airlines were unsafe. He said he had had experience of a number of incidents, and he attempted to cause doubt in the minds of people about the airworthiness, not only of Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited's fleet, but also of Trans-Australia Airlines's fleet.

The Chifley Government used to speak about the prevention of exploitation. That is the La hour party's constant excuse for socializing industries. However, aftei Trans-Australia Airlines had been established the Chifley Government threatened to take disciplinary action against Ansett Airways Proprietary Limited because Mr Ansett refused to increase his charges. That is a beautiful example of a socialistic act. to raise them. Labour party would wipe out all competition if it could, so that there would be no measuring stick available to enable the public to make a comparison of the efficiency of government enterprises with similar private enterprises. There is no reason why Trans-Australia Airlines and Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited cannot run in competition, but it must be f a i r competition. We have been told that Trans-Australia Airlines has carried airmails f a r more cheaply than Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited carried them. Members of the No t ratisfied with that, he Opposition seem to think that we have short memories. I know that after the mail contract was taken from Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited it was found, after a lot of trouble, that Trans-Australia Airlines was being paid an amount of £750,000 by the Postmaster General's Department in a lump sum which had no bearing on the amount of mails carried and was far in excess of the amount paid to Australian NationalA i r ways Proprietary Limited. equal to the deficit of the previous year. bearing on the quantity of mail carried. We have been told by the honourable memE v e r y b o d y knows ber for Fawkner( MrW . M . Bourke) that the Government is acting contrary checks on the airworthiness to the wishes of the general public. I remind him that the Government parties stated in their joint policy speech at the last election that they would deal with the matter of airways. They are now doing so. It is a l l very well for the Opposition to tell us that we are acting contrary to the wishes of the public. Honourable members opposite apparently have forgotten about the 1947 banking legislation.

Both he and the honourable I remind the honormember for Gwydir said that the honourable member for Fremantle had reflected not only on the Department of Civil Aviation but also on employees of Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited. I heard the speech of the honourable member for Fremantle, and a very good speech it was. He did not reflect on the Department of Civil Aviation or on the employees of Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited. What he said was that if Trans-Australia Airlines had had five crashes, Trans-Australia Airlines would have been wound up, and it would have been difficult to oppose the winding up. He felt that he investment. If Australian was justified in applying the same argument to Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited. The tenor of the remarks of honourable members opposite is that this bill has been introduced to prevent the development of a government airline monopoly in this country.

284,Mr Riordan,"The honourable memprior to the establishment of Trans-Australia Airlines, was the ordinary surface transport organization. There was no real competition, because the Department of Civil Aviation would not permit more than one airline company to operate on any particular route. The department believed that a multiplicity of airline operators on one route would force up freights and fares because there would be competition for the limited freight and passenger traffic available. One of the forerunners of Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited, as we know it to-day, was ""Western Australian Airways Limited, which was formed about 1921. Another was Adelaide Airways Proprietary Limited, which was formed in 1936. absorbed by Australian National Airway? Proprietary Limited when it was established in 1936. In addition, Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited incorporated Tasmanian Aerial Services Limited and Holyman's Airways Proprietary Limited. In 1934, New England Airways Limited was formed. That organization was absorbed by Airlines of Australia Proprietary Limited, about 1935. Airways Limited and Northern Airlines Limited. In 1936, Airlines of Australia Proprietary Limited also absorbed the Rockhampton Aerial Service, and in 1938 it absorbed North Queensland Airways Limited. Ultimately, Airlines of Australia Proprietary Limited was itself absorbed by Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited. The Minister for Territories ( Mr Hasluck) referred in his second-reading speech to the fact that Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited was the only major airline operating in this country at the outbreak of war in 1939. He saidIt was Australian National Airways which had by the outbreak of war established the aircraft as a major mode of transport between realize that the aircraft, as we know them capita] cities in Australia. I have referred to the absorptions which ciency in World War II., and engendered took place, the culmination of which was the confidence which is so manifest to the establishment of this privately owned day among those who travel by air. monopoly. Repeated reference has been made to tried to show that the. phrases "" the the fact that this Government is opposed people's bank"" and. "" the people's airto monopolies, and, on that account, has line "" are merely tags attached by the introduced these four bills. The honorLabour party to the Commonwealth Bank able member for Evans said that the Labour Government established Trans-Australia Airlines with the object of driving the private airline operators out of the air. As I have indicated, Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited drove its competitors out of the air, and established one organization, which existed at the time of the establishment of Trans-Australia Airlines. Government supporters do not appear to be aware that the Labour Government established Trans-Australia Airlines for two reasons. The first was to break the monopoly that had been set up by Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited. The second was to make-it possible for ex-members of the Both those companies were Royal Australian A i r Force, who had been trained at the Commonwealth's expense, to secure employment in civil aviation after the conclusion of hostilities. They were readily absorbed by Trans-Australia Airlines. We all know that Trans-Australia Airlines has prospered despite the fact that, in its initial stages, certain chambers of commerce, chambers of manufactures, and other organizations of emA similar fate befell Northern ployers urged their members to support Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited. Despite that attempt to boycott Trans-Australia Airways, the little people, the common people, the ordinary man in the street supported it, and made it possible for it to succeed. The commercial interests were not responsible for the success of Trans-Australia Airlines. It was not Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited that made the man in the street airminded. World War I. gave us the motor car, and World War II . gave us the aircraft as we know it to-day. It is true, of course, that there were motor cars prior to World War I. The limited outlook of Government supporters is revealed by the fact that they cannot to-day, reached their highest peak of effiThe honourable member for Gwydir has and Trans-Australia Airlines respectively. wrong. owned by the people, by virtue of the fact that they have subscribed its capital. The success of Trans-Australia A i r lines is due to the fact that it has received the support of its shareholdersthe people themselves. I have listened with a great deal of interest to the way in which. Government supporters have approached these four bills. They have had the greatest difficulty in trying to justify their support for this legislation, because they all state that they are opposed to a monopoly and favour the introduction of these measures in order to prevent a public or governmental monopoly of airlines. The result of this legislation will be that Trans-Australia Airlines will go out of the air, and a private monopoly will be entrenched more strongly than Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited might have been at the outbreak of World War II . Ever since the present Government assumed office in December, 1949, Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited has been in .consultation with it with a view to effecting an amalgamation with Trans-Australia Airlines. Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited did not offer to buy out Trans-Australia Airlines for two reasons. First, it wanted a share of the airmail Secondly, if Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited were to purchase the assets of Trans-Australia Airlines, it would be buying aircraft which would be obsolete in 1954, when the Vickers Viscount and other jet, aircraft would be available. In consequence, the capital which Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited would have invested in Trans-Australia Airlines would have been tied up in obsolescent machine"". Therefore, Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited desired to effect an amalgamation with Trans-Australia A i r lines so that both organizations would be in the same position. tions were instituted with the Government, and thesu four bills are the result. IfI were a director of National Airways Proprietary I should be very happy about this agreeMr Riordan. ment. All the risks are to be taken by The honourable gentleman is the Government, and Australian National Trans-Australia Airlines is Airways Proprietary Limited, if I may use a racing term, has everything going to nothing. The Minister said, in his second-reading speech, that Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited had been running its internal services at a loss for some years. That statement is true. Later, in his speech, the Minister informed the House of the losses that had been incurred by Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited on its operations in the last two years. But we have not been informed of the result of the private inquiry held into the financial affairs of Australian NationalA i r ways Proprietary Limited. The books of Trans-Australia Airlines are open to the world to see. This House should be supplied with all the statistical data in relation to the position of Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited because at least £4,000,000 of the taxpayer's money could be involved in the company's affairs under the terms of the agreement we are being asked to approve. For a time, that amount will he only guaranteed by the Government, but there are provisions for the termination of the agreement that make it possible for Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited to have everything going to nothing, and for the Government or contracts. Trans-Australia Airlines to be left carrying the swag, to use a queensland term. The Minister also stated in his second reading speech that Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited was in a difficult position. It needed new equipment and, in particular, the latest passenger aircraft, if it were to provide competition. An examination of the situation reveals that Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited has nine DC 4 aircraft. 27 DCS aircraft and three Bristol freighters, a total of 39 aircraft. Trans-Australia Airlines has four DC 4 aircraft, five Convairs and 24 DC 3 aircraft, a Negotiatotal of 33 aircraft. F o r the year ended the 30th June, 1952, Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited, with 39 aircraft, flew 277,000,000 passenger miles, Australian while Trans-Australia Airlines, with 33 Limited, aircraft, flew 320,000,000 passenger miles. It is obvious that Trans-Australia Airlines was gradually pushing Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited out of the airline business. The company realized that in order to maintain its position in the field it would have to purchase additional aircraft. We all arc aware of the difficulties experienced by the airline companies in procuring aircraft. Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited, having failed to procure Convair aircraft, and having realized that its existing aircraft would be obsolescent in two years, was faced with the prospect of investing millions of pounds in the purchase of new aircraft to enable it to compete with Trans-Australia Airlines, which had placed an order in Great Britain some considerable time earlier for the supply of six Vickers Viscount aircraft. Delivery of the aircraft was delayed because the Government held back the final placing of the orders pending the conclusion of consultations with Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited on the proposal for the amalgamation of the two airlines. Mr CI.VD.IS CAMERON -The Vickers Viscount aircraft were ordered, but the Government cancelled the order. that is what occurred. The Minister, in his second-reading speech, also saidThe directors of Australian National Airpany which pioneered an air service from ways approached the Government and proposed the Townsville to Mount Isa and complained amalgamation of Trans-Australia Airlines and that Australian National Airways Proprietary operating a service in competition with Limited. They said that it was not possible it.

Apparently it has not rently the company is waiting to learn contemplated the granting of assistance to whether the Government is of the same Ansett Airways Proprietary Limited or to opinion as it was when the proposal to Butler Limited. Ansett Airways Proprietary wealth Bank was before this chamber. Limited is successfully competing with Trans-Australia Airlines notwithstanding that the fares charged by it are lower than are those charged by the Government airline. I understand that the company has only one mail contract. Under this proposal Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited and Trans-Australia Airlines will share the mail contracts between them. Ansett Airways Proprietary Limited provide services extending from Brisbane to Hobart and as far west as Adelaide. Apparentlj the Government does not regard the company as worthy of assistance, for it is solely concerned in the assistance of Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited which is owned by overseas and local shipping combines which, if they were prepared to do so, would have no difficulty in obtaining the £4.000,000 required for the purchase of additional nirciaft. I propose no.v to deal briefly with some aspects of the agreement which is set out in the schedule to the bill The agreement contains some extraordinary provisions. It states that one of the purposes of the agreement is to ens/.rc the maintenance of competition between the Government airline and Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited and it sets out the arrangements for the rationalization of the two airline organizations. This afternoon, the honourable member for Capricornia ( Mr Pearce) referred to a Queensland airline comProprietary Limited, therefore, Trans-Australia Airlines was tailed.

AppaAir Transport Proprietary alter the constitution of the Common-",98,Cameron Ho W Many So Very Profitably And Australia Would
285,Mr Riordan,"T t is possible thatHonorable members will recall that at that time petitions were presented to the Parthe age of about SO years. liament urging the Government to submit the Commonwealth Bank bill to a referendum of the people before it interfered with the constitution of the bank. Why should not a proposal of this kind, which may involve the expenditure of £4,000,000 of the taxpayer's money, be submitted to a referendum of the people? In addition to the loan of £3,000,000 which the Government is to guarantee for the purchase of new aircraft, an amount of £1,000,000 is to be guaranteed for the purchase of used aircraft. Provision has been made in the agreement for repayment, of the loan to be. made within ten years of the date of the passage of this bill. The company must repay its borrowed money at the end of fifteen years, and if it does not do so the Commonwealth can terminate the agreement. That is a loophole in the agreement which could enable Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited, if it discovered that it was not making a profit and was not able to repay the money owing and could not pay dividends, to have the agreement terminated and arrange for the Government to take over whatever assets it might have left. This agreement is all in favour of Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited and certainly not in favour of the Government. The Minister for Territories said that there was some serious doubt about the legality of the Government imposing a charge for the use of its aerodromes and air navigation aids. That is too silly for words. It is obvious that the Government can make a charge for the service that it provides, and, indeed, Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited recognizes that right because there is a provision in the bill under which the Government agrees not to proceed with the action in the High Court, in which it is claiming about £750,000 from Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited in respect of air charges. In the event of a dispute between the parties to the agreement an arbitrator, who is to be a retired justice of the High Court of Australia, is to decide the matter. That arbitrator will he an elderly gentleman, because High Court Mr JJiordon. justices do not retire until they attain able member's time has expired. I am sure that the House realizes that the honourable member for Kennedy( Mr Riordan) has been quite off the beam. He must have imagined that he was still Minister for the Navy, because he was all at sea. I do not consider that under those circumstances it is necessary for me to reply to his statements. I have listened during this debate to the Labour party's concerted attack on this measure, but I have been unable to understand the logic of their so called arguments. This is merely n common-sense bill and there is no need for all the screaming from the Opposition that we have been forced to listen to. The Opposition apparently is trying to make the people believe that Trans-Australia Airlines assets are being destroyed for the benefit of rich shipping companies. It is the same old socialist cry raised to foment class war. The truth is that this Government is, in effect, protecting the people's assets by . this measure, and the bill is not an attack on Trans-Australia Airlines at all. In the second-reading speech of the Minister for Territories ( Mr Hasluck), it was pointed out that Trans-Australia Airlines is a very worthy organization and that some splendid officers are attached to it. It -is a shame that tihey should feel that there is anything to their discredit .in what has transpired during the debate. Trans-Australia Airlines is an excellent organization, and has been well managed. This bill carries no criticism whatsoever of Trans-Australia Airlines as at present constituted. The measure merely attempts to ensure that our air transport system shall be conducted efficiently, that the people shall get the best possible service and that no monopoly shall be created either by the Government or by private enterprise. The bill does not provide for anything in the nature of a gift to Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited, although every speaker from the Opposition has tried to create that impression. The Government's transactions with Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited are merely simple",101,Cameron Ho W Many So Very Profitably And Australia Would
286,Mr Speaker,Order ! The honor,102,Cameron Ho W Many So Very Profitably And Australia Would
287,Mr Cramer (Bennelong) [1.38 A.m.].,"business transactions and the proposition contained in the measure is designed to -.'liable both major airline concerns to remain active and in f a i r competition. U f the Government had not taken the action embodied in the agreement, the alternative would have been the establishment of a monopoly because the Government would have had to buy Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited and combine it with Trans-Australia Airlines, or Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited would have had to buy the Government concern. In either way a monopoly would have been set up, and this Government does not tolerate monopolies. Honourable members opposite have said time and time again that the Government will provide £3,000,000 or £4,000,000 for the use of Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited. That is quite incorrect. It is possible that, the Government may advance some money for certain purposes, but really all that the Government is undertaking to do is to guarantee the company in its borrowings from the Commonwealth Bank. Proprietary Limited has clone a magnificent job for civil aviation in Australia. To a large degree it pioneered the air services between our capital cities, and during the last war it did excellent, work for Australia. I shall quote the words of the honourable member for Maribyrnong ("" Mr Drakeford), who was the Minister fnr Civil Aviation in the previous Labour Government. On the 18th July, 1945. hp said in this HouseThe civil aviation industry in Australia during this war has performed magnificent serto establish Trans-Australia Airlines at vice. Civil aircraft and civil aircrews, have been used in war zones to aid our own fni-rrs and those of ouv great ally, the United States and no real need for the setting up of of America in many perilous undertakings. Many of the air transport services required by our allies have been performed wholly by civil aircrews; and many civil aviation personnel joined the Royal Australian A i r Force aviation. It is still the purpose of the providing a ready-trained nucleus. I mention this to indicate the importance of civil aviaall other aircraft out of the air That tion in the air strength of the nation. Notwithstanding the honourable member's recognition of the sterling service of Australian prietary Limited, because practically the whole of his statement related to that company, he still continued his efforts to socialize the airlines of Australia. The year 1945 was to be a great year of achievement for the Labour party. When the war ended plans had already been made for widespread socialization. The party purposed putting into operation its scheme for complete socialization. In that year an effort was made to introduce banking legislation with the clear purpose of attempting to nationalize the banks. In that year also the medical profession was attacked. The Labour Government also sought the socialization of many other industries. C i v il aviation came under notice at the same time. Proof of that may be seen in a statement that was made by the Acting Prime Minister( Mr Forde) on the 22nd November, 1944, in this House. He saidThe Government has decided that a wholly government-owned statutory authority be formed to take over, operate and maintain all interstate airlines . This policy does provide for the permanent taking over of interstate airlines, and it will be the subject of a bill which will be introduced in thi? Parliament probably in the new year. That was a direct statement of the inten-"" Australian National Airways tion of the Labour party on this matter. Honourable members know the sequel. TheH i g h Court of Australia came to the rescue again. The Labour Government kept on with its purpose of endeavouring to socialize the industry through the back door, just as it had attacked the banks. It is a fact that the people were encouraged to invest and did, in fact, invest in the private airlines which pioneered the great air services of Australia. Private capital would still have been subscribed had the Labour Government not attempted that time. There was no public demand Trans-Australia Airlines. The organization was established for the express purpose of completely nationalizing civil Labour party, as it was then, to knock has been proved to-night. To do that the Labour Government had to establish unfair competition and that was done. National Airways ProThat was proved by the way in which Government contracts and airmails were handed over to Trans-Australia Airlines. The point is that, ""in this case, the business was taken away from Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited. Some of that business is to be put in the way of Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited again, for, after all, it was taken away from the company when Trans-Australia Airlines was established. Trans-Australia Airlines has done a great job, but the last balance-sheet of the organization reveals nothing to crow about in the way of profits. For several years certain profits were made, but an accumulated deficit of £870,0S9 is still shown in the profit and loss appropriation account. Looking at the accounts as a businessman, I believe that not sufficient reserve has been provided for depreciation. Trans-Australia Airlines is a good organization, it also has been losing money, just as tralian National Airways Proprietary Limited has been doing. I have no figures with regard to the finances of Australian prietary Limited, but I know that it has had losses and that it could not provide new aircraft to maintain an efficient service unless some guarantee were given to it to enable it to purchase new aircraft. This bill is definitely with Liberal party polities. apologies for it in any shape or form. The Liberal party stands for fair play, private enterprise, the right of competition and all those things that are necessary to provide efficient services for the people. that it stands definitely and solely for honourable member must withdraw it. nationalization less of where it leads the people. stand by Liberal party policy. recall no measure greater pleasure in supporting. bill is in the interests of the people. less and that this measure will be of It is not intended merely to give benefit benefit to the community as a whole. to a private organization as the Labour party has suggested. utter nonsense. for Hindmarsh has said that the Government £3,000,000 or £4,000,000 for National but, that it cannot find money for housing. reported:Have honourable members ever heard such nonsense?

Either Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited must get the money privately or the Government must provide it. In the interests of the country, it is better that the Government should give the guarantee that is provided for in the agreement. The honourable member for Hindmarsh also said that the Government was forcing Trans-Australia Airlines to hand over half its business to Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited. Is it not f a i r to say that the Government is only giving backto Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited some of the business that was taken away from it by the AusLabour party when it was endeavouring to socialize this industry ? The honourable member also asked why the Liberal party was showing such compassion for AusNational Airways Protralian National Airways Proprietary Limited. The Government is not concerned with any sectional interest. The people are the only concern of the Liberal party. It works for the interests of the people as a whole.

294,"Osborne, F . M . Mr Keon Asked The Minister Repre","Mr EK IC J . HARRISON -The Minister for Trade and Customs has supplied the following information:1. Importation of newsprint for years ending the 30th June, 1940 to 1952Year ending 30th June. Tons. 1946 1947 1948 1949 . . 1950 . . 1951 1952 . . Total 2. Importation of newsprint for months of July and August, 1952Month-1952 . Tons. July. . August Total 3. The import figures supplied give an indication of what import licences have been issued in the same period. To supply details of the import licences issued would involve considerable work and it is regretted that in existing circumstances the staff cannot be made available to undertake it. In any case, for several years during the period imports of newsprint from non-dollar countries were for the most part exempt from import licensing. 4. In instances where there have been increases in imports of newsprint they have been the result of greater availability. ter representing the M in is t e r for T r a d e and Customs, u p o n not i c e 1. Is it a fact that import licences will be granted immediately to allow French motor tyres to be imported into Australia? 2. Are tyres comparable with French tyres being manufactured and supplied by Australian manufacturers? 3. Is a large number of employees of the tyre manufacturing industries of Australia unemployed at the present time? 4. If import licences are to be issued and in view of the position of the tyre manufacturing industries in Australia, wil l he give to the Australian manufacturers a prior opportunity of demonstrating that Australian tyres ca» and will stand up to any test required by users ? for Trade and Customs has supplied th« following information:Quantity. Value. 1. Yes. 2. Australian manufacturers do not produce and supply tyres which, for some pur£A. f.o.b. poses, give equivalent performance to steel 101,742 1,911,147 mesh tyres. 163,341 4,290,814 3. It is understood that there is some un117,383 3,561,473 employment in the Australian tyre manufac95,455 4,239,470 turing industry which is due, in the main, to a 146,218 5,860,698 fall in the local demand for tyres. 121,774 6,156,690 4. The import licensing controls were intro165,540 17,180,201 duced solely for the purpose of correcting a serious deterioration which had taken place 911,453 43,200,493 in our external financial .position and are aimed at restricting our expenditure to the level of our overseas income. The controls arc not intended as measures to protect local industries and it would be most undesirable if they were used for that purpose. The Quantity. Value. Customs Tariff is the appropriate medium for according protection to industries and an established procedure exists whereby an indus£A. f.o.b. try, which considers that the existing rates 12,684 1,126,539 of duty on a particular commodity do not 5,180 410,035 afford adequate protection, may request that the matter be referred to the Tariff Board 17,864 1,536,674 for public inquiry and report. Under the import licensing controls, there are no prohibitions on the importation of any goods. In the administration of the controls, however, account is taken of the availability of suitable alternative supplies from local production. It is for this reason that the licensing of tyres, since the 8th March, 1952, has been on a greatly reduced scale in comparison with importations in similar periods over the last few years. Licences are, in fact, only being issued for minimum quantities consistent with the general policy that there shall be no prohibitions. The question of the quality of locally manufactured tyres would not provide any justification for reducing the current level of licensing and a demonstration, as suggested, would not have any immediate bearing on this matter.

The Australian Dried Fruits Association has not taken part in negotiations with the British Ministry of Food on dried fruits contract matters. The Dried Fruits Control Board was represented at the negotiations in respect of the sale of the 1952 crop by Messrs. P . Malloch and E . J . Casey, two of the grower representatives on the board. 2. I' am informed that these gentlemen did not visit any country other than the United Kingdom. 3. The costs of the visit were borne by the board. The Government did not assist financially. ter for Labour and National Service, upon noticeW ill he state what action the Government intends to take against the miners' federation, the Workers Industrial Union of Australia, the Waterside Workers Federation, or any other union that closes its books to new members? able member's question is as follows:The question concerns matters of government policy. The honourable member's attention is, however, invited to section 8 3 A of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, which confers certain rights on persons seeking admittance to organizations registered under that act. ing for the Postmaster-General, upon notice1. How many tenders were received in each State, when last sought, for advertising contracts for the classified section of the official telephone directories? 2. What were the names of the tenderers in each State and who were the successful tenderers in each instance? 3. What were the conditions of tender and what does the department receive in each State for the contract? 4. To what authority were tenders returnable in each State and what is the personnel of each authority ? 5. Over what periods do the present contracts for the classified section of the telephone directoryextend ? 6. Is it a fact that contractors insist on at least six months' payment in advance for advertising insertions and that charges are based on a half-yearly tenure although telephone directories are issued at much greater' intervals? answers to t h e 7. Is it a fact that (a) advertising contractors make their own subdivisions of certain industries, (6) charge for additional insertions without the approval of advertisers and (o) levy additional charges without the approval or authority of the firms and persons concerned? 8. W ill he consider investigation by an i ndependent authority of allegations involving excessive advertising charges and unwarranted profits by the present contractors, particularly in Sydney and Melbourne? 0. Are there unsatisfactory aspects of the current service? 10. If so, -will he investigate the possibilities of establishing an advertising section of the department to exercise the same technical functions as those now carried out by the contractors? Sir EARL E PAQE -The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follows:1. New South Wales, 2; Victoria, 2 ; Queensland, 5; South Australia, 3; Western Australia, 7; Tasmania, 4. 2. The successful tenderers were as follows: -Ne w South Wales and Victoria-Edward H . O'Brien Proprietary Limited; Queensland and South Australia-Directorie s (Australia) L i m it e d; Western Australia-Country Publicity Company; Tasmania-The Critic Proprietary Limited (since taken ovor . by Directories (Australia) Limited). It is not the policy to divulge the names of unsuccessful tenderers, as such action is not considered desirable in the public interests and might be regarded by the tenderers concerned as a breach of confidence. the tender schedule is necessarily very comprehensive and the conditions are too extensive to be set out in detail in this .reply. If desired, a copy of the schedule w ill be supplied to' the honourable .member. The amounts received by the department for the advertising rights vary from issue to issue of the directories, depending on the amount of advertising matter inserted in the books. For the 1951 issues the amounts were-Ne w South Wales, £104,000; Victoria, £104,000; Queensland, £12,450; South Australia, £8,930; Western Australia, £6,750; Tasmania, £1,370. 4. All tenders were returnable to the Director, Posts and Telegraphs, Melbourne. They were examined by a tender board consisting of the heads of the Telephone, Finance and Stores Branches, who submitted a recommendation fox consideration by the Director General of Posts and Telegraphs. 1 5. The contracts in ' New South Wales and Victoria w ill end with the 1953 issues and in the other States -with the 1953 issues. 6. As the department is committed for the expense of printing the advertisements some time before an issue' is published, the advertising contractors are required to pay",106,Tyres

301,Mr Cebmean Asked The Minister Act,"to the department in advance of the publication date a substantial portion of the total amount which wil l become payable for the particular issue. It is possible, therefore, that some contractors may require advance payment of portions of amounts payable to them by clients for advertising insertions in the directories, but the matter is one for determination by the advertising contractors themselves and the department has not specific knowledge of the practices followed. The charges for advertisements are based on a display period of twelve months; between publications. 7 (o). No. (6) and (o). Not to the department's knowledge. The maximum prices chargeable for advertising matter in the directories arc fixed under the contracts and the contractors are not permitted to charge higher prices without the approval of the department. They may, however, require a c'icut to pay for art work or the cost of providing blocks in connection with a:i advertisement, which is not wbo'.ly sot up in type. It is usual for advertising organizations generally to require clients to meet this expense. 8. No. The nrices charged for advertising matter in the directories are considered' to be reasonable and there is no evidence to support the allegation that the contractors are making unwarranted profits. 0. The department is satisfied with the present system and the firms concerned satisfactorily carry out the conditions of the contracts. 10.
