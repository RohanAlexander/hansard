Prime Minister a question. Before doing so I might say that we are all very glad to see him back again. I hope he will not put too great a strain on his health by attending the Parliament before he is completely recovered. I ask him whether he is yet in a position to say when the Federal election will be held. Is it a fact that he has it in mind to hold the election on 26th November? Is it also a fact that the divisional returning officers have been advised to engage halls on both 26th November and 3rd December? If this decision has been taken, has it anything to do with the proposed visit of President Johnson to Australia? If it has, does the Government intend to invite President Johnson to Australia for its own political advantage? the Leader of the Opposition spoilt an excellent introduction to his question by the concluding passage. IfI might revert to the introduction, may I say that I appreciate his comment, as I appreciated also the kind inquiry he made as to my progress some few days ago. I welcome his suggestion that I do not overexert myself for the remainder of the session. He asked what is the election date. I have been doing all my planning, as I announced publicly some time ago, on the basis that the election will be held on 26th November. The only factor which has left any uncertainty in my mind is the necessity to pass legislation of an essential character. I am hoping that with the programme which has been proposed by the Leader of the House, and with the reasonable co-operation, which is always forthcoming on these matters, of the representative of the Opposition, we shall succeed in getting through the programme of business without undue inconvenience and over a reasonable spread of hours. That would enable us to say with authority and certainty that the election will be held on 26th November. As to a visit to this country hy President Johnson, I hope that all sections of this Parliament would join in welcoming such a visit. There has never been a visit to this country by an American dent Johnson was here before. President was here during the Second World War. Indeed, he did me the honour of showing me a film he had taken in Australia at that time. I would certainly hope that, having got as far as the Philippines, he would find it possible to include a journey to Australia in his itinerary before he returned. Unfortunately, there is no confirmation of this. The President had from my predecessor an open ended invitation to visit this country. That was renewed by me when I was in the United States earlier this year. It would, I am sure, give great pleasure and satisfaction to the overwhelming majority of Australians if the President could make such a visit at this time. The honourable gentleman suggests that there might be some political motive for this. I can assure him that whilst we would welcome a visit by the President we do not need that to defeat the Opposition. Minister for Shipping and Transport. Has the Australian National Line vessel "" Musgrave Range"" been delayed from drydocking in Brisbane by industrial unrest? What was the basis of this unrest? Will this delay prejudice future dockings of this and other A.N.L. vessels in Brisbane? stances to which the honourable gentleman refers were these: The"" Musgrave Range"" was due to have some repairs and maintenance work done in Brisbane, but a vessel already in the dock was held up by an industrial dispute. That dispute did not directly concern the "" Musgrave Range"". The result was that the "" Musgrave Range"" was delayed for two days from going into the dock for its repair work. Fortunately, on this occasion, the "" Musgrave Range"" was able to do engine repairs while waiting its turn in the dock. But as to getting dock work done in Brisbane in future, tbe possibility of this kind of delay occurring will undoubtedly be a factor which will influence",7,Setup

The right honourable gentleman will recollect that his predecessor in September last year expressed the hope that the House would have the report during last year's Budget session and, in October, said that he would do his best to see that it was made available for debate during that session.

General whether his attention has been drawn to a statement that his Department has refused to instal postal services and money order, telephone and telegraphic facilities at the townships of Savage River and Luina on the west coast of Tasmania. Could the Minister advise me of any departmental plans to ensure that these essential services will be made available and that they will be adequate to meet the needs of members of the work force and their families in these isolated mining areas with the minimum of delay and inconvenience? two Tasmanian newspapers of comments by the Tasmanian Premier with regard to the provision of telephone and postal facilities to the towns which the honourable member has mentioned. I should like to point out in reply that the Post Office has a policy which it applies not only to big organisations such as the company which operates the Savage River undertaking but also to private individuals within the Australian community. It is that the Department will carry the responsibility for extensions from existing services for a distance of 60 chains. This represents a total cost of $1,056.

Towards the middle of next year, Shipping and Transport and I , with the there will be in operation a high power authority of the Cabinet, suggested in a installation which will provide some 12 joint statement that companies should make channels and which will be adequate for the needs of the area. The Postmaster-General's Department proposes to install an automatic exchange at Waratah considerably earlier than might have been normally required. The Department has also undertaken very substantial additions to the trunk line facilities along the north coast of Tasmania to enable them to carry the additional traffic that will flow from the Savage River area. I point out to the honourable member that the operation of the telephone services within the Savage River complex will be under the control of the company and there will be no rental charges and no call charge for the internal arrangement. At present, temporary post office facilities are provided at the company canteen. The Post Office is now negotiating for the establishment of a non-official post office in the area on a basis similar to that of non-official post offices established at many other places throughout Australia. I believe that the criticism offered by the Tasmanian Premier was completely unjustified.

19,Mr Mcewen,"I believe that the honorto the Government proposals touching the carriage in bulk vessels of Australian bulk commodities shipped overseas. This is part of a proposal that we think would result in the establishment of a viable overseas shipping line transporting bulk commodities in large bulk carriers. Obviously, for those who interested themselves, the proposal would involve consideration of the expenditure of millions of pounds, substantial financial involvements otherwise and the arrangement of contracts for carriage. These are considerations that are not likely to have produced a result in the shape of firm proposals in the few weeks since our announcement was made. I have every confidence that there will be made to the Government proposals which will turn out finally to be acceptable to it and which will lead for the first time to the establishment of an overextremely well in their new role of civic seas shipping line under the Australian flag to undertake the transport of bulk cargoes. But this is a thing that I would not expect to be rushed. involved troops in Vietnam, will the right honourable gentleman give an assurance that he will obtain from the United States Government a firm guarantee that the United States forces in Vietnam will not use nuclear weapons without prior consultation with the Australian Government? heard it suggested that the United States had contemplated the use of nuclear weapons in Vietnam. I am certain that in all matters of consequence relating to the future course of events there the United States will continue to keep in the closest touch with Australia, as it has in the past. Defence seen a report in the "" Courier Mail"" of 26th September of a statement made on television by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that Australian forces in South Vietnam are making no military difference to the war in that country? The Deputy Leader of the Opposition having yesterday informed the House that the "" Courier-Mail"" report was accurate, will the Minister say whether there is any factual basis for such a description of the role of Australian forces in South Vietnam? In particular, will the Minister say whether there has been, since the Deputy Leader of the Opposition reportedly said in Saigon on l l t h August that the Australian Army forces in Vietnam had done extremely well in the fighting and in social work, any development in the military situation affecting Australian troops which would justify the apparent inconsistency between what the Deputy Leader of the Opposition said in Saigon in August and what he said on television the other day? be called upon to explain the inconsistently in the statements made by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, but I recall that during his visit to Saigon he was reported to have said that Australian troops had done workers and soldiers, or words to that effect. Accepting what was said in the House yesterday when the honourable gentleman himself declared that the report of his statement in the "" Courier-Mail"" was correct, there is no doubt that he did say that the Australian presence in Vietnam is not militarily useful, or words to that effect. This is not a view which is likely to be acceptable or popular amongst the 4,500 Australian troops in the task force involved in Vietnam. Nor is it likely to be a view which would be subscribed to by the United States command, which has given to the control of our task force one of the most vital sectors in South Vietnam-the Phuoc Tuy province. This clearly is evidence of the great contribution made by the Australian military commitment to Vietnam. If the honourable gentleman is so concerned that 4,500 people make so little contribution to the military situation, I wonder why he is so enormously enthusiastic about what would no doubt be a comparable contribution to the civic aid programme. Prime Minister to a question that 1 asked on 22nd September regarding the Government's instructions to our representative with the United Nations relating to any proposal that the United Nations supervise a ceasefire in Vietnam, a phased withdrawal of all combatants there and the dismantling of military bases.

The statement, naturally, would have to be settled finally by me before it reaches the honourable gentleman. One factor which might have affected the supply of the statement is that my colleague, the Minister for External Affairs, has within recent hours stated in the United Nations the Australian view on a number of these matters, including the general matter of Vietnam. Possibly there has been delay until his statement had been publicly made. I will follow up the matter after question time. ( Mr Drury having addressed a question to the Minister for Health)ing Speaker. 1 think that if you look at the notice paper you will find that it has a questralian industry if considerations of time, tion on this subject. honourable member quote the number of the question? on this subject and No. 2076 is another. question is on the notice paper. Minister for Defence regarding certain Press headlines which slate that a crisis surrounds the production of defence equipment by Australian manufacturers. Can the Minister say whether a crisis does exist and, if so, what is being done about it? the honourable gentleman that there is nothing approaching a crisis in the relations of the Australian Government with Australian industry about the production of defence equipment. There is no deep seated difference of opinion between the two groups. There are matters for discussion in this field and discussions are being carried on quietly and sensibly. They will produce a useful result. I have been involved in one or two quite amicable conferences with groups from the manufacturing industries. They have been designed to clarify the matters that appear to be at issue and to explain why the Government feels compelled to do certain things which, in plain terms, are not always understood by the manufacturing industries. Inevitably, when a problem of this kind gets into the public domain, there is exaggeration, there are headlines and the whole picture tends to get out of perspective. IfI may, I will quote the honourable gentleman some figures out of last year's Budget, that for 1965-66. The equipment component of the defence vote was $272 million. Of this, SI 18 million was in what might be called the big ticket items, such as sophisticated aircraft, warships and electronic equipment which cannot be made in Australia or which for a variety of quite valid reasons cannot be left to Australian industry. At the other end of the scale, some $140 million worth of equipment was bought from Australian industry. So the matter left in debate is one of perhaps $15 million worth of equipment which could conceivably be built by Ausor cost or other matters were not involved. It is on this expenditure that discussion centres at the moment. But in view of the fact that the output of Australian secondary industry is something like $6,000 million, this is a mere bagatelle in terms of dollars, although I readily admit that it could be important in terms of its technical component. There are other important matters to which the Government must pay considerable attention. I think experience has shown that, when equipment in small quantities is required from Australian industry, a long time is taken to produce it, because our research and development component is necessarily small. The cost may reach two or three limes that of the comparable equipment from overseas. There is in operation a logistic arrangement with the United States Government which offers great advantages to Australia in access to' inventories, spare parts and things of that kind. These are all circumstances that qualify how much of our defence equipment can be procured from Australian sources. 1 can assure the honourable gentleman that the whole of this field is being patiently discussed with the manufacturing industries at the moment and I venture to suggest that the questioner and industry will be quite satisfied with the outcome.",15,Vietnam

31,Mr Fairhall,"I am happy to assuret y Party meeting in Perth some time ago the Minister for Trade and Industry said that Australia's export income would have to double in the next 10 years if our necessary economic growth were to continue, and that without that export performance we would be unable to finance the imports which were essential to our developmental needs. Will the Minister say whether he or the Government has a plan to increase Australia's export earnings to the extent he jlaims is essential, or will the Government jj.st leave it to chance and hope that such -n increase will take place? vernment has and pursues in respect of the encouragement of greater export earnings for Australia is the policy of the Government in respect of a whole variety of matters with which I think the honourable member is familiar. IfI remind him that Australia's export income has almost doubled in the last 10 years that will give him some confidence that the policies of this Government will result in our export income doubling again in the next 10 years. the Minister for Trade and Industry. Is the Minister concerned with the actual and potential damaging effect on export industry of the continuing activities of known Communists in key positions in industry, as instanced by the recent trouble at the State Electricity Commission establishments in Victoria which caused loss of production in many export industries? As the average Australian seems apathetic to the functions of these Communists within Australia will the Government take more action to bring their activities to the notice of the Australian people so that they may more fully understand the threat of internal Communism? responsible Australians are concerned that the activity and influence of avowed Communists in certain positions of influence operate in a manner harmful to the Australian economy and, on occasions, harmful to the interests of Australian export industries. Since the attempt of the Government of Sir Robert Menzies, then Mr Menzies, to acquire constitutional power to deal directly with this situation, the position has been that the Government has but minimum direct authority, so it does become a matter of developing an awareness on the part of the Australian community to the dangers to the Australian community of the occupancy of key strategic positions in industry by Communists who have as their objective the weakening of the Australian economy. to the Minister for National Development. Have advanced tests now proved beyond doubt that the Victorian natural gas is of a type well suited to the manufacture of nitrogenous fertilisers? Are similar tests being carried out on the natural gas deposits of South Australia? Has the Minister received any indication of whether or not Moomba and/or Gidgealpa natural gas is suitable for the manufacture of nitrogenous fertiliser? Is he able to provide the House with any information on the Federal Government's attitude towards State representation and participation in providing natural gas pipelines as common carriers? Victoria and in the Gidgealpa-Moomba area is suitable for making ammonia. However, when tbe establishment of a production plant is under consideration, questions arise as to the cost of the natural gas and the likely demand for the product where it is manufactured. Of course, ammonia can also be manufactured from coal and oil. The second part of the honourable members question relates to a matter of Government policy. When we are able to give him a reply on it I will ensure that he gets one.

In fact, members of the delegation held a number of discussions with individual members of the South Vietnamese Government, the staff of the United States Embassy and the American armed forces. There was one particular occasion when General Westmoreland and members of the staff of the American Embassy in South Vietnam were present at a private dinner at the Australian Embassy. On no occasion was there any suggestion that members of the American forces or of the staff of the American Embassy .were under the impression that the Australian Government had given any undertaking to commit forces other than those presently in service in Vietbody else. 1 have said that this Government nam to operations there. There was some discussion about future needs. There was some discussion about civilian aid. But all this was in terms of an assessment of the totality of the situation. There was no indication by any member of the American forces or of the staff of the United States Embassy that the Americans were under the impression that further Australian forces would be committed in Vietnam. Rather, the general indications were that the South Vietnamese Government and the Americans were very grateful for the assistance being provided by the Australian Government and the Australian Service personnel. The Americans and members of the Government of South Vietnam spoke in laudatory terms of the positive contribution that was being made by the Australian personnel to the advancement of peace in the Phuoc Tuy Province at present and previously in the Bien Hoa region where they had been in operations.

I am in no position to comment on the discussion that is alleged to have taken place between a member of this Parliament and General Westmoreland. denied by the Minister for Social Services, who led the delegation. I am not in a position to comment on any such conversation. It is said to have been held. I am in no position to confirm it or to challenge the accuracy of the statements supposed to have been made. I repeat something that I put on record on an earlier occasion. I am able to say that decisions about the size and composition of Australian forces in South Vietnam are taken by the Australian Government and by nohas taken no decision to increase our forces in South Vietnam. I have said further that from time to time we review the size and composition of the Australian forces there. When any change in the composition of our forces is decided on, the decision is made public. I repeat that there has come to my notice no request by the Government of South Vietnam, which would be the appropriate source of a formal request, by the Government of the United States of America or by any officer of that Government concerning the current size of Australia's military representation in South Vietnam. It is quite conceivable that military men, when they come together, discuss a variety of contingencies.

Instead, the Government proceeded to debate the Estimates. man is seeking limelight. shelve the first Bill. tion seconded? the motion. The Minister for Civil Aviation( Mr Swartz) has attempted to repeat in its entirety a speech that he has already made. The Opposition has already placed on record in this Parliament, particularly in relation to the issue which the Minister is now debating, its vio-t' that the Government has nothing but utter contempt for ex-servicemen and their rights. We have moved dissent from your ruling, Mr Acting Speaker, to highlight the injustice inflicted on the Opposition, probably with the best of intentions, and at the same time to give us an opportunity to show the complete contempt with which the Government treats the Parliament and ex-servicemen. What grounds does the Minister have for attempting to make now the same speech as he made on a measure which, through the action of the Labour Party, was amended in another place? The Government will not give one inch in this matter. It wants to take whatever credit it can for itself. It refuses to acknowledge that the Opposition has been responsible for forcing through amendments which are of vital connot allow the Government to get away with cern to the people of this country. Standing Order No. 85, under which the the recipients of repatriation benefits. Seated motion is moved, refers to irrelevance and on the Government side of the House, to tedious repetition. What is more tedious their credit, are many members-probabl y than the Minister making the same speech the majority of them-wh o fought and twice within two days? Once is bad enough. served this country well, but no-one in the It would not be so bad if this were a tin Parliament gives less service to the cause pot issue, but repatriation is one of the most of ex-service men and women in legislation important issues to come before the Parthan do those who sit opposite when liament. At a time when men are being repatriation benefits are before the conscripted, this Government refuses the Parliament. Opposition the opportunity to debate fully in a democratic way the rights that ex-servicemen shall have. If the Government honourable member for Grayndler is getting will not look after veterans of the Boer War, wide of the subject before the Chair. what chance does a kid have? None at this stage. Under the provisions of the legislation that the Minister is introducing, the totally and permanently incapacitated ex-serviceman will receive less than the basic wage. Even the Returned Services League was moved to protest at this. We today have taken a point of order so that the Minister will not again deliver the speech that he made yesterday. But he insists upon doing so and has forced us to the point where we must dissent from your ruling, Mr Acting Speaker. I suggest that you, as a man of wisdom and understanding, must know in your heart that, in the terms of Standing Order No. 85, the Minister's speech today is irrelevant and tedious repetition, and that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Whitlam) is quite in order in raising this point. I do not want to prolong the debate. I know full well that the Government will gag it if it is not too ashamed to use the gag for the second time in a day. The Government has shelved the previous Bill and I suppose it would not be too much to expect that it will gag this debate. But is it not remarkable that, if we are not debating repatriation matters in the dead of night, we are doing so on a Wednesday when the proceedings of this House are not broadcast and the people cannot hear our recital of the shortcomings of the Government? Is it any wonder that the Government is shelving the other Bill? After all, it is very touchy on this issue, particularly with the Vietnam war in progress and a third battalion to be despatched as soon as the election is over. So the Government gags the debate on repatriation. I do not like adverting to this, but I will it. It is touchy because it is letting down Motion (by Mr Fairbairn) putThat the quesuon be now put.",25,Objection To Ruling

This is a new Bill that has been introduced and this is the second reading speech to explain the terms of this .. . . 41 particular measure. I would also point out ..' . . 57 that this Mr Allan FraserI rise to order. I 16 raise the point of order that under the",26,Objection To Ruling
118,Mr Swartz (Darling Downs,"Ministe rStanding Orders the Minister has no right to proceed with his second reading speech because, as I shall show, Repatriation Bil! [No. 2] has not been circulated to honourable members. The position is, as you know Mr Acting Speaker, that the Minister can proceed to the second reading only if the Bill on which he wishes to make the second reading speech has been circulated to honourable members. This is Repatriation Bill [No. 2]. If you will examine the Bill which has been circulated to members and which purports to be Repatriation Bill [No. 2] you will see that there is no such description on it. It is not Repatriation Bill [No. 2]; it is simply described as "" Repatriation Bill"". Mr Bill out and is presenting another Bill Acting Speaker, in the ordinary course of events I might not take this point, but it is essential that every point of order should be taken as will prevent the Government from using a device to prevent veterans obtaining the hospital treatment to which they are entitled. regard to the point of order raised by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro, I point out that the correct Bill has been circulated to honourable members. The designation "" [No. 2 ] "" has been applied to thc Bill to distinguish it for the benefit of honourable members. It was an administrative use of the figure "" 2 "". term. purpose of differentiation. The Bill presented to honourable members is the correct Bill. Mr Allan Fraser Mr Acting Speaker, because of the importance of this issue I move That the ruling be dissented from. the honourable member for Eden-Monaro, I point out that there is no ruling in this case. I have made a statement of fact on the presentation of the Bill, therefore to that degree there is no ruling from the Chair. I have given information from the Chair to the effect that this is the correct Bill referred to by the Minister and presented to honourable members. Mr Allan FraserI raised a point of order, Mr Acting Speaker. Have you given a ruling on my point of order?

[4.24] -Therefore , Mr Acting Speaker, your ruling is that there is no substance in my point of order. I move That the ruling be dissented from. I do so because the rights of returned soldiers to hospital treatment are involved. The Government has thrown the original purporting to be Repatriation Bill [No. 2], when it is not. Do you, Mr Acting Speaker, accept my motion? honourable member for Eden-Monaro put his motion in writing? Mr Allan Fraser -Ves, Sir, I now do so. tion is: ""That the ruling be dissented from "". Acting Speaker, during the proceedings I have had the opportunity to compare yesterday's Bill with the Bill which has just been circulated. There is only one substantial difference between them. There is a clause 14 in today's Bill; there was no such clause in yesterday's Bill. The Minister's speech, of which he has given me a copy, makes no reference to the Bill which has been circulated today insofar as it contains this additional clause. The speech which the Minister is making refers to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that the motion of dissent from my ruling at this given moment is based purely on the fact that I have ruled there is no point of order in the matter raised by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro which was that the Bill had not been presented to honourable members.

It makes no reference to the clause which has now been added to the Bill. Accordingly think the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has not completely grasped what I said. The matter before the House at this given moment is a motion of dissent from my ruling. My ruling was that the Bill had been circulated to honourable members. Therefore, at this given moment neither the content of the Minister's speech nor anything else is relevant. The only factor is that the Bill to which the Minister is referring is before the House.

He has specifically said that he is asking for a procedural ruling, whatever that might be. I put a point of order-the only point of order before you, I think-that the honourable member is speaking to the substance of the Bill. I submit that the Mimster for Civil Aviation has the call. following the remarks of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, that this is a subject matter to be dealt with in the debate on the Bill before the House rather than a procedural matter. the House. Leader of the Opposition will listen for a moment. I can follow what the honourable member for Melbourne Ports is commenting on in regard to the relationship between the Bill before the House at the moment and the otheT Bill on the notice paper. But I do feel that the subject matter raised by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports-and his comments on itinvolves not so much a procedural point, because a procedural point at this moment does not affect the Bill before the House. I think that the subject matter raised by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports is more suitable for debate later in the second reading stage of the Bill than at this point as a procedural matter. trying to point out-and surely we can get agreement upon this-lha t there is already a Bill on the notice paper-ite m No. 22 under Orders of the Day-and there is the Bill that the Minister for Civil Aviation is seeking to have read a second time. Those two Bills are identical in context except for clause 14. Clause 14 has been inserted in this Bill so that it becomes a Bill which the Senate cannot amend. point out to the honourable member for Melbourne Ports-as I pointed out earlier -that the matter he is discussing at this moment should not be debated as a procedural matter or as a point of order. I point out to the House that the time of the Minister for Civil Aviation, wno represents the Minister for Repatriation, has expired. commend the Bill to the House. before the House is, ""That this Bill be now read a second time "". you put the question that the debate be adjourned I want to ask you at what stage in this debate I may state this procedural point. I think with all respect the honourable member will take the call he can put his point immediately in accordance with the Standing Orders. If you give him the call he can proceed forthwith. remind the Attorney-General that under the Standing Orders at the moment he is not correct. The debate cannot proceed forthwith. It must be adjourned. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports can raise the matter he is now speaking about when he is making his second reading speech. This is the ruling I gave previously. When the honourable member for Melbourne Ports will speak, is, of course, in his own hands. I suggest again to the honourable member for Melbourne Ports that this is not the moment to raise the point he is raising. House is entitled to ask the Chair for guidance as to procedure in the House. That, Sir, is what I am seeking. I am asking Honourable members will cease interjecting. claim to be interested in the working of Parliament as an institution should be particularly concerned about this point which I want the opportunity to outline.

Department of Labour and National Service. Proposed expenditure, $8,649,000. [4.56] -In dealing with this section of the Estimates I want to direct my thoughts to the kind of recommendation that the Department of Labour and National Service makes to the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission from time to time when the Commission is hearing applications from the Australian Council of Trade Unions with respect to margins or the basic wage. 1 propose to refer particularly to the proceedings on the last occasion. The Committee will recall that when the case was before the Commission it became public knowledge that the Government's representative had submitted that the Government believed the time had arrived when there should be a moderate increase in the basic wage to stimulate the purchasing power of the community. I presume that was its purpose. At that time. I asked the responsible Minister whether he would indicate to the House the basis of the submission and I asked him also to explain what was meant by the "" moderate increase"" which had been suggested. The Minister replied that the recommendation had been prepared by his Department and he said that he stood by it. As the Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Bury) is now at the table I propose to direct my attention to this subject of Australia no longer want an extra £1 and to the kind of recommendation that the Government makes to the authority which has the power to assess the living standards of Australian workers. The Commission has this power because it fixes the basic wage or the margin, if it happens to be a general case on margins. When I examined the Government's recommendation on the last occasion I became astounded at the type of thinking behind the submission which had been presented to the Commission. The part of the recommendation which of the submission and reads:So the Commonwealth puts the view, with very great respect, that the proper approach is for the members of this bench That was a reference to the full bench of the Commissionand indeed of all multi-membered benches of the Commission, not only to consult together but to do their very utmost, through fullest discussion, to reach a unanimous decision upon the weighty matters lhat are before the Commission. There is no complete analogy that we can put to the Commission. An analogy may be the responsibility of a jury. There is the prime duty of a jury to continue discussion until agreement is reached. Deadlock can occur but it is a relatively rare event. That kind of recommendation to an industrial tribunal which is adjudicating on a dispute which has properly been found by the tribunal to exist and which had arisen from an application for improved conditions for the workers is not the kind of submission, in my view, that should come from a responsible government. Nobody knows the state of the economy better than the Government. It would appear that the next step from the Department of Labour and National Service is to the Treasury. formerly the Minister for Labour and National Service, and the present Prime Minister( Mr Harold Holt) was Minister for Labour and National Service before he became Treasurer. I do not know whether the present Minister hopes to follow in the footsteps of those who went before. I say to the Minister that the time has long passed when this kind of recommendation should be submitted by a responsible government to an authority which has to determine the future standards of the workers, without the Government having had regard to the impact on the national economy of what it is doing. The workers a week in their pockets; what they want is value for the £1 which is already there. If the type of thinking in which the Government has indulged for 17 years continues we will live to see the day when our economy will be wrecked as a result of its submission of reckless recommendations to the Commission. The 1961 decision of the Commission demonstrated what eould happen if we attempted to provide in Australia an effective scheme for the stabilisation of prices.",32,Business Of The House
172,Mr Acting Speaker,Order! The concerns me greatly appears at page 21,33,Appropriation Bill No 1 1966 67
173,Mr E. James Harrison (Blaxland),,33,Appropriation Bill No 1 1966 67
174,The Present Treasurer ( Mr Mcmahon) Was,"There is no doubt in the mind of anyone who has explored what happened after the 1961 decision that the action taken by the Commission at that time had the greatest effect on stabilising our price structure since the 1942 decision when the basic wage and all prices, except where anomalies could be shown, were pegged for four years. If the Government was thinking in terms of what was necessary for an effective price s'ructure in Australia it should have looked at the situation in the period between 1942 and 1946. At that time war pressures and' the impasse in industry brought about by war production would have led to inflation in ordinary circumstances, but the situation was kept on an even keel by the policy adopted by the government of the day. Wages were pegged at a point where the country accepted the theory of quarterly adjustments in the basic wage. This system opera ed from 1942 to 1946 because a ceiling was placed on prices as at 10th February 1942. The result was that, with the operation of the system of quarterly adjustments the cost structure in Australia rose by only 8s. in four years. The present Government saw what happened as a result of the 1961 decision. Without any action on the part of the Government, the Arbitration Commission tried to stabilise price levels, and the Government should have followed that lead. I put it to the Minister and to the Government that if ever a government and a responsible department failed the nation at a time when a golden opportunity presented itself, it was this Government and this Department because they failed to follow up what the Commission had done in 1961. The Government should have recommended strongly to the Commission that no departure be made from the principles laid down in the 1961 decision. 1 remind honourable members that the 1961 decision had reversed the onus of proof requirement, ln the 15 minutes available to me I have not time to analyse the entire decision, but if honourable members will look at the fifth recommendation contained in the judgment they will nnd that the Commission reversed the onus of proof and increased the basic wage by 12s. Because the onus of proof had been reversed, from 1961 to 1964 the cost ment to set up a committee headed by thc structure throughout Australia rose by only President of the Commission which brought 2s. If the Government and, in particular, this Department had been alive to the real value that the 1961 decision bad proved to the nation they would have been on their feet at every opportunity recommending to the Commission that the principles laid down in the decision be not departed from. But that course does not suit this Government. The Government does not want a levelling out of prices in Australia; it wants an increase of £1 in the basic wage. In this session the Government was able to introduce a budget providing a hand-out for social services of $65 million or $70 million. Where does that amount come from? It comes directly from revenue derived from taxation on the £1 a week increase in the basic wage. As a result, between 1961 and 1964 prices remained static, the economy was stabilised and taxation revenue increased by 5 per cent. In 1964, the Commission, having before it the fact that the price structure had risen by only 2s. since 1961, decided that the productivity of the nation had increased to such an extent as to justify its granting to the workers an increase of 18s., in addition to 2s. to cover the rise in prices. I come now to 1965. What the Government did then was to complain about the Commission's decision in 1964. It should really have complained about the decision in 1965. The 1965 decision-the blame for this lies at the door of the Governmentabandoned the onus of proof and laid down that price variations as shown by the "" C "" Series Index or the Consumer Price Index -variation s which had been taken into consideration since 1934-shoul d no longer be considered in assessing the basic wage. From then on there was chaos. After three years of stability there were two years in which there was an upward trend in prices. This gave the Government additional income by way of taxation, but at what cost? If the 1961 decision had been followed again in 1965, things would have been much better, but in fact from 1965 we saw a spiralling of costs and prices. It has not stopped yet. I warn the Government that if this state of affairs continues Australian commodities will be priced out of the world's markets within a decade. We are now living in a much more highly competitive world. I make a strong appeal to the Governdown the 1961 decision. I do not hesitate to mention his name. I believe that the decision given in 1961 was the result of the brainwork of Sir Richard Kirby and of those close to him. I say that the Government should set up a committee presided over by Sir Richard Kirby or someone of equal calibre-someon e who appreciates, as Sir Richard Kirby did in 1961, the need to maintain the value of the money in the worker's pay envelope, someone who realises that any extra money given to the workers by way of an increase of the basic wage to meet price increases can be paid from extra profits. It is tragic that this Government, when formulating recommendations to the Commission since 1961, has not paid due regard to the stabilising eifect on the economy of the Commission's 1961 decision. I know that the present Minister for Labour and National Service did not hold his portfolio in 1961, but I plead with him now to examine, or to set up a committee to examine, the impact which the 1961 decision had on the nation's economy. There can be no denying that breaking away from the principles of that decision has resulted in destruction of the value of the worker's pay envelope. Under present conditions if $4 or $6 were added to the basic wage there would be no possible chance of levelling out the economy unless the captains of industry who make huge pronts had placed upon them the onus of showing why costs and prices should rise because of that increase. It is not an extra $6 that the worker wants. What he wants is to maintain the value of the money already in his pay envelope. What the nation wants is not continual increases of the basic wage by $2 a week but the type of stability that was enjoyed after the Commission gave its decision in 1961. I appeal to the Minister to analyse, A.C.T.U., which, to give it credit, has before it is too late, what happened between endeavoured to bring a stabilising influence 1961 and 1964 and to compare it with what to bear on the trade union movement of happensd between 1942 and 1946. If he Australia in recent years. does so, he will see how prices can be stabilised and how the purchasing power of the workers can be increased without is in the trade union movement a battle causing inflation within the economy. If between the Communist-led shop stewards the Government were to make recommendaand the A.C.T.U. It is a battle which has tions to the Commission based on what was yet to be won, as the honourable member for done in 1961, it would at least be doing Blaxland knows. Whilst not disagreeing something to stabilise prices and to guarantee with many of the things that the honourable the future sale of the nation's products on the world's markets. We cannot expect to go on putting an extra $2 into the worker's pocket and taking $2.50 out. That can only smash the national economy. most interesting to listen to the honourable member for Blaxland( Mr E. James Harrison). I do not disagree with much of what he said. It was interesting to hear him say what the working man or the unionist wants today is not an extra $6 in the basic wage but stability of the value of the money already in his pay envelope. However, I have seen but little sign of this attitude when the annual applications in respect of the basic wage are made to the Commonwealth Arbitration Commission. I do not think the faults are all on the one side. There are faults, but I think they are fairly evenly distributed. I respect the honourable member for Blaxland as one who has fought to restrict the power of those who have sought to disrupt the trade union movement, to damage the Australian economy, to upset the stability of our industries and to lessen the opportunities for the sale of our commodities on overseas markets. But I would have been most interested to hear him comment on what is happening in Victoria at the moment. There is an on and off strike at Yallourn and Morwell, the two areas which produce power for Melbourne and the great industries of Victoriaa strike which does not have the endorsement of the Australian Council of Trade Unions. Indeed, the A.C.T.U. has ordered the trade unionists there to go back to work. There is no doubt in the mind of anybody in Victoria that this strike is inspired by the Communist dominated unions in those areas. The strike has been called not to gain perhaps an extra SI a week but to break the power of the We all know that at the moment there",33,Appropriation Bill No 1 1966 67
175,Mr Jess (La Trobe) [5.11],"It wasmember said, I would bave liked to hear some reference from him to this battle which is going on within the trade union movement, a battle in which the intention of one side is to place the Australian economy in jeopardy, to force up prices to the workers and to disrupt industry and thereby cause discontent within. The honourable member for Blaxland knows just as all other honourable members do that Communism can breed only where there is fertile soil for it to breed-wher e there is disruption and unhappiness. I rose to speak mainly about the rehabilitation of Service personnel, for which provision is made in the estimates for the Department of Labour and National Serdetails of the rehabilitation facilities in other vice.

However, I want to see further advances concessions; and the Korea and Malaya made in the rehabilitation of national sertraining scheme. vicemen and members of the Permanent Army. We must remember that the national servicemen who were called up in the first vide rehabilitation facilities the equal of intake under fhe present scheme will be those that we have provided before to men discharged in about March or April of who serve in Vietnam, Malaysia and other next year on completion of their two years' service. It has always been my opinion and, I think, the opinion of most people who have investigated the rehabilitation facilities available to the members of all the Services of a variety of countries throughout the world that the provision made in Australia for the rehabilitation of servicemen is very good indeed. There may be many things that we think should have been done. We may think that the existing provisions should have been extended or assistance increased in a number of respects. Nevertheless, in these matters Australia stands out when compared with other countries. I should like to give the Committee some ness re-establishment loans and tools of trade; service pensions; telephone rental 1 see no reason why we should not protheatres of risk. We are calling up for service young men in their twentieth year. They are being required to undergo compulsory training. I believe that there is an obligation on the Government and the people of this country to make sure that the rehabilitation facilities provided for them are second to none. I direct attention particularly to the rehabilitation measures that were introduced during and after the last war by the Department of Post-war Reconstruction. Under that scheme, a serviceman who had served overseas was entitled on his return and discharge to various jobs. A suitable rehabilitation scheme will rehabilitation measures, including university training if he wished, or training in a technical college or in any other sphere that he wished to enter. We are calling up today young men aged 20. Many describe them as boys, but I do not regard them as boys. They are young men. A young man may have been working in industry or on a farm. He may have been prepared during his two years of service if he had not previously matriculated, to undertake matriculation with the assistance of the Army Education Service. I do not see why a young man who does this should not, on his return to Australia, if he is suitable and able member lor La Trobe( Mr Jess). I capable, be offered an opportunity to go on to higher learning. Such opportunities would do much to help in the rehabilitation of these young men who are asked to serve. I would like the Government, in the forthcoming year, after it has won the general election, to announce a better and more detailed rehabilitation scheme for our servicemen than we have at present. I distinctly recall what happened after the last war, as f am sure other honourable members do. Great numbers of men returned to Australia after service abroad, aged 22, 23 or 24, and many of them even older. Many decided to take advantage of the rehabilitation scheme offered by the Government of the day. I acknowledge that that was a Labour government and I give it due credit. The scheme that it introduced was a good one and ex-servicemen appreciated it greatly. In the situation in which we find aspect of the responsibilities of the Departourselves today-it is claimed that we are not actually at war, but there can be little doubt in the mind of anybody that we are at warI can see no reason why a man who is sent to Vietnam and who serves his country gloriously and well while he is there should not, on his return home, be given every facility that this country can afford for his rehabilitation. I suggest to the Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Bury) that before the first group of national service trainees is discharged, the best possible rehabilitation facilities be organised for these young gentlemen. I would not like them to have to wait until they have been out of the forces for, say, six or twelve months and have re-established themselves in civilian have to be announced very soon so that these men will know on their return from service that they are entitled to the benefits of the scheme. I am sure that the Minister is sympathetic. I trust that he will use his best endeavours with his colleagues in the Cabinet to ensure that the maximum possible rehabilitation benefits are provided without delay. Deputy Chairman, I agree wholeheartedly with the closing remarks made by the honorbelieve that a man who has still some working life ahead of him will always derive an advantage from further training. There is no age limit in this. Probably not enough thought has been given to the kind of training and educational facilities that ought to be placed at the disposal of men on their discharge from the Services and return to civilian life, whether they are regular soldiers in the strict sense or whether they are young national service trainees. I was 31, I think, when I returned from the last war. Four years of university training were made available to me. Men who served in the last war, of course, knew that this sort of opportunity was available to them on the day when they left the forces. This knowledge had a substantial effect on one's attitude when one began to think about one's return to civilian life in the last days before leaving the forces. This is a very important ment of Labour and National Service and it is probably one on which we all would be in complete agreement with the Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Bury) if he were to develop a wide ranging rehabilitation system.",35,Appropriation Bill No 1 1966 67
176,Mr Bryant (Wills) [5.22],"MrI wish to discuss the national service training scheme as it at present operates. It comes under the administration of the Minister ior Labour and National Service and it has assumed overriding significance in thousands of Australian homes. In 1964, the Government, not exactly lightheartedly, but evidently without much consideration of the implications of the scheme or of the ultimate employment of the men who were to be called up, embarked on the present national service training scheme. It should be made clear to the people of Australia that this scheme does not provide for national service as we used to think of it. The Defence Act makes adequate provision for liability to serve and service in the armed forces of Australia by all males between the ages of 18 and 60, I would think, in Part IV. This has been part of our legislation since 1909 or thereabouts. The Act was amended last year to make it obligatory for men to serve anywhere in the world. The general principles behind the legislation are substantially the same as those that have prevailed for the last half century. I am convinced that the average citizen does not realise the fundamental difference between the system implemented since 1964, now known as national service, and the system by which we recruit for the Regular Army and national service as it was known prior to 1957. This system is a direct descendant of that introduced 13 or 14 years ago, when the first legislation, known colloquially to its victims as Nasho, was introduced. Under that system a man was called up for about 90 days' training and then served in the Citizen Military Forces for a further period. The Australian people were acustomedto the idea; this was part of a pattern, although in recent years the voluntary system has prevailed for the most part. Because of long standing tradition, the people accepted it. In 1964 when the present conscription system was introducedI think it is fair to call it "" conscription"" as distinct from "" national service ""-the average Australian citizen thought that overseas service in the Regular Army would be voluntarily. It was not made clear, although I have no doubt it was stated clearly enough in the House, that this system was designed to fill the Regular Army. I am sure there is confusion in the minds of the citizens of Australia between what you might call "" universal training"", which may be necessary at time. I do not accept that it is necessary now-and conscription into a regular force which is to participate in an overseas expeditionary force, as is presently the case. The present system is fundamentally different from anything that has applied in Australia before. 1 believe it is different even from the system introduced in 1943 when service under the universal provisions of the Defence Act was extended to include the outer reaches of the Australian Territories. Here is something that has been introduced as a basically different concept into Australian military and national thinking. I am still concerned that the people of Australia do not realise all the implications of this system, moral and otherwise. Why did the Government have to introduce it? I suppose there were two reasons. One was the failure of recruiting but perhaps the major reason was that our foreign policy was demanding a greater regular commitment in the forces. This was not made clear two years ago when the system was introduced. I am positive that it was not apparent to anybody two years ago that the Government proposed to send expeditionary forces to the war in Vietnam, although there was already a commitment in Malaysia. We had to expand our regular forces to accept these two commitments. It is an odd piece of strategy that you should have this kind of commitment at one end of South East Asia and another commitment at the other end. Why has recruiting not kept pace with demands? This was a valid point referred to by the honourable member for La TrobeC Mr Jess). When you enter the armed forces, no matter whether for three years, three months or a lifetime, you accept an absolute commitment. The commitment of a service person is quite different from that of anybody else, even members of the police forces or the fire brigades. In the armed services when the chips are down your life is the sacrifice you are laying on the table. I believe it is time the community accepted a similar commitment towards the servicemen. It does not matter much to me whether a man serves in the Citizen Military Forces or the Regular Army. What matters is our commitment. We should move into a new field of thinking towards rehabilitation rights, education training rights, housing rights and so on. I would be quite happy to support the view that there should be almost a continuing advantage through the rest of one's life after one has served for a reasonable period. We might provide something like war service homes and educational benefits. I am not convinced that the Commonwealth employees' compensation scheme provides adequate compensation for the citizen soldier or the regular soldier who is injured or for the dependants of those who are killed. I believe that these things are some of the reasons for the recruiting failure. The real reason for the demand for soldiering stems from a foreign policy which has not yet been adequately explained to the people of Australia and which does not have a solid philosophical base. This has probably been part of the history of Australia. We have not given a great deal of thought to this matter. We still operate as if vernment should pick 20 year old people. we were in the European context. We have always associated ourselves with the commitments that come from British commitments. Now we seem to have accepted policies that come from commitments of America. I do not believe that sufficient thought has been given to our foreign policy or to the defence policy behind it. 1 take strong exception to the present system of conscripting a small group in the community. Figures provided in answer to a question asked in August by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Whitlam) show that of 122,000 persons who registered for national service, 46,837 were selected by means of the ballots conducted by the Department of Labour and National Service. Those 46,000 persons were accepted for examination. A number have had their callups deferred. A number have been exempted. A number have been called into the Army and a number are in Vietnam. I believe that this system is an act of immorality on the part of the Australian Government. If the Australian people support it, I believe it is an act of national immorality. If the Government implements the system without the support of the people, it is an even greater act of immorality. say it is an act of immorality even if the year there are 100,000 young people in any people support it? it I would still consider it to be an act of immorality, although I will concede that if it has the imprimatur of a democracy through the ballot box, it is a system we all have to accept. I look at the matter this way; The Government says that it has a commitment. What is the commitment? It is one that will involve the absolute and unlimited sacrifice of some people. It does not matter whether one million or 10,000 are killed in a war, it is still an absolute commitment to those involved. In this case, we think that the Australian people have not voluntarily accepted the commitment. The voluntary recruiting system has failed. The average citizen of military age has not accepted service in Vietnam as a duty. The Government has said it is a national duty and that it has to pick somebody. Whom shall it pick? There may be strong economic and other reasons to select 20 year old persons. I do not see any reason why the GoIf it picked 25 year old or 30 year old people, who would have had years of voting before they were called up, and who would have family responsibilities, I would see something in it. At least the Government would have thrown out a challenge and would face the responsibility for it. I believe that in chosing this age group the Government is guilty of an act of immorality. But it has also created a system of inequality. Some 122,000 were registered; some 46,000 were balloted. A number were exempted for all sorts of reasons. Some were eventually called up. Why were they chosen? You might say that Ihe law of chance prevailed and Tom Smith rather than Tom Jones served eventually in Vietnam. One was killed and one goes on in civilian life. You might say it is the luck of the game. I do not think any nation worth its salt can live by chance of this nature. There has to be a consensus, a national support and a universal application of the principle of equality of sacrifice before you can say: "" This is national policy "". I believe we are guilty of inequality in our demands upon people. While the system continues it will be so insidious in the community that large numbers of people will be able to avoid the sacrifice that is implied. Large numbers particular age group.

178,Mr Bryant,"If the people support tralian families out of 4 million Australianfamilies are directly affected by registration McCarthyism that attempts to intimidate for national service. This is about 2 i per cent. The other 97i per cent, carry on business as usual. If we demand an absolute commitment there must be equality of sacrifice all round. It must be something in which all the resources of the nation are committed. I believe that in adopting the present system the Government has been guilty of shirking its responsibilities. The system means risking the lives of some and business as usual for the great many. Nobody in an Australian community can justify such a system. Apart from that, diffimembers opposite to newspaper reports culties and uncertainties flow from it. Who is in? Wbo is out? Why will the Government not say which birth dates have been drawn? Why is it that this is a secret to everybody except the honourable member for Higinbotham ( Mr Chipp) and his colleagues who turn up at the ballot box? Why can the Government not say that the people born on this date will be called up and those born on other dates will not? Does the Government suggest that if it announces that the birth date of, say, 3rd August has been drawn, people born on that date will blow through or something of the sort? Is this the kind of faith that we have in tbe people of Australia? Of course it is not. The system has, 1 believe, been introwould have raised his usual objections to duced without proper and adequate explanathe war in Vietnam, and he is entitled to tion.

But I say firmly and clearly that the people of Australia have something to answer for. The people of South Vietnam have not called their young men to the colours in any wholesale way. There is no equality of sacrifice or diversion of effort there. Young Australians are being called on to make sacrifices in a cause in which the people in the country concerned are not actively engaged. I refer honourable which support what I have been saying for weeks since I have returned from Vietnam. They can find the newspapers in the Library for themselves. Let us look to the facts, look to all the causes and look to our own consciences. If Australians must lake up this challenge, it is for all of us. Let the Government call up 450,000 and say it intends to do it. Then we will know that it is dinkum.

He is saying to the. people: "" If you do this, you will commit an act of immorality "". fications the honourable member has that enable him to be the final arbiter of morality. Perhaps one day he will enlighten me by telling me of his qualifications. The other statement he made, to which I took objection, was an insinuation about the ballot that is conducted and at each of which I personaUy have had the honour to represent the Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Bury). The honourable member said in rather a sneaky way: "" The honourable member for Higinbotham in his secret session draws the ballot"". This, if it was meant to do anything, was obviously meant to cast some sort of a smear on the system. He then had the impertinence to say that this system has sown the seeds of doubt in the minds of the people. The system has not sown the seeds of doubt; it is this kind of smear by the honorabie member for Wills that has sown the seeds of doubt, if indeed seeds of doubt have been sown. As I said, I have had the honour to be present at each of the ballots conducted so far. At each of them, between 20 and 30 Press, television and radio commentators have been present and on each occasion an extraordinarily distinguished Australian not associated with politics has drawn the marbles. In his presence, the marbles have been drawn, supervised, checked and re-checked by myself as representative of the Minister. Any smear on the secrecy of the ballot is necessarily a smear and a slur on the character and integrity not only of myselfI must become used to this, being in the political arenabirth dates were announced, the sports but also of the distinguished Australians and the senior officers of the Department of Labour and National Service who are present at the ballot. One might well say that the Press of that, since the reason for maintaining the secrecy of the birth dates was explained at the first ballot, we have not received one question from any Pressman about the reason for the birth dates not being disclosed. I would have thought that, he being a person who sets himself up as an expert on morality, the reason for not divulging the birth dates would have become quite apparent without my having to spell it out for him, but let me try to do so. This is an arrangement between the young men of 20 and the Government. This is an individual relationship between the young men and the Government. I cannot see what right the honourable member for Wills or thc general public have for wanting to know whether a young man's birth date has been drawn out of the barrel. This is up to the young man and the Government. Let mc give an instance of what could happen if the birth dates were revealed. As the honourable member for Wills said, many young men are balloted in but are not accepted. There can be many reasons for this. They may be medically unfit or they may not pass the mental fitness tests. They may be married. Let me take the hypothetical case of a young man who is applying for a position. He is aged 20. His employer may approach him and say: "" You were born on 3rd August 1946. I know your marble was drawn out of the barrel, because it was published in the newspaper. Why are you not in the Army?"" If we published the birth dates that were drawn, we would place young men such as this in the position of having to defend themselves against their prospective employers, and to me this would not be right. Why should our young men be placed in such a position? This is a relationship between the young men and the Government. I can think of thousands of situations in which the divulging of this information could cause harm. Let us consider young star footballers, particularly in Melbourne at this time of the year. As soon as the writers would ascertain which football star or cricket star was affected by the draw and this would become headline news.

189,Mr Chipp,"I do not know what qualiwere not called up, he would have to justify himself to the public and to the world. I do not believe that we should put young people in such a position. There are many other reasons for maintaining secrecy as to the birth dates, but I will content myself at this stage with the explanation I have given. I should like to support strongly the plea by my friend and colleague, the honourable member for La Trobe( Mr Jess), for the very generous rehabilitation benefits that the Government is soon to announce for servicemen serving abroad today and, in particular, for the national servicemen. Like myself, there are a great many members in this House who voluntarily joined up on their eighteenth birthdays and served in the Air Force, Army or Navy and who are prepared to say that rather than their lives suffering from service in the forces their lives were benefited. Notwithstanding this, I believe that in the present context we are taking only a few of those available and we should be extremely generous in our rehabilitation benefits for them. I come now to some of the comments of the honourable member for Blaxland( Mr E. James Harrison). In his usual thoughtful way he made a contribution on the vexed question of conciliation and arbitration. It is one of the facts of life that we as a Government, and as a Parliament, can argue here-and we have been arguing for two months on one aspect of financial policy, namely, the Budget, and whether it is a good or bad Budget-abou t financial measues yet, strangely, almost as important a fiscal weapon is in the hands of a body completely outside the Parliament. I refer, of course, to the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission which, by raising or lowering the basic wage by even one shilling a week, can produce an impact of £5 million on the national wages bill. The decisions of the Commission are of a momentous nature. I am not persuaded that we have anything near the perfect system, and I was impressed with the views put by the honourable member for Blaxland that price stability is what we should aim for. With due respect to him, however, I must say that he did not put forward many concrete ways in which price stability could be maintained ad infinitum. He referred to 1961.1 am sure he was not advocating a repetition of the financial measures that were implemented in November 1960 which caused the stability we had over the next two years. However, this is one of the dilemmas a government finds itself in when there is overfull employment, as we have at the moment. The honourable member spoke of the inequity to the worker in his not getting a greater share of increased productivity. This concerns mc also, but I do not go as far as the honourable member for Blaxland. I have been trying to find figures and to ascertain whether any deep research has been done on the three aspects of where productivity goes. Obviously if there is an increase in productivity-and all of us know how impossible it is to measure this with any degree of accuracy-it can go to the worker, and I would be the first to agree that he should get his just share, or to management, capital, or call it what we will. The honourable member for Blaxland did not show us-and I do not blame him, because I have not seen any figures on it-that the relationship of profits to shareholders' funds has increased since 1960. I do not believe it has. He did not prove that it had, because the figures are not available. I have been critical in this Parliament of universities, particularly those undertaking research in the humanities, but if any subject is crying out for some real research, here it is: Where is the increased productivity going? Is it going to the worker? If so, how much is going to him? Once that information is provided then we, as parliamentarians, can judge whether or not what is happening is equitable. How much of increased productivity is going to capital? Of course, there is a third possibility. Is it going in the increased price of money? This is one aspect that concerns me. Is too much of it being siphoned off in the additional price of money7 I hope that after this Government is returned at the next election it will give some consideration to the pleas of the judges of the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission-and , indeed, of its President, Sir Richard Kirby-wh o have asked the Government to provide guide lines to the Commission as to the basis for the making of basic wage determinations. The Government does this in respect of the Reserve Bank of Australia. It says to the Reserve Bank: "" These are certain broad guide lines or criteria to which you should look"" and it refers to the overseas trading position, the balance of payments situation and so forth. I know that this is fraught with all sorts of difficulties, both economic and political, but ballot. 1 was speaking of secrecy as such I think it is fair to the judges, if we are going to persist with the present system, that the Government should give them some guide lines. I conclude by referring to a phenomenon but the doubts in the minds of the registhat is occurring in Australia today.

193,Mr Webb (Stirling) [5.53],"No w thathope that it would include the principle of equal pay for equal work. It is a recognised fact that women have become an important factor in the Australian work force. The Australian Labour Party, of course, is not opposed to the employment of women but objects to women being employed at cheap rates. It is noticeable that the employment of women has not been responsible for a reduction in thc cost of commodities. It is clear, therefore1 do not refer to the Commonwealth Public Service in this regard-that the cheaper wage rates which are paid to female employees result in increased pronts for the employers. In my view the Minister and the Government stand condemned for their failure to promote the principle of equal pay for the sexes for work of equal value. The Minister and the Government have failed to honour obligations under the 195.1 International Labour Organisation convention and recommendation concerning equal remuneration for the sexes for work of equal value. The Minister and the Government have failed to ratify Convention No. I l l and Recommendation No. 111 concerning discrimination between the sexes. The Minister and the Government have failed to implement the 1962 recommendation regarding the provision of vocational training for girls and women. The Minister, or his predecessor, and the Government have refused to establish a Status of Women Commission as was done in the United States of America. So it is reasonable to say that this Government, while urging the employment of women, has blatantly and unashamedly used the female work force as a source ot cheap labour. This is part and parcel of a deliberate campaign to reduce the standard of living of Australian workers. The honourable member for Blaxland( Mr E. .lames Harrison), when referring to this aspect, pointed out that the recent increase in thc basic wage does not give the worker the purchasing power that he had formerly, and that even though a $2 increase in the basic wage resulted from the decision of the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, that increase was swallowed up almost before it appeared in the pay packet. When the quarterly cost of living adjustments applied, the worker knew that the wage he received in one quarter would at least purchase as much as it did in the previous quarter but that is not the case today. There is always a time lag, so plainly the worker's pay is behind increases in the cost of living. As I have said, this is all part and parcel of the cheap labour campaign. The Government wants cheap labour and is not concerned very much how it gets cheap labour. Another important point is that employers are prepared to use the channels of the Arbitration Commission to fight workers' claims for increases. If the employers win outright, that is well and good. They accept the decision. But if they lose, they meet behind closed doors and decide to increase prices, so the workers find themselves no better off than they were before the basic wage was increased. The actions of the employers have repercussions on other sections of the community. Why should this be? Why should not the employers be required to justify an increase in prices in exactly the same way as the workers are required to justify a claim for an increase in wages? There is at present a move in Western Australia by the Brand Liberal Government to remove the system of quarterly adjustments of tbe basic wage. The court in that State has always been free and untrammelled in applying these quarterly adjustments. As a result, the cost of living in Western Australia is no higher than it is in the other States. Tn fact, in many instances it is lower. It should be remembered, too, that cost of living adjustments were introduced in the 1930s when costs were falling. When costs were falling the employers accepted the quarterly adjustments because wages were being reduced, but when wages started to rise there were immediate moves to get rid of quarterly cost of living adjustments, first of all in the Federal court, then in some of the State courts and now a move is being made by the Liberal Government of Western Australia in the same direction. I have already mentioned the Government's refusal to implement certain I.L.O. decisions. When the Government has been challenged about its attitude towards these decisions it has made excuses. Sitting suspended from 6 to 8 p.m. pended I was talking about the employment of women in the Commonwealth Public Service and the failure of the Government to implement decisions of the International Labour Organisation. When the Government is challenged on its attitude to I.L.O. decisions it makes the excuse that some States will not agree to ratify the I.L.O. conventions. My view is that this Government is not seriously supporting the decisions of the I.L.O. In particular it is very keen to ensure that Convention No. 100 is not ratified. It is the responsibility of the Government instance, of the opinions expressed in other to apply the principle of equal pay for countries in which automation is being work of equal value in the case of its own introduced? Why should Australia be the employees, but it does not do so. It is not only country that will escape the unemploydoing so with respect to the Commonwealth ment that results from the introduction of Public Service at the present time.

As well as helping to keep down the purchasing power of the basic wage and seeking to employ women at cheap rates of pay despite increased productivity, the Government now intends to turn a blind eye to the greater productivity that will result from automation. Why does the Government hide its head in the sand in connection with this matter? It says that automation will not cause any difficulties and that everyone in the work force will have employment even after automation has been introduced. That may be the position for a time, but we must look to the future. What does the Minister think, for In the United States of America autoIn the United States of America it has tion revolution moves in with explosive",43,Appropriation Bill No 1 1966 67
194,Mr Webb,"When the sitting was susenergy. There is a difference, however, between the two revolutions. Workers' organisations were weak during the industrial revolution; today they are strong. Unions now are alive to the fact that the new technology will not create jobs, that automation is specifically intended to make manual labour unnecessary, and that it does so. lt has done so in America, where there is quite a substantial degree of unemployment, and it will do so here. I suggest to the Minister and his Department that this is what will occur, and that instead of sitting back and doing very little about it, they should do something to implement the decisions of the Australian Council of Trade Unions on this matter. The machines of the first industrial revolution supplemented or augmented man's muscle power. The new machines not only augment his muscle power but also take the place of his brain. The new machines and computers can work with precision and speed that no human being can match. Throw a switch and the computer does what it is told. The A.C.T.U. has passed several resolutions on this important subject, and is to hold a seminar on it very shortly. The attitude o; the A.C.T.U. is that the introduction of planned automation by joint government, trade union and employer consultation holds out the promise of vast improvements in the standard of living. Its application can eliminate routine repetitive or arduous work. Jt believes that the objectives should be, first, the avoidance of dislocations of the labour force which cause social hardships or labour displacement; secondly, training or re-training in skills to meet the new technological development: and thirdly, ensuring that purchasing power is expanded to keep pace with the nation's productive capacity and with the lessened need for human effort accompanied by improved living standards and greater leisure. The A.C.T.U. has declaredThe principle which should be pursued is the establishment of an advisory committee consisting of representatives of the trade union movement, employers' organisations and the Federal and State Governments. The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN -Order! The honourable member's time has expired. wish to speak about what I consider a serious anomaly in the calling up of national servicemen. Section 31 (4.) of the National Service Act provides that a court of summary jurisdiction constituted by a Police, Stipendiary or Special Magistrate may defer the liability for service of any registrant upon whom or upon whose parents or dependants the rendering of service would impose exceptional hardship. It is the definition of exceptional hardshipor the lack of a precise definition-whic h is creating difficulty in many rural areas of Australia. As the Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Bury) knows, I have raised with him several times cases, in my opinion, of extreme hardship, either for the boy called up or for the parents of the boy. Under the provisions of the Act a deferment on the grounds of exceptional hardship is temporary only. It merely postpones the commencement of national service for a period decided by the court. The deferment may be for a period not exceeding 12 months and may be subject to conditions imposed by the magistrate. A person to whom such a deferment has been granted may subsequently apply for further deferment. The point which I wish to make is that it has been recognised-quit e rightly-by the Minister, since the inception of the national service scheme that the rendering of service would impose some hardship on young people or on their parents or dependants. In order that there should be no question of partiality it was decided that applications for deferment would be decided by an independent judicial authority. In a letter to me the Minister said that on the whole this arrangement had proved quite satisfactory. It is this phrase "" on the whole"" which concerns me, because one could rightly infer that there may be cases where this arrangement has not been satisfactory. In a matter such as this it is of vital importance that there be no doubt whatsoever about the definition of exceptional hardship. The decision as to whether or not an application is to be approved is left entirely to the magistrate. 1 do not know whether any other honourable member has sat in courts where magistrates preside to pass judgment on such applications. The magistrate is the sole person",45,Appropriation Bill No 1 1966 67
195,Dr. Patterson (Dawson) [8.9],"Iwho determines whether a boy will be called up or whether he will get deferment on the ground of exceptional hardship. The magistrate is concerned only with the evidence placed before him by the applicant and exercises his judgment accordingly. An officer of thc Attorney-General's Department represents the Department of Labour and National Service. His job is to place before the magistrate the facts of the case as known to him. I have no objection in principle to this method. WhatI do object to is the magistrate being put in the position of having to make firm and precise decisions about exceptional hardship, because I maintain that a magistrate cannot do this unless he knows his subject and knows the problems of rural areas. It is wrong to ask him to judge, and impossible for him to judge properly unless he has this knowledge. After all, Mr Deputy Chairman, if you were going to appoint somebody to pass judgment on the problems of brigalow scrub clearing, and the problems to be faced on certain types of flood country, you would not appoint a magistrate to do it. You would appoint somebody who had a knowledge of that particular problem. 1 suggest to the Minister that in order to avoid the serious problems that are arising-certainl y in my area-regardin g the imprecise definition of the term ""exceptional hardship"" as applied to rural areas, the Department should make people available to advise and assist the courts in interpreting this phase. How could a magistrate pass judgment on applications for deferment and say that there was no exceptional hardship caused to a man whose property has been devastated by drought for two years, or a man who has lost his breeding stock and is restocking, or a man who may have disease rampant in his stock, or a man who may be following a particular breeding line in his stud? The last man may have particularly high class stud cattle or pigs and could help pay the debts of his father. The Minbe following a breeding programme. If his son has to go away he has to get somebody to take his place. Can this man get labour? How does a magistrate, sometimes sitting 400 miles away from the place concerned, know whether this man can get skilled and efficient labour to replace the son who is being called away? Of course the man cannot get such labour. Yet because of the jurisdiction he holds the magistrate can, in effect, pass judgment on such people. In my opinion the judgments are not consistent. I know magistrates in my area who seem to be deferment happy-bu t they will defer a trainee for only a few months at a time. Anybody knows, surely, how little can be done in a few months in some of the drought stricken areas. If their sons are taken, where will these men on the land in my area get their labour from, when they have to compete for labour with coal mines at Moura and Cracow? Once having obtained a short deferment the applicant has to brief his solicitor or barrister again and get deferred for another tsvo or three months. This procedure goes on until he gets two or three deferments, then finally he is called up. To me this is wrong and it could be avoided. I will say in fairness that the Minister at the table ( Mr Bury) and the Minister for the Army( Mr Malcolm Fraser) have at all times attempted to help in any case I have put to them. They have been completely fair about it. But the point is that it is impossible to define this term "" exceptional hardship"" unless the magistrate concerned has some knowledge of the particular conditions. I would like to give examples to illustrate my case. They will leave no honourable member in doubt as to the inability of some magistrates to pass judgment on the definition of "" exceptional hardship "". One case concerns a father who has been on crutches, cripppled, for 40 years. He has two sons, farms 6,500 acres of land, most of it poor country, and is $22,000 in debt. He runs a mixed farm in a drought stricken area. He is completely incapacitated. His son was called up for national service and the magistrate advised the father to cut down on his production, to do less on the farm. He advised the lad concerned to send his money home while he is in the Army in order to ister knows that what I say is right, because I have seen the transcript of the proceedings. I know of another tragic case concerning a father whose leg was amputated in an accident. He was told-by the same magistrate-to cut down production so that he would be able to look after the farm in spite of his incapacity. The magistrate said: "" Why can't your 12 year old son come home at the weekends and help with the mustering and dipping?"" I do not think this magistrate would know what mustering and dipping entailed in scrub country with brigalow whipstick suckers like this property has. A lot of the properties concerned are in such country, but this is the sort of thing that is happening. AgainI stress the point that the Minisprimary production. I object strongly to ter is aware of those cases, but he makes it quite clear that hardship cases are decided by the courts and that neither he nor the officers of his Department have any administrative discretion in the matter. When one of these boys is called into the ArmyI have to ask the Minister for the Army to try to do something about it. AgainI say that the Minister is most co-operative. Tn fairness I must say that he does look at every case and up to the present he has passed sound judgment. Another caseI could mention 20 more if I had the timeconcerns a father who has a permanent back injury. He cannot ride a horse, nor can he do any work with the cattle. He relies entirely on his son to do this work. He lives in an area which has been devastated by drought during the last two years, an area where it is impossible to get skilled labour. To obtain skilled labour in these areas it is not simply a matter of advertising and getting somebody to come onto the property and do some work. If a person has a stud herd of either cattle or pigs and has to leave the animals in somebody's charge for two years, he can only hope that when he returns he will find they have been well looked after. Another case concerns a boy in Monto. In that instance the magistrate granted a deferment but told the boy that he would have to get someone to replace him. The boy did the right thing. He advertised in "" Country Life"" throughout Queensland and managed to get a married couple who lasted at the job for only a short time. In the middle of one night they packed their bags and walked out, leaving the pigs unfed and the cows unmilked. Anybody who understands cows and pigs would know what damage could be done to that herd. Yet in these cases the magistrate says there is no exceptional hardship. With the exception of the case which I next propose to cite he has put all these cases into the same category. In the next case, after three deferments the boy was found to be medically unfit. In that case justice was done, irrespective of how it was achieved. In that instance there was certainly exceptional hardship. That boy is working 20 hours a day now, yet according to the Army he is medically unfit, whatever that may mean. Nevertheless he is doing something for the country in terms of increased magistrates in country areas telling fathers and boys to cut down on primary production, especially at a time when the Government desperately needs an improved balance of payments position and desperately needs increased efficient production. A standard has been set for apprentices and students. There can be no argument about a student being a student and an apprentice being an apprentice within the various definitions, but how do we decide, and how can anybody say, that a boy on the land, brought up in the area, does not serve an apprenticeship on the farm? He does serve an apprenticeship and is just as important to the economy of this country as, if not more important than, many who are getting an automatic deferment until they pass some examination. I fail to see why priority should be given to somebody who is studying French or music when a person who is earning export income which is urgently needed by this country is taken away. So far as I am concerned the two persons should at least be equal. AgainI suggest that the Minister should think seriously about the situation of people in these areas, and particularly those in the more remote areas. I cannot speak with any authority of areas in thc south, but my remarks certainly apply to the remote areas in the north. I suggest to the Minister that a magistrate when hearing applications for deferment should have the advantage of having present an impartial agricultural or stock adviser so that he can question him about the importance of the farm work in question or ask whether thc case is justified on the grounds of exceptional hardship. The agricultural advisers present at the hearing could be independent advisers appointed by the Minister. I am quite certain that this suggestion, if adopted, would give the fathers, the sons and the communities a greater appreciation of the problem and a greater sense of justice with regard to the calling up of youths in rural areas. It would also give them a fairer judgment with regard to deferments on the ground of exceptional hardship which, in my opinion, is not capable of definition. should like to speak on the subject which has been brought up by the honourable member for Dawson (Dr. Patterson) because Country Party members have been advocating certain things along the same lines for many months and possibly for more than a year. A student at a university or an apprentice, as has been pointed out, is really in the same position as a boy on the farm who, it may be said, is serving his apprenticeship with his father and is learning the trade of primary production. If honourable members look at "" Hansard"" they will see that I asked the former Minister for Labour and National Service a question on this subject at least nine months ago, if not 12 months ago. The Minister answered that the farm boy who was attending an agricultural college would be treated in exactly the same way as a student at a university. But this answer was not very satisfactory to us because we knew that only a few attended agricultural colleges whereas on the farms there were thousands of young men learning their trade. If this decision related only to those attending agricultural colleges it would not meet our requirements. This is a case that needs to be looked into. It is a matter that has been considered Service. It is the judiciary which may be by the Minister and the Government after some advocacy, although whether or not it was as a result of the advocacy I am not sure. Where exceptional hardship can be proved there should be a deferment and then a further deferment in 12 months' time if the situation is still the same. But for borderline cases and even for general cases, after much advocacy the Government decided that it would form, and has formed, special units of the Citizen Military Forces. When a man aged 20 is about to register for national service training, he is given the opportunity to lodge an application to join the C.M.F. It is accepted now that he can join the C.M.F. if he lodges his application at the same time as he submits his national service registration form. In the C.M.F. the young men must serve at least 30 days each year and the service can be given at an appropriate time. I am not able to say what the situation is in Queensland, but in the electorate which I represent they would not be asked to serve at seeding or harvest time, or if they are engaged in the dried fruits industry they would not be required to serve at picking time or at times when the vines had to be pruned. The time would be worked out as near as possibleperhaps not exactly-to suit the serviceman so that he could do this work at home and continue in production which is so important. At the same time he would be serving his country or preparing himself to serve his country. It has been said by many honourable members that it is very hard to define "" exceptional hardship "". I agree with them. Many magistrates in the area which I represent have a very good knowledge of what goes on in the area because most of them have been magistrates in rural areas for a long time. I can name some who have been in the country for many years. They are right up to date in their knowledge of what is happening. Nevertheless, the decisions of some magistrates are considered to be quite unfair. It must be remembered that we sometimes read that a man is given six months in gaol for a certain offence, whereas for another offence which people generally regard as much more serious the accused gets off with a fine of $20. If magistrates are not giving correct decisions, this is not the fault of the Department of Labour and National at fault. I am not saying the judiciary is at fault, but the question of deciding hardship does go beyond the Department of Labour and National Service. So far as I am concernedI cannot speak for my Party on this-in some cases deferments should not have been granted. In one case a young man was given the chance to go on to a property which belonged to his wealthy uncle. It was apparent and had been stated that if he worked well on the property his uncle would give it to him in a few years. There was no suggestion that other people were not available to run the property; others were available. But the boy said that the hardship in his case was that if he had to do national service he would lose his opportunity to get the property. I do not regard that as hardship. Another young",46,Appropriation Bill No 1 1966 67
196,Mr Turnbull (Mallee) [8.24],"Iman who did not have a wealthy uncle would have to serve. Where war is concerned, I think the cheapest thing we can spend is money. I do not believe that deferment should be granted just because the bright future of some young man on the land or some young man in business would be jeopardised by his going into the Forces. The young man who does not appear to have a bright future should be on exactly the same level as the young man with the rich uncle. Reference has been made on many occasions in this chamber to hardship caused to parents who own properties and who are not in the best of health. In one such case in the Mallee electorate that was brought to my notice-the case of a father who is suffering from a heart condition and who has only one son-the son was granted deferment. I believe that in such cases deferment should be granted, and I think it is granted in most cases. Now that we have the C.M.F. as an alternative, all cases submitted should be capable of settlement under one of the two headings. As we are talking about national service, I should like to relate what happened when I was going home from Canberra last weekend. After passing through Melbourne, and just as I got to the other side of a place named Marong, I saw a young man in uniform who wanted a lift. I picked him up in my car. He told me that his car had broken down and that he wanted to get to Adelaide. Everything I am telling the Committee is perfectly true. I cannot bring the young man here-althoug h I suppose I could, if necessary, because I know what camp he is in. I thought that this was a good opportunity to gain information, so I said: "" How do the boys in your camp regard national service?"" He replied: ""When they go into the Regular Army units, once thcy know they are going away, they are quite happy and like to get away. Until they go into the proper units with other volunteers and regular soldiers who are going overseas, some of them are a bit unsettled; but once they get into these units with their mates they are happy."" That is what he told me, word for word. I said to him: "" How do you find the general public reacting to this cailup?"" He answered: "" I find that people are more happy now about it than they have been for a long time."" He also said: ""Those people around Melbourne who go about with placards against Vietnam and the call up do not know what they are talking about."" Those are the exact words he used to me"" do not know what they are talking about"". I took him as far as a place named Bridgewater. He said to me: "" I will have no trouble in getting a ride to Charlton, then to Warracknabeal, Dimboola, Bordertown and on to Adelaide. When you are in uniform, people recognise it. They recognise that you are giving service and they are very pleased to give you a lift."" I said: "" If you had not had a uniform on, probably I would not have picked you up, because there are so many reports of people having picked men up in their cars and the next minute having a revolver pushed into their ribs, being made step out of the car and then seeing the car being driven off without them."" I thought this was a good opportunity to find out how the national service trainee feels about national service. This lad was quite happy with his position, and he told me so. sure the lad was not absent without leave? whether he was, but I do know that he told me his car had broken down. He appeared to me to be a good Australian, and I did what I do with all people I think are good AustraliansI took his word. I thought he was genuine and I treated him as such. I believe that what he told me was true and I think it is worth repeating in this place. everybody would agree with the honourable member for Dawson (Dr. Patterson) and the honourable member for Mallee( Mr Turnbull) that only exceptionally dangerous national conditions would justify the calling up for national service of the people to whom they referred. Indeed, I would go further and say that only the gravest of national dangers-dange r amounting almost to a crisis-woul d justify any government in calling people up to fight overseas against their will.

A nation should only do these things if there is no other way of meeting the difficulties that confront it. Is there no other way of meeting the position that operates in Vietnam than the compulsory balloting in of national servicemen to the tune of some 2,000-odd for service overseas? The other day, I asked this questionDoes the Acting Prime Minister know that Major-General Vickery, who is now a member ot the Militarj' Board, said that 32,000 servicemen in tlie Citizen Military Forces had volunteered for service anywhere in the world and that they could have fulfilled the role of national servicemen drafted into the Army for overseas service, and that he further commented that conscription for overseas service was introduced into Australia not for a military reason but for a political reason? What is the political reason? The Deputy Prime Minister repliedI am not aware of what the General may have said. As to why national service has been introduced, it has been stated many times in the House that it was introduced because the number of volunteers coming forward was inadequate for purposes that the Government regarded as necessary. I heard the distinguished General speaking on television. He was most emphatic thai there was no military necessity for national service trainees to go overseas. Furthermore, he was opposed to national service training I was reading is not a full one. 1 have told within Australia for military reasons. This the Committee of the questioning of the report of his statement appeared in the General by the panel before which he "" Age"" of 6th June 1966The Citizen Military Force conceivably could some of the questions that were asked and have fulfilled the role of national servicemen some of the replies that were given. I have drafted into the army for overseas service, Majortold the Committee exactly what the General General N. A. Vickery said last night. He declined to comment on conscription for overseas service, said in reply. He was emphatic that conwhich he said was a matter of Government policy, scription for overseas purposes was introbut he said the C.M.F. had the numbers to fill duced not for military reasons but for a thc places of the national servicemen. I heard that telecast. The panel examining that there were 32,000 members of tue the General asked: "" Do you mean to say Citizen Military Forces and that all memthat those people who have enlisted in the bers of the C.M.F. had enlisted for overseas C.M.F. could be sent to Vietnam? "" He said: service. The statement that I say he made "" Most decidedly they could "". The repon later under questioning is only a corollary ol the General's views continuedThe citizen soldier volunteered for overseas service when he joined the C.M.F. The report stated laterGeneral Vickery said that, at its present strength and recruiting rate, the C.M.F. was capable of training men to full efficiency for the type of war they might have to fight At this stage he was against universal military training. It would swamp the forces with recruits. Training would be ineffective because the forces would not have enough experienced servicemen to spare for instruction. The Army would have a large number of semitrained soldiers when it required high quality soldiers. The point that I make is that these are com.ments made by a highly placed General in the Citizen Military Forces who has since been appointed to the Military Board. When he was questioned by the panel of interviewers, he stated emphatically that the introduction of national service training and the conscripting of men for service overseas was decided on not for military reasons but for a political reason. lenge anybody who doubts me to get the text of his remarks on the ""Meet the Press"" programme in Melbourne on this occasion last June and to find out exactly what was said.

206,Mr Peters,"The report from whichrecruitment, to obtain men for overseas service? Is the distinguished General correct or is the Government correct? Was the Deputy Prime Minister correct when he said that it was impossible to obtain, as volunteers, from the Australian population the 1,500 recruits that were required for overseas service when conscription was introduced? Is it true that conscription had to extend to aliens-to unnaturalised immigrants whom we are enticing to come here and each of whom is costing us $600 or $800 to bring here? Those are the questions that have to be answered in the light of the statements that have been made on these matters. As an outsider looking on, 1 think that there could be something in what General Vickery has said. If the cause for which we are fighting in Vietnam is such that out of the native born population and the migrants who have come here we cannot obtain 1.500 men to serve willingly as volunteers, conscription may have been essential to obtain the required numbers. However, if this was the case, it proves that the cause for which we are fighting is not one that inspires or appeals to the masses of the Australian people. I firmly believe that the Prime Minister( Mr Harold Holt) should look again at the statement made by Major-General Vickery of the Citizen Military Forces, who is now a member of the Military Board. Particularly, the right honourable gentleman should consider whether it is correct that the General specifically said that it was a political reason and not military reasons that caused the Government to enlist national service trainees for overseas service. If the Prime Minister says that the reason was not a political one, I am entitled to ask him: What are the military reasons that cause him to insist that Australians such as those mentioned by tbe honourable member for Mallee and the honourable member for Dawson (Dr. Patterson) must be called up to fight in the Vietnam war? I say that the only military reason could be a grave national danger, amounting to a crisis. That is the only reason that would justify the Government's calling up men against their will and forcing them to fight overseas. If there is no such military reason, the political reason should be divulged so that we may consider it. If the Government could not, by any means at its disposal, induce 1,500 men or thereabouts to enlist over a period, it should consider again very seriously the cause for which we are fighting in Vietnam. Deputy Chairman, I want to answer the remarks made by the honourable member for ScuIIm( Mr Peters). He has read only part of what was said on the occasion when Major-General Vickery was interviewed on television. It is rather interesting to read the whole and to consider the interpretation that the honourable member has, either intentionally or unintentionally, placed on reports of the interview. was dishonest. But I am suggesting that he was careless. I have a report of the interview before me. The honourable member began by saying that only the most urgent crisis would justify a nation's calling up men for national service training and sending them overseas. One of the things that the Australian public is becoming very much more aware of these days is the difference between the policy of the Australian Labour Party-if there is any it is confused and varying-and that of the Government. It appears that the Labour Party has no policy at all on the defence of this country. Indeed, it would do nothing until a crisis was upon us and had reached its most urgent stage. when the parties opposite would step out of the picture, as they did once before honourable member for Stirling is saying. If he would only keep quiet and listen, he might learn something. The Labour Party, it seems, would do nothing. It would allow the situation in South East Asia to deteriorate to a stage at which Australia would be under a direct threat. Only at that stage would it possibly think of doing something. But as far as defence training and requirements in the South East Asian theatre, particularly at this stage, are concerned, this would not be good enough for the defence of Australia or of the Australian people.

The Government has realised that we must put our house in order and prepare our forces to play their part in the defence of the free nations in this theatre. 1 do not think anybody who looks at what is happening in the remaining free countries of South East Asia would deny th=t the Communists are moving and exerting an influence in each and every country to the north o; Australia. So the difference between our policy and that of the Opposition is that the Government at this stage says that' we must be prepared; that we will not have the time we had in the First World War to send troops to Europe or to the Mediterranean; that we will not have the time we had in the Second World War again to send troops to Europe or to the Mediterranean; and that the threats to our sphere of influence are close to our shores at this time. knows as well as I that the threats are from Communists in the area and from the Chinese Communist influences in these countries. Let me come back to the article which the honourable member for Scullin so glibly quoted. AlthoughI personally like the honourable member for Scullin, I think it is rather contemptible to quote or partially quote what a General of the Army has said when he does not have the right of reply. It is not right to quote only portions of what he said. The article from which the honourable member for Scullin quoted appeared in the "" Age"" of 6th June 1966. The date was about the only thing the honourable member for Scullin got right. The article readsThe Citizen Military Force conceivably could have fulfilled the role of national servicemen drafted into the army for overseas service, MajorYew, quoted by the honourable member General N. A. Vickery said last night. But this would have displaced the CMF from its intended role in the defence machine and unbalanced the military structure, he said. The honourable member neglected to read this next partGeneral Vickery, GOC 3 Division CMF, was interviewed on Channel Seven's Meet the Press programme. He declined to comment on conscription for overseas service, which he said was a matter of Government policy, but he said the CMF had the numbers to nil the places of national servicemen. The article continuesBut to use the CMF in this role would be to mistake its purpose, which was to stand as a reserve force behind a full-strength Regular Army. Those are the things which the honourable member for Scullin intentionally or unintentionally omitted. He purported to quote what a General, in his advice on defence policy, had said but he selected only those portions of the article which suited his case or the extraordinarily bewildered case of the Opposition. Referring to the General, the article statesAt this stage he was against universal military training. The General was referring to universal military training, not selective national service training. He was referring to complete mobilisation of military forces. The article continuesIt would swamp the forces with recruits. In other words, we do not have the instructors, the non-commissioned oflicers honourable member and the junior officers to cope with universal training at this time. I again protest at the manner in which the honourable member for Scullin quoted the remarks of the General, who has no right to claim that he has been misquoted. Honourable members on both sides should be sure that when they quote the remarks of people in official positions who cannot themselves reply, they quote them correctly and in their perspective. On the advice given to it the Government is of the opinion that there is an emergencya threat-movin g towards Australia which, if not checked, will certainly confront Australia. It is not necessary to quote the remarks only of those people whom honourable members opposite quote when it suits their case. I could quote the remarks of Lee Kuan for Batman( Mr Benson), who said that if the advance of Communism were not stopped in Vietnam, eventually it would mean the overthrow of Singapore, Thailand and the other countries of the area. Statesmen from Asian countries could be quoted but it is extraordinary that honourable members opposite do not quote those who do not support their case. I suggest",52,Appropriation Bill No 1 1966 67

Does the honourable member claim to have been misrepresented? ber for La Trobe implied that I had deliberately suppressed portions of an article from which I quoted in order to give the article a slant which it did not have. That is gross misrepresentation. I am willing to have not only the article but the complete transcript of the television interview incorporated in "" Hansard "". If this were done it would prove beyond doubt that what I quoted was a just version of the General's remarks. The honourable member for La Trobe( Mr he has decided that the problem exists, Jess) launched a peroration about the defence needs of this country. May I remind him that our defence needs pivot in a large degree on the productivity and general industrial activity qf the constituency that I represent and that which the honourable member for Newcastle ( Mr There were at present more than 5,000 employJones) represents? I again refer, as I have done repeatedly in this place, to the chronic problem of female unemployment in my constituency. We have a new Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Bury). This problem merits his attention. At present, almost 6,000 women and girls who are capable of working are unemployed within the City of Greater Wollongong and the adjoining district. If documentation of this kind is required I have it here by the ream. First let me quote the President of the South Coast Chamber of Manufactures, Mr is that he will do precisely nothing either, Simpson, who, as reported in the "" Daily Mercury"" of 5th August last, saidMoreover, the employment situation for females in this city is more dismal now than it was 12 months ago. I quote again the Liberal Party member for the State seat of Wollongong, who said in the New South Wales Parliament in the first week of September, as reported in the "" South Coast Times"", that no one could expect newcomers to settle permanently in Wollongong unless they saw full employment opportunities, including jobs for women. He saidThe problem of unemployment for females on the South Coast is grave. People have come to WoUongong wishing to establish a new home and seeking to set up a house for the whole family. lt is well known that many women in our area would like to have jobs available for which no previous training is needed. This must always be expected. The people want such work and it is up to the Government to do something about it. When I first raised this matter in the House, the present Minister's predecessor in office, on the advice of the egregious honourable member for Macarthur ( Mr Jeff Bate), told the House that women queueing up for employment at a local chain store were queueing up for a bargain sale. A little later he admitted that there was a problem. The Liberal member for Wollongong in the State Parliament at first tried to duck for cover and refused to present a petition on unemployment to the State Parliament. Now because he needs to save his political hide. If further documentation is required, here is a statement from Mr A. J. Howard, Managing Director of Strata Development Corporation. On 27th July last, he saidable women without jobs in tbe Wollongong area. The Minister's predecessor, when pressed, finally said it was the responsibiltiy of the State Government. When the State Government was pressed, being under the influence of the Country Party, it could not do anything because this city was not within the area of decentralisation. What does this Government intend to do? What has it done? Nothing. What is the present Minister capable of doing? I will leave that to him, but my guess-it is a shrewd onebecause he is not capable of doing anything. If we want to take this matter further, I have here the stringent criticism written by the Financial Editor of the "" Sydne?",53,Appropriation Bill No 1 1966 67

216,Mr Connor (Cunningham) [8.57],"Morning Herald"" in the issue of 14th November 1964. This is serious. He saidMoreover, there seems to be something impermanent about the present abnormal preponderance of males over females in the population of the Wollongong-Port Kembla district. This imbalance of the sexes is aggravated if teenage girls find they have to leave their home district to get employment. He continuedThe sex ratio can only be restored to a more normal balance either by more young wives coming into the district-in which case the female unemployment will rise more sharply than everor else by unmarried men leaving the region and finding jobs elsewhere. This is the classic economic scissors movement. The Financial Editor of the "" Sydney Morning Herald"" also saidMore and more contemporary family budgets depend on the wife earning wages at various stages of the married life. Areas in which this is markedly below the average occurrence are under-privileged areas, unless or until employers like BHP. come to pay special loadings to married ment in the housing industry. But if the men or all men. In the 1961 census, Wollongong had the worse example of disproportion between the sexes of any city in Australia. There were 72,000 men and only 61,000 women. That imbalance has been due to the policy of the steel industry of, where possible, bringing out single migrants because it is easier to accommodate them in hostels. The problem has been further aggravated by girls and married women leaving the city and going elsewhere. The Minister, of course, is discreetly silent on this. His Government always has been and intends to be, because it does not have any solution to the problem. What is the situation with wages? The average unskilled steel worker in my constituency has a take home wage of about £18 10s. a week. The national average is somewhere near £27 10s. or £27 15s. Is there any wonder that there is acute unemployment-that an unusually high percentage of women are forced to go out on the labour market seeking work that is not there in order to supplement family incomes? Migrants are being induced to come from the United Kingdom. They are being offered jobs as production operators at £22 a week. But the expression "" production operator"" is only a euphemism for an unskilled labourer. The migrants are brought out, dumped in hostels under the control of the Minister and they are trapped there. When the realities are brought home to them and they find that the £22 a week was based upon some overtime which is now largely non-existent, they want to move elsewhere. They were told in Britain by the agents for the steel industry that there would be work for their wives and for their adolescent children. There is neither. When they eventually come to the local parliamentarians and ask for a transfer to another hostel in another major city where employment can be found, they are told they cannot get it. In other words, this Minister and his Department are conducting a system of industrial peonage. What is the general employment position in Australia? The figures are there for all to see. The Minister, of course, puts the boldest possible front on the latest statistics. He can rationalise if hechooses. He can clutch at the straw. He can draw what comfort he likes from the slight rise in employMinister were quite frank he would tell the House that there was also a fall in other forms of construction in the housing industry. These are the statistics. In August 1964, 25,975 people were registered as unemployed. In 1966, the figure was more than double that; it was 54,279. In the same period, job vacancies dropped from 43,616 to 37,432. The position is even worse than this, because there is a considerable amount of what is euphemistically termed over employment. I quote from the "" Australian Financial Review"" of 23rd September last. The article is headed "" Economy going nowhere "", and statesBusiness expectations are failing and unless the long-awaited upturn in consumer spending occurs soon the shakeout in the over-employment many businesses carry for some time after their operations run at less than top capacity will inevitably occur. Let us go on to another facet of the present situation and let us consider the comments of Mr Justice Taylor of the New South Wales Industrial Commission. The"" Sydney Morning Herald"" of 26th August last reported the scathing remarks of Mr Justice Taylor in these termsThe President of the N.S.W. Industrial Commission, Mr Justice Taylor, said yesterday the Commonwealth Arbitration Commission was threatening to do away with the basic wage. He said that if the Arbitration Commission followed its present trend of thought, the basic wage, which ensured a decent standard of living for the worker, would cease to exist. He was also reported to have said. . . the Commonwealth Arbitration Commission's assessment of the capacity of the economy to pay an award wage seemed most unscientific. "" It is based on very sparse information, and out of the whole of the discussion it seems to me you pluck a figure out of the air"", he said. That is precisely the situation. The report continued""The argument before the Court is lhat the concept of basing a wage on the real needs of a worker should be discarded, and that the wage should be based on the capacity of the economy to pay. ""The Commission is teetering on the edge of overthrowing thc traditional conception of the Australian basic wage."" In spite of such a system and such deficiencies in fact finding, let us consider what this Government did. The last Labour Administration had inserted in the Conciliation and Arbitration Act provision for an Office of Economic and Industrial Research. The functions of the office were to be to collect and compile, in accordance with the directions of the Chief Judge, information which might be or assistance to the Court and to Conciliation Commissioners in the exercise of their powers; to keep information so collected and compiled up to date; to carry out research in respect of such matters as the Chief Judge directed; and to make the information collected and compiled available to such persons or organisations as desired to obtain the information. This Government chose to repeal that section of the Act. But what do we find developing now? I shall quote from the judgment of Mr Commissioner Winter in the recent General MotorsHolden's Pty. Ltd. case. This, I think, is a classic criticism of uncontrolled greed and profit taking. Mr Commissioner Winter is reported in the ""Australian Financial Review"" as saying"" Apart from a little inexpensive flattery, it is not enthusiastic about showing appreciation of those who have helped to create thc wealth that is the company"", he said. "" Its employees and its customers have deserved well of G.M -H. "" In fact, its general attitude might be described it good all the time rather than to take the as being mercenary. "" Such an attitude makes a mockery of any pretence to industrial partnership between employer and employees."" There can be little doubt that I am of the opinion, in all the circumstances, that employees of the company have a moral entitlement to share in the extreme profits being made. It is astonishing that the company of its own volition has not taken such a step. What is the attitude of the trade union movement to the general question of arbitration? It is disillusioned and cynical, and it has every right to be, because the only commodity in Australia today the price of which is strictly controlled is the sale of human labour. This is to the eternal discredit of the present Government. There will be, Oi"" course, a trade union demonstration in Canberra of representatives from Sydney and from my constituency in the middle of next month. The trade unionists will have a good deal to say, they will get a good deal of publicity, and they will get the support of members of the Opposition. The delays in arbitration are nothing short of scandalous at present. The decision on margins in the metal trades award case has been unduly and scandalously delayed. The demands of the trade union movement are quite simple. It wants protection against price increases. It wants consistent wage fixing policies. It wants a fair share of productivity gains and it wants a share of exceptional profits being made in certain cases. It wants the abolition of the penal clauses. The right to sell or to withhold human labour is the fundamental right of every human being. Labour and National Service) [9.12] -First I should like to refer to one or two remarks made by the honourable member for Cunningham ( Mr Connor), since he was the last speaker. He referred to the discontent, as he called it, of many members of the trade union movement with arbitration. It is true that certain members of the trade union movement have been vocal on the subject of arbitration, but I suggest that some of those people who have been so outspoken when decisions have gone against them should bear in mind the very many occasions when decisions of the various arbitration bodies have gone in their favour. Some people are disposed to want rough with the smooth. As a result of the system that has developed in Australia over the years we have better labour relations",54,Appropriation Bill No 1 1966 67

If his occupation is such that he cannot attend the regular parades, he can again join a special unit and attend two camps a year instead of participating in the national service training scheme on a compulsory basis. Now perhaps I should refer to the remarks of the honourable member for Higinbotham about the problem of married women. He suggested that a national survey of this problem should be made, and this is certainly something that we will consider. On the whole I agree with him that it is probably not the best thing to have a government department conduct such a survey, but we will certainly have a look at the problem. In some fields surveys may be profitably conducted. Sometimes they produce useful information while at other times they merely confirm the obvious. The honourable member for Stirling referred to the removal of the marriage bar. I assure him that he will have full opportunity-a t least I hope so, and I am always optimistic-befor e the end of this session to debate this subject as it applies to the Public Service. The honourable member also brought up the subject of equal pay for the sexes. 1 do not want to dwell too long on this, but I say in a preliminary kind of way that equal pay for work of equal value is a very desirable objective and one to which I personally subscribe. At the same time, however, it is quite obvious that if we implemented such a policy overnight we would produce a considerable degree of dislocation in industry. We would redistribute incomes in a way which the honourable member for Stirling, if he really thought this problem through, would not be prepared to accept as something that should happen overnight. Mr Clyde Cameron -What about nurses? Hindmarsh has asked about nurses. I will say something about them because there is something else involved in the case of nurses. There is not only the question of equal pay for work of equal value; there is the valuing of the work as such, however F.l 1348/66 -R -[52 1 it is done, whether by males or by females.

Mr Clyde Cameron What about teachers? member for Hindmarsh would drag his fascinating trail all over the map, but he has not yet made his contribution, so I do not intend to follow him any further. Mr Clyde Cameron -Then why not round off? length. It is surprising what an arc one can describe when stimulated by the remarks of the honourable member. As far as margins are concerned, it is Commonwealth policy to pay the same margins to women as to men, and this is a desirable first step, but when one comes to the basic income structure of the country, this is governed mainly by the operations of the Commonwealtl Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. Any real move for equal pay for the sexes must be taken into account by the members of that Commission when they are fixing wages. If we suddenly increase the income stream in one direction without at the same time increasing the volume of goods and services that the extra money can buy, we will produce some very curious results. ihis conversation between the Minister and the honourable member for Hindmarsh? Stirling is free at any time to persuade his friends to make an appearance before the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission and make submissions about equal pay for the sexes, just as is the retired trade unionist from Watson( Mr Cope), who is so often inclined to talk about the proceedings of the Commission. There were some other fascinating speeches, including that of the honourable member for Dawson (Dr. Patterson). The honourable member cited a number of cases of exceptional hardship.

233,Mr Bury,"The honourable member forexceptional hardship in rural areas, that during the last few months 80 per cent, of applications in rural areas for deferment on grounds of exceptional hardship have been granted, as distinct from 50 per cent, in the cities. As the honourable member very rightly pointed out, decision in these cases have been taken out of the administrative field and into the judicial field. I suggest that the honourable member for Dawson think very carefully before advocating that too much administrative discretion be given to Ministers. The opportunities, over a long period, of political interference with the national service training scheme would in fact destroy its basis, because it would be very difficult to convince an individual that the treatment he was receiving was fair when compared with that given to some other person. As long as I administer the scheme the basis of my policy will be that as far as possible all individuals will be treated completely on a par. They will be treated quite objectively by someone other than myself and outside my Department. Mr Clyde CameronA lot of the Minister's colleagues are starting to yawn. ber for Hindmarsh is not. I do not know whether he is eager to say something on this occasion, but he will have to contain his impatience a little longer. NowI refer to my good friend, the honourable member for Scullin( Mr Peters). I thought that tonight he was unusually calm and, most of the time, quite lucid. He will not, I am sure, resent it if I say that when he talks about foreign investment I wonder now and again whether he has a touch of rabies. However, I happened to skim the article to which he referred, and my understanding Deputy Chairman. The Minister said that at times he thought I had a touch of rabies. If that remark had been made by any other member of this Parliament I would have objected to it. able member for Scullin that I do not think he was malevolent in quoting Major-General Vickery, but, if I may say so, I do not think he got the same understanding of the purport of the statement as others did. The honourable member for La Trobe pointed this out very clearly. out. the honourable member for La Trobe to point out that .what General Vickery said was that the Citizen Military Force was certainly equipped to fight overseas, if necessary. As far as commenting on conscription is concerned, the honourable member for La Trobe said that General Vickery, quite naturally, would not comment on this because he was wrapped up with the C.M.F. and this was a political matter. So it is, because basically the military factors are subordinate to political questions. National service is a political question. It is bound up fundamentally with Australia's survival and this is certainly a major political end to which any military consideration should be bent. Our survival is currently wrapped up with the effort we are making in Vietnam. Even more fundamentally it depends upon the strength of our armed forces, of which national service is an indispensable ingredient without which our security could be in grave jeopardy.

240,Mr Uren (Reid) [9.50],"In the few parts of Australia blending with the goodbe about 10 miUion or possibly 20 million. Now, with the development of science and the coming of the atomic age in which atomic isotopes are used for distilling water, salt water can be converted to a form suitable for irrigation, and trace elements can be used to develop the fertility of our soil, we know that the population of Australia will one day exceed 100 mUlion. Therefore the planners of Canberra should be thinking not of a capital city of a nation of between 10 million and 20 million people but of a capital city of a nation of between 100 million and 150 million people. It should not be thought of as the capital of a small nation. We should be planning a capital city for what one day will possibly be one of the great nations. I remind the Minister that I am not levelling criticism at the Government. I know of the difficulties in getting finance from the Treasury to develop this city. I know also of the criticisms levelled by the States at the Commonwealth Treasury. I feel that all members of Parliament should read and consider the report by this man of foresight, Lord Holford. He has made certain criticisms of the standards and status of some of our buildings. He says that the architecture of most of our buildings in Canberra is not up to international standards. He says that so far the only building of any note is the National Library which is still being constructed. We have to think about these things. We must stop thinking on a small scale. We must start thinking that one day Canberra will be the capital of a nation of 150 million people. I have been toying with this idea for some years, but it was really brought home to me last year when I was in Washington, D.C. I looked at Washington and saw evidence of the great foresight shown by those who planned the city. Consequently, I wish to make a couple of suggestions. Lord Holford said in his reportThe problems that face the development of the Government Triangle do not seem to me to consist in finding sites, but in keeping its communications feeling of great expanse, a feeling of openclear and in creating not only fine buildings but also a distinguished and enlightened setting for them. It seems to me that even with the planning by the National Capital Development Commission there is too much cramming together of buildings. Too many buildings have already been planned for the Government Triangle. I should like to sec Parliament House situated on Capital Hill. I would like our present Parliament House, which was only intended to be a temporary buUding in the first place, demolished when the new Parliament House is built on Capital HiU. I would like Parliament House to be on Capital Hill, with nothing to obstruct the view from it over the lake, up ANZAC Parade to the Australian War Memorial. If Canberra is to be the capital of Australia and the structures here are to represent a vast nation, we must give the impression of vastness in the capital. 1 do not want Parliament House to be situated down on the lakeside with other buildings cluttered around it and the existing Parliament House behind it, and behind that a convention centre, and behind that centre a national gallery and other structures on Capital Hill. I want to see a capital which has, in its government triangle in particular, distinguished buildings of beautiful architectural design. 1 want to see erected on Capital Hill a Parliament House that will be the pride of, not a small nation but a nation that some day will be great. Now is the time to start thinking and planning for the future. I am not criticising the Government's achievements in the past; I give the Government credit for anything that it has been able to do in its sixteen years of office. It has at least tried to do something to make this a great national capital. But we are moving very fast indeed, and in the last 16 years we have never appreciated fully the great potential of Australia. Great mineral deposits have been discovered, but in fact we are only just beginning to scratch the surface of this great country. I repeat that my reason for wanting the new Parliament House to be erected on Capital Hill and for suggesting the demolition of the present Parliament House so as to permit of an unimpeded view from this spot to the Australian War Memorial, is that I want to give a ness. I want to avoid any feeling of being cramped. This is a great, broad land. For heaven's sake, let us get away from the mentality of those who would have tenement houses in such a land. There is another aspect of Lord Holford's report with which I wish to deal briefly. It relates to transportation. No doubt my colleague the honourable meniber for Blaxland( Mr E. James Harrison) would be more competent than I am to discuss this subject. Lord Holford says in his report1 was asked during my last visit in August 1965 why I wanted to discuss with (he Commission public transport and mass-transit systems . . . . when it was obvious that the private car, supported by a few buses, and running on freeways and distribution roads, would sufiicc for all traflic needs for as far ahead as one could foresee. There are several reasons. Planners should always try io avoid and profit by the mistakes of the past, and Canberra is being planned for a greater future than that of the avcra c t.nvn of its prer.ent size. He goes on to sayThe opportunity exists now. For those reasons, we should look at the transport system of Canberra now. We must avoid making mistakes which would cost a great deal to rectify later. Lord Holford has given us the benefit of his great wisdom and foresight in these matters. I do not say that I agree with everything lhat he says, or that we should accept ihe whole of his recommendations, but I do ask the Government to give serious consideration to what he has said with relation to transport within the city of Canberra. After all, what are just over 35 years in the history of a country like Australia? 1 believe that by the turn of the century it will be necessary to have underground or subway railways in this city. Most capital cities of the world are building subways. Jn 1960, when I was in Peking and when the Chinese people were rebuilding that ancient city, I saw that they had started upon the building of subways. If that can be done in cities such as Peking, why cannot it be done in our Australian cities? We have better techniques, more skill and more mechanical equipment for getting the job done in the correct and efficient manner. ln conclusion, let me say that, whatever government succeeds this Holt-McEwen Administration I hope that it will strive to build a great and wonderful capital city, a city of which Australians may justly feel proud, and a city that will symbolise the growth of Australian nationalism. section of the estimates for the Department of the Interior about which I wish to make a few points is the provision of $140,000 for the Electoral Branch. I understand from a reply to a question given by the Minister for the Interior( Mr Anthony) that the estimated cost of conducting a general election in Australia is in the vicinity of $1 million. $1.5 million. that correction. I think most honourable members will agree with me when I say that the Divisional Returning Officers do an excellent job, at short notice, in organising the manning of polling booths at every election. Their task is no light one, especially when we realise that in some electorates there are 120 booths and that in electorates such as Dawson there are 250. The Divisional Returning Officers do a magnificent job in finding people to act as presiding officers and booth clerks in the polling booths at the various centres. But I feel that these officers could do an even better job if they were able to visit the polling centres in the various electorates at least once during the term of each Parliament. I realise, of course, that one can only guess at what is the term of a Parliament, and 1 know that these men have other duties to perform. There are elections other than Federal elections and there is the conduct of the census. But if they were given more opportunity to visit the various polling centres, they would have a better idea of just what facilities are available. I would remind the Minister that in a number of polling booths the lighting facilities are not all that are to be desired. This is most inconvenient when voting is continued until 8 p.m., especially if one is attempting to complete a complicated ballot paper such as a Senate ballot paper. With poor lighting, the elector often is writing in his own shadow. I believe that this may contribute greatly to the large number of informal votes recorded at Senate elections. It may be a reason why there are so many more informal Senate ballot papers than there are House of Representatives ballot papers. On the latter there are, at the most, only four or five candidates named, except in most exceptional circumstances.

243,Mr Hansen,"I thank the Minister forhave been closed down and in some cases have been moved to other areas. This is so particularly in Queensland. Some of the sniall school buildings are now being used for housing, for Country Women's Association rest rooms and for other purposes. They are no longer available to the Divisional Returning Officer, with the result that from Queensland. This is understandable, often he finds it necessary to arrange for space in a private home to be used as a polling booth. I am not saying there is anything wrong with this, although some criticism may be offered of the rentals charged in some instances. For example, in one case the rental charged for a comfortable front room was only Si, whereas at another place the rental asked for the use of an open verandah in a house on high stumps, which necessitated the climbing of many steps, was $3. The verandah was wide open and electors complained about lack of secrecy when recording their votes, yet the Divisional Returning Officer was asked to pay a rental of 30s. for those poor facilities. lf Divisional Returning Officers were afforded facilities to travel about by car to visit polling centres, they could see for themselves what the conditions were and they would be able to discuss with people on the spot the most suitable locations for polling centres. There are, of course, different polling centres for State and Federal elections in some instances. Sometimes people vote at one polling booth in State and local authority elections and then they turn up at the same location to vote at a Federal election only to find that there is no polling booth there and that they have to go somewhere else to cast their vote. This brings me to the question of the hours of polling. I have mentioned the problem of lighting at polling booths. At some booths, it must be remembered, there is no electricity and kerosene lamps have to be used. Often, even if there is electric lighting, the light is too far behind the voter as he completes his ballot paper for him to be able to see clearly what he is doing. On 1st October 1964, I asked the Minister for the Interior( Mr Anthony) whether he knew of any reasons why the hours of polling at Commonwealth elections should not be shortened from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. to 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. He said that this could not be done. I also asked him could he tell me what were the hours of polling in the various States at local authority and State elections. He said that he was not sure but he would find out and give me the information, and he subsequently did so. He also said that for some time requests had been made that the hours of polling be shortened to 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. These requests were received principally because almost everywhere in that State, even in summer, it is definitely dark by 8 p.m. and lights are needed to see what one is doing. The Minister said also that in the southern States the later voting hours were more favoured, particularly in country areas, by voters who worked in the fields and paddocks and who found it better to vote during the later polling hours. He said that his own experience was that a high percentage of electors liked to vote between 6 p.m. and 8 p.m. The Minister later provided me with a list showing the hours of polling at the various elections in the respective States. The hours of 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. are the general rule for Commonwealth elections. This gives a spread of 12 hours. In New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia, the hours of voting in State elections are 8 a.m. to 8 p.m.; in Queensland 8 a.m. to 6 p.m.; and in Tasmania, 8.30 a.m. to 7 p.m. The position in respect of local authority elections is more complicated. In the cities listed in the Local Government Act of Victoria, the hours of voting are from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. It is still daylight in many parts of Victoria at 8 p.m. in the summer. In the shires, the hours of voting are from 8 a.m. to a time not earlier than 4 p.m. There is an option allowing for polling booths to be closed at any time after 4 p.m. In the towns, boroughs and cities not listed in the Local Government Act, the hours are from 8 a.m. to a time not earlier than 5 p.m. In the last two instances, the hours may be shorter than the period from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. which is laid down in Queensland. In South Australia, in elections for metropolitan corporations, polling takes place between the hours of 8 a.m. and 7 p.m., and in elections for country corporations and district councils, between 8 a.m. and 6 p.m. In Western Australia, the hours of polling are from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. In Tasmania, they are from 8.30 a.m. to 7 p.m., the same as in State elections. I just make the point that, whether or not voters prefer to vote later and are opposed to shorter polling hours, in local authority elections, in many instances, the hours o-' voting are shorter than those prescribed for Commonwealth elections. I believe that people are creatures of habit. Any storekeeper will tell us that if his closing time is 5 p.m., someone will come along five minutes later seeking service, lf his closing time is 8 p.m., someone will arrive wanting to be served five minutes later. If his closing time is 10 p.m., someone will be at his door al 5 past 10 wanting to be served. The same sort of thing applies to polling booths. Those who have manned them find that the same people repeatedly come along at thc last minute to vote. Let mc just give an illustration of what can be done. It has been pointed out to me that the first issue of food coupons and clothing coupons lo Australian civilians under the rationing arrangements introduced during the war was made over two days-Saturday and Sunday. The electoral oflicers arranged for the issuing offices to remain open on thc two days to make the issue. At thc second issue, when this became necessary, the same number of people were issued with coupons on Saturday only. I may be corrected on this, if I am not right, but 1 believe gaged at the scrutiny and who is in charge of that thc hours of issuing were from 8 a.m. to 5.30 p.m. This shows that it would be possible for the same number of people as vote now in local authority and State elections to vote in Commonwealth elections in the shorter period allowed for local authority and State elections. The additional hours of polling are not needed. I believe that they to some extent delay the counting of votes and they certainly mean much longer working hours for those who perform the functions of the Commonwealth Electoral Office at election times by working as assistant returning officers, presiding officers, assistant presiding officers, poll clerks and the like. Here, I want to discuss the rates of remuneration. I do not know when they were last reviewed, but they seem to be very much out of proportion with the work that is done. 1 have not been able to get figures for all thc States. However, I know that in Queensland the rates paid in respect of State elections are higher than those paid in respect of Commonwealth elections though the hours worked are fewer. We must also remember that those officers who attend the scrutiny do not just collect the voting figures for the House of Representatives. They have also to provide a total for the Senate. Let me take the case of a poll clerk. 1 do not pick out this category for any particular reason. A poll clerk who is not engaged in the scrutiny receives SI0.50 for a day of 13 hours. He is expected to be at the polling booth at 7 a.m., one hour before polling begins. This is necessary. 1 believe that he should read his instructions, regardless of how much experience he has had. From time to time, cases of polling officers not having read the instructions that they received from the divisional returning officer crop up. For example, 1 have found that many people are in effect disfranchised because the presiding officer, for one reason or another, has failed to initial a ballot paper before handing it to the voter. A poll clerk has to remain at the booth for 13 hours and may not leave it unattended at any time. For this, as I have said, he receives remuneration of $10.50. An assistant presiding officer who is not engaged at the scrutiny receives Si2.50 for a working day of 13 hours. A presiding officer who is not ena booth containing only one table receives SI2.75. If in charge of a booth containing two or more tables, he receives $17.25. In many country districts an officer may have to drive 20 or more miles to deliver his ballot box. The only additional remuneration that he receives for this is 9c a mile. The document setting out the rates of remuneration specifically statesThe above mentioned remuneration has been determined on the basis that the hours of service on polling day shall he held to commence at 7 a.m. and to end at midnight and includes all personal expenses such as board and residence, refreshments, &c. Those rates are totally out of keeping with rates that can be obtained elsewhere for similar hours. The people who are employed lor an additional three or four hours as scrutineers receive, in the case of a presiding officer in charge of two or more tables, $3 for three hours. In other words, if he works from 8 p.m. until 11 p.m. he gets only $1 an hour. I do not think you would get people to work for these rates if it were not Saturday work and some of them have time to spare. The rates should be revised. Perhaps costs could be reduced by reducing the number of polling places. In these days of modern travel and modern roads some of the smaller polling places could be eliminated, thus reducing costs. crave the indulgence of the Committee to raise a matter which the Minister for the Interior( Mr Anthony) may not consider to be wholly his responsibility. However, I have been advised that the matter does fall within the Minister's jurisdiction. His departmental officers have told me that they cannot do much about the matter, so I asked the Minister to see what can be done. The problem to which I refer relates to conditions on Thursday Island. Thursday Island is not a very big island, but it is perhaps the main island of the Torres Strait Islands. There are SO or 100 islands in the Torres Strait. The availability of land on Thursday Island is very limited, not only because the Island is small but also because there is no natural water supply except the catchment from small hills. Dams have been scooped out of the earth in which to collect this water. These dams must be kept clear of residences because of pollution. The Army owns an area of ground on the Island. It used to accommodate the Torres Strait Light Infantry Battalion, but since the last war it has not been occupied, although I had a look at the area. I looked at the house have tried without success to get the Minisowned by the man who is rumoured to be ter for the Army to re-form the battalion.

The traders on the chased from the Department of the Army Island could easily outbid the ex-servicemen to the Department of the Interior and nowho are virtually squatters on the land. body seems to know who has the responThese ex-servicemen have no chance of sibility in this matter. The Army does not getting other land on which to house their want to touch it and the Department of families. I would urge the Minister to confer with the Minister for the Army( Mr J. M. Fraser) to see whether the land can be leased to the present occupants instead of being sold. I do not think the Treasury would lose anything by leasing the land but the ex-service occupants would gain a lot. After all, they served their country. They are very good citizens. As I have said, the buildings are admittedly sub-standard. The local authorities have cut off the water to these buildings notwithstanding that they have been supplying water for the last 20 years. They are trying to drive the ex-servicemen off the land. I contacted officers of the Department of the Interior who told me that it was rumoured that a man who had a house on the land would buy up all the land, build humpies on it, and let them to the islanders for £7 or £8 a week. The rumour may be right or it may be wrong. I do not know. I have made inquiries in the Department and I have been told that the man already has a house on the land. This is not so. He does not have a house on the land. He has a house on the edge of it. His house is not within the boundaries of the land in question. There is no reason why he should get the land before anybody else. I fear that he may be offered the land in question because he already has a house near it. I would be grateful if the Minister would look into the matter. I visited Thursday Island recently and about to buy the subject land. His house is not on the subject land. The ex-servicemen",64,Pairs

I think I can guarantee that if the men had security of tenure they would raise the standard of their houses. They have no chance of getting other land on the Island. They face hardship if they are put off this land. If these ex-servicemen are given secure doing all sorts of odd jobs and attending tenure of the land I do not think other all sorts of functions.

As a matter of fact, the honourable member for Capricornia has told me that my electorate is within 400 yards of his backyard. At times I must pass through Mount Morgan, which is in the electorate of Capricornia, to get back into my electorate. Apart from this sector of the electorate, however, the boundaries are reasonably logical in that they follow the Dawson River. The electorate includes a number of small towns which add to the extraordinary number of polling booths. At the bottom end of Dawson another amazing phenomenon occurs. In travelling around the Mount Perry and Gin Gin area a person has to cross the ranges to get back into the Dawson electorate and, as my colleague the honourable member for Wide Bay knows, passes within a mile of the post office in the middle of that electorate. I admit there are reasons for the peculiar shape of the Dawson electorate. There is no community of interest between, say, Longford Creek in the north and Gin Gin in the south. The electorate is 600 miles from north to south and in the bottom section of the electorate one is virtually in the suburbs of the Wide Bay electorate and in the middle section in the suburbs of the electorate of the honourable member for Capricornia. I can appreciate the problem confronting the Commissioners, because they must find a specified number of electors to constitute an electorate, but in all seriousness I suggest that at some future time, when practicable, serious consideration be given to making this electorate more homogeneous. Not only would it be to the benefit of the member representing the area but, more importantly, it would be of far greater benefit to the electors in the area. At present there is considerable diffiin service and the aircraft of the future. culty in travelling by road from the top part of the electorate to the bottom part. This is not conducive to efficiency in providing the electors with the best possible service. I have found, too, that maps of the electorate are difficult to follow. They seem to be overprints of Department of Lands maps. It is impossible in many instances in Dawson to ascertain the location of polling booths. I should have thought that a map showing the polling booths would be available. Sometimes I am asked by peopb how to get to a polling booth. It is obvious that unless they know the area well and can swim a few creeks they will not get to the booth. This is not satisfactory. In conclusion I emphasise the problems of the Divisional Returning Officers and urge that those officers be provided with clerical assistance, particularly as their work has increased over the years. I believe it is degrading for a man in charge of an office, who must interview people, to have to type his own correspondence, frequently using only twofingers.This situation should be remedied. delay the Committee for very long, but I should like to mention again the future development of Canberra and in particular the Canberra Airport, a subject that I did not have time to cover in my earlier remarks. Surely all parliamentarians and all residents of Canberra must be concerned about the existing airport. The Government, or the National Capital Development Commission, should give some indication of its plans for the future Canberra Airport. I should like to mention again the experience 1 had last year. I am sure many honourable members have had a similar experience. [ visited Washington, D.C, last year and landed at Dulles International Airport. The distance from the airport to the city is about 20 miles. The whole route is lined with beautiful trees which soften the landscape and give a marvellous effect. I hope that the Government, or the National Capital Development Commission-who ever is responsible for planning the location of the future airport-wil l provide not a mere transit airport but an airport of international standard with runways of sufficient length to handle the jet aircraft at present Wherever the airport is located-it may even be 20 miles from the city and in the State of New South Wales-the road connecting it to the centre of Canberra should be so constructed as to emphasise the softness of trees and show the beauty of the surrounding countryside. My colleague and friend, the honourable member for Dawson (Dr. Patterson), spoke about the beauty of his electorate. I was there not so long ago during the last Queensland election and saw the beauty of",70,Pairs

In my earlier remarks I tried to indicate what a good job succeeding governments have doneI give this Government full credit for what it has done in this regard is no reason why we cannot develop a great in the past 16 years although I give it credit for very little else-in changing Canberra from a second class sheep station to a city of some beauty. A softness and serenity has been developed of which we in Australia should be proud. I hope that governments of the future will make even greater efforts to give us a city of extreme beauty. A government with real vision can step beyond the development and planning of Canberra to the development and planning of the whole of Australia. There is no limit to this nation's development. I want to make one last plug to have the new Parliament House situated on Capital Hill. I do not know whether the Minister has been provided with proper maps indicating what will happen if the new Parliament House is situated on the shore of the lake. If it is of any height the view of the National Library-that beautiful structure which is represented on the front page of this year's annual report of the National Capital Development Commission, that beautiful structure which exhibits an international standard of architecture-wil l be obscured from the opposite side of the lake. Anyone travelling across King's Avenue Bridge from the existing airport or, when it is demolished, from the Defence buildings at Russell Hill will not be able to see the National Library because it will be obscured by the new Parliament House on the lake foreshore. I think I have expressed to the Committee Lord Holford's view that the Parliamentary triangle is already cluttered with too many buildings and that we should limit the sites. I believe we should build the new Parliament House on Capital Hill so that the view I have mentioned will not be obscured. I know there will be some criticism of my speech. else to be done but I believe what I have The Minister can remove one possible suggested can be done.

Lord Holford said that Canberra should have buildings of international stature which will gain respect for us throughout the world. As well as seeking to gain the respect of other countries we should also seek to gain the respect of our own people by having a national capital of which they will be proud. In other countries people take great national pride in their capital cities. Every American is proud of Washington. I spent two days in Washington and was captivated by its beauty. Admittedly, I also saw the slums, the like of which I hope we will never have in our capital city. The early planners of Washington, Paris and so many other beautiful cities of the world deserve great credit.

He was quite eulogistic in his remarks about the National Capital. I support him wholeheartedly. 1 know that those remarks will have the full endorsement of most members of the Parliament. I believe that Canberra, as the National Capital, is doing more for this Parliament and for the nation than we realise. It is niaking us more believe that if speed boats were allowed to mature as a nation. It is teaching us all to adopt a national outlook rather than a parochial outlook. It is teaching us not to adopt a prejudiced State attitude to problems which affect the nation. The concept behind the establishment of the National Capital was to get away from the bigotry that existed between States. I am proud to be able to say that the majority of the members of this Parliament speak from a national viewpoint rather than merely from a State viewpoint. We do so because we all get together in one capital city away from the direct influences of Sydney, Melbourne and the other great cities of Australia. When building a capital city it is imporCapitol Hill. Camp Hill is the hill immetant to build a city of which one can be diately behind the present Parliament House proud.

The only provision that could be made for the centre of the city was the construction of an artificial lake.

That is why the Government has not permitted motorised craft on the lake. I ply on thc lake and to disturb its peacefulness and serenity, it would lose a lot of its effectiveness. The size of Canberra has grown. Walter Burley Griffin predicted that it would be a city of 25.000 inhabitants, with the number rising possibly to 75,000. Today the population is nearer to 100,000. By 1980 it could be 250,000. Lord Holford predicts that the figure could be considerably higher than that. But Canberra will never be complete until we have a permanent Parliament House. The building we now occupy is a provisional Parliament House. Walter Burley Griffin proposed that Parliament House be situated on Camp Hill, not on the lake. I do not want to enter into a long argument about this matter. If we did I hope that members of the next Parliaproposals for building a new Parliament House. Australia is growing up as a nation. If Canberra is to be the hub of this great nation, if it is to be the city in which are made decisions which determmine the rate of development of this country, if Canberra is to be the microcosm from which stems growth, development and enthusiasm, then I believe that we must soon decide to erect a permanent Parliament House. As I said a moment ago, I hope that in the life of the next Parliament that decision will be made without too much excitement being engendered. We cannot delay the decision indefinitely. The honourable member for Reid referred to the establishment of an alternative airport citizens. It relates to the call up of 20 year for Canberra. In our plans for the next 20 or 30 years, provision is being made for an airport of international standard at Mulligan's Flat, which is situated on the far side of Gungahlin. However, I do not envisage this airport being built for at least objectors who come before them. I want to 10 years. The cost of the airport would be considerable, and I do not think Canberra warrants an international airport at this stage. What is necessary is a good airpori. one that can handle international passengers to and from Melbourne and Sydney. The Minister for Civil Aviation( Mr Swartz) has already announced that there will be a new treminal constructed on the present Canberra site. 1 believe that there are to be extensions of the runway. The design and size of the air terminal are under consideration. I am happy to announce that in addition to the estimates under discussion provision will be made this year for an improvement of the road link between King's Avenue Bridge and the airport. There will be an upgrading of the road through Duntroon and a new bridge will be built across Woolshed Creek on the road leading straight to the airport. This work will be started this year and I hope it will be completed in the next financial year. The ultimate plan is for a dual highway from King's Avenue to the airport, but for the immediate future only one highway will be built. It will be of a standard which will, I hope, give people a respectable opinion of Canberra when they enter it via the airport. Proposed expenditures agreed to. Progress reported.

The matter 1 want to bring before the Parliament is of national importance and is causing concern to many decent Australian old conscripts for the Australian Army, and to the sending of them overseas. I want to refer also to the behaviour of magistrates in the courts of petty sessions and judges in courts of appeal towards conscientious refer to the legal rights of conscripts. I wonder whether these legal rights have been forgotten by some people. A Sydney judge surely overstepped the limit recently when he asked a young man in Sydney: "" What would you do if an invader tried lo rape your mother? "" If those were not the exact words used they express what His Honour meant to convey. Further, the judge spoke of the 20 years of freedom that this young man had enjoyed as an Australian citizen and asked what he was now doing to earn such freedom. How would the judge know what freedom this young man had had and what the circumstances of his life had been? What had this to do with the appeal? Sir John Cramer -What would the honourable member for Hunter know about it? reactionary waking up over on the Government side. The man about whom these remarks were passed by this judge is named Simon Townsend. He was a journalist, and I hope that his journalist friends in the Press gallery will give appropriate publicity to this matter. He appeared before Judge Curlewis and his appeal was dismissed. The report I have of the case states that Simon Townsend told Judge Curlewis that he would not kill. He says that when Judge Curlewis posed a situation in which",74,Pairs

261,Mr James,"Listen to the oldTownsend's mother might be a victim of an invader's atrocity, Townsend said that he would ilo everything to defend her and, in the emoiion of the situation, might kill the attacker, but was quite sure he would suffer in conscience for such an act. He continues that Judge Curlewis spoke of the 20 years of freedom that Simon Townsend had enjoyed and asked him whether he did not think he should repay the debt of sacrifice which had been incurred so that he could enjoy such freedom. Simon Townsend replied that he felt he was repaying the debt by being a good law abiding citizen and by furthering the cause of peace for which World War II soldiers thought they were fighting. There seems to be a great deal of prejudgment by certain members of the judiciary when dealing with these matters. They seem to have locked minds before they hear the facts of a case. Recently, in Sydney, Judge Goran displayed a similar outlook. It is not easy for a young man to take an unpopular stand because of the dictates of his conscience. In fact, to my mind, it takes a lot oi courage of a special kind to do so. Asking a young man in effect whether he would stand by while his mother was being raped was an outrageous thing. It was wounding to this young man, a young Australian, and to his family, and does little credit to the law. I wish to refer also to the way in which certain real cases of hardship are treated by magistrates. I will instance a particular case. younger children. The magistrate said to A married man with a 13 months old child, and a wife who was expecting another child in 6 months time, applied for deferment of national service on the ground of hardship. The wife, 19 years of age, is an asthmatic and according to the medical evidence she needs someone to be with her whenever she suffers an attack of asthma. The applicant said that his wife and child depend on his personal care. The magistrate said that the wife's mother lived nearby and therefore the wife had someone to care for her if she became ill. He said that he did not consider it a case of exceptional hardship. The applicant was under the impression that he was applying for permanent deferment but was told that there was no such deferment on the ground of hardship. In fact, there was no deferment at all for him, and for his sick wife, a girl of 19 with one baby in her arms and another coming. From my experience as a police officer for many years I know that the average man on the bench is human and, on many occasions, merciful, and is not given to sadistic expressions of the type I refer to tonight. The average Australian citizen can usually depend on fair treatment from the bench. I hesitate to believe that some of the courts are not as impartial as they should be, particularly when dealing with conscripts or deferment applications, but I have been told that the courts have had their orders from this Government, that they have been told that the Government wants to crack down on conscientious objectors. The evidence I have disclosed indicates that the Government has instructed the magistrates that only in exceptional cases should they grant deferment to those seeking it on compassionate grounds. It is harder to believe when the figures for the voluntary enlistment of our young men show an enormous number of rejections. It is almost unbelievable while the call up seeks to hang on desperately to every 20 year old. In a recent reply to a question by Senator McClelland, the Minister supplied figures for rejections of volunteers which would shock the nation. I wish to mention a final case of deferment put before a Melbourne magistrate. A mother asked that her son be left with her as he was part of her support. She had other her: ""You appear to be young enough to go out to work yourself and some of the other children might soon be able to help. Surely someone would look after the younger children if you had to go to work."" The young conscript-the 20 year old son -wa s ordered into the Army. What sort of a soldier does the Army expect that man to be? There is a certain savagery in these cases which is not justified by the circumstances of the undeclared war in Vietnam. We have about 5,000 troops in Vietnam, about half of whom are young conscripts. We are not fighting an all out war. We are not actually going all the way with L.B.J., despite the Prime Minister's statement in the United States which caused a belly laugh to ripple around the world. We do not have our backs to the wall. We are not in danger of invasion. The bulk of our manpower over 20 years of age is proceeding with civilian duties. Big business is making enormous profits out of strategic materials. Seventeen members of the Liberal Party sit opposite, and none of them has indicated his intention to enlist. Mount Isa Mines Ltd. is making an annual profit of about SI6 million. This is surely a case in point. Money manpower has not been called up-onl y the 20 years old kids. The war, for these young fellows, was a shock and the most unexpected event in their lives. Surely, therefore, there should be more decorum in the handling of these cases. I hope that Parliament will take care of the rights and wrongs of the situation. The coming Federal elections will place the issue squarely before the Australian people. If conscientious objection is a crime, or if seeking deferment is a sort of criminal act. why does not the Government say so? If, on the other hand, it is the law, let it be administered as such and let us be saved from the inhumanity and savagery of cases such as i have quoted. Saturday evening's edition of the Melbourne "" Herald"" an article appeared headed "" Labour Speaks "". Underneath that heading was a sub-heading "" Need for Vigilance "". The article was written by Bill Hartley, Victorian Secretary of the Australian Labour Party. It read, in partCivil liberty in Australia is strongly dependent speaking before a public audience was asked on the vigilance exercised by major political purabout the membership of the National Civic ties in protecting their own machines and thus our system of parliamentary democracy from infiliraiion by those who would repress liberty and turn Auslralia into another Spain or .South Africa. the associate members were Protestant.

The tirst was for control of the ALP. Later in the article, this appearedIn the Ballarat area, the Liberal Party member for Ballarat North. Mr Tom Evans, is carrying nut a rearguard action to stop this infiltration. Two of the other Liberal Party MP's for the areaapparently detached but actually frightened silence about the affair. The NCC influence in the Ballarat Liberal machine is such that an organiser who complained about it was sacked. We know who the organiser is to whom they are referring. He wrote to the Secretary of the State Liberal Party and resigned of his own volition, of his own accord. If it were not for certain people involved in this lying trash, people who are unable to defend themselves, I would not now be attempting to highlight that which most decent thinking people would push aside without further thought. The two people to whom I refer are my two colleagues who unfortunately are not in a position to defend themselves. There are five members in the Ballarat areaone Federal member, two of the Legislative Council and two members of the Legislative Assembly. Three of them are: Mr Evans, Liberal, an Anglican; Mr Dickie, Liberal, an Anglican; and myself, Liberal, an Anglican. Two members were purposely not mentioned in this article and it was implied that they were members of the National Civic Council and were infiltrating thc Liberal Party. One is Mr Byrne, M.L.C, Liberal, a Catholic; the other is Mr Stephen. M.L.A., Liberal, a Catholic. Since this article appeared I bave endeavoured to check on the National Civic Council. I found that Mr Santamaria, a man whom I have never met in my life, to whom I have never spoken on the telephone and with whom 1 have never had any written communication, i.s the President of thc National Civic Council. I found out also that Mr Santamaria on one occasion when Council and replied that most of the members were Catholic and that a number of have found out also since making these inquiries that one of the National Civic Council organisers in New South Wales is a member of the Australian Labour Party. him. I found out, too. that the National Civic Council is non-Communist and has no Communist members. It is not seditious in any way and it is not disloyal to our Queen or our country.

This is the point. It is because they are Catholic and because all their lives they and their families before them have been members of the Liberal Party. In fact, Mr Stephen, who has been a personal friend of mine of long standing-ove r 16 or 17 years-ha s always been a member of the Liberal Party. In 1955 he supported me in a pre-selection ballot against Mr Byrne. In 1956 he supported Mr Dickie against Mr Byrne. This man, who is a Catholic, has no forum in which to defend himself, but he is treated in this cheap insidious way. it is implied that he and Mr Byrne are members of the National Civic Council and, as such, that they are evil. To show further what the Victorian Executive is like, I refer to Councillor Holland, who holds one of the Melbourne seatsI forget which. He did not get a nomination for a seat in the redistribution. Do honourable members know why? It was because he is a Catholic.

Prefabricated steel is coming into Australia, to the detriment of the average technician here. The recent developments in this country regarding the use of steel from Japan and other cheap labour countries can only react in a very detrimental manner to the employment possibilities of Australian citizens. Members of the public should protest in every conceivable manner to their respective members of Parliament, both State and Federal, and call on employer organisations whose interests are adversely affected to join forces with the trade union movement to bring to an end the importation of prefabricated steel to Australia from Japan and other cheap labour countries. Let me turn to the development of Australia's mineral resources and the construction of oil refineries. The various monopolies concerned, many of them of overseas origin, are turning to other countries with much cheaper labour for the steel with which to construct their plants. In addition of our steel technicians, this in fact constitutes a peaceful conquest of Australia by those overseas monopoliesa fact to which I have drawn attention in the past. The Federal Government, an employers' government, has had this fact forcibly pointed out to it on a number of occasions but so far has failed to do anything about it. It was as a result of its failures that the Government suffered a resounding defeat in a recent by-clection in Queensland when Dr. R.

270,Mr Curtin (Kingsford,"Smith) [11.43].Mineral wealth exists in unbelievable quantities in the northern part of our continent, but all that is happening is that this Government is allowing foreign monopolies to grab that wealth at an extremely low price, leaving us with the quarry holes to lament. Recently an American millionaire was quoted as saying: "" Christopher Colombus may have discovered America but we American businessmen have discovered the mineral potential of Australia and that represents a fast buck.""a fast buck for the American monopolies. Not Only the Americans have discovered the Australian wealth; to a very large degree, so have the Japanese big business tycoons. Recently it was reported that one of the leading Japanese industrialists had stated in an interview that be believed that part of and 200 men, will employ less than half Australia belonged to Japan. He pointed out also that the Japanese industrialists, by gaining control of thousands of square miles of Australia and bringing in their own work forces and machinery, were accomplishing what so many Australians had died or been wounded in preventing -the taking over of our country by the Japanese imperialists. Not only have the foreign monopolies -the Japanese included-gaine d control of huge tracts of our country, but in building their plants they have not even accorded our technicians the opportunity to work on these projects. A typical example of this is to be found at Gladstone in Queensland where a huge aluminium refining plant is being constructed for Queensland Alumina Ltd. It was intended originally that much of the steel fabrication work be done at Gladstone, following the carrying out of some prefabrication in workshops in the various States. This was done for a while, but then it was found that there was a drying up of orders for work in Australia. Much of the steel which could have been fabricated at Gladstone has been fabricated in Japanese workshops and shipped to the site, only a very minor amount of work having to be performed upon it on site. The various unions concerned have had consultations with the managements of some of the bigger workshops in Sydney and, in fact, with representatives of our national metal trades employers. The overall situation is that these ever, the Japanese were supplying rolling developments are creating tremendous problems for both employers and workers alike. We have a position now where pockets of unemployment exist. In the Sydney area, some of the largest steel construction shops are working with a minimum of overtime or no overtime at all and employing only a portion of the work force they could employ if their shops had the work to carry out. It has been reported that, in addition to what is happening at Gladstone, a new horizontal cracker plant, which is to be constructed at the Boral company's works in Sydney, is to be built largely from prefabricated steel imported from Japan and that, as a result of that move, this job, which would employ between 180 that number. It is also reported that plant extensions at the Shell refinery at Clyde, New South Wales, will be made from steel fabricated in Japan, again greatly reducing the employment of Australian workers who are normally employed on this type of work. Indications are that the Japanese big business tycoons are considering very seriously an iron pelletising plant at Kwinana, Western Australia. No doubt, if this plant is proceeded with, these Japanese exploiters will have the steel made in Japan and will use a minimum of Australian labour to assemble it on site. Not only is a very large volume of prefabricated Japanese steel being imported, but incidental items, such as welding electrodes manufactured in Japan are being imported with it. From these few examples-n o doubt the list is far from complete-it can be seen that Australian workers, and in particular my own union members, are very rapidly being placed in a position where they will be unemployed while the development of industry continues in the interests of tremendous profit making for the owners. Very important reports of infiltration of the steel construction industry in this country by the Japanese monopolies were published in the "" Australian Financial Review"" of 4th May 1966. The article stated that the Japanese railway industry has won its first order to build locomotives for Australia. Before winning that contract, howstock and rails for government railways in Australia. They have the following current orders: 62 bogie ore wagons for the Commonwealth Railways3 ft. 6 in. gauge. North Australia Railway, the manufacturer being Kinki Sharyo which a few years ago also built streamlined carriages for the Commonwealth Railways Trans-Australian Railway; a total of 144 iron ore bogie hopper wagons under construction by Nippon Sharyo for the primate Hamersley standard gauge export line in the north west of Western Australia, which will serve our fabulous iron ore deposits and is supposedly part of our tremendous national development; locomotives that Japan will supply for the 90 centimeter gauge State Electricity Commission network at Yallourn, Victoria; and two electric locomotives that have been ordered from Hitachi Ltd. through its Australian representative, F. Kanematsu (Aus.) Ltd., the total cost of which, including spares, will be $448,000. Strangely enough, the huge wartime munitions manufacturer, the Mitsubishi organisation, also holds orders to build 1,900 freight vehicles for the New Zealand Government Railways. It is interesting to note that the biggest Australian monoply-the Broken Hill Pty. Co. Ltd -whos e hostile attitude towards trade union members is well known, is complaining bitterly to the Federal Government about the importation of Japanese steel. Obviously its profits are affected and it sees more than one occasion, Mr Lyle found danger to its shareholders dividends. We must protest with all our vigour and in every possible way against these developments in the interests of retaining Australian workers' employment and wages. honourable member's time has expired.

It was formed when the South Vietnamese Government, under the Colombo Plan, asked the Australian Government to establish an experimental dairy farm at Ben Cat, some 35 to 40 miles north of Saigon. The expert who was entrusted with the forming of the herd was a man named Lyle, a near neighbour, though not an immediate neighbour, of mine. He had been an artillery officer in the Sixth Division and is a man of high ability and repute, and his word would be irrefutable. He was entrusted with the purchase of more than 100 Jersey cows, most of them in calf, and also with the purchase of some £75,000 worth of modern dairy equipment, which included milk treatment plant, refrigerator, pasteurising plant, bottling equipment, electrical generating plant, general farm machinery and two ice cooled motor vans for transporting milk. The basic idea was to supply milk to the women and children of Saigon. Mr Lyle established 400 acres of pasture.. I have seen photographs of it, and by any standards it was good. He and his wife were constantly menaced by Vietcong action while they were at the farm. They constructed a concrete pill box into which they retired when they were attacked. The house was shot up from time to time. The herd was constantly interfered with. Cows were hamstrung and their udders were mutilated. There were several shootings of cattle and members of the staff were murdered. On the heads of members of his staff on the fence behind the dairy. Early in 1961, he relinquished the management of the farm after some two years of this menacing behaviour. The establishment had come into productivity and some deliveries of milk had been made to Saigon.

Still later, workmen were kidnapped, more guards were killed and wounded, buildings were damaged and several cattle were stolen. irrefutable facts. In mid-1964, the Vietcong entered the farm. Some intimidated the guards while others rounded up and removed 83 cattle, which were later recovered. Vietcong attacks increased and the situation at the farm became increasingly untenable until it was finally abandoned in mid-1964. This is a correct record of what happened. These are facts. I have discussed these matters with the original manager since his return to Australia and I checked and crosschecked these facts when I was in South Vietnam. The Vietcong occupied and pillaged the farm in mid-July 1964. The buildings were looted and destroyed and those housing the milk plant were burnt. Neither the farm nor the herd was ever subjected to aerial attack prior to its abandonment or subsequent to its occupation by the Vietcong. The statement that the farm was abandoned because of bombing by the United States Air Force is not founded on fact. I say that it is dangerous to make such statements and that no responsible person should do so unless he is sure of his facts. Thursday, 29th September 1966. shall not delay the House for very long. I wish to direct attention to the hate campaign that exists in the world and to show honourable members how this may come closer to home than they perhaps think. I am prompted to do so by an article in today's Melbourne "" Herald "".

How do we know that the Vietcong The children sang in unison, pointing toy machine guns and rifles at imaginary capitalists and revisionwill always be against us? Why, some memists, the "" paper tigers "" of the song. A recent Japanese visitor to China described this scene in a kindergarten there-par t of the cradle-to-the-grave indoctrination that the Mao Tse-tung regime is imparting to the country. Children do not escape it, in school or out. They draw pictures of what they think American bomber pilots look like. They play in parks where the amusements have a political twist. A typical carnival handgrip machine-squeez e it as hard as you can and try to ring the bell-is fitted with a plaster head of President Johnson, American Associated Press says. When a youngster squeezes the handgrip he can imagine himself wringing the neck of the US. President. The article also statesIn the palace girls work at embroideryembroidering portraits of Mao. Boys in an art class draw cartoons-of bayoneted American soldiers. Their age: About 10. When the children grow up they may enter the Pioneers movement and wear red scarves around their necks. These are seen everywhere. Later they may go into the Young Communist League or ths more recent and prominent youth force, the Red Guards. Will the indoctrination stick? The article proceeds in similar vein. I mention this matter in order to show that the Liberal Party Government of this country is following the same pattern in Australia. I am prompted to do so by the announcement that a Sydney Grammar School boy has been expelled because he has refused to wear the school Army cadet uniform. An article in the "" Sun"" newspaper stated recentlyThe boy had refused to wear the uniform because he disagrees witb Australia's role in the Vietnam war. He said that he had decided not to wear the uniform after taking part in an exercise at Singleton during the holidays. According to the article, he saidWe were made to take part in a ""search and destroy "" operation at camp. We had to go out and "" shoot"" other schoolboys playing the part of Vietcong. They were dressed in black pyjamas and had red stars sewn on their caps. This sort of thing propagates the idea that it is right to kill the Vietcong. It also shows the school cadets are serving as a preliminary training ground for the war in Vietnam. I feel this is wrong and some protest should be made. What is the difference between that kind of thing and the events that are occurring in Communist China today? I suggest there is no difference at all.

You may do that to men, but you have no right whatever to do it to school kids. I would like Government supporters to attempt to justify this treatment of a 15 year old boy whose politics may not be in line with those of the Government.

Softwood Plantings. (Question No. 1992.) Mr Hayden asked the Minister for National Development, upon notice1. Was a benefit-cost report compiled by the Forestry and Timber Bureau or any other source, provided for the Australian Forestry Council to guide its decisions on its recently announced softwood planting programme? 2. If so, because of the great public interest that this softwood planting programme has generated, will lie arrange for the report to be published? honourable follows1. The expanded programme of softwood plantings arose from a recommendation of the Australian Forestry Council but the responsibility for the plantings rested with the States. The States subsequently requested Commonwealth financial assistance to undertake the accelerated programme. As a part of the consideration of this request the Commonwealth carried out a benefit-cost study which was considered by Cabinet. 2. The benefit-cost study contained information supplied on a confidential basis by State Government instrumentalities; and the study wa3 accordingly prepared for the confidential information of Cabinet. I regret therefore that the request for its publication cannot be met. Reservoir-Commonwealt h Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Authority. (Question No. 2067.)

How many (a) professional and technical; and (b) finance and administrative staff, have been cmployed in the Division at the end of each of the last five financial years? 3. What is the planned future programme of the Division? honourable member's questions are as follows1. During the last five financial years the Field Dam-Commonwealt h Construction Division of the Snowy Mountains Authority has undertaken a variety of construction loans. jobs in the Snowy Mountains area and has also carried out work in Thailand as purl of Australia's assistance under the Colombo Plan and in Bougainville on behalf of Conzinc RioRinto. The work in the Snowy Mountains area includes the construction of major access roads and tracks, aqueduct lines leading stream flow to main storages, exploratory and preliminary open cut excavations for major works subsequently carried out by contract, and camp and township construction.

What amount was provided, in each case, from general revenue, and what percentage of the lotal cost of thc project did this represent? Mr Harold Holt -The answer to the honourable followsOver the last five years expenditure under the heading "" Capital Works and Services"" (Statement No. 3, Item No. 11, attached to the Budget Speech) has been financed from the Consolidated Revenue with the exception of portion of the expenditure of the Snowy Mountains Hydroelectric Authority.

Sales Tax: M o to r Vehicle Scat Belts. (Question No. 2074.) Mr Hayden asked the Acting Treasurer, upon notice1. Is it a fact that seat safety belts for motor vehicles, sold as accessories, are not subject to sales tax? 2. l f so, when was the sales tax removed and at what rate did it apply prior to the time of removal? 3. Is it a fact that seat belts sold as fittings with new motor vehicles are subject to sales tax? l f so, what is the rate of tax? 4. Have road safety authorities recommended the provision of seat belts in motor vehicles as an important safety factor; if so, will he take steps to remove any sales tax applicable to belts provided as fittings in new vehicles? F.l 1348/66 -rt -{51 1 Mr Harold Holt -The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follows1967-68 1968-69 1969-70 1970-71 1. Yes. 2. Motor vehicle seat safety belts are classified $ S S S as exempt goods under sales tax exemption item 1,620.000 113G which applies lo equipment of a kind used in the course of industrial operations to protect persons engaged in those operations. The exemption has applied since 5th June 1961, the date on which it was established that safety belts were being used to a reasonable extent by persons driving motor vehicles in the course of their industrial occupations. Prior to that, safety belts were taxable at 163 per cent., the rate then applicable to motor vehicle accessories. 3. Safety belts sold as fittings with new vehicles are subject to sales tax if they are fitted to thc vehicle when it reaches its taxing point, i.e., in normal circumstances, when it is sold by a vehicle manufacturer or wholesale distributor. There is then only one article, the complete vehicle, to be taxed and tax is payable on its selling price. The amount included in the selling member's questions is as price to cover the seat belts would then bear tax at the rate applicable to the particular type of vehicle. Passenger cars and station waggons are taxable at 25 per cent. Motor trucks, utilities, panel vans and so on are taxable at 12+ per cent. If safety belts are not fitted to a vehicle when it reaches its taxing point, but are sold separately, no tax is payable on the belts even though they may be supplied by the vehicle manufacturer at the same time as the vehicle and subsequently be fitted to the vehicle prior to its sale by a retail dealer. 4. Several authorities have recommended the . . 315.184 fitting of seat belts in motor vehicles. Tn the con. . 323,016 text of the information set out in the answers to . . 342,074 the earlier parts of this question, consideration will . . 389,954 be given, when the relevant sections of the sales . . 418,053 tax law are next under review, to the exemption from sales tax of seat belts provided as fittings in new vehicles. Cigarette Smoking and Lung Cancer. (Question No. 2075.) Mr Hayden asked the Minister for Health1. Is it a fact there is a relationship between cigarette smoking and lung cancer? 2. If so, will he arrange (a) for his Department to undertake a campaign, utilising the various forms of mass communication media, to warn the public of this relationship and (b) to initiate action for all packets of cigarettes to bear at the time of sale a stamp of specified size as a warning to the consumer? Dr. Forbes -The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follows1. Medical evidence indicates such a relationship. 2. Health education campaigns are considered to be within the province of State Governments, but Commonwealth co-operation would of course be available should the States introduce a co-ordinated I answered Question No. 1870, asked by the programme of action towards education of -the public as to the risks attendant upon smoking. Taxation. (Question No. 2077.) Mr Peters asked the Acting Treasurer, upon noticeHow many residents of (a) the United States of America and (b) the United Kingdom are there (for taxation purposes) in each of the following categories-(i ) companies or individuals not engaged in business through a permanent establishment in Australia, and (ii) public companies engaged in business through a permanent establishment in Australia, (iii) private companies so engaged and (iv) individuals so engaged? Mr Harold Holt -Availabl e taxation statistics do not classify non-resident taxpayers according to country of residence or as to whether they are engaged in business through a permanent establishment in Australia. The information available does not therefore permit of an answer to the honourable member's question. Poliomyelitis Vaccine. (Question No. 2085.) Mr Reynolds asked the Minister for Health, upon notice1. How many doses of Sabin oral poliomyelitis vaccine have been purchased by his Department and what was the cost of these doses? 2. Has the Department entered into any long term contractual arrangements for the supply of this vaccine? Dr. Forbes -The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follows1. Three million monovalent doses in 1962 and one million trivalent doses in 196S at a total cost of $213,908 were purchased by the Department. 2. No. As I announced in the House on 13th September, future supplies of Sabin vaccine will be imported by the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories primarily from the Connaught Laboratories, Canada. One million trivalent Sabin doses were imported by the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories this month. Adequate supplies of Sabin vaccine will be available in Australia. Medical Benefits Organisations. Dr. Forbes -On 13th September 1966, honourable member for Werriwa( Mr Whitlam), concerning Medical Benefits Organisations. I now find that the information given in answer to part 4 of the question contained an inaccuracy. The correct answer is as under4. The percentage of the cost of services met by each party during 1965-66 was(a) Fund .. 35.7 per cent. (b) Commonwealth.. 33.9 per cent. (c) Member .. 30.4 per cent. These figures do not include payments in respect of contract medical organisations. honourable member for Gellibrand ( Mr Mclvor) asked a question as followsWill the Minister for Defence inform the House of the methods used to ascertain the number of Vietcong wounded and killed in engagement with our troops? Will the Minister also explain the arrangements made for hospitalisation and treatment of captured wounded Vietrong? If wounded Vietcong are hospitalised and treated by Australian personnel, who bears the expense of the general treatment of these prisoners? I ask these questions in view of the conflicting statements which are appearing in the Press from time to time and having very disturbing effects on the public. I now provide the following informationThe .method used by Australian troops to assess the number of Vietcong and North Vietnamese killed is to carry out an actual body count of enemy dead. The number of wounded is assessed from after-action reports from the troops taking part. Wounded Vietcong and North Vietnamese soldiers captured by our forces are treated in accordance with Article 12 of the 1949 Geneva Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of Wounded and Sick in the Armed Forces in tbe Field. They are dealt with humanely and are not left without medical assistance or care. After treatment by medical orderlies, in the field, prisoners requiring further attention are moved to the battalion Regimental Aid Post, or the main Task Force area, where medical officers and more advanced facilities are available. Only immediate medical treatment is given by Australians. They are not given hospital treatment in Australian hospitals. Prisoners are handed over to South Vietnamese medical authorities as soon as practicable after capture. The cost of the treatment rendered by our forces is a normal charge against the Army funds for the Vietnam theatre.",91,Notes
