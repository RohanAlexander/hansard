Of particular concern today is the lack of spending by the state Labor government on the Gladstone Hospital and the lack of any consideration by the federal government to providing additional stimulus funding to bring this hospital up to a stand befitting an Australian industrial hub. Gladstone Hospital caters for a population of over 45,000, comprises 66 beds in the public hospital system and has community health services. The emergency department is crammed in with the outpatient department and it is totally inadequate for today’s demands. Heaven forbid that we should ever have a serious disaster, because if we do Gladstone Hospital will be stretched beyond its limits. Emergency department presentations have risen by 28 per cent in the last six years. Believe me, they will continue to rise as industry gears up to accommodate the new LNG industry. Thousands of new workers and their families are due to start arriving in Gladstone within the next 12 months and we have a hospital that was built in the 1980s. It is an outrage. It is an outrage because the Labor government is intent on spending $6 million on a GP superclinic in Gladstone that is not needed. That money would be better off being applied to the Gladstone Hospital to provide a stand-alone emergency department and other services that will bring the hospital up to 2010 standards. The management and staff are doing an incredible job with what they have, but they need more. People from Gladstone have to travel to Rockhampton up to three times per week for dialysis treatment. This is not their choice. They have to because Gladstone, Australia’s powerhouse industrial city, does not have the suitable equipment to provide this service. Gladstone Hospital needs $25 million now-no more bandaid treatments. Do it once and do it right. It is just $25 million for a city that provides Queensland, and Australia, with much of its wealth. The government promised a further $1.8 billion for regional health. All Gladstone needs is a lousy $25 million. This government has wasted more than that on the report on the NBN that it will not release to the Australian public. The people of Gladstone deserve better than what they are getting from the state and federal governments. Hindmarsh Electorate: Thebarton Senior College ior College, in my electorate of Hindmarsh. I was very privileged and honoured to be at Thebarton Senior College recently for the opening of the new language centre, which was part of the Building the Education Revolution. Over $1.7 million of funding went towards that particular school. I would like to acknowledge the great work that the staff do there in ensuring that the education system works very well for their students. Many of the students are new arrivals to this country and attend the college to learn English as a second language. Principal Kim Hebenstreit is fantastic and is doing a great job there in running the college. On the day that I was there the members of the governing council were there, as were representatives from TAFE SA, DECS, and Kennett Builders, who built the magnificent lanMAIN COMMITTEE",221,Notices

264,Mr Georganas (Hindmarsh) (10.33 Am),"TodayI rise to speak about Thebarton Senguage centre at Thebarton Senior College. As I said, Thebarton Senior College received $1.7 million in funding to build the centre. We know only too well that there have not been enough opportunities for schools around Australia to undertake major projects like this for quite some time. We know that they were crying out for better facilities to give them the tools to be able to educate our children. Over 11 years, all that we saw from the current opposition were programs for flagpoles-and that was about it. Even then, as an opposition we were not allowed to go to the opening ceremonies; they had to be opened by government members only. But back to the point: the $1.7 million for this language centre will enable students to have the tools to get an education and go on to become good citizens of this country. As governments it is our duty and our job to ensure they have all the tools in their hands to be able to get that education. The $1.7 million for the language centre came from the government’s Science and Language Centres for 21st Century Secondary Schools program. I know there are over 537 projects like this one being built around Australia. It was so good to be there on the day, especially to chat with the builders, Kennett Pty Ltd. How interesting it was to hear their perspective-that the BER had supported quite significant job growth in the building industry, against the backdrop of a pretty serious world financial crisis. The Kennett builders were telling me that they had to take on extra staff, not only for this project but also for many other projects around South Australia, because they picked up quite a few of the contracts. They said they were putting people off before we started our BER projects. It was very good to hear that from them first-hand. So the building of this centre benefits not only students, who will be able to enjoy this facility, but also construction workers and tradespeople in the area because it has created a lot of work locally. (Time expired) Aston Electorate: Roads asked for their views on the Stud Road bus lane. Stud Road is the only north-south road that travels through the city of Knox, and as such it is a very important arterial connecting our community. The response that I received to my newsletter was overwhelming. About 90 per cent of the respondents asked that the bus lane be removed or amended. They said that it was unnecessary, it was dangerous and it was adding to congestion. I have with me some comments from those residents. Sherman from Wantirna says, ‘The bus lanes are dangerous, a waste of space and in my opinion a waste of good taxpayers money.’ Victor from Rowville says: ‘It is a ridiculous and very, very dangerous bus lane. It is unwarranted and dangerous because at various points four lanes suddenly become two lanes.’ Ian from Bayswater puts it very simply: ‘It needs to be scrapped, urgently.’ I could not agree more with these sentiments expressed by local Knox residents. The bus lane is dangerous. The lane does add to, rather than subtract from, urban traffic congestion. And, with only six to seven buses travelling down the Stud Road per hour, it does not warrant a dedicated lane. I have asked the responsible minister to scrap the bus lane and start again or at the very least undertake a full evaluation of it. If such an evaluation were undertaken, it would reveal that the number of buses does not warrant a dedicated bus lane, it would reveal how dangerous it is when traffic has to constantly merge in and out to avoid the bus lane and it would enable a full consideration of the constructive suggestions that local residents have already made, including changing the bus lane to a bus priority lane or having priority signals for buses at traffic lights, rather than having a dedicated bus lane which cars cannot use. MAIN COMMITTEE",223,Constituency Statements
265,Mr Tudge (Aston) (10.36 Am),"In the newsletter I sent to my constituents in October, IWe do need to ensure that buses can meet their schedules, but let us not make that happen at the considerable expense of all other road users, including putting motorists at risk. There are smarter options available. I urge the minister to heed my request to scrap the Stud Road bus lane or at the very least undertake a full evaluation of it. Thank you. Makin Electorate: Asbestos memorial service for victims of asbestos related disease. It is held each year at Pitman Park in Salisbury, where the Asbestos Victims Association of South Australia has established a permanent memorial to asbestos victims. The Asbestos Victims Association of South Australia is a voluntary, not-for-profit advocacy group established to provide any kind of assistance it can to individuals and families who have become in some way victims of asbestos related illness. A white wooden cross for each asbestos victim known to the association is placed adjacent to the memorial on the day. Sadly, each year the number of crosses increases. Public recognition of the extent and seriousness of asbestos related issues and the obligations of those who knew of its dangers reached a peak when the late Bernie Banton became the face and voice of the national asbestos campaign. I met Bernie when he attended and addressed the Salisbury service-I believe in 2006. He was an inspiration to all asbestos victims around Australia and a tireless campaigner for asbestos victims. Since Bernie’s passing, the campaign for justice and support for asbestos victims has continued. Only three weeks ago I attended the Pooraka Neighbourhood Watch monthly meeting. Terry Miller, president of the AVA in South Australia, was the guest speaker on the night and provided an excellent presentation on the topic of asbestos. I note that last week a motion was moved in this place by the member for Reid on this very issue, and I congratulate him for that. I also note that asbestosis and mesothelioma are insidious diseases for which there is no cure. The authorities and those who produced asbestos were warned of its health risk over 100 years ago yet continued using the product for decades with no concern for human life. Not only should they be paying compensation, but those responsible should have been charged with industrial manslaughter. It is expected that, even though the use of asbestos products has been banned for some time, we can expect to see the number of asbestos victims continue to rise. It is estimated that by 2020 around 54,000 Australians will be affected by an asbestos related illness. Sadly, the number of deaths related to the September 11 terrorist attack on the twin towers continues to grow because the clouds of dust caused by the destruction of the buildings were full of asbestos dust which subsequently infected many of the rescuers or others in the vicinity. The campaign related to asbestos being run by the Asbestos Victims Association and its counterparts around Australia highlights more than just asbestos issues; it is a salutary reminder that human life can be of so little value to those driven by greed, and that mindset is still widespread in the world today. I commend the team led by Terry Miller, Kat Burge, Pam Sandys and Tony Henstridge for the work that they are doing in South Australia in trying to change the laws relating to asbestos.

267,Mr Buchholz (Wright) (10.41 Am),"I rise to give recognition in this place to the workcare community care. I attended their AGM recently and congratulated their new incoming committee for stepping up to be part of Beaudesert’s future. The work of the past also should not be forgotten, and therefore I also congratulate the outgoing committee for its great work over the last year, including the final phase of construction of a magnificent new building at the Beaudesert Hospital precinct. The foresight and professionalism shown by the whole project management group of volunteers will be an investment in the community that will receive a dividend for many years to come. Beaucare has been operating since 1987 and has provided a valuable contribution to our community. Beaucare provides a broad range of services, including child care, family support, youth development, community development and support services for the frail and aged and people with disabilities. Under the guidance of President Marg Moss and Treasurer Geoff Ryan, Beaucare runs a family support program called KinKare, which has a relative carer support group in Beaudesert. KinKare provides mutual support information and advocacy to grandparents in relative care and those who do not have access to their grandchildren. The group allows grandparents and kin carers to share their stories of triumph and heartache, obtain access to relevant and up-to-date resources and information, and gain valuable support with understanding. The delivery of the services of Beaucare is overseen by the general manager, Nola Petersen. The second organisation is called Rural Lifestyle Options. It provides opportunities for people less fortunate than us in this place to maximise their quality of life. I had the privilege of visiting Rural Lifestyle Options a few weeks ago and sharing a meal with them. It was just a short walk through the back of the block of my Beaudesert office, but it took me to another place. This is a place where people who would struggle to engage in mainstream settings are given the love, care, skills and confidence to find a better quality of life. In my brief visit I shared a meal and was welcomed by some of the residents. One address in particular will stay with me for the rest of my life. It was an address of welcome delivered by a young man by the name of Martin Caswell. We in this place are used to public speaking; there are many members here who can rise without a moment’s notice and produce an eloquent address without preparation. However, there are also times when the eloquence is not matched by commitment, so we find ourselves watching speeches going through the motions. What a difference Martin Caswell’s speech made to my day. I struggled to understand many of the words that Martin was using, but the passion and engagement which were projected there were truly impressive.

In support of and to assist those women who have been diagnosed with breast cancer and are facing the challenge of dealing with that diagnosis, for the last three years I have been, through my electorate office, organising a series of Pink Ribbon morning teas.

When we look at the funds that have been raised over the last three years through this initiative, we have now reached the $10,000 mark. I am pleased to say that this year we raised $4,662. At St Mary’s we raised $2,157.20, and at Penrith, $2,505. There are many people that I wish to take this opportunity to thank for their support of this event. I would like to acknowledge our guest speaker, Julie Ackroyd, an ambassador for the National Breast Cancer Foundation. All of the proceeds of course of these events over the last three years have gone to the National Breast Cancer Foundation. Apart from having our speaker, Julie Ackroyd, give us some background on her very inspirational story, we also heard from representatives of the Nepean Valley Zonta Club, Lyn Sepatouc, and Lilly Cowen, who are involved in an initiative that provides free breast care cushions to ladies that are going through mastectomies. I would also like to thank those who donated prizes to the event. In particular I would like to thank Krystyna and Kristy Whitbread, Barbara Plummer, Irene Brown, Vicky Griffith, Veronica Fleeton and Oban King. These women have spent many hours working on many of the goods that were offered up for raffle and with their efforts we were able to raise some funds through this process. I would also like to thank those sponsors: Vicary’s Winery; Priceline Pharmacy, Penrith; Morgan’s Hand-Crafted Coffee; the Heritage Terrace Cafe; the Caring Hearts Community Quilters; Penrith Valley Providore; Gloria Jean’s, St Marys; and all of the other sponsors that have contributed to helping us raise these funds that will go to the National Breast Cancer Foundation to assist with further education and research to prevent and treat breast cancer and to assist those women in particular who will face this challenge into the future. McMillan Electorate: Foreign Investment by many rural members such as me. Sixty per cent, or two-thirds, of Gippsland’s dairy farms are in my electorate. Gippsland farmers produce 2.1 billion litres of milk or 23 per cent of the national milk production. The export value of our dairy product is $690 million and 30 per cent of the farms are owned by the people who exist on the property. We have lamb, sheep, wool and potatoes. We grow lots of apples, and there is beef of course. My dilemma is that at the time of retirement these farmers would choose to sell to the best bidder, which is only reasonable. On the other hand, the nation is concerned about internationals from Singapore and China and other countries coming in and buying up properties in South Gippsland and around the nation. Australia has survived and grown and developed out of overseas people investing in this nation-in our mining, in our financial sector, in our businesses, in our agricultural sector. How can I say to a farmer, ‘You can’t sell to the highest bidder; you should go and have an assessment of whether you should sell that property?’ I cannot. If you are a farmer in your 40s, 50s or 60s and you want to retire out of the industry, you should be able to sell to the highest bidder. But the nation is saying, ‘We don’t want our land and property handed over to people from other nations.’ It is a serious dilemma that we have to find a way through. Mr Deputy Speaker Slipper, you come from an area where there has been an enormous amount of foreign investment.

269,Mr Broadbent (Mcmillan) (10.48 Am),"I have a dilemma, and that dilemma is facedproperties. The member for Durack has just walked in. He has an enormous amount of foreign investment in his electorate. Probably one of the highest levels of foreign investment in this country’s history is going on in his electorate. How do I as a member of parliament say to a farmer, ‘This nation says you cannot sell your property to an overseas investor without a review?’ And what if that review is negative towards the farmer? We have a dilemma in this parliament as to how we protect our national capital and at the same time encourage investment from overseas. I put to you that we are going to have to deal with the issue. I have not got an answer. Family Law Legislation Hon. Robert McClelland, released a draft bill for public consultation, open to 14 January 2011, proposing amendments to the Family Law Act to provide better protection for children and families at risk of violence. Since writing an online opinion on onlineopinion.com.au for Graham Young, I have had considerable feedback in my electorate and also across South-East Queensland. The Howard government got it wrong on shared parenting and the protection of children. In 2006, without any social research and in a knee-jerk reaction to the urgings of a vocal minority of men’s groups, the Howard government made sweeping changes to the Family Law Act in parenting matters. By elevating the rights of parents above the need to protect children, the Howard government fettered judicial discretion and created a legislative pathway fixated on shared parenting. The change has been much criticised in reports such as the Family Courts violence review by Professor Richard Chisholm, a former justice of the Family Court; the Australian Institute of Family Studies’ Evaluation of the family law reforms; and the Family Law Council’s Improving responses to family violence in the family law system. A culture of expectation developed that it was worthwhile for children to continue regular contact with a parent even if it meant exposing a child to abuse, neglect and family violence, as a result of the 2006 Howard government changes. Time and again parents felt compelled to agree to contact arrangements for fear of falling foul of the ‘friendly parent’ provision imposed with the 2006 changes. The task confronting any court where allegations are made is daunting, more so in the pressure cooker of an interim hearing, usually shortly after separation and without the benefits of detailed affidavits or cross-examination. The ramifications of terminating all contact between a parent and a child can be many and long term, but the balance needs to be restored in favour of the protection of children, and it is restored by these proposed amendments. The bill incorporates for the first time the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, compelling the court to consider the convention in deciding matters concerning children. The bill elevates the primary consideration of protecting a child from abuse, neglect and family violence over the benefit of having a meaningful relationship with a parent, where there is an inconsistency. It broadens the definition of ‘family violence’ in tune with community perceptions and understanding to include not just actual or threatened physical or sexual assault but harassment; emotional manipulation; financial abuse; cultural, familial and friendship isolation; and a range of dominating and controlling behaviours. The bill also expands protection of children by expanding the definition of ‘abuse’ and approving obligations on court personnel and independent children’s lawyers to report child abuse to state and territory MAIN COMMITTEE",227,Constituency Statements

(Time expired) Durack Electorate: Ms Jan Ford owner of Jan Ford Real Estate, Port Hedland, won the Commonwealth Bank Business Owner Award at the prestigious Telstra Western Australian Business Woman of the Year awards. The Commonwealth Bank Business Owner Award is for owners with a 50 per cent or more share in a business who have the responsibility for key management decision making. Jan is principal and licensee of Jan Ford Real Estate, an agency opened 10 years ago in Port Hedland. Jan Ford Real Estate opened its doors in April 2000 and has grown from a one-person operation to an immensely successful business now employing 13 staff. Jan chose to start a business, in her words, ‘in a town that was sliding backwards, dominated by men, with red dust, cyclonic weather and temperatures of up to 50 degrees’. It was not an ideal business climate for anyone starting a new enterprise. With Port Hedland in the early nineties being such a male dominated area, both in real estate and in mining, Jan was resolute about the need to create a family friendly business. With a lack of infrastructure impeding the growth of Port Hedland, in 2001 Jan became part of a community action group to instate changes needed to support development. Subsequently, she was elected to the local shire and is now on the Port Hedland Port Authority board. Port Hedland port, I might add, is the largest tonnage port in Australia, with a throughput in 2009-10 of 178.6 million tonnes, made up of manganese, solar salt and iron ore. Port Hedland is the home of BHP Billiton and Fortescue Metals Group, led by the famous Twiggy Forrest. Jan is renowned in the local Port Hedland community for working tirelessly for the betterment of the town. She has been involved with the creation and continuation of alliances between local and state government agencies and also federal initiatives. Rather than despair, back in 1999, at her husband’s relocation to an isolated mining town, rather than become despondent because she could not gain employment in the real estate industry upon her arrival, Jan took the bull by the horns, so to speak, and opened her own real estate agency. The Pilbara cities of Port Hedland and Karratha are much different today. With the Pilbara Cities initiative underway, with the support of the state government and, hopefully, the federal government, the Pilbara will be the city of the north and the place to live. It is people such as Jan, who live in isolated and harsh environments and succeed against all odds, who deserve applause from all Australians. Jan is a pioneer in every sense of the word. I congratulate Jan Ford on her win and wish her continued success for many years to come.

272,Mr Stephen Jones (Throsby) (10.57 Am),"I am very proud to represent the Gillardcent. In parts of my electorate, unemployment, and the social disadvantage that flows from this, is an issue that spans generations. Addressing this issue will be a key focus of my work as the member for Throsby and a member of the Gillard Labor government. We have a clear vision and a strong agenda to focus on education and skills. Given the skills shortages that we are dealing with, Labor’s priority is to train our young people for the long term. An important program in this regard is the Gillard government’s $2.5 billion Trade Training Centres in Schools Program. More than $219 million has been allocated in the third round of the program to deliver 58 projects across Australia. I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the principals and teachers who worked on the Illawarra Partners in Education Trade Training Centre. Three schools in this consortium-Warrawong High School, Figtree High School and Illawarra Sports High School-were recently successful in being awarded a grant of nearly $3.7 million. I would also like to congratulate Picton High School and Tangara School for their work in putting together another trade training proposal, which was successful in the latest round in being awarded $1.2 million. Putting together an application like this takes a great deal of time and effort, and I commend these schools for their outstanding commitment to the success of their students. In regions like the Illawarra and Southern Highlands, where there are high levels of youth unemployment and a lack of access to skills training opportunities-and the social disadvantage that rises from this-centres like these are making a real difference to students because they can get hands-on experience in the trades while they are still at school. These new trade training centres will encourage students to build their capacities and skills so that they can participate in our economy and help meet the skills shortages that we face. In contrast to those opposite, who failed to provide this much-needed investment in skills training when they were in government, Labor’s view is that the long-term solution is to be found in training and educating our young Australians to ensure that they can access job opportunities through the growth in these industries. For Labor, skilled migration will only ever be a part of the solution; our focus is on training our young people to meet the skills needs of the future. der 193 the time for constituency statements has concluded. PAID PARENTAL LEAVE (REDUCTION OF COMPLIANCE BURDEN FOR Second Reading Debate resumed from 15 November. That this bill be now read a second time. to listen to and respond to very legitimate concerns about the compliance burden, the cost and the regulatory risk to employers in implementing the government’s Paid Parental Leave scheme. WhatI need to make absolutely clear at the outset, given the mischievous and ill informed comments the minister has made today, as reported in the media, is that this in no way changes the nature of the benefits available under the Paid Parental Leave scheme or the eligibility criteria and in no way impedes the introduction of the scheme from 1 January. In MAIN COMMITTEE",229,Constituency Statements
273,The Deputy Speaker (Hon. Peter Slipper),Order! In accordance with standing or,230,Employers Amendment Bill 2010
274,Mr Billson (Dunkley) (11.01 Am),"This is an important opportunity for the parliamentfact, from 1 January, the scheme will be administered by Centrelink. It is Centrelink that will be handling the paperwork, making arrangements for the payments, confirming eligibility and resolving any disputes that may arise so that the Paid Parental Leave instalments are paid directly to eligible recipients. The proposition contained in the Paid Parental Leave (Reduction of Compliance Burden for Employers) Amendment Bill 2010, is a very simple one: maintain that system. Keep that investment, the infrastructure to deliver the Paid Parental Leave services and all the systems that go along with it that the government is putting in place for the first six months, by continuing those arrangements indefinitely. The bill seeks to ensure that that is the case, because the government’s stated plan and the provisions that exist within the Paid Parental Leave Act actually enable the government to require employers, big and small, to carry out the pay clerk function for the Paid Parental Leave scheme after its first six months of operation. This bill seeks to ensure that that does not happen and that the government continues, through Centrelink’s Family Assistance Office, to administer these payments. In June 2010, parliament passed the Paid Parental Leave Act, and it comes into effect from 1 January next year. The scheme provides for eligible recipients to receive up to 18 weeks paid parental leave per child, paid in instalments, at the national minimum wage. Under the scheme, payments are administered by Centrelink’s Family Assistance Office for the first six months, after which employers will be obliged to receive payments from the Commonwealth for forwarding on to eligible employees, and employers will need to account for these transactions. Significant fines may be imposed on employers that fail to meet the numerous obligations and compliance requirements imposed under the scheme. Let me reiterate that this is not about changing the scheme, the nature or amount of the payments or the eligibility criteria; it is about the way in which the scheme is administered. It is completely mischievous of Minister Macklin to suggest this would in any way hold up the scheme. Employer organisations and the small business community are deeply concerned about being forced to be the pay clerk for the government’s Paid Parental Leave scheme, because of the costs, the red tape and compliance burdens and the risks it will impose. These unnecessary and avoidable costs and risks include the need for employers to become aware of and familiar with their obligations and responsibilities under the government’s scheme-to make necessary changes to their payroll and accounting systems; to train staff; to receive, handle, process and make payments in a timely way, in instalment amounts. There are compliance, verification and reporting requirements, and of course the opportunity cost of this displaced effort and these resources. From the government’s own information, there will be more than a dozen transaction points that will need to be handled by an employer, big or small, and they need to put in place the systems to ensure that they are undertaken in the way the law requires. This bill is about removing that administrative and compliance burden and the costs and risks that the government wants to impose on employers by obliging employers of eligible recipients to carry out this pay clerk function. The effect of the bill will be to indefinitely maintain the role of the secretary to administer the payments to eligible recipients through Centrelink’s Family Assistance Office beyond the first six months of the scheme. What is extraordinary is that the government sees fit and believes it to be entirely appropriate, safe and thoughtful to have the Family Assistance Office administer the scheme for the first six months MAIN COMMITTEE but not after that. It is an arbitrary cut-off arrangement where no credible justification or persuasive argument has been presented. The bill will not change any of the scheme’s parameters or the provisions about eligibility. When the original paid parental leave bill was considered by parliament in June, the Senate agreed to support the coalition’s amendments, and these amendments are replicated in this private member’s bill. But the government threatened to delay the entire scheme if the Senate insisted on these amendments. I have not seen such an extraordinary overreaction and piece of parliamentary bullying in the 15 years I have been representing the Dunkley community here. On an issue of relieving employers, big and small, of a pay clerk compliance obligation, the government was prepared to delay the entire scheme. It makes you wonder: what is really going on here? There has been a chorus of concern raised right across the country-from small businesses, big businesses, representative organisations and thoughtful and leading thinkers such as Peter Strong, the Executive Director of COSBOA, who is in the gallery here today-for the government to abandon this nonsense. But what do we get instead? Minister Macklin was reported in this morning’s paper as saying the coalition wants to delay the start of the scheme. What utter nonsense! There is nothing in this bill that will cause any delay to the scheme. It was the government that threatened to delay the entire commencement of the scheme if the coalition, given that the Senate supported our amendments, insisted that those amendments be captured in the law. You do not necessarily have to agree with me, but I would like to think that Minister Macklin might agree with herself, that the Prime Minister might agree with herself and that Minister Plibersek might agree with herself. I take them back to their 13 July 2007 media release. This was a joint media release from shadow ministers Plibersek, Gillard and Macklin headed ‘Maternity leave’. It stated: Labor will not support a system that imposes additional financial burdens or administrative complexities on small business … Those were their words. They not only said they would not support it but demanded it; they insisted on not having those kinds of burdens imposed on small business and other employers. Otherwise they threatened to delay the entire commencement of the scheme. If for no other reason than personal integrity and implementing election promises, all sides of the parliament should back this bill. In fact, Labor ministers are running around the countryside talking to small business and employer organisations, saying that they agree with the proposition in my bill but that they did not win the argument within Labor. I think it is interesting that even the ACTU, in its Productivity Commission submission in May 2008, stated: The simplest administrative system would seem to be that the government provides the safety net componentsit handles the paymentsto all the new mothers via the existing welfare system, as it does with the baby bonus. Employers would provide any additional top up payment to employees as per their usual methods. That is the union movement’s position, a position reinforced more recently when the exposure draft was developed and entirely consistent with the position reflected in its May 2008 submission. What is quite extraordinary is that the government has gone ahead with a thing completely opposite to what it promised as articulated in its July 2007 press release. MAIN COMMITTEE So what are we left to conclude? We are left to conclude that the government has no interest in hearing from and responding to the concerns of the small business community. COSBOA Executive Director Peter Strong astutely picked up how the Gillard government’s decision to impose this PPL pay clerk responsibility on smaller employers shows that the government: … does not value the time and effort put into the economy by small business by continuing with this. What Mr Strong was saying is that small businesses are not machines; they are run by people, and the people are saying, ‘We have enough of a burden trying to maintain the viability of our businesses and the employment and economic opportunities that they facilitate without having this pointless and completely unjustified imposition distracting us from that work.’ COSBOA has been consistent in its criticism of the government’s imposition of the additional red tape and compliance burden, rightly questioning: Will the government never learn the simple needs of small business? I fear not. It seemed to know it when there was an election in the air; it made clear statements that it now turns its back on. So what are we left to conclude? I think that what we are left to conclude is that something else is going on here. It cannot actually be the substance of the issue. Why would the government threaten to delay the entire commencement of its Paid Parental Leave scheme because of the opposition and the Senate simply wanting to continue the administrative arrangements the government itself was putting in place for the first six months? Why would it want to junk the whole scheme, and why would it make statements of a similar ilk today in opposing this private member’s bill that should have the support of all members in this parliament, particularly any Labor member who wants to stand behind election promises from their side of politics? So what could this be? The government has failed to provide any persuasive justification. There must be something else going on here, not only requiring the administrative arrangements but putting this system in place to fit small business up to top up the commitments. (Time expired) minister seconded? Mr O’Dowd-I second the motion. opposition to the Paid Parental Leave (Reduction of Compliance Burden for Employers) Amendment Bill 2010. It is raining in Queensland, but it is another beautiful day here in Canberra with yet another horrible political stunt from the opposition. It is straight out of the opposition playbook-the ‘deny, delay, destroy’ playbook. It does not matter what the policy is; it seems that those opposite, since August, have been making exactly the same play-or actually we might go back to December last year, perhaps. If we look at the stimulus package, at significant healthcare reform, at a national curriculum or at the National Broadband Network, it is the same thing: deny, delay, destroy. Now those opposite are so ashamed of their own shocking policy on paid parental leave that they are taking the wrecking ball to the federal government’s Paid Parental Leave scheme. For the first time in history Australia has a fully government funded Paid Parental Leave scheme, and I am proud to be a part of the government that has commenced this procMAIN COMMITTEE",230,Employers Amendment Bill 2010
275,The Deputy Speaker (Hon. Peter Slipper),Is the motion moved by the shadow,233,Employers Amendment Bill 2010
276,Mr Perrett (Moreton) (11.11 Am),"I rise, in contrast to those opposite, to voice myess: six months pay at the minimum wage following the birth or adoption of a child. This is an historic social reform. It is not something that was achieved under the 12 years of the Howard government. When we look around the world we see where we were behind. Let us look at some of those countries like Bolivia, where they get 12 weeks; Equatorial Guinea-now there is a real OECD leader; Eritrea; Cambodia; and Mongolia. They are just a few of the countries that Australia was behind when it came to a paid parental leave scheme. It is truly a shameful state of affairs that we took until 2010, under the Gillard government, to bring in this historic social reform. Australian families, as I am sure you know, Mr Deputy Speaker, need this reform, because just like annual leave and sick leave this is a workplace entitlement that is good for the economy. It gives one parent the opportunity to spend more time with their infant in the early months and also to keep on top of the mortgage and the bills. As anyone with kids would know, these bills do not let up just because they have a baby. In fact, it is probably just the opposite. More than 2,000 applications for paid parental leave have already been received from expecting parents, and businesses are also getting on board, with up to 550 employers already signed up. So our Paid Parental Leave scheme is fair to business and good for business. Despite the protestations of those opposite, we are seeing businesses getting on with the fact, catching up with Bolivia, Eritrea and Equatorial Guinea, and saying, ‘This is a good way to treat our employees.’ Let us look at why we should have Labor’s Paid Parental Leave scheme. It is not just because it is the right thing-something that you feel in your gut. We also need to look at the economic reasons. The Productivity Commission, a very well respected body, recommended this model because it would help employers retain skilled staff and boost workplace participation. As I am sure anyone from COSBOA would know, one of the big costs associated with small businesses is retaining good staff or, more importantly, finding good staff. It can cost $10,000, $20,000 or $30,000 to find a good employee. So this initiative from the Gillard Labor government is about making sure that small businesses and big businesses can retain skilled staff. The shocking irony from those opposite is that, having spent months crowing about their plan to slug business with a new tax, they are now, all of a sudden, concerned about the impact our scheme will have on business. I put it to the member for Dunkley that given that during the election his side were putting forward a proposal for a 1.7 per cent levy to be put on everyone shopping at Woolies or Coles or putting petrol in their car-that great big tax on everything that was going to be passed straight on to consumers; that 1.7 per cent levy or tax-it is a bit hard to swallow to see the member for Dunkley now putting this proposal forward. The Labor government consulted appropriately with stakeholders, and we now have a system that imposes very little on businesses-certainly not the billions of dollars in extra tax that would have been passed on to all Australians and would have come straight out of their wallets. It is worth explaining to the member for Dunkley how the system works and perhaps putting to rest any fears he may have cultivated amongst Australian businesses. I think it was on Thursday last week that his colleagues forgot his name in question time, but I want to assure MAIN COMMITTEE the honourable member that I will not forget him. Employers will receive funds from the government before they are required to pass them on to their employees, and will make payments in line with the employee’s usual pay cycle. Employers can choose to receive payments from the government in as few as three instalments. Employers will provide government funded parental leave pay to their long-term employees only-so only those who have been with them for at least 12 months. Payments will be made on a ‘business as usual basis’, so there will be no special rules or special bank accounts or special red tape; it will just be business as usual. Employers simply have to provide parental leave pay in accordance with their usual pay cycle and provide a notice, such as a pay slip, to their employee-just as with other leave like annual and sick leave. Obviously, small businesses have a close connection with their employees and, with modern email distribution networks, it is not uncommon for people to receive an email notice with their pay details while they are at home. Employers are not required to pay the superannuation on parental leave pay, and the government has made sure that employers do not have any increased payroll tax liability or workers or accident compensation premium liabilities. To help ensure that employers can prepare and adjust, the government has phased in the new payment arrangements over six months, kicking off from 1 July 2011. This is the best time for most businesses, at the start of the new financial year. And, of course, any reasonable costs incurred by employers in administering the scheme will be tax deductible. So the parliament should judge this opposition bill for what it is: it is sour grapes dressed up as legislation. We all know that paid parental leave is long overdue. Almost all modern countries have a paid parental leave system in place. From my research, the United States and Swaziland, in southern Africa, are the only countries in the world without some sort of paid parental leave scheme. Even Sudan and Rwanda are progressive enough to have funded schemes in place. But this does not stop the opposition in their aim to wreck this historic reform. As I said, I think it is a case of sour grapes that they are not able to associate themselves with this great reform. Australian families have already waited far too long for this paid parental leave scheme. For 12 years, the opposition were dead against paid parental leave. I think the suggestion was that it was going to be introduced over the member for Warringah’s dead body. Unfortunately, that is another election promise that has gone by the wayside! But, despite their pie in the sky election commitment to the 1.7 per cent levy, it seems that little has changed-it is just one more delay, more denial and more destruction from the opposition. Ms LEY (Farrer) (11.19 am)-This debate is not about whether we should have paid parental leave or the merits of the government’s Paid Parental Leave scheme versus the opposition’s paid parental leave scheme; it simply seeks to revoke the unnecessary and burdensome administrative requirements of the Paid Parental Leave scheme due to come into effect on 1 January 2011. The Paid Parental Leave (Reduction of Compliance Burden for Employers) Amendment Bill 2010 is a proactive measure introduced by the coalition to reduce the burden on business. Under the government’s Paid Parental Leave scheme, the Family Assistance Office will undertake responsibility for parental leave payments for the first six months of the scheme. Thereafter, Labor has proposed that responsibility falls to the individual employer, who will be forwarded payments by the Commonwealth only to on-pay them to workers. What a clumsy administrative arrangement that is. The coalition, instead, proposes that the Family Assistance Office retains responsibility for the administration and payment of paid MAIN COMMITTEE parental leave indefinitely after the first six-month period. By having the government retain responsibility as paymaster, we can prevent an additional regulatory strain on businesses, which currently suffer enough red tape. In particular, this strain would be felt disproportionately by small business, which may not have the specific human resources or payroll personnel to administer the scheme. Labor risks threatening the livelihood of some businesses which just do not have the capacity for another layer of bureaucracy or the additional administrative costs that are likely to flow on from this. Employers who fail to meet the administrative requirements of the scheme are liable for hefty fines. In all likelihood small businesses that have difficulty in coming to terms with that additional administrative requirement are the ones that will suffer. Business lobby groups have been vocal in their criticism of passing the role of paymaster from the Family Assistance Office to an individual business. The Chamber of Commerce and Industry Queensland Vice-President, Ken Murphy, has stated: … what has not been taken into account is the impost of administration costs associated with the scheme. Any national paid parental leave scheme must be wholly administered by government. Yet by having responsibility for the administration of Paid Parental Leave remain with the Family Assistance Office, we can avoid an administrative nightmare for businesses. Surely the logic of this is evident to all, barring those opposite. Regrettably for Australian families and Australian businesses, this Paid Parental Leave scheme is neither as family friendly nor as business friendly as the scheme proposed by the coalition. Our scheme offered 26 weeks paid leave at the wage level previously received by the parent up to a salary maximum of $150,000 per annum or the national minimum wage, whichever was the greater. In addition, superannuation payments would be maintained. Labor’s scheme has neglected superannuation contributions, which will see many women worse off when it comes to their retirement. Shame on them. Ours was a scheme offering real time and real money. We also proposed a more user-friendly, comprehensive model that saw the paymaster role stay with the Family Assistance Office. We heard the concerns of business and took these into account. Labor, on the other hand, has ignored the calls of businesses and lobby groups. By supporting the Family Assistance Office to retain responsibility for the administration of PPL, we can at least go some way towards improving the scheme but removing unnecessary hurdles for business. Everyone who has signed up to the government’s Paid Parental Leave scheme has signed up on the basis of the current administrative arrangements-that is, with the Family Assistance Office. All we are saying is: just keep those arrangements going, just keep them on. It is disingenuous of those opposite to suggest that this debate is about us versus them in terms of the merits of the scheme or having a paid parental leave scheme at all. I ask members opposite to debate what is on the table. Not only do we need to ensure looking after the economic needs of working families but we also have to make sure businesses are not unduly pressured as result of any government policy. The Family Assistance Office is positioned best to administer the scheme. The government has failed to provide a coherent or valid reason for its decision to handball administration to individual businesses. The coalition will continue, as we always have, to go into bat for Australian businesses and Australian families. MAIN COMMITTEE Ms SMYTH (La Trobe) (11.24 am)-I rise to oppose the proposed bill, the Paid Parental Leave (Reduction of Compliance Burden for Employers) Amendment Bill 2010. It has taken workers, campaigners and parents more than 30 years to achieve a paid parental leave scheme in this country. It took the hard work of so many people, together with this federal government, to implement the scheme, which will operate from 1 January next year. This matter certainly was not a priority of the Howard government during its many years in office. After all of that effort by so many people, what we see from the opposition is a disingenuous attempt to undermine the scheme. The opposition is, yet again, playing politics with one of the most important social reforms that this country has seen. The Leader of the Opposition is very well documented as having said there would be paid parental leave ‘over my dead body’. Then he changed his mind in the lead-up to this year’s federal election. Now we see the opposition reverting to its true values, its true position. The shadow minister is now using his very best endeavours to interfere with the smooth implementation of the government’s scheme and to create confusion. I hope, and I am sure, that both parents and businesses will see this for the stunt that it is. The bill is merely an attempt to disrupt and confuse the introduction of the government’s Paid Parental Leave scheme on 1 January next year. The bill is creating significant uncertainty for Australian families, which have been waiting decades for paid parental leave. It is extraordinary that the opposition is seeking to laud its business credentials in relation to this matter because, not particularly long ago, one of the various iterations of its paid parental leave scheme policy was announced on International Women’s Day 2010. At that stage, various people remarked on the operation of the proposed scheme. In fact, we had Peter Anderson, from the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, saying at that stage that the proposal was unfair. We heard Katie Lahey, from the Business Council of Australia, saying that at that stage they were also firmly opposed to the scheme. And in a statement Heather Ridout, from the Australian Industry Group, described the scheme as ‘flawed, unrealistic and a deterrent to investment in Australia’. So it is somewhat curious that the opposition now seeks to remark so vehemently on its business concerns and credentials. The scheme that the Australian government is proposing is fully funded, and we know that legislation approving it has passed through parliament. But, unfortunately, about six weeks out from the beginning of the scheme, once again we see the opposition taking the tack of wreckers. It is a fairly consistent and uniform theme. They were wreckers of the stimulus package that protected jobs and saved our economy. They were wreckers of the badly needed healthcare reform in this country. When it came to plans for improving our schools and our education system they were wreckers. Australian families and businesses are counting on the Paid Parental Leave scheme starting on 1 January. As has been said, more than 2,000 applications for paid parental leave have already been received from parents expecting a baby in the new year. Anecdotally, from my campaigning in the recent federal election, I note that many parents were particularly pleased to know that from 1 January they would be entitled to access a paid parental leave scheme. They specifically raised that matter with me during the campaign. We know that at least 550 employers are already signed up to provide government funded paid parental leave. Around two-thirds of these employers are ready to start before 1 July. Under our Paid Parental Leave scheme, leave payments will be made by businesses for their MAIN COMMITTEE long-term employees. These arrangements will be phased in over the first six months of 2011. Because the government believe that paid parental leave is a workplace entitlement, we believe that that leave should be paid through employers, just as annual leave, sick leave and other leave are. We consider our scheme is fair to business, based on the expert recommendations of a major, independent inquiry undertaken by the Productivity Commission. The Productivity Commission recommended this model because it will assist employers to retain their skilled staff and boost workforce participation. Earlier, my colleague the member for Moreton mentioned the significant steps undertaken by the government to consult very widely with business and to implement a range of measures in the scheme to ensure that their role is made easy. Once again, this legislation is simply an example of the opposition moving to wreck policy that is currently being relied on by so many families around Australia which are expecting children in the new year. Ms MARINO (Forrest) (11.29 am)-I commend the member for Dunkley on the Paid Parental Leave (Reduction of Compliance Burden for Employers) Amendment Bill 2010. I think the title of this bill says it all: the ‘reduction of compliance burden for employers’ amendment. That is wholly and solely what this is about. It does not cause any delay. There are no uncertainties about paid parental leave. This is all about the reduction of the compliance burden for employers, particularly small businesses. I have over 14,000 of those in the south-west, Member for Dunkley, and they are the backbone of Australia, as you have rightly pointed out, and yet we are constantly seeing examples of how this government has no understanding of those same small businesses, how they operate and what small business people do in the course of their days. They do not sit around drinking coffee; they are the ones who have to work days and nights just to keep their businesses operating, often on very tight margins. They have really seriously committed to their small businesses. But this government is directly and deliberately imposing a further burden on small business-on owners and operators who work in their businesses as well as on their businesses, often every single day. They have often mortgaged their house and every single other asset to finance their small business venture. The small businesses tell me constantly that government regulation and red tape are major costs and burdens for small business, and yet we are going to see an increase here. I have very serious concerns about the additional workload and compliance costs this PPL scheme will have on small-to-medium businesses. This Paid Parental Leave scheme will add significantly to their cost and burden. It will be a serious administrative burden on small businesses to have to make time just to understand their obligations and responsibilities. That will cost them because they will not actually be working on or in their business. The costs and risks of compliance to their business if they have staff include training their staff, managing the system and changing the payroll and accounting systems, as the member for Dunkley has previously said. They include the processes of receiving, handling, processing and paying in a timely manner instalment amounts and the fines that would be imposed. If you were a small business and you knew you were going to be fined for this, you would be seriously concerned about your role in this. So this really comes on the back of small business at the moment facing significant costs in accessing finance and in interest rates, and now here we have a government that is adding further administrative burdens and costs, preventing the small business owners and operators from working in or on their business. MAIN COMMITTEE We should not underestimate the challenges to small-to-medium businesses in finding replacement workers for the parental leave period either-and it will be quite difficult. I see that Julia Gillard said: Labor will not support a system that imposes additional financial burdens or administrative complexity on small businesses or in any way acts as a discouragement to the employment of women … I have to say that that is what I am seriously concerned about with these additional compliance costs, burdens, risks and costs to small business. Some small businesses may be forced to make the decision to potentially not employ women. I think that is a real issue. There is a further quote from the Tasmanian Small Business Council: Paid parental leave is a fact of life in most of the western world and small business owners are happy to see it introduced in Australia. However, the move by the Government to make the business owners responsible for making the parental payments shows little or no real understanding of the culture of small businesses … That is something that we on this side, with our experience in small business, are very directly aware of and concerned about, which is why the member for Dunkley has introduced this bill. We want to reduce the administrative and compliance burden from small business owners and operators. Centrelink’s Family Assistance Office is and should be the paymaster for the government’s scheme. They could well also have to handle the practical issues and queries that will be ongoing in dealing with this. It should be done through that source. The taxpayers’ funding that the government is already expending to set this up should simply be used to the best effect. As I said earlier, I am seriously concerned that there may be some small businesses that will be forced to look at this and say, ‘I am seriously concerned about employing women.’ I very strongly support the member for Dunkley’s bill that the Family Assistance Office should administer this Paid Parental Leave scheme. Ms HALL (Shortland) (11.34 am)-It is with great pleasure that I rise to speak to the Paid Parental Leave (Reduction of Compliance Burden for Employers) Amendment Bill 2010. This is a bill where the opposition is just playing politics with a really vital piece of social reform. One of the best pieces of legislation to pass through this House was the bill for paid parental leave. The government’s legislation that was passed through the House establishing paid parental leave was the greatest reform that has taken place in this country for women in the time that I have been in parliament. It is going to benefit so many women. Women are already registering to obtain the benefit when they have their babies in January, and I believe over 500 businesses have already registered. What this bill before us today does is create uncertainty and show a blatant disregard for women. It is playing politics-blatant political game playing-and I am pretty disgusted with the member who has raised this here today. This is six weeks out from the commencement of the scheme, and the opposition are showing once again that they are wreckers. The member opposite has brought to this parliament a piece of legislation that is delaying an act that is already in place. The legislation is creating uncertainty-something that women having babies do not need-and is creating confusion in the community which will lead to women not registering for the Paid Parental Leave scheme passed by the government. I note that the date for the member for Dunkley’s legislation to take effect is 1 July, and I note that he is really creating this uncertainty in the community. MAIN COMMITTEE Businesses are looking to the benefits of the government’s Paid Parental Leave scheme, with 550 employers already signed up to provide government funded parental leave scheme pay. That will make it much more efficient. Around two-thirds of these employers are choosing to start playing their part before the ongoing payment arrangements for long-term employees start. I have been contacted in my office by a number of my constituents-women having babies-and they have told me just what the legislation that has been passed through the House means to them. I would like to bring to the attention of the House the fact that the opposition did not support the legislation. They were against it from the start. The Leader of the Opposition had a thought bubble that led to him introducing his amendment to the legislation; it was going to be a tax on everything, which every Australian had to pay for his proposal for a paid parental leave scheme-a scheme that was flawed right from the onset and one that he could not fully explain and on which he could not bring the community on board with him. It is important for women to maintain a connection to the workplace when they have a baby. The Paid Parental Leave scheme that is in place will allow this to happen. Women do not need uncertainty. They do not need an opposition that is playing politics to erode a scheme that is in place and that will benefit most women having children in Australia. It is about security and about keeping a skilled workforce in place, and I think that the member who has brought this to the House should have thought this through a little better before he introduced his legislation. expired. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. White Ribbon Day Debate resumed, on motion by Mr Hayes: That this House: (1) notes that 25 November marks White Ribbon Day, the symbol of the United Nations’ International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women; (2) recognises that White Ribbon Day aims to prevent violence against women by increasing public awareness and education by challenging the attitudes and behaviours that allow violence to continue; (3) asks all Australian men to challenge these attitudes and behaviours, so that we can begin to drive real change in our community; (4) asks all Australian men to join the ‘My Oath Campaign’ and take the oath: I swear never to commit, excuse or remain silent about violence against women; (5) notes with concern that one in three women will experience physical violence, and one in five will experience sexual violence over their lifetime; (6) understands that domestic and family violence are primary causes of homelessness; (7) acknowledges the cost of violence against women and their children to the Australian economy was estimated to be $13.6 billion in 2008 09, and if we take no action to shine a light on this violence, that cost will hit an estimated $15.6 billion by 2021 22; and MAIN COMMITTEE",233,Employers Amendment Bill 2010
277,The Deputy Speaker ( Mr S Sidebottom),"Order! The time allotted for this debate has(8) asks all Members to show that they are challenging violence against women by wearing a white ribbon or wristband on White Ribbon Day. tions International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women, which is held annually on 25 November. I have been involved with the White Ribbon campaign for a number of years as a White Ribbon ambassador because I find absolutely abhorrent the number of women who are subjected to violence in their lifetime. Nationally, the disturbing statistics are that one in three women will experience physical violence and one in five will experience sexual violence in their lifetime. What really brings this home to me is that of the women in my life-my mother, my wife, Bernadette; my daughter, Elizabeth; and my two granddaughters, Charlie and Kiarni-this statistic means that one is likely to experience violence in her lifetime. As a son, a husband, a father and a grandfather, I find that completely abhorrent and reprehensible. If everyone can personalise domestic violence in these terms and think about their families and their loved ones, people may have a better appreciation of the horrific and heart breaking situations and the consequences and impacts that domestic violence has in our community. Another disturbing statistic is from Amnesty International. It shows that in Australia domestic violence puts more women aged between 15 and 44 at risk of serious health issues and premature death than any other risk factor within our community. Clearly, we need to do something to change these worrying statistics; action must be taken. The White Ribbon campaign calls on all Australian men to challenge the attitudes and behaviours that allow violence to continue. It encourages men to act as role models and take the lead in order to raise awareness that violence against women is never, ever acceptable. Sadly, in my electorate, 723 people in the Liverpool LGA reported violence, with another 690 women from the Fairfield LGA experiencing violence in 2009. It is important to bear in mind that those local statistics are from people who had the courage to report their experience of violence to the police. It is a sad fact that many incidents of violence against women go unreported. As a society, we should be doing everything we can to encourage victims of violence to come forward and to say, ‘Enough is enough.’ It is important to remember that violence against women is not simply physical or sexual; it can be emotional or financial violence. By ‘financial violence’, I refer to a situation when a partner or a husband has such a level of control over finances that women are forbidden to spend money on their necessities and those of their families. All of these types of violence against women are unacceptable. I recently had the privilege of attending a session of the Aboriginal violence against women program in my electorate. The program is run by the Joan Harrison Support and Outreach Services for Women out of the Liverpool Women’s Resource Centre. My visit gave me a new and valuable insight into the work that is being done to break down the cycle of violence in my community. Through the partnership with TAFE New South Wales, the Liverpool Women’s Health Centre, WILMA Women’s Health Centre, Bonnyrigg Public School and the Aboriginal mental health workers, this program gets the message out there that violence within the family is never okay. Five groups of women have now completed the program, allowing about 70 Aboriginal women to become mentors and advocates against violence in their own communities. The members of the group are given a simple message: if someone is hurting you or abusing you, MAIN COMMITTEE",240,Private Members Business
278,Mr Hayes (Fowler) (11.40 Am),"I rise to speak about White Ribbon Day, the United Natell someone about it and get some help and support. Those words are filtering down through the wider community as women who have completed the program become mentors and pass on what can be a lifesaving message. My thanks go to Tracy Phillips, the manager of the Joan Harrison Support Services for Women, the Aboriginal project worker Mary Eatts, and Shirley Kent from the Liverpool Women’s Resource Centre, for opening my eyes to this amazing project. I was so impressed with the progress being made by the Aboriginal Women Against Violence Program that I suggested it be used as a pilot program for the White Ribbon Foundation of Australia. After all, the foundation and this program share a common philosophy: that mentoring and community leadership are key instruments in breaking down the cycle of violence. The Liverpool Women’s Resource Centre also supports the Aboriginal Women’s Support Group, which has started producing a newsletter called Sister to Sister. I would like to share with this place a poem that was included in the latest edition of Sister to Sister and was written by a woman named Timika. Timika’s poem is entitled Place to Start, and it says: Sometimes you feel like you are being pushed into a corner Being made to feel like a pawn in a game of chess Being told how to feel and when to feel it Everyone deals with things in their own time Who has the right to tell you different? When you have walked in these shoes, When you have felt the pain, Then this is the time you will be heard. When you sit back and help someone instead of hurting them, When you can listen instead of being heard, Everyone has a story Everyone can help if we all would work together Just talk and listen That would be a great place to start. As Timika so rightly points out, it is up to each and every one of us to talk about violence against women as something that is shameful and intolerable. We also need to listen to the victims of violence against women and take their advice on what we should be doing to redress this terrible situation. As research shows us, of the children who witness domestic violence in the home, 50 per cent of young women will grow up to take abusers as partners and, most chillingly, 60 per cent of the boys will grow up to become abusers themselves. This cycle has to end. We also need to ensure that White Ribbon Day is not just another day on the calendar but a day that people make a change in attitude, a change for the better. As I have said before in this place on many occasions, violence against women is the most widespread human rights abuse in the world. In Australia the cost of violence against women and children in the Australian economy was estimated to be $13.6 billion in 2009. If that is not addressed, by 2021 I understand that the cost is likely to rise to a staggering $15.6 billion. We must recognise that while living free from violence is everybody’s right, reducing violence is everybody’s responsibility. MAIN COMMITTEE In conclusion, on this White Ribbon DayI will humbly join many Australian men and take the White Ribbon Oath: I swear never to commit, excuse or remain silent about violence against women. It is a very simple thing that all of us men in this place can do and I would encourage people to take that pledge. We all have the responsibility of leadership in our communities and I think we should be taking leadership on this principal issue of human rights abuse. Disturbingly, violence against women and children is probably the most prolific issue within our justice system at the moment. I would also encourage the men of this place to show their commitment by wearing the white ribbon on White Ribbon Day and by being prepared to stand up when it comes to showing leadership in their communities. Whether we are fathers, brothers, uncles, community members or just workmates, we can all make a difference and we can make it very clear that we will not condone violence against women and children. recognise that White Ribbon Day is important. It is not just symbolic; there is a genuine reason for it. It is a recognition and acknowledgement of the fact that there are still major issues in many countries and societies, including our own, with respect to violence against women. As with all of these types of programs, the important thing is that we change society’s attitudes. We can talk a lot about stopping violence against women, but as men we need to stand up in the community and change our attitudes. A lot of words are spoken at times about these issues. But it is not about the words; it is about the actual actions that are taken. There are groups in my electorate like MADD and, whilst they are focused on parents with drug problems, a lot of the women that they take care of are victims of domestic violence, whether it be sexual, financial or physical. The problems that pervade our society with respect to domestic violence cause enormous damage. In my career in financial services I have seen the destructive effects of that first hand as clients have gone through divorce and separation for a variety of reasons. The financial and emotional consequences for the family are very destructive. It takes enormous amounts of time-and in some cases many years-for the family to recover from the effects of those situations. As I said earlier, it is about us as men changing our attitudes and our behaviours to drive real change. By and large, men are the primary perpetrators of violence towards women. There is some discussion about violence towards men as well, but this campaign is focused on violence towards women. We as men are responsible for looking after our households. We are the primary provider. It is our responsibility to take care of our wives and take care of our children. That is what sets the tone and solidifies the family unit in order to move forward. That solidity makes families the basic building blocks of our community. The opportunity for Australian men to be involved in the My Oath campaign is an opportunity for men to stand up and say, ‘I wish to be counted.’ It is an opportunity to say, ‘I’m not going to tolerate violence, I’m not going to undertake it myself and I’m also going to hold other men accountable for the way they treat their wives and children.’ The cost of domestic violence in our community is a stark reality. I have to be honest-I was not aware that the figures were this high. That is the very sobering reality of the financial consequences. More importantly, it is about not only the financial consequences but also the MAIN COMMITTEE",241,Private Members Business
279,Mr Van Manen (Forde) (11.49 Am),"I thank the member for Fowler for his motion toemotional and physical consequences for those ladies involved. It takes so long for people to recover, if ever. If they do go through divorce or separation as a result, it can affect their next relationship or, as the member for Fowler rightly mentioned, the future relationships of families’ children. I have seen many examples of that over the years. It becomes a generational issue, and we see that in the electorate of Forde, where there are generational problems of domestic and family violence. So it is not just that immediate husband-wife relationship that is affected-it can last several generations. That is where the problem grows and becomes wider. The fact that the violence is perpetrated not only physically but also financially or emotionally also causes a great many scars and reduces the importance of the wife in the relationship. The husband should value the wife’s contribution to the relationship because it is a partnership. It is not me as a husband lording it over my wife; it is a partnership where we work together to achieve more than we can as individual entities. And that is the value of a marriage relationship, whether it is a de facto or a married couple. Violence of any sort in that relationship breaks that down and reduces the effectiveness of that partnership. I do not think it is a coincidence that in parts of our society where these issues are much more relevant-and there are more obvious problems-the ability for those families to be successful and generate wealth or hold down jobs and contribute positively to society is reduced because those families have fractured and split as a result of these issues of domestic violence. I agree with the request of the member for Fowler that all members show that we are challenging violence against women, because it is an enormous cost to our society. We can say that we are a wealthy, successful society but it is not just about us being wealthy or successful financially or materially. Those family relationships are far more important because having a strong family unit is the foundation of our society. Domestic violence breaks that down and takes away from that. SoI commend and concur with the member’s motion and I certainly will support him on 25 November in supporting the United Nations International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women as I think that it is a very worthwhile campaign and we as a society should be looking to eliminate that. It will create a better, stronger society for this nation to grow and prosper. I thank the member and the House for the opportunity to speak on this matter. and I thank the member for Fowler for bringing it to the House. I also rise to note the upcoming White Ribbon Day, the meaning and significance of this particular day and the ongoing violence and abusiveness on which it is focused, and the role that each and every one of us can play in ridding society of this blight. White Ribbon Day is a time to refocus on both the unacceptable violence perpetrated against women and what we ourselves are doing to prevent this so we can move toward a non-violent, non-oppressive society. Over the course of 2008 and 2009, the Labor government commissioned response to violence against women was developed to combat and to eliminate violence towards women in Australia. That response is called Time for action. It set a framework of 117 actions of governments, collectively and individually, research and community service organisations towards the achievement of 25 strategies to realise six outcomes within a time frame of 12 years. The report has six outcomes that we all seek, and they are: MAIN COMMITTEE",243,Private Members Business
280,Mr Georganas (Hindmarsh) (11.59 Am),"I too rise to support the motion before usCommunities are safe and free from violence Relationships are respectful Services meet the needs of women and their children Responses are just Perpetrators stop their violence Systems work together effectively. It is a very sad indictment of our society and those of nations around the world that these statements are so hard to apply to our very own communities, our very own neighbourhoods, our own circle of friends and the social and community services that we have created to serve us. Of the 117 actions listed, 20 actions were prioritised within the response for immediate fulfilment. One such action was: Recognising that most men are not violent towards women, encourage them to take a role in countering such violence and promote understandings of, and support for, expressions of masculinities that are non-violent. White Ribbon Day ambassadors are men who assume a role in countering the violence and promoting non-violent expression. I am very honoured to be one of no doubt many members of this House and myriad White Ribbon Day ambassadors in our communities. I believe that there is no greater or more significant task that we have assumed over recent years than that of being White Ribbon Day ambassadors. The pain and suffering perpetrated on women and their children, the normalisation of abuse learned and passed on through such experiences from generation to generation and the debasing of people’s human experience are the manifestations which we pledge, as White Ribbon Day ambassadors, to strive to bring to an end. We are reminded on White Ribbon Day that each and every one of us is in a position to do our bit to stop and to prevent that which we find so unacceptable and unconscionable. We should all be doing all that we can among our families, when we are raising our children, and guiding those close to us, our colleagues and those on whom they rely, within our social circles, our clubs and our congregations at all times and in all circumstances. We have the opportunity to set an example and to instil in our fellows what is right, good and just. There is, of course, a tremendous role for professional service providers in both halting the perpetration of violence in the immediate discharge of their duties and preventing its recurrence within a context from which a person has been brave enough to emerge seeking help. I welcome the funding of the Women’s Services Network to build the capacity of service providers to support those victims of domestic and family violence within an early intervention and prevention model. I encourage all governments, federal, state and local, to give appropriate resources to emergency housing for use by women and their children who leave an abusive and violent environment. People desperately need our help. They ask for our help. They plead for our help every day in our electorate offices. We need to acknowledge what that means in terms of service provision, face up to our responsibility to help people as and when they need and request it and fund the services, including emergency accommodation, so that they can make a difference. Good intentions are cheap but without effort and resources too often betray indifference. This is not the mark of a civilised society. MAIN COMMITTEE privilege to talk on this issue because it affects so many families across Australia. Having worked in the fields of both education and health, I have seen the direct result of violence inflicted on women and families. A close colleague of mine, Judy Atkinson, who lectures at the Southern Cross University in the top end of New South Wales, once spoke to me about the intergenerational impact of family violence and violence perpetrated against women. This intergenerational trauma is passed through generations of the family, and the practices and learned behaviours are there for some time. I strongly endorse and support the My Oath campaign and I believe that all Australian men and other men living in Australia should commit to this campaign because this violence has social consequences that are far reaching, and the dislocation of women and children in times of hardship and in times of stress is something that we do not want to see experienced on the scale that we do at times. I also swear to commit to never excuse or remain silent about violence against women. I would like to salute the Canadian men who, after the massacre of 14 women in Canada by a gunman, made a commitment to acknowledge that there was a need to address violence against women. I had the privilege of working in New South Wales as Director of Aboriginal Health, and I had a strong association with the Education Centre Against Violence, whose principal task is to work with communities-all communities, because family violence is not an issue particular to any section of society but tends to be right across the socioeconomic spectrum-to develop women’s awareness of the avenues, services and resources that are available to them when seeking refuge from violence or seeking a strategy in which an intervention can occur which allows them to change from being a recipient of violence to being much more proactive about removing themselves and their children from a violent situation. I am pleased that the United Nations has established an International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women, which aims to prevent violence against women by increasing public awareness and education, and by challenging the attitudes and behaviours that allow violence to continue. Certainly, the fundamental role of the ECAV program in New South Wales was to develop the awareness of communities and men that it is not appropriate for a male to exercise any level of violence against a woman or against children within the family. There is a need, as I said, for all men to drive the change in our society, because, if we go to the whole crux of the way in which we bully or are violent towards another human being, it leads in our minds our ability to control the circumstances that we sometimes find ourselves in. I will certainly work tirelessly in Hasluck to create wide-scale awareness of the positive role that men can play in bringing an end to violence against women and in influencing other men who are violent to look at behaviours to deal with that rage, to protect the women who are part of their lives and to protect their family. It should also enable leadership, particularly by men and boys, to bring about social change and build collective knowledge and understanding of the effective prevention of violence against women. I concur with the comments by the previous speaker, the member for Hindmarsh, about the need to ensure that services in this area are real, provided at appropriate times and readily accessible. I am also proud to say that I am now a member of the male parliamentarians for the elimination of violence against women subcommittee. We will ensure that awareness of the impact MAIN COMMITTEE",244,Private Members Business

It is aof violence and the inappropriateness of violence against women and children becomes a focal point of our work and that we continue to influence the way in which men behave in family or in partnership relationships. When you consider the range of violence that is part of that whole make-up, we certainly have a challenge. I commend the member for Fowler for putting this motion forward. has expired. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. National Curriculum Debate resumed, on motion by Mr Pyne: That this House: (1) expresses its concern that the Government’s deadline to have the national curriculum available for implementation from January 2011 will result in a substandard curriculum; and (2) requires the Government to delay the implementation of the national curriculum until January 2012 for K 10 in the areas of English, maths, science and history. January 2012 is an attempt by the opposition to help the new minister for schools. We know that the Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth feels cornered by the promise that the government made to implement the national curriculum in January 2011. We know that the minister for schools feels particularly cornered because the current Prime Minister was the person who began the process for the implementation of the national curriculum in a serious way over the last three years. We know that with the record for failure of the minister for schools in respect of solar panels, the Green Loans scheme and, of course, the diabolical Home Installation Program he does not want to fumble the ball yet again on a government program like the national curriculum. We know that all these thoughts are coursing through the mind of the minister for schools. So the opposition has decided to reach out and provide the minister for schools with a life rope. Mr Melham interjectingtuitive to some people that the opposition-particularly me, some people would be unkind enough to say-would try to help the minister. In the opposition we believe that it is better for the curriculum to be right than for it to be forced into schools unready. We believe that it is better to get the national curriculum right than to get it in, and we would rather give the government an opportunity to get off this hook and delay the national curriculum until January 2012. That extra year will prove crucial in ensuring stakeholder support for the national curriculum, state government support for the national curriculum and a much better outcome for the students from reception to year 12 through the introduction of our national curriculum, which the opposition supports in principle and, of course, which we initiated when in government. The current minister for schools has picked up where the previous minister left off, but unfortunately she left him with a bugger’s muddle when it comes to the national curriculum. This is an opportunity to get him out of that muddle. You do not have to take my word for it. MAIN COMMITTEE",246,Private Members Business

284,Mr Pyne,"I am trying to help, as the member for Banks points out. It seems counterinThere are many stakeholders expressing very genuine concern about the implementation of the national curriculum. A letter to the minister in New South Wales on 22 October 2010, signed by groups such as the Australian Association for Research in Education, the Australian College of Educators, the Australian Council for Educational Leaders, the Australian Curriculum Studies Association, the Australian Education Union, the Association of Heads of Independent Schools of Australia, the Australian Primary Principals Association, the Australian Professional Teachers Association, the Australian Secondary Principals Association, the Independent Education Union of Australia, the National Education Forum, the Catholic Secondary Principals Australia and the Principals Australia Association-13 of them-said: We believe that the timeline for the project must be extended to ensure that the Australian curriculum is as good as it can be. The timelines for all stages of the project at present are unreasonably short, and in the end this will be self-defeating. The consultation timelines do not allow enough time to provide considered, detailed feedback, and do not allow the voices of teachers and other stakeholders to be heard. The speed of the development process is contrary to what is known about the conditions for effective professional development practices and educational change. It was noted that schools require time for both evaluation of the curriculum documents after they are provided and planning for their effective implementation. This will also require an extension of the timeline. That is point 2 of the document provided to the minister by 13 peak education organisations in October, all of them calling for the time line to be extended. This is not a group of people who you would normally find in the same room agreeing on educational policy. You would not normally get the Association of Heads of Independent Schools of Australia and Catholic Secondary Principals Australia as well as the Australian Education Union and the Independent Education Union of Australia getting together in the same room and signing up to exactly the same document without any qualification. Nobody came out after this letter was published-not Angelo Gavrielatos, Leonie Trimper or anyone else-and said, ‘We’d like to qualify our signature on that letter.’ They signed that letter because they were genuinely concerned. We have comment from the President of the Mathematical Association of New South Wales, Mary Coupland, who said: A lot of work needs to be done to make it anywhere near as good as what we have in NSW. I get a sense it is all being rushed. Mark Howie, the President of the English Teachers Association of New South Wales, said: A number of things create the sense that it is a backward step. It has an incoherent sense of learning. Margaret Watts, the President of the Science Teachers Association of New South Wales, said: We are very concerned and it may well be a step backwards. So we have maths teachers, English teachers, science teachers and all of the peak education associations and unions in Australia begging the government to extend the time line for the implementation of a national curriculum. All of this has been admitted by ACARA, the Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority. They have accepted that there is consistent feedback highlighting overcrowding and that the draft curriculum was also found to be too difficult, inflexible and inadequate. The authority conceded that the suggested method of teaching grammar, vocabulary and spelling is out of sequence and needs revision to provide clearer and logical progression. They are still arguing over whether calculators should be used in grade 3 or in kindergarten. They are still arguing about the possibility of introducing consistent handwriting MAIN COMMITTEE across Australia. They have identified a lack of continuity between the primary and secondary years, and language and terminology were found to be inconsistent. This is all in 26,000 submissions to the ACARA draft curriculum process, and ACARA have admitted that all of these issues need to be addressed in a very short time frame. We know that the state governments are falling off the national curriculum faster than dags off a sheep, if I can put it that way. There is only one state-South Australia-that is in support of the introduction of a national curriculum in January 2011. tralia-and that is saying something, because the member for Banks is from New South Wales. Even he must admit that the New South Wales Labor government is close to being the worse government in Australia, but the South Australian government is giving it a good run for its money. But I do not wish to be distracted. Only one state has signed on to the national curriculum in January 2011. New South Wales has indicated, in September, that there will be no expectation of any classroom implementation for 2011. The Northern Territory has said that 2011 will be identified as a pilot phase, and senior secondary courses will not be implemented in the Northern Territory before 2014. Queensland has said that schools will implement the Australian curriculum in English, mathematics and science in 2012 and in history in 2013. Tasmania has given no indication of a time to start the national curriculum. Victoria has indicated that it is expected that the new Australian curriculum for English, mathematics, science and history will be introduced in all Victorian schools in 2012 and, in years 11 and 12, in 2013 and 2014. In Western Australia they have recently announced that 2011 will be regarded as a time to familiarise themselves, but substantial implementation will not occur until 2013. So the stakeholders are against it. The state governments are not supporting it. There is no money set aside by this government for implementation of the national curriculum in terms of teacher training or teacher support. At least the coalition, recognising the failure of the government, announced that if we won the election we would put $20 million into the implementation of the national curriculum to train teachers. Of course, we won the election but lost the negotiation. As a consequence, that $20 million will not be provided. I could talk at great length about the coalition’s concerns about things like the cross-curriculum perspectives, but suffice to say we are reaching out to the government to give them an opportunity to get themselves off the hook, and I hope they will grasp it. worked out pretty quickly that the only bit of any importance was the last bit where the member for Sturt said that the opposition had won government. That is really what this motion is all about-apparently they have won government. We will see how that works when we are in the chamber and in terms of the law and the Constitution. Apparently Mr Pyne is a member of the government, so we find ourselves in an interesting set of circumstances. This motion is really just about trying to delay the role of the government and our implementation of some very important policy that we had in place before the 2007 election. There has been an ample amount of time for a whole range of stakeholders, including the opposition, to play a constructive role in this, which they have not done.

287,Mr Ripoll (Oxley) (12.19 Pm),"If anyone heard that contribution they would haveThere are range of things which I think are very important in getting a national curriculum up and fully operational in Australia, and none is less important than the future of all of our children-the future of students in this country. At some point in time, when discussion, debate and consultation come to a natural end, if you like, there is a natural place where the situation goes from thinking about it, looking at it, consulting, doing surveys, going through all the motions and going through every part that needs to be done to actually getting on with the job and implementing something. That is exactly where we are at as a government and, I believe, as a country. That is the important part we are at now. This is not a new concept, nor is it a new idea. Not is it something that has taken people by surprise, whether they be teachers, students, parents or anyone else. I can recall many, many years ago, if not decades ago, people discussing the merits of having a national curriculum and how good it would be-in fact, how great it would be-if we ever got to that place in this country. We will get to that place and we will do it under a Labor government. I note, because I think it is important, that this motion is about delay. Part (2) of the motion says: … requires the Government to delay the implementation of the national curriculum … I do not think we can delay any further. I do not think we can afford to delay; we have already had a delay. Those years of delay were the 12 years that the opposition were actually in government-they delayed it for 12 years. It took us getting elected in 2007 to get on with the job, to go beyond the delays and just thinking about it or considering it as a wonderful ideaand I know everyone believes that-to actually implementing this very much needed policy. There are some great things about our Federation and there are some things that do not quite work very well, and one of those is the area of education. When you have six states and a couple of territories, there is bound to be a state with the best system and others that are not quite at the same level. What is important here is that we find a base level where we can bring up every child in this country and where every student can have the same opportunities. There needs to be an equalisation between the states and territories in terms of where education is going and the standards that are implemented. In my home state of Queensland we have been working on this for a number of years now with the Queensland state government. We have now introduced what is called the prep year, the pre year 1 year, which will make an enormous difference over a period of time to bring young Queensland kids in line with other states in their educational experience and the opportunities they get. There are a whole range of very, very good reasons why this needs not to be delayed but to continue on. There is our international and global competitiveness. I believe competition between the states needs to end. Competition ought to be between students, not between states, and it ought to be at an international level. The time line for this has not been rushed. Development began in 2008 with the preparation of papers outlining the broad shape, and they were finalised and published in March 2009. Draft curricula were first published from March to May 2010 and 150 schools were involved in a trial. At the end of the consultation period 3,650 individual online surveys were carried out and 209 written submissions were received from 186 peak organisations. The reality is that government and government agencies have been taking note of all of those. Twelve hundred people participate in national and state forums. Extensive consultation has continued; it has not just ended but has actually continued. There has been independent MAIN COMMITTEE mapping of the four curricula against state and international assessments. The result of the mapping against international assessments is very encouraging. It shows that we should expect the same level of performance from our students as do high-performing countries such as Hong Kong, Singapore, Canada and Finland. The program that we bring forward may be difficult. It may be tough. It may involve people actually getting on with the job, looking outside the square and starting to tackle some of the harder issues-but I do not believe that delay is one of them; I do not believe that that is the one we ought to pursue. If we listened to the opposition, they would have us delay for a further 12 months. But, in reality, we know that the game of politicsMr Van Manen-You want to get it right then. question. I was talking about delay for delay’s sake-12 years to get it right. In fact, it has been a few years since those 12 years. There has to come a point where there is a little bit of courage, a little bit of forethought and some hard work going into making it happendelivering. If we were to listen to the opposition, who just happen to think that it was actually the government-which probably says a lot about their agendatunity. But unfortunately-or fortunately-you will actually have to apply the rules of the Constitution and the will of the people, not the will of Mr Pyne. The important thing to note about what is happening in making sure that this implementation goes through and goes through properly is that it is a matter for the states and territories. We as a federal and Commonwealth government are working with the states and territories. This was a commitment for government schools that was given under the National Education Agreement and a requirement for non-government schools under the Schools Assistance Act 2008. It also includes provision for professional learning for teachers, which has always been a jurisdictional responsibility. ACARA, the Australian Curriculum, Assessment Reporting Authority, also has an agreed facilitation role in the implementation of the Australian curriculum. This involves working with the states and territories and helping them with the planning and implementation. That is taking place. That is the reality: this is actually taking place. While the Australian government does have a direct role in implementation, it has invested significantly in a number of initiatives that will also support that implementation. The timing has been set. It is flexible. Education ministers have agreed that implementation of the K-10 Australian curriculum in English, mathematics, science and history will begin from 2011, with flexibility in commencement but with substantial implementation to be achieved by the end of 2013. I do not think we ought to delay it any further; 2013 is still some time away. I do not think it is right for young people in this country to have their good education delayed any further-to delay bringing this standard up and making sure that we have, for the very first time in this country, a national curriculum. This agreement is subject to a three-year implementation window from when the Australian curriculum becomes available. The three-year window allows time for jurisdictions to determine the extent of the curriculum change, work with stakeholders, develop implementation plans and inform students and parents about those changes.

I do not think he was talking as much about a delayhe was more concerned about thinking that he was in government-as about putting this off for some other time. These decisions can no longer be delayed. An extensive process has been put into place. There is agreement between the state and territory ministers and the Commonwealth government ministers. The real work at hand now is in having the courage to get this done and get it done properly. The Australian government will be resourcing it properly. We will be doing that through ACARA, through Education Services Australia and through the Australian Institute for Teaching and School Leadership. We are doing it in a total partnership with all those agencies. Again, this puts the lie to what we heard from the previous speaker-that there is no support, that this is just a rushed implementation and that the resources are not there. The resources are there. They are there in black and white, and they are being done through the peak bodies in this country. We will work collaboratively with ACARA, ESA and AITSL, who will play vital roles in supporting the implementation of the Australian curriculum.

It will happen under Labor. member for Sturt. We are calling on the government to delay the implementation of the national curriculum for the simple reason that it is not ready. And don’t just believe me or Mr Pyne in this assessment but listen to the views of education stakeholders. For example, the Victorian Association of State Secondary Principals has described the curriculum as ‘not up to scratch, drowning in content, overlapping subjects such as science and geography and contains no agreement as to how it would be assessed’. The Australian Council of Deans of Science wrote to the Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth asking him to delay the implementation of the science curriculum for six to 12 months. The President of the Science Teachers Association, Anna Davis, said there needs to be another round of consultation to include classroom teachers to comment on the latest version of the science curriculum. The Mathematical Association of New South Wales claimed the four maths courses proposed for years 11 and 12 are too difficult for students with learning difficulties and are insufficiently challenging for gifted maths students. The History Teachers Association has also written to the minister expressing concern about the pace of progress. The New South Wales Board of Studies and teaching associations for science, maths, English and history have all criticised the curriculum and the process. On geography particularly it has expressed concern that the curriculum contains an inadequate focus on physical geography. And finally, just last week, the New South Wales education chiefs from the government, independent and Catholic sectors wrote to principals arguing that ‘some dimensions of the Australian curriculum currently being developed by ACARA are not being considered for implementation by New South Wales at this stage’. They are simply not going to do it, against the express wishes of Minister Garrett. I could go on with examples of real concerns from other credible stakeholders pleading with the government to delay. But one of the concerns that many have in relation to the draft curriculum is that it lacks a clearly stated direction or curriculum theory and has no overarchMAIN COMMITTEE",251,Private Members Business
291,Mr Tudge (Aston) (12.29 Pm),"I rise to second the motion moved by the honourableing framework. It also appears to be unbalanced and ideologically biased in its approach to some issues. For example, it is promoting the teaching of the climate change film An Inconvenient Truth despite the UK High Court finding that the science in the film contained nine fundamental errors and had been used to make a political statement and to support a political program. The curriculum also has a heavy focus on Indigenous and Asian culture without giving similar weight to our British and our Judaeo-Christian traditions. Trade union history and the history of the ALP are also given special prominence in the draft national history curriculum. On the other hand, there isn’t a single mention of the most politically successful party in Australian history, the Liberal Party of Australia. Even if the curriculum was up to scratch, there would be insufficient time to train teachers in the new curriculum to be ready for next year. Ms Leonie Trimper, President of the Australian Primary Principals Association, believed that August of this year was too late to finalise the draft curriculum and get the teachers up to speed. It is now November and the draft curriculum is not to be finalised until next month. There are positive aspects of the draft curriculum and we should not lose these aspects. For example, grammar is finally being put back in its proper place, phonics is being introduced into the early stages of literacy learning, and students will learn more about Asian history and culture, which is a good thing. All of these are good developments. However, overall the national curriculum is far from where it needs to be. Something as important as a national curriculum needs to be of the very highest standard, and it is not that presently. I implore the minister to give the national curriculum another year, to give ACARA the time necessary to get it right. We are better off delaying than producing something inferior. madness, thought he was in government and that his party did not lose the election. The member for Aston, in a speech of ideological fixation and philosophical obsession, kept on attacking the Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority and the process. These guys, in the 12th, 13th or 14th year of their reign under Mr Howard, were yearning for some Menzies-like longevity of coalition duration. The bastions of privilege on the other side of the chamber think they have every right to be always on the governing side of the chamber, but they really did nothing. Let me say to the member for Aston that in my electorate-which includes the municipality of Ipswich, the fastest growing area in all of Queensland-we have a RAAF base at Amberley with thousands of people working there. We also have thousands of kids who travel across states-80,000 every year-to come to Queensland and other fast-growing states such as Western Australia. And guess what? They do not get taught the same things in Torres Strait as in Tasmania or the same things in Palm Beach as in Perth, because those people opposite did not have the wit, wisdom, determination or commitment to implement a national curriculum. The coalition are now grizzling, griping, groaning and moaning about it. That is the reality. This government is getting on with making major improvements not just in the national curriculum but also in teacher quality, partnerships and great rewards for great teachers. We are improving things by increasing funding. The member for Sturt went on and on about the BER. Let us get the money back.

Barry McGaw, the chair of ACARA, on 29 October 2010 said this about 2011-although those opposite do not want this rolled out next year: So 2011 will, in the main, be a year of preparation and familiarisation, with some jurisdictions commencing a phased approach to implementation. In some states or territories, preparation may include working in classrooms with the new curriculum to test it more fully. This will help with the validation of the achievement standards specified in the curriculum and with the collection of additional samples of students’ work to illustrate different levels of achievement. Implementation of the national curriculum is vital. We are working in partnership with the states and territories. There is a commitment to it for government schools and private schools. It is important to make sure that every child gets the same advantage in life: good quality teaching and a good curriculum to make sure they are not disadvantaged when they move from Coolangatta to Tweed Heads and that, if they decide to jump across the border between Albury and Wodonga, they get the same advantage in life. But those opposite want to continue their opposition to making sure that young people throughout this country get access to good quality education. They do-that is the reality. They did not support the BER or digital education; in fact, they want to rip computers out of schools. That is their attitude; that is the policy they took to the last election. Here we are now and they are still complaining, still opposing and still wanting us to delay. ‘Procrastination, inertia, inaction’-that is the Liberal Party’s motto. When it comes to the national curriculum it is the same all over again. They simply want to sit on their hands-the do-nothing opposition, the negative opposition. To oppose this and to suggest we delay is nothing short of disgraceful. They should hang their heads in shame because they are the party of negativity. Let me say from the outset that I support the concept of a national curriculum, and many would say that in this country it is long overdue. The problem is that, while the national curriculum is a good idea, every indicator we have at the moment is telling us that this national curriculum is underdone and runs a high risk of being damaged in the long term because of its ill-preparedness. The president of the Victorian Association of State Secondary Principals, Brian Burgess, says: We haven’t had a national curriculum in this country for 120 years; another six months to get it right is not going to disadvantage anyone. There was a motion passed in this place last week exhorting members to go out and consult their electorates, something any half-reasonable member should be doing as a matter of course and certainly something I do as an integral part of my job. On the matter of the national curriculum, I have been consulting my electorate and I can tell you that the teachers at the coalface are feeling like a box of mushrooms: in the dark and isolated. They are being told they will deliver this curriculum next year but have little idea of what it will encompass and how they are supposed to deliver the syllabus and are far from convinced that it is an advancement in education. If the government does not have the teachers and the schools on MAIN COMMITTEE",253,Private Members Business

Minister Garrett is saying the curriculum will be ready in December and expects schools to start delivering the syllabus in six to eight weeks. Surely even he can see that this is an impossible deadline. School leaders are telling me that, while they are supportive of the concept, they have simply had a lack of information and no support for training and implementation. One leader of a subject area in a large secondary school told me they had no chance of doing anything at all in this area next year. As a member of the school’s curriculum committee, he said the school was focused on the implementation of the new South Australian Certificate of Education-which has had its own difficulties which I am sure you are aware of, Mr Deputy Speaker Georganas, including the widespread criticism of dumbing down of requirements. He said: We haven’t even considered it yet. We’ve had no support, no money for teacher training and no chance of starting next year. Those who have had more than a cursory glance at the curriculum are not happy with the overly prescriptive levels of content and doubt they will be able to deliver anything more than rote learning. One principal in my electorate told me: I am really concerned we will be focused more on content than process. This comment is supported by Brian Burgess, who said: In this day and age we need to be encouraging people to learn how to learn; just drowning them in content is an absolute waste of time. Content in the world is growing exponentially, and schools have been trying to teach children how to learn rather than commit to memory a string of facts. While we need a national focus, we should not want a national curriculum to be so prescriptive as to discourage the development of learning skills. One principal told me that from what she had seen of the curriculum in her area: … we will have to do a fair bit to sex this up, it’s dead boring and we’ll lose the kids before we start. Criticism is widespread. John Rice, executive director of the Australian Council of Deans of Science, told the Melbourne Age that there was ‘a failure to articulate major scientific ideas about how the natural world worked, biodiversity, planetary history and processes and the atomic structure of matter’. Both the New South Wales Teachers Federation and the Victorian Association of State Secondary Principals have raised serious concerns about content and quality. Art Education Australia President Marian Strong has said: I just think it’s unteachable. This would be really dumbing down each art form rather than providing any depth of learning. This motion is not about destroying a national curriculum. A national curriculum has our support and should be pursued. The motion is about getting the format right and, most importantly, about taking with us the most important link in the system, the teachers. To treat them as bystanders in this process will lead to failure. Minister Garrett, of all ministers in this government, should understand the risks of trying to rush a program before the ground has been prepared and before the training process and information systems are in place. It seems that once again we are at risk of being consumed with a time line to enable the government to say, ‘We’ve delivered on something-anything.’ But if the consequence is widespread failure then nothing will be achieved. This motion asks MAIN COMMITTEE the minister to pause the process and get the foundations in place so that a national curriculum is a net benefit to the nation and not another point of ridicule and failure. the member for Sturt. I was interested to hear the comments by the member for Grey about a national curriculum being long overdue. I notice that he is a South Australian as well. I think that Mr Deputy Speaker Georganas also is South Australian, and another South Australian has just entered the chamber. I think all of the previous speakers on this side were from Queensland except for one speaker from Victoria. Not being from New South Wales or Victoria may flavour their views on a national curriculum-with all respect to Victoria of course. I do not know whether South Australia has a different perspective or a different approach to curriculum because convicts did not go there or something like that, but it is interesting to see. I did mention that there was one Victorian-the member for Aston. But, irrespective of the perspective that we bring to the national curriculum, the motion by the member for Sturt, despite his South Australian connections, is straight out of the Liberal Party playbook written by Tony Abbott, member for Warringah-deny, delay, destroy. In this case it is delay until January 2012. If we look at the position of those members opposite on climate change, a great policy under the Howard government that they would embrace climate change and put a price on carbon became, as soon as the member for Warringah was the leader, ‘Deny, delay, destroy.’ It has been the same with health reform and the NBN. It is just the way that those opposite seem to roll at the moment. I think the member for Sturt is a bit like the kid at school who is trying to organise the fight. He is not actually going to be in the fight but he is out there whispering: ‘Oh, the states aren’t ready yet. The states aren’t supporting this. There’s a fight on; there’s a fight on.’ But there is nothing constructive about something that the member for Grey indicated most sane people connected with education would accept as long overdue. What is the national curriculum about in the federation of Australia? It is about ensuring that all Australian children get the best possible education regardless of the sign hanging over the front gate. We have had our experiences in the past where we have perhaps been a bit divisive about education. You might remember the 2004 election, Mr Deputy Speaker, where perhaps our policy was not necessarily the best policy in terms of trying to divide between the private and state areas and the haves and the have-nots. Now we understand that education is much more important and that it is not a political football. We have to do the right thing by the 1,986,715 primary school children and the 1,474,611 secondary school children. Why? Because we do not want to play politics with the education of our kids, particularly with the 80,000 who move between states every year. That is about 2½ per cent of the school population, and a great majority of them would be children of defence personnel. Maybe the fact that we are all connected with the RAAF base at Amberley is why I, the member for Oxley and the member for Blair are particularly passionate about this policy-that we need to get it right. I was a schoolteacher for 11 years, and I know there is nothing worse than kids rocking up and you having to start over with them because they have come from New South Wales or Tasmania and they are not familiar with the syllabus you are using. It would be great if we could get this right for the sake of the defence children and all the children who have to move. MAIN COMMITTEE",254,Private Members Business

Look at what we are doing: look at NAPLAN, at the My School website and at increasing school transparency and accountability. The national curriculum is just another brick in that great process. The building block of a fine economy is to make sure that our children are educated. The national curriculum now has to be fully implemented over the next three years beginning with English, maths, science and history.

So even though I only had 11 years of teaching it is amazing how much teaching had changed in those 11 years. started I think it was called ‘the sage on the stage’, but now with the internet it is ‘the guide on the side’.

CanI just say at the beginning what a fantastic job the member for Cook has done and is doing in highlighting Labor’s failed approach to Australia’s border security. This motion very much concentrates on a direct consequence of Labor’s mismanagement of Australia’s borders-that is, the decision, the ambush announcement, by the Prime Minister on 18 October this year, a mere month ago, to establish a detention facility at Inverbrackie, in the Adelaide Hills. I will just indulge the House briefly to step through the potted history of this decision and this announcement by the Prime Minister and her minister, the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, on 18 October. On 17 October, the Prime Minister visited the Adelaide Hills, unbeknownst to the state Labor Premier-and anyone else, in fact-to have a photo opportunity for the beginning of the parliamentary sitting week. That was pretty unremarkable; prime ministers do that from time to time. They usually tell their Premier friends, particularly when they are of the same political colour, but on this occasion that did not happen. I think that has more to do with the next bit of the story than anything else. On 17 October, that lovely Sunday in the Adelaide Hills, instead of consulting with the Adelaide Hills community or telling the Adelaide Hills community what was coming, the Prime Minister was silent. She did not say a word. She did not mention a thing. And then she came to this place the next day, some 1,300 or 1,400 kilometres away from the Adelaide Hills, and with her minister, just before question time, an hour after ringing the Premier of South Australia-in fact, she did not even ring the Premier of South Australia; she left that to her minister, thus the respect she has for Premier Mike Rann-with half an hour’s notice to the local mayor, she announced that the Inverbrackie defence housing would be turned into a detention facility for what they describe as a cohort of low-security asylum seekers. That sent a massive shock wave through my community, so much so that an action group was formed. Members of the action group are here in parliament today. Five members of the action group have come at their own expense to parliament today to make the point that they MAIN COMMITTEE",257,Private Members Business
300,Mr Briggs (Mayo) (12.50 Pm),"It is with great pleasure that I stand today to speak inshould be listened to. And that is exactly what this motion seeks to do: force this government to do what it should have done in the first place, and that is listen to the people of Woodside and the Adelaide Hills. Since that time, we have had all these mealy-mouthed suggestions that there are consultations going on. There has been an advisory group established that meets once a week, with a couple of locals on it. There has been a visit by the minister, which was comic in its outcome, where he visited the Adelaide Hills to consult. He went to Inverbrackie in the dark of night to do a tour but actually failed to get to Woodside. He could not quite get the extra three kilometres down the road, Mr Deputy Speaker. I know that you know just how close that is and how ridiculous it was of the minister to fail to get to Woodside on that day. Instead, he had a meeting with a hand-picked group of five or six locals and the local council to tell them what the government had already decided. I think that speaks volumes of the way that this government has handled this process. It has been a disgrace. Since that time, of course, we have had the Prime Minister visit Adelaide to go to the new Adelaide Oval grandstand. She was able to get there, but she was not able to get 40 minutes up the hill to visit the people of Woodside. It is a great honour to have five of those people in the gallery today, trying to get this government to listen, trying to get this government to support this-I think-very worthwhile motion, which would see the Joint Standing Committee on Migration have a look at the issues in relation to the decision by this government. I know the next speaker on the list for this debate, the member for Hindmarsh, is a great advocate of community consultation. I remember many occasions on which he, when it came to the issue of noise around Adelaide Airport, was on Adelaide radio saying endlessly that the community should be consulted. I am sure that in his remarks the member for Hindmarsh will acknowledge the fact that communities should be consulted when decisions like this are made. But, unfortunately, in this case the government has not seen it right to consult with the community, which is going to be affected so greatly by this decision. The response we have had from the Labor ministers and the Labor government has been remarkable. You had the Minister for Trade, the clown, jester of the parliament, on TV with the member for Cook debating this issue and accusing the locals of being hysterical. So it seems that before the election, when the Prime Minister was trying to cultivate those who are worried about this issue because she has completely lost control of Australia’s borders, it was okay to express concerns about this issue. But after the election, according to the Minister for Trade, these people are ‘hysterical’. It is just not good enough. Now, today, we have had the great snub by the Prime Minister. Five locals have given up their time and money to fly to Canberra because the Prime Minister would not go to them. They have come to see the Prime Minister and there was an indication on Friday that she would see the locals from Woodside. Then, this morning, we had a phone call to say that she will not see them-after it was reported in the Advertiser and after the suggestion was made in the Advertiser that she would see them to calm their nerves. She has now deliberately snubbed them. It is just not good enough and the parliament should not stand for it. In this new parliament, with its new paradigm of openness and of letting the sun shine in over the parliament, it should shine in this Thursday morning when this motion is put to a vote. We should support this motion because it is a good one. It is a motion that the government should itself move. It is a motion about talking to people. Last week we spent a lot of time talking about a motion to talk to people, and MAIN COMMITTEE we would expect that the Greens, given that they moved that motion last week, and the government supported it, would understand the very need for this motion here today. The people of the Adelaide Hills are suffering under the direct consequences of decisions made by this government, because they have lost control of Australia’s borders. Every day Labor sets a new record on boat arrivals, and that is a point that has been very well made by the shadow minister for immigration. This is an issue that the government has lost control of and the consequences will be felt very much by my community. The motion very simply asks for the Joint Standing Committee on Migration to inquire into whether or not this is a suitable site to locate a detention facility for family groups. The impacts of the operation of this facility on the local community, including health, education, recreation, transport, police and community services are issues. These are questions that they would have liked to ask the Prime Minister, but she will not meet with them. She refuses to see them. The Adelaide Hills is a good enough location for a photo opportunity, but it is not good enough to talk to the locals when she is up there. We hear in the Adelaide media that the Prime Minister is going to spend Christmas in Adelaide. So we are hoping that over Christmas at the Woodside pub on Boxing Day watching the first ball of the Boxing Day test she can come out and sit down with the locals and work through these issues with them. Before she rushes ahead with this centre she should answer some of these questions. I say again: I know the member for Hindmarsh is the next speaker and he has been long and loud on community consultation when it come to airport noise. I would hope that the member for Hindmarsh does not now back away from his view that the community should be listened to when it comes to the impacts on their community. I am sure he will not. His former employer was in the paper not a month ago-some of us have got staff connections, but we do not always go into that. The member for Hindmarsh does have a history with Nick Bolkus, a former Labor immigration minister, and the member for Hindmarsh, as a good man, will recognise that Nick Bolkus said that this was not the right place to have an immigration facility. He refused it. He said no to the department when they recommended it, and this government should say no again. This motion should be supported because it does what the government should have done in the first place. They should have listened to this community. They should still listen to this community. They should answer the questions which are so relevant to this community about the impact on it-about the impact on their school services, their health services, their security and the so-called economic benefits we keep hearing about. This government should listen. This Prime Minister should show some courage. She should front up and talk to these people before it is too late. This motion should be supported.

One might have thought that they could have made a valuable contribution towards the consultations, towards the department of immigration’s management of operations on the ground and especially towards the government’s existing and ongoing consultation with the local community groups, representatives and residents. Yes, I am all for consultation, as the member said. I always have been when it comes to issues in my electorate, and I am sure the member for Mayo is doing the same in his electorate.

What is the impact on the local community, the economy and small businesses? The department will be increasing economic activity, we hear. We already know this. This increase is said to be good for the coffers of local businesses, so that question is answered. With regard to the cost and level of services to be provided at the facility, how does the member think this information will be sourced? How does he think that a committee will dig out this information? They would ask the minister and the department. That is the obvious course of action. They would ask a question and, if that is all they would do, I do not know why you would need a committee for this purpose. Just ask the question and be done with it, and do not waste our time. It would be a similar situation to seek information on potential risks, although what risks the member is referring to I do not know.

He has also set up the community reference group, which is already meeting. The motion calls on the would be committee to undertake public hearings. The government has already gone one better than that.

I was one of those kids thatfrom non-English-speaking backgrounds, there are 22 Aboriginal enrolments and nine new rival program classes are run per week. I understand the logic of the people of the Woodside area that new challenges will diminish the resources and energy that can be applied to the existing challenges, but the fact of the matter is that in Cowandilla’s case we coped. More than that, as I have indicated, we actually thrived. This issue is different, of course. With the department of immigration, there will be additional support, additional resources, and additional education personnel and the like. They will be picking up the tab as well. In terms of the area and the impact on the area, migration has been a blessing in this country. Adelaide’s western suburbs were great when I was growing up. If you want a window into the past, have a quick look at my maiden speech and how much the place has changed over time. It is an even better area now: it is more diverse, more interesting and more enjoyable because of the people there and the different cultures, experiences and perspectives that they give our community. SoI encourage the member for Mayo to be positive and to try and create a positive atmosphere out of it and at the same time do all that we can to consult with the community and ensure that these fears are erased. Your community leaders have already met with the minister; communication is open. I encourage people to express their views with the minister over time. They are there to resolve these issues with a cool head with the department of immigration and the minister. I acknowledge that this is a change but all I can talk about is my experiences and it is likely to be positive change socially and economically. The opposition’s reflex opposition to this government’s initiative is exactly identical to their opposition to other government initiatives. It is a tactic which is repeated week after week to frustrate anything that the government is doing. I cannot support their tactic and their hypocrisy on this obstructionism that they embody. panic because of its own failed policies. Labor want to turn this into a race debate. We just saw that then from the member for Hindmarsh, turning this into a debate about immigration when this debate today is about an arrogant government flailing from their own policy failures and forcing a decision on a local community. I welcome those in the gallery today from the community of Woodside who out of their own pockets have come to get what they could not get in Woodside-meetings with the government and particularly a meeting with the Prime Minister. I note today that the Prime Minister has scurried away, despite the fact that she has been in Adelaide on numerous occasions and could have met with the good people of Woodside but has refused to. This government needs to face up to its own failures. The people of Woodside are not only standing up for their community but I believe they are standing up for people around the country, because this will not be the last set of beds opened by this government in the detention network. There have been some 1,800 to 1,900 people who have arrived illegally by boat since the election. The government have announced around 3,000 new beds and they will be exhausted in very short order. So the processes established by which this government arrogantly and in a panic imposes these matters on people in our community is a matter that is worthy of debate.

When I was in Woodside recently-and those in the government did their usual thing of trying to accuse the coalition of being racists, basically, in considering the legitimate concerns of people in the community-these were some of the concerns put to me: they were concerned about the future of the Inverbrackie base and want an answer to that; they were concerned about the location of demountables on the school playground as a result of having to cater for additional students at the school, which will take away the play area for their children; they were concerned about whether there would be counsellors placed in the schools who would be able to address the concerns of parents and their children and who would deal with the inevitable situations that would arise from these matters; and they were concerned about bushfire risk and the lack of a plan-and I understand there is still the lack of a plan to deal with a catastrophic bushfire event-where you have 400 people in a centre in a very hazardous zone, none of whom can respond directly to any English directions. That is a concern that this government should be concerned about. They were concerned that the alternative uses of this facility for supported accommodation for people with disabilities had not been assessed or considered. The need for social housing in this community-and there are quite a number of people in the Adelaide Hills in need of this, I am told-was also ignored. The potential for this facility to be used as a women’s refuge for women who are fleeing domestic violence was also discounted. There were concerns that the $10 million that is going to be spent on this facility could be better spent on the Mount Barker hospital. People were concerned that the site was chosen without any discussion about what the alternative sites were other than in this facility, and that remains the issue. We do not know what the alternatives were; the government will not release the list of alternatives. They are not prepared to stump up and explain their decisions to this community. This community was also concerned about access to health services and whether there would be a two-tiered health service in Inverbrackie and Woodside: a substandard service for those who live in Woodside and the Adelaide Hills and another standard for those who will be detained as part of the Inverbrackie detention centre. These are very legitimate and reasonable concerns. This motion put forward by the member for Mayo, who I commend for his advocacy in this parliament on behalf his community, is simply designed to give people a say and to force this government not simply and arrogantly to impose decisions on a community. It is because of their failures, and let us not forget that they are their failures that have created the need for this facility. More beds and a never-never solution in East Timor are no solution. What this government needs is to put a real solution on the table for their border protection MAIN COMMITTEE failures. The minister should come into the House this week before the parliament rises and stump up with his plan. I am ready to put mine forward and the people of Australia can decide. (Time expired) ground in what it is like to grow up in a community which has been, over many generations, the beneficiary of people who have come to our country with a suitcase full of photos and a heart full of hope in search of refuge from wars and persecution. They have come to a community which has, on the whole, received them with open arms and benefited from the great contribution they have made to our community in the Illawarra and the greater Throsby region. I agree with some of the comments that were made by members opposite that there is a need for a debate on immigration in this country, that there is a need for a debate around refugees in this country, but that debate should be based on facts. It is a debate which should be cognisant of the fact that we live in a region which is beset by international turmoil, by wars and by dislocated populations. It should be cognisant of the fact that, as the UNHCR has reported, there has been an overall increase in the number of displaced persons in the world, in our region-by over 12 per cent between the years 2007 and 2008 alone. Indeed, over 35 million people are believed to be displaced. We have an obligation as a community to deal, in a responsible way and with regional solutions, with the plight of unfortunate people who are being displaced in our region. We do need a debate on how, in this country and this region, we deal with those problems. We need a debate which is cognisant of the fact that the majority of people who are in our detention centres at the moment did not come by boat. You could be forgiven, if you listened to the rhetoric and the debate of those opposite, for thinking that the majority of people have come to us by boat. They have not come by boat; they have come by plane, with valid visas. After arriving in a plane, with a valid visa, they have sought asylum or refuge. That is what led them into a detention centre. The motion we are debating is yet more of the politics of fear from the member for Mayo and the coalition. Prior to the election campaign, the Prime Minister proposed seeking a long-term solution, a bipartisan solution, to deal with asylum seekers and to end the politics of fear and division that the coalition has been practising. and listened to the speech by the shadow immigration spokesperson, the member for Cook, and I am sure other members in this chamber would be forgiven for being confused as to whether this was a debate about a particular site in Inverbrackie or whether it was a debate about immigration policy. an opportunity for him to spread more of the politics of fear and confusion. We are seeing that as a result of this motion. The coalition has to come clean on whether it opposes the housing of families and children in community based accommodation or whether it wants these families to remain in detention centres. And that goes to the nub of the proposition. Do the opposition want these people to remain in detention centres or do they want them to be in commuMAIN COMMITTEE",263,Private Members Business

There was a bipartisan position from 2005 that it would be better for women and children not to be in long-term detention centres but to be in more community based facilities. But we see through this episode perhaps a reversal of that bipartisan position. Mr Danby interjectingment, it is reprehensible for the member for Mayo to continue to spread fear and misinformation in his community and to seek to exploit the fears for some political advantage. Holding an inquiry, as the member is proposing, would simply be another stunt to stir up community concerns. Any genuine concerns that the community may have are being dealt with systematically by the department and by the minister, and that is indeed the appropriate way for those concerns to be dealt with. (Time expired) sense, and sadly it is required, as the Labor government continues to make ill-conceived decisions which show their lack of concern for the welfare of communities and for people within Australia. Their lack of planning and consultation can be shown in the latest announcement of a detention centre at Inverbrackie in South Australia. Concerned community residents have formed a group called the Woodside Community Action Group and they were here earlier today. They are worried about the severe ramifications that this centre will have on this community unless serious action is taken. Community groups in the area are calling the government sneaky and untrusting and the groups believe the government are not capable of thinking through the consequences that could affect the fabric of the community. On 18 October 2010, the Prime Minister and the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship announced a $9.7 million detention facility which would accommodate 400 people, consisting of family groups who are undergoing refugee status assessment. But the government did not consult with the community around the proposed detention centre when making their plans. Neither did they consult the state government of South Australia or the Adelaide Hills Council. The Prime Minister did not even mention the plan when she visited the Adelaide Hills on Sunday, 17 October, the very day before the announcement was made. The government only consulted the Department of Defence. The government’s lack of concern for the community was shown in a radio interview with the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Chris Bowen, on Friday, 22 October 2010. When he was asked whether the final decision had been made and if the community was now expected to simply accept the plans, Mr Bowen answered: … we’ve made a decision that this is an appropriate site. We’re more than happy to sit down with the local community and sort through their concerns but we’re implementing the decision that’s been made. The minister went on to confirm that the government did not have concern for the community with the following statement: I understand people’s concerns but at the end of the day this is of course a Commonwealth responsibility to make sure that people are accommodated. It’s Commonwealth land and it’s land which is very suitable for this purpose. In other words, the land belongs to the government and they will do whatever they like with it without concern for those living in the area or the local governments in place.

It has been announced that detainees will be lowrisk clients who were assessed for their suitability for placement while on Christmas Island and other places, but it does not give any other details. What ages will they be? All the government have said is that families will arrive. What will be the impact on local health services, education, recreation, transport, police and other community services? There are no concrete answers to these questions, which shows a lack of planning by the government. The government do not even have a plan for the duration of the facility’s usage. It has been said that Inverbrackie is intended to be a mediumto long-term facility but that detention facilities are always driven by the number of people who need to be detained. Has the government thought through any of these questions or are they simply doing what they want to do because it suits them? A further inquiry by the Joint Standing Committee on Migration should be undertaken as a matter of priority for a government which has clearly failed to gain community support, come up with a detailed plan and fully assess the issues and concerns of the community involved. pleased to take part as a former chairman of the parliament’s Joint Standing Committee on Migration. The opposition has made this motion, which claims that the government has not consulted on the development of this centre, into a political issue that is not based on fact. The brief I received from the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship indicates that he has met a number of times with people from Woodside and that Woodside residents are going to have further opportunities to meet with him. As the member for Hindmarsh said earlier when he was in the chair, the mayors of the local area will also be meeting with him on Wednesday, 24 November. This motion needs to be seen in a wider context. The real issue is not some faux concern about consultation. It is another attempt by the opposition to use its old faithful political weapon: hysteria about unauthorised boat arrivals. Debates surrounding unauthorised boat arrivals in this country have had many low points, but some of the worse occurred during the recent election campaign. We all remember the opposition’s extraordinary as with red arrows pointing at hordes of people coming from Asia and the Middle East to our shores. Who can forget the overblown rhetoric of the member for Warringah, the Leader of the Opposition, that Australia is suffering a ‘passive invasion’? We have 13½ thousand people who are part of an authorised refugee program, and that overall number is not altered. Those who come by boat-there are no extra people who become refugees-are but part of that small segment of our migration program. The debate descended into the downright bizarre when the member for Warringah, the Leader of the Opposition, suggested that he would establish a ‘boat phone’ to turn boats back. Of course, he would not do that. We all know that the rhetoric of the member for Warringah is worse than what he would actually do. He would not drag women and children back out to sea. But slogans and publicity stunts are what we have come to expect of the opposition, rather than measured and sensible responses to the issues facing our country. The government is developing a policy response to this issue that is focused on regional engagement. We will only be able to successfully manage this issue of unauthorised arrivals by working with our neighbours-those countries through which the vast majority of unauthorised arrivals transit. This policy will not necessarily be a quick fix, but it will achieve a MAIN COMMITTEE",266,Private Members Business
325,Mr Danby (Melbourne Ports) (1.24 Pm),"I have been called late into this debate and amlasting result. As I said previously, every person who is seriously involved in the asylum seeker issue knows that the central issue is what happens in Indonesia. The government in Indonesia is democratic and the best friend Australia has ever had. Indonesia has an excellent President and an excellent foreign minister. The possible passage by the Indonesian parliament of legislation giving sentences to people smugglers is much more germane to people in Adelaide who are upset about unauthorised arrivals than is this hysterical motion. We also must remember the context. Around the world approximately 42 million people were forcibly displaced as a result of conflict during 2009. Developing countries host 80 per cent of the world’s refugees. Australia received 6,170 unauthorised arrivals in 2009, which is 1.6 per cent of the world total. Please, let us place this debate in some context. As I said, we had 13½ thousand asylum seekers in our humanitarian program. The people who come as unauthorised arrivals are subtracted from that 13½ thousand, so there are no extra people coming to Australia-something I hope the member for Mayo and the member for Cook point out to people in the Adelaide Hills. I cannot understand the opposition’s policy on this. I was on the Joint Standing Committee on Migration when the shadow minister for migration, the member for Murray, voted in 2009 at the committee for asylum seekers to be treated more humanely and more rationally. She voted for that policy. That was the time when the opposition ought to have been up there demanding any changes they wanted to make to our migration policy, to the way we receive asylum seekers, rather than making people hysterical for political purposes during an election and when we actually have to deal with a group of asylum seekers who need to be housed in a particular centre in Adelaide. Our policy is about ensuring that Australia retains its rightful role of welcoming a reasonable number of the world’s refugees while maintaining the security of our borders. Our policies will achieve this; cheap slogans will not. has expired. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting.

327,Mr Ruddock (Berowra) (4.03 Pm),"In the spirit of the occasion, I first apologise to theing in any real direction and one that shows that the government is without a substantial plan for the future. I thought as I read this speech that it was particularly germane because the first matter that the Governor General comments on is the outcome of the election. I must say it is quite fascinating for me to read an address-in-reply where the Governor General comments on the outcome of an election. She goes on to say on behalf of the government: Nowhere has the robust nature of our democracy been more evident than in the election held on 21 August 2010. Through this result, the Australian people have placed upon their elected leaders the responsibility of forming a minority government, something not seen in our Commonwealth for seven decades. In that I agree. She went on to make this very interesting observation: It is a tribute to every senator and member gathered here today that this process unfolded with patience and civility and has yielded a parliament committed to greater transparency and accord. I thought to myself, ‘Where is the evidence for this greater transparency and accord?’ I know that the speech covered a number of areas, which I will go to, but among the issues that I found particularly fascinating were the issues in relation to the National Broadband Network. I was particularly focusing today on some comments in the Sydney Morning Herald written by Ross Gittins, not a person who I normally see lauding the opposition but one who makes, when I read his remarks, often quite perspicacious comments. He made this observation today: I am starting to get a really bad feeling about Labor’s plan for a national broadband network. The more it resists subjecting the plan to scrutiny, the more you suspect it has something to hide. He goes on: The obvious way to start that process would have been to accede to calls for the Productivity Commission to conduct a cost-benefit analysis. The determination of governments to keep their schemes away from the commission is always prima facie evidence they know the scheme’s dodgy. I must say that I thought these were particularly perspicacious comments about what is said to be one of the major centre points of this government’s program for the next parliament. When I also read about greater transparency and accord, I also want to take this opportunity-in relation to the way in which the government was made, on which the Governor General has seen fit to comment-to record something of the observations made recently by the member for New England. WhatI was fascinated by was that the member for New England, in relation to a matter which in the overall scheme of things is important to some but for most people largely irrelevant-that is, the question of same-sex marriage-said, of course, that this was the most important issue, about which every member should consult with their constituents to form a view as to how they might respond. I might say that I have already spoken in another debate on that matter, and I mean no ill will to people who are in same-sex partnerships, but I think it is germane that in relation to the major question facing the people of Australia, the formation of a government after this recent election, the member for New England did not think it was necessary to consult with his electors about whom he should support in the formation of that government. I found that quite fascinating: on same-sex relations it should happen, but in relation to the formation of the government for the next three years in Australia it was not necessary. I must say that I have greater respect for the member MAIN COMMITTEE for Denison, who, in relation to the judgment he formed that he, having consulted with his constituents and fairly obviously having formed a view about where their loyalty would be if he were not there as an Independent-that is, with the government-decided that he should support the government. I am surprised the member for New England did not go through the same process. I want to take the opportunity of addressing the first major question that the government raised in this address-in-reply, and that is a stronger economy. The first point I want to make is how ungracious I think this government has shown itself to be. It goes on to make this observation through the words of the Governor General: Having emerged from the global financial crisis with some of the best economic outcomes of any advanced nation, the government will implement measures to ensure Australia’s economy remains flexible and strong. I thought how ungracious it was not to acknowledge that the underlying strength of the Australian economy, which saw us through that crisis, was something that they inherited: a strong economy-not obtained, I might say, with ease but obtained because people were prepared to take tough decisions over a long period of time to produce surpluses. When I look back over the way in which some other leaders of Australia have responded from time to time, they have been prepared to acknowledge the efforts of their predecessors if they have been significant in the outcomes that are being obtained. In relation to the global financial crisis, the record of the Howard government and the strength of the economy that was bequeathed to Labor should always have been acknowledged quickly and generously, and I think it diminishes those who fail to make that acknowledgement. But I was also impressed with these observations: Foremost among those challengesthat is, in relation to a stronger economyis the need to build a high-productivity, high-participation, high-skill economy that delivers sustainable growth for all Australians. The speech goes on to identify a number of ways in which it is believed that that is possible. As one who is strongly of the view that we should be transparent in relation to these matters, and fair and just in the way in which we deal with these issues, I am prepared to acknowledge that it is important to have expenditure by the Commonwealth in improved infrastructure. It needs to be improvement in infrastructure where it is actually needed rather than where it is politically opportune, and it is in that context that I wish to comment about the commitment to invest in transport infrastructure over the next six-year period and the decisions taken by this government in relation to the community that I represent. I have to say, Madam Deputy Speaker-and you may not be familiar with it-that Sydney is a quite fascinating city. It is a city that is often seen to be divided, not just by a river but in the way in which people are dealt with, and certain assumptions are made that if you live in some parts of Sydney you are a little better off than others and you may have fewer needs. When you form your judgments on the basis of addressing expenditure where you assume there may be greater needs and you ignore others, you can sometimes have quite perverse effects. The most significant and perverse effect in Sydney is the extent to which significant MAIN COMMITTEE transport links which are necessary between our major capitals have been disadvantaged because of very deliberate decisions to ignore some parts of our great city of Sydney. I often tell people-and I am sure my colleague the member for Macarthur would know that a new freeway has been built in the western suburbs of Sydney. It is called the M7, state of-the-art infrastructure which ends on another freeway called the M2, which in fact goes to Sydney rather than anywhere north of Sydney. There is another highway called the Cumberland Highway, which stretches through the southern part of Sydney. I will tell you where it ends in a moment. There is another highway called Woodville Road and another highway called Silverwater Road-and, Madam Deputy Speaker, where do you think they all end? They all end on one road called Pennant Hills Road at West Pennant Hills, where, with a mass of traffic generated locally, with a lot of traffic lights and with a very considerable number of dangerous sites where quite significant accidents could occur, you have major interstate transport vehicles, B-doubles and the like, mixed with schoolchildren in vehicles on a three-lane road, said to be a highway, which services a local community and no other way, essentially, to bypass it if you want to go from Melbourne to Brisbane. It is the major choke point in effectively linking those three cities, and yet no expenditure occurs on that road, ostensibly, I think, because people think: ‘These are Liberal electorates. They don’t deserve to have expenditure of this sort given to them.’ It is said at times that the freight issues might be able to be dealt with by putting freight railway lines in. You certainly cannot do it on the existing line or you would have to raise the level of every overpass carrying traffic between Sydney and Brisbane, but no substantial expenditure or effort has been made to provide an effective freight network on that rail link. I think that this is the most significant decision that has impacted upon any community, in a most deleterious way. Unless the government is prepared to make a substantial effort to convince New South Wales that it should prioritise this road link, we will go on with the farce that Infrastructure Australia will not advise the spending of any money to address that issue, by a genuine western orbital, by a tunnel or by whatever other route is properly advised. It will not happen unless the preliminary work and planning has been undertaken. When you go to the link and ask the question: ‘What work has been done to prepare the plans so it can be job ready?’ none has been undertaken. In one way or another Labor is responsible, whether it is federally or in the state of New South Wales. I think these decisions are deliberately neglected because they are of no priority to the government. I have to say that I hope a time will come when it can be detached from the political arguments and people will recognise that there is a very large community of people here who are entitled to proper services-a north-west rail link, an effective orbital road network that will separate out the interstate trucks from local communities. Until that happens the people of north-west Sydney are entitled, and justly, to complain and to complain loudly. There is nothing in this speech that would suggest that there is an approach to deal with this question. I found one other issue that was of interest to me. Having been an Attorney-General and interested in economic reform that one could undertake, it always seemed to me that harmonisation of laws between the states of Australia and the territories of Australia is a very significant way of reducing costs to industry and making Australia a more productive society. YetI find in this speech the only example where this government is working in relation to that important MAIN COMMITTEE issue is the one area in which two Labor governments now cannot see eye to eye. The speech says this: During this term, the government will also pursue its reform agenda to break down barriers for businesses operating across state and territory borders, in particular, a national regime for occupational health and safety regulation. I think that regime is absolutely necessary, but I find it preposterous that New South Wales should be walking away from it and that a Labor government in Canberra cannot convince a Labor government in New South Wales to cooperate on a measure that they say is important. What disappoints me even more is that beyond that no other areas of reform have been effectively identified. There is little in this speech that one can comment on in a generous way, because it is so shallow. There is a lot that I wanted to comment on, and time will prevent me, but I do need to talk about another area adjacent to my electorate where my electors have been particularly short changed. The government has a statement in this speech that it: … will implement its landmark structural reforms to improve access to health and hospital services for all Australians and sustain the financial viability of the health system. I have to say in northern Sydney we are only serviced well by our private hospital system. The major public hospitals, which have been community hospitals supported by the local community, have been savagely neglected. It is not the staff or the people who work there that are to blame. It is a government that has deliberately ignored the needs of north-western Sydney and particularly those of the Hornsby and District Hospital. When people are taken into hospital premises and they find that males and females are using the same toilet facility because people have been mixed together when they have come out of surgery-and I had a local resident complain to me about a situation in which, while he was on a toilet, a woman came into the premises to have a shower-you have to ask yourself how that can happen. While he was in the hospital, the roof was leaking because no effective maintenance had been undertaken. When the hospital said it would try to do something about it, it erected a temporary roof over the top and maybe next week it would bring some tarpaulins in. It is an absolute disgrace that you can leave a community served in that way and not give it priority. Yet the arguments that are given are that these people are in some way privileged. I think this government will be very severely judged in time because it has no substantial proposals. This speech is bereft, in my view, of any significant outline or plan of achievement for which the government can be effectively held accountable. It is full of cliches and there is very little on commitment, particularly to my constituents, who are entitled to be very concerned. There are many other issues I would like to discuss, but before I finish my speech I will focus on one other issue I find quite fascinating which is likely to be of importance to my electorate in time and that is the rollout of the National Broadband Network. I was certainly unaware that, in order to implement the National Broadband Network, states might be asked to legislate to give the providers of that service the right to enter onto private property, often without consent, to ensure that connectivity can be achieved. The fact that Tasmania has legislated in this way needs to be clarified now by all the other Australian states. I noticed a headline in the Hobart Mercury ‘Gardens at Risk’. I think all Australians are entitled to know MAIN COMMITTEE whether the National Broadband Network is going to lead to intrusive activity in their homes without their consent. Ms SAFFIN (Page) (4.23 pm)-In my contribution to the address-in-reply to the Governor General’s speech, I am going to focus on my seat of Page and outline a number of what I call ‘Page priorities’-a list that I have put together over the three years that I have been a member and something I have worked up in close consultation with my five local government areas, with a range of representative bodies in my area and with individuals. So it is a real community list of Page priorities. I always say to people that we can always lobby for them and some we will get and some we might not get but good ideas never go away and they find their time. That is the approach I take to working with, working up, advocating and advancing these priorities. Obviously, health is a big one and I will start with health. Stages3 and 4 of the Lismore Base Hospital redevelopment-the next stage of the development-will cost $155 million. That amount is broken into $90 million for stage 3 and $65 million for stage 4. There is a community health centre on Treelands Drive, Yamba. That would be at a cost of $3.5 million. These are indicative costs. There has been some sort of project brief done as well. Grafton Base Hospital, also in my electorate, would be stage 3. We have stage 1 and stage 2, and I am happy to report that I have been able to get money for both of those hospitals. They are underway, but stage 3 at Grafton Base Hospital would be about a $50 million package. It would involve a new surgical services unit and new emergency department, among other things. There are other projects in the community-I know there is Ballina District Hospital. One of the longer-term projects there would be an upgrade of the emergency department and surgical services. That would be a $25 million project. Iluka is a small, lovely village in my seat. The expansion of the Iluka Community Health Centre would be a $2 million project. Casino Aboriginal Medical Service, which covers a range of services in a broader area, would get an upgrade. They are looking to relocate to a stand-alone, purpose built Aboriginal Medical Service centre. That is a $4.7 million project. There are some other projects. I will start in the Ballina Shire area. There would be the completion of the Ballina River Street Beautification Project, the Main Street beautification in Alstonville and, as they call it, the Ballina Lady Jockeys Racing Museum at the Ballina Racecourse. That is something the Ballina Jockey Club are very passionate about and are doing some work on in the community at the moment. There is also a biochar project that Ballina Shire Council is working on in conjunction with others. We are in conversation about that at the moment. It is a very good project that I see as a leader in that area. It could have good implications for our regional economy. Richmond Valley Council, one of the other five local government areas, are working up the Queen Elizabeth Park redevelopment master plan with at least nine local sporting groups and widespread community support to enhance and develop a large multiuse sporting fields area. Other projects in the Richmond Valley area include two projects coordinated with the Richmond Valley Council who, with other people in the community, are keen on and working to advance. One is a gas pipeline in the area and another is intermodal freight rail. There is also the Northern Rivers military museum. I have had a look at an old hall in Casino with an ex-serviceman: the Richmond Valley general manager. They are gathering widespread support across the Northern Rivers area to look at a Northern Rivers military museum. In various RSLs and clubs that we have across my seat of Page you will find museum pieces, and I am MAIN COMMITTEE sure that they will be keen to hang on to them. The idea was that they could look at having a Northern Rivers military museum so that there could be one key museum that could house a lot of this very important historical memorabilia. Coraki, which is also in the Richmond Valley Council area, has projects identified including the multipurpose court for tennis and hockey at Windsor Park, the extension of the skate park facilities and the Coraki riverside park foreshores improvement program. In Evans Head, still in Richmond Valley, projects include the Stan Payne Oval improvements, the footpath bikeway program that gives connectivity between certain streets and Ocean Drive et cetera, and heritage work at the Evans Head Memorial Aerodrome. I move on to the third local government area: the Clarence Valley. One of the projects identified there is the Grafton Regional Art Gallery, which in conjunction with Clarence Valley Council, Arts Northern Rivers, the Gallery Foundation and Friends of the Gallery, has widespread community support for an upgrade, a collection room and a range of other things to enhance it. There are also the saleyards at South Grafton-an area for which I got money before for an upgrade-for a continuing upgrade; a performance stage and dressing rooms at the Saraton Theatre; and a new Men’s Shed at the former Grafton brewery site. The old brewery site is an old historical landmark in Grafton, a great site, and they are doing some really good work there. There is also a plan to build a second crossing over the Clarence River, and that is something that has been strongly promoted and pushed at state level. It is a key project. I will also mention Iluka, which has formed a local community-run committee to raise funds for a pool. That was done in Evans Head in my electorate. They worked for 17 years to raise funds for a pool. They were fortunate in that they were able to get some additional funding under the regional community infrastructure program. In that 17 years they had a lot of cake stalls and lamington drives to raise the money, so it was good to see that get up. Iluka has drawn its inspiration from what happened at Evans Head. Kyogle council, another local government area in my seat, have a key project-the Kyogle Gallery and Museum project and library extension-put forward as the Kyogle Shire Council’s No. 1 priority works project. It is one of those projects that the whole community is behind. It has a local committee, led by Tom Fitzgerald, one of those great local people who get involved in all sorts of things. He is someone who talks the talk and walks the walk, because he gets out and does things. I have had the opportunity to work with Tom over many yearslong before I came into this place-to get some good things happening in health and other areas. This key project will help enhance and develop the cultural precinct in Kyogle and add to the regional economy as well. A new Kyogle Youth Centre is dear to the people in the community and to the Kyogle council, as is restoration of the Kyogle Memorial hall and working with the local RSL. There is also a project in a very beautiful place called Lawrence, which is on the river in the Clarence Valley. It is a small project but one that will make a big impact in that small community. It is for the restoration of Lawrence Hall, also known as the Lawrence Literary Institute. Part of the restoration is for the removal and replacement of the asbestos roof. That will go a long way to helping Lawrence Hall. I now turn to the Lismore local government area. A project the residents there have long advocated is the Margaret Olley Arts Centre. Margaret Olley, who has allowed her name to be MAIN COMMITTEE put to the arts centre, has links with our area. The project has the support of the Lismore City Council, Arts Northern Rivers, Regional Development Australia and the Northern Rivers industry investment district. There is widespread community support for the project. It is a strategic project that they would like to get up. The centre would be a purpose-built facility on the corner of Keen and Magellan streets and would include permanent and temporary exhibition space, a lecture theatrette, a collection and storage area, a reception area, a cafe and a gallery shop-all the things we now have in modern art galleries, which are more than art galleries; they become part and parcel of the cultural precinct. Another priority in the local government area is a lift in the Lismore Regional Museum, which is about accessibility. The residents of the area would also like a second bridge over the Wilson River. There are a lot of places where people want a second bridge, and the Wilson River has been identified as an area where a second bridge is needed. Refurbishment at the Lismore City Hall is another priority. There are also a number of road projects, particularly the Ballina Road alignment and the Pineapple Road link between Ballina Road and Bangalow Road. Other priorities in local government areas include the Nymboida Wilderness Rescue team at Nymboida and Coutts Crossing in Clarence Valley. They provide a really important community function but do not have a storage area. Their equipment is stored in bits and pieces at various people’s places, and they move it around as they go out and do key work in the community. They do share an overcrowded shed with the State Emergency Service at Coutts Crossing, but they are keen to have their own storage area. For the village of Rappville, public infrastructure would allow them to upgrade the community hall and provide a playground and shade structure. For Wardell, a priority is the second stage of the Wardell master plan. The master plan was worked out between Ballina Shire Council and the Wardell community and Wardell businesses. The second stage would reinvigorate the Wardell town centre. The council has already provided money for the first stage and for the restoration, including the wharf, street lighting and shared pathways, which is wonderful. Wardell also has a great timber boardwalk. It is a historical village, and historical and cultural artwork would be included in the project. In Woodburn, which is on the Pacific Highway between Grafton and Ballina-a stretch of the highway that is often talked about-there is a lovely visitor information centre, which is run by volunteers. They do a great job, particularly Joan Roots and her team. I know they would like to see the centre done up, but in Woodburn they also want to develop their native botanical garden, which is on the riverbank east of the town, and upgrade Riverside Park. Woodburn is certainly a lovely place to stop. The projects would not only beautify the area but also help the local economy. A few other projects have come up as Page priorities. The Yamba Surf Life Saving Club needs a new storage shed at Turners Beach. You may not know that Yamba was voted as the ‘best kept secret’ in Australia. I think some of the people who live there would like to keep it like that, and I do not blame them. It is one of those places that people like to visit-very beautiful. It is a great surf lifesaving club, and a storage shed for the club is one of the projects that has been identified as a priority. Another priority for Yamba is some additional work at the sporting complex, particularly the Lower Clarence rugby league club and Yaegl Elders, which has community support. MAIN COMMITTEE Then there is Woodenbong. Woodenbong is in my electorate. It comes within the Kyogle shire and borders on the Tenterfield shire. My seat of Page also borders on the seat of New England. Woodenbong has long had a dream and it is hard to get attention, particularly as it is one of the smaller towns and villages in the area-a very vibrant one-and people want it for roads. It is a key linkA division having been called in the House of RepresentativesSitting suspended from 4.40 pm to 4.53 pm In the few minutes I have left in the address-in-reply debate I will mention a few other projects. There are quite a few employment ones, covering a whole range of areas from community colleges to Southern Cross University. There are also some social inclusion ones, particularly with the Northern Rivers Social Development Council, and there is also the regional integrated transport plan, which is a big one that the entire community is committed to. As well, the community is working with colleagues over the border in South-East Queensland out into the Southern Downs area Scenic Rim and way beyond my seat. But that is what we need for a proper regional integrated transport plan and it has some legs. There have also been some advances made towards Infrastructure Australia in another area. Another key issue that comes up is about the Clarence River. There are a lot of people who are continually talking about getting their hands on the water in the Clarence River, about diverting it or damming it. This has come up again in the context of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan and the debate about that. I have said in this place and I will keep saying to anybody who even thinks about it, dreams about it, talks about it, speculates about it or advances it: not a drop will go out of the Clarence River. It is just a nonsensical approach to dealing with a problem and it will create another problem. The Clarence Valley Council has put up a minute on it, and all of its members and the whole community are at one on that. While ever that debate goes on, I will keep restating: not a drop. We have bumper stickers for people’s cars that say ‘Not a drop’ and I will be giving out more of those. In the few seconds I have left in this debate, I want to mention a meeting I had with Dr Harry Gibbs and Dr Matt Landos in my office the other day. One is a cardiologist and one is a vet. They have been doing a lot of good work in the community, looking at chemicals and at the body of science around the negative impacts of chemicals in our rivers affecting fishery production and also affecting human health. I had a very interesting conversation with them and they have given me information on some great research. They have set out a case for urgent reform of pesticide regulation in Australia, and I will have another opportunity to talk about that. represent the people of Goldstein in this place. I have had this honour now since 2004. I would like to thank the people of Goldstein for their continued trust and support, and again commit myself to seeking to represent every member of the Goldstein community. The local interaction with the people of my electorate remains for me the most enjoyable and rewarding aspect of my job. As I said, I have now had six years representing the Goldstein community, which is a very vibrant community in a beautiful part of Melbourne on the bay. We have 60,000 households and 50 schools, and I enjoy the contact with all of that, but the 980 community organisations I have identified is an area of work that I have found particularly enjoyable. MAIN COMMITTEE",268,Governor General S Speech
328,Mr Robb (Goldstein) (4.56 Pm),"It is a great privilege to have the opportunity again toWhat has struck me since becoming a member of parliament is the number of people in each electorate who volunteer to assist with so much of what makes our communities as vibrant as they are. Amongst the 130,000 people in my electorate, I estimate that there are close to 30,000 who do some sort of voluntary work. They make the football clubs, the tennis clubs, the bowling clubs, the community and ethnic organisations and all those sorts of activities work. But the groups that deal with people with disabilities are the ones that I have found the most rewarding to deal with and the ones that I am most in awe of, in a sense. Places like Bayley House, Marriott House and the Berendale School, among others, are wonderful places with wonderful people. In relation to the overall election result, to get so near to forming government but to find ourselves back in opposition is both disappointing and frustrating, particular considering that we won more seats than our principal opponent, the Labor Party, and 700,000 more primary votes than Labor. It is truly remarkable that the effectiveness of the coalition resulted for the first time since Federation in a first-time Prime Minister not lasting until an election and, for the second time only, a first-time government losing its majority. Much credit should go to our leader, Tony Abbott, who has been truly magnificent in holding this government to account and has continued in that vein very strongly since we have continued in opposition after the election. Tony had a wonderful campaign and has led a united and disciplined team, supported by strong policy work by our shadow ministers. We must continue the efforts of the last 12 months in order to remove what in my view is really a quite dangerous Labor-Green government. In the three years of the Rudd-Gillard government, very little was done, and what was done involved major increases in the nanny state. I do think that this explains a lot of results. Once people were able to focus on the nature of the government over the past three years and the implications of that, we saw that unprecedented movement against a first-term government. Nothing has been done or said to suggest that we can expect anything different in this Labor term. In fact, the last three years and now the alliance formed with the Greens have shown me that philosophy matters. It shows me why we are here. It often annoys me that people say that, since the fall of the Berlin Wall, there is no longer any difference between the two parties. From my observations at both the state and federal levels over the last 30 years, that is not correct. There are two legitimately held philosophical positions but they are fundamentally different. On our side we believe in the great value of the individual, and it is our belief that the collective well-being, happiness and prosperity of any community is maximised by government creating an environment where each person is free to make decisions about how they conduct their own lives as long as they do not harm others-in other words, a community where people have choices, the freedom to choose. That freedom of course carries with it an obligation to take personal responsibility for your own actions and decisions. By contrast, turning to Labor and its Green allies, instinctively both those parties think the best decisions are made by Canberra-that the government knows best and people who make the wrong decisions are victims and need to be protected from themselves. It is a legitimate philosophy, but it is fundamentally different from the philosophy held on this side of the House. And it is that different philosophy that is brought to bear on everyday policies that affect everyday people in the way in which they go about their lives. MAIN COMMITTEE In that respect, I feel concern about the danger that is being created for the future years of our community under this government. I feel that, in this context of a nanny state, in the last three years we have seen, arguably, the greatest growth of government in our lives, probably including the Whitlam years. Using the excuse, in many respects, of combating the global financial crisis and now of needing the cooperation of the Greens, the Rudd-Gillard-Brown governments have taken every opportunity to impose their will on our lives. We are the only country in the world that re-regulated the labour market during the global financial crisis. We are the only country in the world that I know of that is renationalising its telecommunications sector. We are the only country in the world that sought to bring in the most bureaucratic, most taxing-$114 billion in the next 10 years-and most invasive emissions trading scheme imaginable. We were looking to auction 70 per cent of permits from day one; in Europe, they auction four per cent, and in Europe it is just a pilot compared to what was proposed here. And we were going to lead the world! Of course, now the US have said they will not be bringing in such a scheme. How stupid would we have looked last year if we had, lemming like, followed the Prime Minister of the day into that most invasive, bureaucratic and difficult scheme. In the last three years, we have seen the government seek to undermine and ultimately get rid of private health insurance. We have seen them seek to get rid of employee share ownership. We saw them seek to set up a government bank while systematically removing 25 years of building up competition-25 years of competition in the finance sector all gone because they botched the introduction and the use of the wholesale and the deposit guarantees. Now the government are trying to back-pedal and find some way to improve competition at the margin. When the Treasurer agreed to the merger of St George Bank, what a folly that was. He also agreed to the merger of other banks and agreed to the disassembling of trust funds that in some cases had been there for 50 years. We have seen the attempt to control the internet with filtering. We have seen the mining tax, with an attempt to introduce nationalisation of 40 per cent of the mining industry. When you think about it, it beggars belief. But that was what was on the table-all rush, all without consultation, all for political motives, all through instinct, because they think government know best. Tax, spend and borrow is the instinct to solve a problem. Of course, paying back $90 billion in debt, with tax increases for many years to come, again reduces choices. It is a bad government; it is a dangerous government. Notwithstanding the disappointment of losing the election, we as an opposition need to very assiduously keep this government to account so that we can in fact be successful at the next election and try our best to reverse much of the damage done, the incursion and the introduction of the nanny state, writ large, over the last three years. On the local front, in my electorate we saw a similarly disciplined and effective campaign to the one run nationally, which produced a swing of almost half a per cent against us, compared to the disappointing statewide swing of almost one per cent against us. In general, the result in Victoria was disappointing and we need to take stock. But the future is bright. We have introduced very significant changes in the way in which candidates are preselected in Victoria. This time it threw up a most outstanding field of candidates. Many of them were successful, as many others have been in the last election or two. In Victoria and around the country we really do have reason to be very confident over the next 15 or 20 years about the MAIN COMMITTEE skill that is now available at a young level. Some people need more time in the paddock, but they will be the future leaders of our party and the country. I think those who support our side of politics have every reason to be enormously confident in the capacity of the coalition to strongly lead this country for a long time to come. We have a good mix, as I say, of experience and youth. Again, we have to use this three years in opposition to keep the government to account and to give the talent that is coming through every opportunity to gain the experience so that we can have a very powerful influence over the politics of Australia in the years ahead. As always in my electorate we have a very highly experienced and committed team of party members. I have almost 700 members of the Liberal Party in my electorate. I have had wonderful leadership, in Jeannette Rawlinson, of each campaign for the three elections that I have contested. She is a person of great experience and a good friend. She has served the party with great skill and certainly supported me. The leadership was even more important this time round, as I had other significant responsibilities at our campaign headquarters. I needed to have the organisation very well finetuned so that I could spend what time. I had most effectively in my own electorate and not have to worry about any of the logistical matters. I have never had to do so in the three campaigns that I have contested. Our campaign saw over 500 Liberal volunteers, helping with prepoll and mobile booths, providing office assistance, doing street walks et cetera. I would like to sincerely thank those 500-plus volunteers and take this opportunity to mention very briefly a number of them, most of whom have helped me not only in the last 12 months and during this campaign but also over the six years that I have had the great privilege of representing all of those people who live in the electorate of Goldstein. Jeannette Rawlinson, who I mentioned, was my campaign manager. Kaye Farrow, who has been our FEC chair now for three years, did another outstanding job as deputy campaign manager but also took so many other responsibilities. Ralph Wollmer, Ramon Frederico, Colin Gourley, Terry Farrow, Brett Hogan, Leonie Abbott, Fazal Cader, Andrew Hudgson, Andrew Tame, Lee Trevena, Mike Rawlinson, Hanife Bushby, Tim Wildash, Tammy van Wisse, Kim Dunstan-all of those people and many more provided great assistance. I wish I had time to go through some of the things that they turned their hand to. It had been in some cases many months in getting properly organised. It really did run as a very smoothly oiled machine. My staff have been exceptional. Many other members are similarly blessed but in my case Vanessa Kimpton, my PA, is a wonderful person and highly skilled and a great office manager and PA for me. Nick Troja and Cameron Hill are fellows of great skill and commitment and a pleasure to work with. Within my electorate office Skye Buttenshaw and Samantha Russell have been so well-regarded by all of those who have the need to contact my office. I am very blessed with the campaign staff and the office staff I have got. Young Scott McCloud has served me very well as a part-time member of our team while he completed his university studies. Finally on that front, I mention my wife and three children. Maureen is long-suffering not only with this responsibility but many before it, having flown over 2,500 return domestic flights in the last 30 years in different jobs. I think it probably is the best way of explaining the load that my wonderful wife has carried, with our three kids, Tom, Joe and Philippa. This time. I have the great pleasure of my son Joe, who was in the campaign headquarters looking MAIN COMMITTEE after social media, which he has had a strong background in. SoI not only had the pleasure of his company but also was brought up to speed on my social media skills at the same time. That was an added bonus for this campaign. I would like to finish on a couple of other points. Firstly, I would like to take the opportunity to announce the winner of my annual Christmas card design competition. Lachlan Williams from Larmenier, an outstanding school in Hampton in my electorate, is this year’s winner with a bright and happy drawing of Jesus in the manger complete with Christmas star and approving animals. Each year I have a competition with different organisations dealing with disadvantaged or disabled people, young people usually but not always. Lachlan Williams’ piece of art will feature on the front cover of thousands of Christmas cards, with an inside picture of him, my wife, Maureen, and me. It is a truly outstanding school located in Bluff Road in Hampton in my electorate. It is run by the Catholic primary schools and families within the Archdiocese of Melbourne, dealing with students displaying social and emotional and behavioural difficulties which may contribute to learning difficulties. They take these young people in, they go one or two days a week or perhaps full-time, and then they integrate them back into the schools whence they have come. The dedication, the patience and the faith in every human being that is displayed by the principal, Patrice Duggan, and her staff are things I am totally in awe of. They are wonderful people, highly skilled, who do an outstanding job. I have seen so many young people come from all parts of Melbourne and go to that school, and it might take 18 months or two years but it has had an enormous effect on their quality of life and future. We all owe them a great debt of gratitude for what they do in a selfless way for our community, but in this case it covers all of Melbourne. Finally, in the short time. I have left, I would like to acknowledge and thank so many people on both sides of the House. I have had a depressive condition in the mornings which I had never confronted-and I have had it all my life. I had never admitted to it. It used to lift at eight o’clock but in the last few years went on to nine o’clock, 10 o’clock or 12 o’clock. I was finally forced, for certain reasons, to confront it. I thought it might mean that my political career had come to an end, but that was not the case. I have had thousands of emails from people which have been an enormous source of encouragement. There is still a strong stigma, which probably explains why mental health is still the poor relation amongst health services. But, as I said, I would like to thank everyone on both sides of the House for the way in which they have given me encouragement. Fortunately, in my case, after six months of experimentation and lots of uncomfortable side effects, I have found something that helps, and for the last five months I have had mornings that I have never had in my life. I have never been better. I am looking to demonstrate to millions of others that you can have this sort of condition. It is just like another illness. Not in all cases but in many, many cases you can deal with it effectively, get on with life, stay in the same profession and hopefully even do better in the same profession. So thank you to everybody on that front. It has been an interesting phase of my life. I am now looking to move to the next. for Goldstein on looking so well. I look forward to working against him, and sometimes with him, over the next three years. I would also like to take the opportunity to thank all of the people who worked on Labor’s election campaign in Bendigo, in particular our campaign diMAIN COMMITTEE",276,Governor General S Speech
329,Mr Gibbons (Bendigo) (5.16 Pm),"First of all, I would like to congratulate the memberrector, Bill Murray; our dedicated and hard working staff; the many hundreds of volunteers; and, of course, my ever supportive wife, who has been a constant source of strength to me for the past 33 years. Through their efforts we were able to record a modest swing in Labor’s favour-one that was against the trend across the country. Elections are an important part of life in our democracy and they provide both politicians and voters alike with an opportunity to evaluate the past term of the government and the alternatives that are on offer for the term ahead. This was the first occasion during my time as the member for Bendigo that I was campaigning for the re-election of a Labor government, and I certainly took time to reflect on what had been achieved over the previous three years for the people of central Victoria. That local record needs to be seen in the context of a global financial crisis that threatened to bring down the world banking system, with dire consequences for millions of people. When the action taken to avoid a crisis proves to be effective, it is all too easy to forget how real the threat was at the time. I am reminded of how, now and again, we hear commentators claiming that the Y2K bug was a huge beat-up or some worldwide conspiracy to spend hundreds of millions of dollars unnecessarily on upgrading computer systems. But those involved assure me that that was not the case. Without appropriate remedial action, many computer systems would have stopped working, building control systems would have failed, businesses and government would have been severely disrupted and many lives would have been put at risk. But, through some good planning, effective management and a lot of hard work by a lot of people-and a modicum of good luck-serious disruption was avoided. Here in Australia we appear to be witnessing a similar loss of memory about the global financial crisis. It is all too easy to think that there was no crisis in the world financial markets in 2008 and that the threat to the world’s economy is now over. There is a great temptation to think that talk of the world’s worse global recession since the 1930s is just scaremongering by politicians or more sensationalism by the popular media. But you only have to read the international pages of the newspapers to realise that much of the world is still in deep economic trouble. Europe is in the midst of a sovereign debt crisis, with the problems spreading beyond those that surfaced in Greece earlier this year. Contagion remains a real risk across euro countries as weaker economies drag down stronger ones. Indeed, European Union President Herman Van Rompuy called it a ‘survival crisis’. The bailout of Ireland’s banks may cost Irish taxpayers as much as 75 billion. The Irish government is reportedly in talks with European International Monetary Fund officials about emergency funding to avoid defaulting on repayments. Portugal and Spain are also in trouble, with significant budget deficits. Like their Irish counterparts, Portugal’s banks are being kept afloat by cheap credit from the European Central Bank and the Spanish banks are plagued by the highest level of distressed loans since 1996. Growth in the United States is expected to slacken, consumer spending is expected to remain weak and jobs growth is likely to remain slow. The Japanese economic outlook is also weak. So there can be no doubt that the economic crisis outside Australia is very real and very much still a threat. Equally, there can be no doubt that it was the early and decisive action taken by the federal Labor government in 2008 that mitigated the worse effects of the crisis here. As the OECD said in its economic survey on Australia that was released just recently: MAIN COMMITTEE The fiscal stimulus was implemented rapidly and targeted to credit constrained households and public investment. It proved highly effective, with a sizable impact on output and confidence … Of course, this is just the latest in a long line of endorsements of the actions taken by the Labor government. During an economic downturn, the private sector reins in its spending, cuts costs, lays off workers and waits for the economy to pick up again. When people are thrown out of work, not only is there a lot of personal stress involved but those people do not have as much money to spend and so the economy slows down even more, going into a vicious downward spiral. It was the unwillingness of governments to take effective action that contributed to the severity of the Great Depression in the 1930s. We now know that, by increasing investment in spending to fill the gap left by the private sector, governments can stimulate domestic economic activity, keeping firms in business and people in employment. This is exactly what the federal Labor government did and the results are clear to see: Australia has the lowest debt and deficit of all major advanced economies, we have the lowest unemployment rate of all major advanced economies and Australia was the only major advanced economy to avoid recession. The impact on my electorate of Bendigo has been dramatic. Schools, from both the public and private sectors, have received much needed investment in classrooms, trade training centres and other facilities. There has been investment in local community assets and infrastructure that will be of benefit for many years to come. Local businesses have been kept busy with new work that has enabled them to retain staff and, in many cases, create new jobs. In the city of Greater Bendigo alone, independent economic modelling commissioned by the city council showed Bendigo’s economy has grown by 27 per cent in the three years since the election of the federal Labor government. Following more than a decade of drought, it is very pleasing to see the city doing so well as a result of the hard work and enterprise of local business, supported by the economic policies of the Labor government. Labor’s economic stimulus has contributed much of the $390 million of federal government investment to the Bendigo electorate since 2007. The effects of this spending can be clearly seen in the local construction sector whose output grew more than 46 per cent between November 2007 and May 2010 to $1.2 billion. There were 600 more jobs in the sector than three years ago-an increase of more than one-third. Some other key findings in the report are that output from property and business services grew by 23.3 per cent to $886 million and mining output grew by 54.3 per cent to $616 million. And, of course, keeping businesses working and employing staff means that more money is spent in local shops than would otherwise be the case. This has helped Bendigo’s retail sector to remain the biggest local employer with an 8.6 per cent increase in jobs-an impressive result given the economic conditions. This is the story of the Labor government’s stimulus spending in just one electorate, and I am very sure that this has been repeated across the country. As a member representing a regional constituency, I am particularly pleased that regional Australia has not been forgotten by the government and will benefit from these significant investments in the future. But, instead of celebrating the success of a stimulus package that the OECD says is ‘among the most effective in the OECD’, the parties opposite-and their public relations spokesmen MAIN COMMITTEE and women in the Murdoch press -have run a scare campaign about the very few projects such as some in the Building the Education Revolution program that have experienced problems. The objectives of the BER program are twofold: first, to provide economic stimulus through the rapid construction and refurbishment of school infrastructure; and, second, to build better learning environments for our children. In order for these measures to have the desired stimulus effect on the economy, they needed to be implemented expeditiously. This has been recognised by both the Australian National Audit Office and the OECD in separate reports. In an audit report of May this year, the ANAO concluded: There are some positive early indicators that the program is making progress toward achieving its intended outcomes. It recognised: … many of the issues arising were a function of the compressed timetable for the establishment of the program, given the prevailing economic downturn. Mr Brad Orgill, the chairman of the BER Implementation Taskforce, told a Senate hearing earlier this month that the program was effective as a stimulatory measure. He said: There is no evidence to say that value for money has not been achieved. So two independent reports have found the BER to be effective and to provide value for money, despite the accusations from the opposition that the government had been inefficient in managing the program. Let us now turn back the clock to another ANAO audit report. This one is from November 2007 and concerns the former Howard government’s notorious Regional Partnerships program. Between 2003 and 2007, the former coalition government allocated more than $409 million through this program. The ANAO found that the Regional Partnerships Program: … had fallen short of an acceptable standard of public administration, particularly in respect to the assessment of grant applications and the management of Funding Agreements. Furthermore, it concluded that during the first three years of funding: … departures from the published guidance were a feature of the Programme. This: … resulted in funding being approved for projects that have either not proceeded as planned or which did not result inany community benefits. The Regional Partnerships program was not conceived in haste or in response to a global financial crisis. It was not necessary for these grants to be made expeditiously to stimulate the economy. There was simply no excuse for this gross mismanagement of taxpayers’ funds by the Liberal and National parties. Yet they now have the audacity to accuse the present Labor government of mismanaging parts of its economic stimulus programa program that, I remind the House, was just recently praised by the OECD as containing many timely, targeted and temporary measures to boost consumption and investment and help to avoid a recession. The hypocrisy from those opposite is once again astounding. As we learn from the recent Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook, Labor’s sound economic management is continuing to deliver strong economic growth. Strong job creation and falling unemployment are expected to continue. As the remarkable economic performance of MAIN COMMITTEE our major trading partners in Asia continues, our economy is expected to grow at an aboveaverage rate over the next two years, with real GDP forecast to increase by 3¼ per cent in 2010-11 and 3¾ per cent in 2011-12. The unemployment rate is forecast to fall to 4.75 per cent by the June quarter of 2011 and 4.5 per cent by the June quarter of 2012, returning to levels that we last saw before the global financial crisis. Inflation is forecast to be 2.75 per cent in the year to June 2011 and three per cent through the year to June 2012. One of the highlights of the latest MYEFO is a forecast of an additional 380,000 jobs over the next 18 months or so. On top of the 650,000 jobs that have been created since Labor came to government, this means there will be about one million more Australians in work than when we were first elected in 2007. That is an extraordinary achievement when you consider what is going on in other major economies. As the OECD commented recently, the Labor government’s economic stimulus package was ‘wisely accompanied by a well-designed fiscal exit strategy’. Under this strategy, the federal budget is expected to return to surplus in 2012-13. At this time, the major advanced economies are forecast to still be in deficit by an average of six per cent of gross domestic product. Of course, the members opposite continue their scaremongering about the level of Australia’s public debt, even though this is expected to peak at just 6.4 per cent of GDP in 2011-12. This will leave Australia in a substantially stronger fiscal position than any of the major advanced economies. According to the MYEFO, net debt in the major advanced economies is expected to reach an average of 90 per cent of GDP by 2015, some 14 times higher than the expected peak in Australia’s net debt. And, of course, the money borrowed by the federal government has been spent on renewing vital infrastructure and other stimulus measures. The government was faced with a choice when the global financial crisis hit. It could borrow nothing and let hundreds of businesses go to the wall and thousands of people lose their jobs or it could borrow moderately and responsibly and support Australian businesses and workers by investing in long-term infrastructure. This Labor government chose to borrow and invest, and without this decisive action thousands of Australian jobs would have been lost. The opposition continues to make out that Australia has a runaway debt problem, but how much you can borrow responsibly depends on how much you earn and your ability to pay the interest and repay the loan, just like when you take out a mortgage to buy your own home. Australia has borrowed a very small amount compared to its annual income, currently about six per cent. That is equivalent to somebody earning, say, $50,000 a year going to the bank and taking out a loan of $3,000. No-one could suggest that they could not easily afford to pay the interest and repay the loan. Australia is in a similar situation. The federal government is borrowing affordable amounts of money to invest in long-term infrastructure and can easily afford to pay the interest from its current income. In comparison, some major economies such as the United States and the United Kingdom are borrowing 60 to 70 per cent of their annual incomes, and Japan is borrowing even more. If there were any concern about Australia’s level of debt, our credit rating would have been downgraded like that of Greece. That has not happened, and Australia is still rated as a AAA credit risk. That is one reason why the Nobel-prize-winning economist Professor Joseph Stiglitz described the government’s economic stimulus package as ‘one of the best-designed of all the advanced industrial countries’. MAIN COMMITTEE As far as the opposition’s credibility on economic matters is concerned, we only have to take a look at their record. First, they voted against Labor’s stimulus package and would have sent our economy into a downward spiral of lower incomes, lost jobs and reduced services. Second, the Leader of the Opposition and his economic team have been forecasting doom and gloom for almost two years. In February 2009, the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Abbott, said: ‘I think what we’re going to get is a massive debt and deep recession.’ The following month, former shadow finance minister Senator Joyce said: … we’re heading towards a recession … And in April 2009 the member for Goldstein, the previous speaker, an aspiring deputy leader and shadow Treasurer, predicted: The recession will be deeper and longer because of the [Government’s] misguided spending … Of course, we all know that Australia was in fact the only advanced economy to avoid a recession. With a track record of forecasts like that, it is clear that no-one should take seriously anything the opposition say about economic matters. But, as the Labor government is one of the few governments to have successfully navigated through the biggest economic crisis since the 1930s, Australians can justifiably have confidence in Labor’s economic management and ability. In the last few days, our plans for fiscal consolidation have received a big tick from the OECD. It recognised that our economy has been one of the most resilient among OECD members, that our future prospects remain very favourable and that our growth potential is among the strongest in the OECD. The OECD said Labor’s response to the global crisis proved highly effective in supporting confidence and activity in our economy, which helped keep Australia out of recession. In the same week that the government released the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook, it endorsed Labor’s disciplined fiscal strategy, saying: The prudent fiscal consolidation strategy reinforces Australia’s commitment to sound public finances, the maintenance of which is one of the major lessons from the international economic crisis. It is clear that the Labor government’s economic management since coming to office has been among the best in the world. The policies it has pursued, including taking early and decisive action in the early days of the global financial crisis, have been endorsed by the OECD, the International Monetary Fund and many of the world’s leading economists. As I have outlined, these policies have had a marked impact in my electorate. Economic activity has been increased, local businesses have been kept working, local jobs have been supported and there has been major investment in the region’s economic and community infrastructure. I now look forward to serving the people of central Victoria during the second term of the Labor government and building on what has been a commendable record of achievement during difficult economic circumstances. Bendigo’s speech, and I have only two questions for him. The first one is: if the current government did such a wonderful job preventing the Australian economy going into recession by introducing a stimulus, why are they still running the stimulus two years after the recession? look to me like easing. The second question I have for the member for Bendigo is: if they did MAIN COMMITTEE",280,Governor General S Speech

332,Mr Ian Macfarlane,"I see. The money that is being spent about the place does notsuch a fantastic job, why did they stab the Prime Minister in the back in the middle of the night after the now Prime Minister admitted that the Labor Party had lost its way? Mr Deputy Speaker, I actually rise to speak of far more positive things. CanI first say that I am deeply humbled by the people of Groom to be re-elected as their member for what will now be my fifth term. I am particularly humbled by the fact that the margin by which I was elected virtually doubled. That was in no small part due to the efforts of my campaign committee. I wish to put them on the record and thank them, particularly Dave Nichols, who as my campaign manager did a fantastic job; Dylls Kelly and the rest of the Liberal-National Party in the electorate of Groom; and, particularly, the Young Liberal-National Party, which really showed the power and future potential of the Liberal-National Party in Queensland. While speaking of the LNP I should also mention Bruce McIvor and Michael O’Dwyer for the leadership that they provided and, of course, James McGrath, the campaign director, who did such a fantastic job in Queensland and saw Queensland deliver 21 seats to this federal parliament, which is now the largest coalition division in Australia. Of course, none of that would have been possible without the efforts of Brian Loughnane, the federal director, who ran an exemplary campaign and, were it not for some things which we will not dwell on in relation to decisions by Independents, would have delivered Tony Abbott to government. There is no doubt about one fact, and that is that, for the first time for almost half a century, a first-term government, a Labor government, has been robbed of its majority in the House of Representatives. It is almost three months since the federal election. Some may feel that it is not that long. Others, for their own reasons, may feel that it has been an eternity, and part of that is that all we are seeing from this government is more of the same-more talk, more rhetoric, the same non-delivery, no reform agenda. It is obviously a government that, to use the Prime Minister’s words, has ‘lost its way’, and this has flowed through to the confidence of the people, particularly those in my electorate of Groom, where the level of apathy from the Rudd-Gillard government is seen as simple fact: for this current government, regional Australia does not exist. The coalition took a very positive plan for regional Australia to the last election and we looked forward to delivering on that plan had we been elected. In my electorate particularly, the Labor Party failed to make one election promise-not one piece of infrastructure, not one suggested way of improving the lot of regional Australians, many of whom they hope to tax to the absolute limit with their new mining tax. Not one positive piece of news was delivered in the five weeks of the campaign. There is nothing there that would give the people of Groom and the people of regional Australia any hope that this government under the current Prime Minister will deliver them anything. At the top of the list of things that need to be delivered is the Toowoomba Range crossing. It is a key part of South-East Queensland’s transport infrastructure, a road that currently channels trucks into the main street of Toowoomba at the rate of about 5,000 a day. These are not delivery vans. They are B-doubles carrying all sorts of cargo in both directions, which is crucially important for the economic development of Queensland. When they travel through the main street of Toowoomba, they intermingle with the everyday traffic of a bustling, growing city and, as such, pose a real problem. We need to see the range crossing built. The Howard government committed $700 million to begin construction of that road. Unfortunately we lost the election and that promise was not MAIN COMMITTEE able to be delivered. However, the Abbott led coalition renewed that promise and, had we been elected in the election in August, that road would already be on the drawing board being prepared for construction. The Toowoomba Range crossing highlights the appalling record in regional Australia and it makes a mockery of Labor’s claims about nation building. Building school halls is well and good, and I note that in my electorate particularly the ones built by private schools and church schools have been good projects, but it is important to contrast them with those managed by the Queensland state Labor government. They are appalling examples of waste and mismanagement, inappropriate buildings being built that the schools did not need and did not want, buildings that are not air-conditioned, where there appear to be unreasonable margins being afforded to the contractors involved. Those sorts of buildings are not infrastructure that is going to earn this country the dollars it needs to pay off the massive debt which the member for Bendigo may have only lightly touched on, a massive debt that is growing daily. In fact, in September the deficit run by this government was almost $14 billion. Not only do the government have to borrow, under normal circumstances, $100 million a day, but in the month of September they had to borrow $400 million a day to feed their spending habit. We need infrastructure that is going to grow this country, that is going to deliver to the people of Australia not only the goods and services that they need but also the economic growth and economic wealth that they need. It is not just the Toowoomba Range crossing; it is the whole road network west of Brisbane. The member for Blair let the cat out of the bag when he admitted that no money had been spent on the Warrego Highway west of Ipswich since this government had been elected. That is the case. It has been estimated by the Queensland government that $200 million needs to be spent on the section between Helidon and the base of the Toowoomba Range at Withcott alone. I am sure that if the member for Maranoa were here he could take you, Mr Deputy Speaker, through the needs of the Warrego Highway in his electorate, which is significantly more vast than mine. It is not only infrastructure that we need. The coalition promised to deliver to Toowoomba a PET scanner to improve cancer care in that city. Toowoomba benefited from a Howard government program where I delivered $8.6 million to St Andrew’s Hospital in Toowoomba. I was there just on Friday of last week, both for personal reasons-to have my annual check-up with my radiologist, as you do-and to have a quick look at the expansion of that facility which is now taking place. That facility will not be complete without the ability to provide a PET scan to cancer sufferers. The provision of that scanner is important in terms of saving people, when they are at a difficult point in their lives, the difficult and arduous journey to Brisbane for that sort of treatment. Just because you live in a regional area does not mean that you should go without in any way, and the provision of basic health services is something that I will be continuing to work on through the next three years of this government. I hope at some point that this current Prime Minister realises that there is a whole world outside the capital cities and that she devotes some of her time to ensuring that the infrastructure and health and service needs of those areas are met. I have in my electorate two very significant defence bases. No-one is prouder than I am of the defence forces. They have done a fantastic job for Australia and continue to do so. I have men and women from my electorate who are currently serving in conflicts, in Afghanistan in MAIN COMMITTEE particular. It is unfair to them not to receive an assurance from this government that Borneo Barracks will remain open. I fear that at some point the government will close that facility. I dread to think that that may then be used at some point to house what is a completely uncontrollable expansion in the number of illegal immigrants coming to Australia because of the inaction of this government. We have seen that occur in other parts of Australia. Disused military facilities have been used to house the uncontrolled immigration that we now have in Australia. I hope that is not the case and I call on the Gillard government to make it clear to the people of Groom and to the service men and women of Cabarlah that their base’s future is certain. Certainly under an Abbott government, the future of that base is absolutely assured. Groom, apart from probably being the best electorate in Australia, is of course at the very top of the Murray-Darling system. What happens in the Murray-Darling is as much of interest to us as it is to the people of Adelaide. The coalition is committed to restoring a healthy river system while retaining the robust rural communities and the productive agricultural sector that have been the backbone of regional Australia, in fact the whole of Australia, not only through my lifetime but through the life of modern settlement in this great nation. The coalition will stand up for regional Australia. We will ensure that any changes to allocations are done with full consideration of the socioeconomic impacts of taking water out of communities that rely on that water, not only for their current livelihoods but for their future livelihoods. You cannot take a thousand gigalitres out of a system and not affect the economic income of the region. Already we are seeing cotton gins and rice mills lie idle. The potential of this government to destroy the heart and soul of rural communities along the Murray-Darling is real. I want to assure them that, just as I will in my own electorate, I will stand up for them right across the length and breadth of the Murray-Darling. CanI also say that education is an important area, and the changes that we have seen to the youth allowance under the Rudd and Gillard governments are robbing people of the confidence that this government cares at all about those who live outside capital cities. It is important that all people have the ability to receive a good education, which is a pathway to young people having a solid, sound future, but also a pathway to Australia’s future economic growth. The current restrictions in place, particularly in terms of work requirements, are unfair to rural people. Again, the coalition will be doing everything we can in this area whilst in opposition and will certainly be fixing the problem when we get back into government. I am going to use the remaining portion of my speech to talk about my portfolio interests. In my time. I have been a minister for resources and energy, and I currently hold that shadow ministry. AlthoughI see many perplexing things in my life, I have never seen anything so perplexing as the approach of this government towards energy and resources. It is simply amazing that the member for Bendigo and no doubt others, including the member for Corangamite, think that their government single-handedly saved Australia from the recession that the rest of the world had. The reality is that a major part of that economic recovery was down to the mining industry. The resources industry has a long and proud history, since the gold rush days, of supporting this nation’s economy. Now is no different. As we look at what is going to hold our economy and see it grow, we cannot pick up a paper anywhere and not see estimates of the investment that will go into Australia. I think the figure I saw last week was approaching $150 billion. It may have even been $160 billion. Why then would any government move to make that industry uncompetitive? MAIN COMMITTEE I have been to most countries in the world in my time as a minister, and I am amazed that this government does not realise that one of the strengths of Australia is its sovereign risk and the fact that any change in that sovereign risk profile by any government will cause investors to reconsider their investment decisions. Everything is a balance, a fine balance, and what we saw with the initial approach with the superprofits tax, the RSPT-again, another political name that sort of gives away the fact that this is more about politics than about good economic management-was that Australia’s economic and sovereign risk profile was damaged permanently by a government that did not realise that if you take away one of the cornerstones of investment in Australia then companies will simply take their copper mine to South America, their coal mine to Indonesia or their gas prospects to Africa or South-East Asia. The damage that this government has done has been appalling, but just as appalling has been the Prime Minister’s attempt to renege from the deal that she did after she became Prime Minister, where she gave a categorical assurance to the mining industry, particularly to Marius Kloppers and David Peever, in which she said that all state royalties, both current and future, would be credited against the MRRT. The attempt by the Prime Minister to renege on that deal is appalling, and I have to say that I am not surprised that Sam Walsh from Rio Tinto was moved to say that classic quote: If you can’t trust government, who can you trust? I say to the Gillard government that they need to prove that they are up to it. They need to prove that their word actually means something and they need to stand by that commitment. The coalition will remove the MRRT, if we are returned to government, because it is a bad tax. The minerals belong to the people of each state and it is up to that state to decide what those minerals are worth. What we have is a government blindly focused on spending and then taxing so they can spend again. Of course, this is not the only tax on the horizon. The far more damaging tax for all of us is, of course, the carbon tax, a tax which the Prime Minister refused to deny last week in parliament. It will increase electricity prices single-handedly by 25 per cent-that is, by 25 per cent over and above any increases that occur between now and whenever she introduces the tax. I believe that electricity prices are going to rise substantially, in part because of the mismanagement of the electricity sector by Labor state governments. Whatever happens will happen, but on top of whatever happens we are going to see households, mums and dads, who are struggling to pay electricity bills now, not being able to pay electricity prices in the future because this Gillard government is taking a deliberate decision to increase, ahead of the rest of the world, the price of electricity by 25 per cent. Families are going to get it in the neck. They are already getting it in the neck from Labor governments, with higher water prices, higher gas prices, higher electricity prices, higher registration prices and higher licence fees. Everywhere you go where there is a Labor government, the costs of living are going up. There has to be some sanity brought into this argument. If the rest of the world is stepping back from an aggressive approach to dealing with the price of carbon, Australia should do the same. It will not just be the families who get hurt; it will be the industries and the jobs that rely on those industries. It will be things like the LNG industry, which is an industry that can actually lower emissions, that are going to pay the price for this government’s poor management and complete fixation on spending and then taxing. MAIN COMMITTEE me say at the outset that in a speech which is principally-at least, for my part-about giving thankyous to many people who have helped me in the last three years and, in particular in the last election, it is a great privilege to be able to make this speech in the presence of the member for Corangamite, who holds the other seat within Geelong. He and I work very closely together in representing the interests of Geelong within this place. I think we operate as a good team, and we have certainly become very good friends. I know that he has worked incredibly hard here in this building over the last three years in representing the interests of the constituents of Corangamite, and that of course was very deservedly rewarded by his re-election to this place. The 2010 election was a gruelling election, for many reasons. I suspect the member for Corangamite will feel that more than I do. One way in which the election was particularly gruelling was by virtue of the weather, it being a winter election. SoI would like to start by thanking everybody in every party who participated in this election-those who handed out pamphlets on that cold day, those who got up early to go to train stations in the morning and those who letter-boxed into the evening-because, no matter which party they did so on behalf of, they deserve the thanks of the Australian people. Engaging in the act of democracy is a hard thing to do. It is particularly hard to do it in the middle of August. I would like to thank the officials of the Australian Electoral Commission for what they did during the election. I would particularly like to thank the parents and friends of the Clifton Springs Primary School who, on the afternoon of election day, were conducting a sausage sizzle from a caravan which had one of those flaps which came up to provide some form of shelter. As a storm came through, their generosity of spirit meant that in a very bipartisan way ‘hander-outers’ from every colour and persuasion of the political spectrum were huddled under that veranda and that prevented us all from being soaked, so I thank them. The election ventilated a number of local issues in Geelong-the future of Avalon Airport and the extension of the dual carriageway on the Princes Highway towards Colac-and there was debate around some local priority projects such as the library and Skilled Stadium. There are two observations that I would like to make about the local election debate. The first, as I have mentioned, is that there are two electorates in Geelong. There is the electorate of Corio, which has been held by the Labor Party since 1967, and the electorate of Corangamite, which, I think I am right in saying, at this election returned the closest result of any electorate in the country. Naturally, in that context, the local media focused very much on the electorate of Corangamite, as it should and as we expect it to do. But it is important to note that, since 2007, much work has been done by this government in the electorate of Corio. Indeed $163 million has been spent in the Corio electorate on things such as education, health, industry, development, transport infrastructure-I could go on. It is important that, whilst media attention is going to be on the more marginal electorate, the work that has been done in the other electorate should not be forgotten. It is all too easy for the local media to come out with a line that nothing happens in the north because it is not a marginal seat. Of course, nothing could be further from the truth. The second observation that I would like to make is the differing attitudes that were taken by the two main contestants in this election-the coalition and the Labor Party-when it came to local promises around particular local priorities. I am referring to the development of MAIN COMMITTEE",285,Governor General S Speech
333,Mr Marles (Corio,"Parliamentary Secretary for Pacific Island Affairs) (5.54 pm)-LetSkilled Stadium and the development of the Geelong Library, in particular. The Labor Party certainly made no commitment to the future funding of either of those projects. On the face of it, the opposition appeared to make a commitment in relation to both of them. Of course, that commitment formed part of a raft of commitments that were made across the country, which were unfunded. We now know there was an $11 billion black hole in the costings across the country. Funding for the local projects was spread out over a very long period of time, a fair part of those funds not being accounted for within the forward estimates. I think it is fair to say in hindsight that had the opposition formed government after the election there would have been a very real doubt as to whether or not those commitments would ultimately have been delivered. From our point of view, as the Prime Minister said, we did go into this election saying that every dollar committed through an election commitment in the lead-up to the election would be met by an equivalent dollar in savings. That was the right thing to do. The fact that we did not make a commitment in that context to these two projects does not mean that they were not worthy; nor does it mean that they never, ever will come to fruition. But it does pay to remember that projects of this kind have no right to public expenditure on them; that, in the aftermath of the global financial crisis, after the necessary spending in the form of the stimulus, it is important to get the budget back into the black, and so we do live in a time of restraint; and that locally we were living the commitment that was made by the Prime Minister nationally. The proponents of these projects will continue to argue for them, as of course they should, as it is important for them to do because they are worthy projects. While there can be no guarantee that they will be funded until a decision is ultimately made about them, what can be guaranteed is that no funding will ever come forth without the very good advocacy which is being mounted on their behalf. In relation to the national issues that were ventilated during the election-along with, I think, a desire to see at last a national health system across our country and to make sure that Work Choices never returns to Australian workplaces-in my view the economy formed the key issue. That the Labor government were able to save 200,000 jobs through the way in which the economy was managed during the global financial crisis is an incredible achievement. It averts a negative legacy which would have lasted for generations in our community. There were two particular local announcements-one by Ford at the end of 2008 to reverse a previous decision to close its engine plant and the other by Viridian glass to merge with MHG glass and overturn a decision to close its automotive glass plant-which were both very important in terms of keeping morale going during what was expected to be a very difficult year indeed in 2009. The Building the Education Revolution was a very important initiative during the last term of government which of course continues today and, I think, did play out during the election. In the electorate of Corio, $114 million has been spent. I have opened the wonderful, state-of the-art Katsumata Centre at Kardinia International College which on one day can be set up, as I saw it, as a scene from the French Revolution-I was there on the night of the school production of Les Miserables-and the next day can be converted into a basketball court. I have opened the multipurpose assembly area at the North Shore Primary School which has revolutionised the way in which activities are conducted at that school but has also helped engage that school with the community, as more community groups are able to use it. At St Francis MAIN COMMITTEE Xavier’s School, a primary school, we now see modern classrooms which provide cuttingedge pedagogy for that school, as it should, in that part of Geelong. In addition, Diversitat, which is a community organisation that runs vocational education and training, now has a state-of-the-art media training centre in the heart of Geelong. This is a magnificent legacy for the youth of Geelong which will be experienced by young people in our city for decades to come, and it is the result of the Building the Education Revolution program. I do not think that that was lost on the voters of Geelong, not for a minute, when they came to express their opinion on 21 August. The result in Corio was a swing to the Labor Party of 5.3 per cent, which now sees the margin in Corio at 14.2 per cent, which I think I am right in saying is the largest margin that has ever been returned in Corio. That is far from being my result; it is the result of so many people whom I would like to thank on this occasion: Roger Lowrey, my campaign director, of course; and the many people in my office, who do a wonderful job of representing and supporting me in the work that I have done to date as the member for Corio and previously as the Parliamentary Secretary for Innovation and Industry-Geraldine Eren, Grant Dew, Chris Balaam, Hayley Harrison, Ella George, Pauline Braniff, Saverina Chirumbolo and Karyn Murray, who is based here in Canberra, as well as Russell Menzies and Mark Donohue, who both worked in my office in the last three years. The state MPs who are going through their own trial of fire at the moment have also given me great support over the last three years: John Eren, Michael Crutchfield and Lisa Neville, along with Ian Trezise and Gayle Tierney. There are many who worked on the campaign in Corio, and I would like to mention Cameron Granger, David Saunderson, Lou Brazier, Rod MacDonald, Chris Kelly, Vlad Selakovic, Leonie Sheedy, Tony Beck, Nandi Young, Peter Symons and Peter McMullen. I am blessed to have a number of friends from my days at school who retain a friendship with me and who have known me now for most of my life. We are in a sense the witnesses to each other’s lives, and that is a wonderful thing indeed. It was great to me that Ninian Lewis, Peter Little and William Reeves could be with me and help on election day, and I know that Darren Fox was there in spirit. My sisters, Vic Marles, Jen Green and Liz Marles, were all there helping out on election day, along with my parents, Fay and Don Marles. Also, from my own family, my son, Sam, who is now 14, handed out at his first election with his cousin, Alex. My eldest daughter, Bella, who showed an unhealthy interest in campaigning at street stalls at the very tender age of six, my son, Harvey, and daughter, Georgia, are all incredibly tolerant of what I do and provide me with enormous love. I am a very lucky man indeed having them as my children. Of course, the person I would like to thank the most and to whom I am in the greatest debt is my wife, Rachel Schutze, who allows me to do what I do and provides me with enormous support in doing it, and much love along the way. I thank you, Rachel, for being with me every step along the way. There are a number in the civic leadership of GeelongI would also like to mention in this speech, certainly not in the context of supporting my campaign because they of course stood aside from politics and act very much in a bipartisan way. I have worked closely with them, as the civic leadership of Geelong, over the last three years and I think they have made my life a lot easier. From the City of Greater Geelong: Mayor John Mitchell and the previous mayor, Bruce Harwood; CEO Steve Griffin and, before him, Kay Rundle. From the Committee for MAIN COMMITTEE Geelong: the CEO, Peter Dorling; the chair, Michael Betts and, prior to Michael, Jim Cousins. From G21: the chair, Ed Coppe; CEO Elaine Carbines and, before her, Andrew Scott. From the Geelong Football Club, an important institution in Geelong: the President, Frank Costa, who finishes at the end of this year, and Brian Cook. From Deakin University: ViceChancellor Jane den Hollander and, prior to Jane, Sally Walker. When I look at that group of people I know that Geelong is in very good hands indeed. They do make my life easier because from them emanates a power of ideas. For the most part they are very coordinated in the way they articulate the priorities for the Geelong region and they do make a real difference. They have provided me with great friendship over the last three years and I thank them for it. Many of them are here today as part of a two-day lobbying trip to Canberra-‘Geelong meets Canberra’. It is the fifth visit of its kind in a program that began via the Committee for Geelong five years ago. They are meeting with ministers, parliamentary secretaries and, indeed, shadow ministers and members of the opposition, raising the issues that face Geelong and the challenges that are presented to Geelong, as well as making an indelible mark on this place about Geelong in the context of our nation. It is right that Geelong should be seen on the national stage as one of Australia’s leading and largest regional cities. There are lots of issues, such as the Princes Highway West and the building of the Premiership Stand at Skilled Stadium, which began in conversations on trips of this kind in the past and which, in the case of the Premiership Stand, are now a reality. It is a program which has, very importantly, helped to place Geelong on the national map. I thank them for doing that. In addition to those I have mentioned amongst the civic leadership, most of whom are here this week, I would also like to welcome to this building today Jason Trethowan, Kevin Roach, Mark Sanders, Kean Selway, Gabrielle Nagle, Mark Davis, Councillor Libby Coker, Michael King, Justin Giddings, Chris Dare, Bridget Connor, Amy Gibson, Jack Green, Bernadette Uzelac, Councillor Andy Richards, Councillor John Doull, Councillor Taanya Widdicombe, Pats Hannelore and Alli Murphy, along with Andrew Tillett and Danny Breen from the local media. Tonight we have the third annual FedCats dinner, which is a centrepiece of this trip and is there to allow those in this building and in this parliament who support the Geelong Football Club to give expression to our innermost feelings. We will have in attendance tonight the new coach of the Geelong Football Club, Chris Scott, dual premiership player, Max Rooke, Bob Gartland, a member of the board, and his wife, Phillipa. On a serious note, it is hard to overstate the significance of the Geelong Football Club to the city of Geelong. It is easily the most culturally unifying phenomenon that we have in Geelong. As we have gone through the glory days over the past few years, we have clearly seen the extent to which everyone in the City of Greater Geelong participates in the wonder which is the Geelong Football Club. We are proud and we are passionate, but aside from that emotional connection there is a strong economic side to the football club, as it brings many people to Geelong. It is also clearly, at a national level, the most recognisable Geelong brand that exists. It projects our city onto the national stage in a way that we could not hope to do without it. Finally, I mention an issue which has gained some significant coverage in the Geelong media over the past few weeks: a debate about the revitalisation of Geelong’s central business MAIN COMMITTEE district. The debate was sparked by a decision by the Kentucky Fried Chicken chain to close its store in the centre of Geelong, leaving the building it inhabited vacant. That building now joins many other shopfronts in Geelong’s CBD which are vacant. This has raised concerns amongst the people of Geelong, and these are concerns that I share. I commend the Geelong Advertiser for commencing a campaign around this issue of how we can revitalise our CBD. I have spoken about this on a number of occasions in this place. I have said that the key to being able to revitalise Geelong’s CBD is to restore the enormous heritage value which exists within the Geelong CBD. There is an incredible history within the Geelong CBD. It is perhaps the best collection of heritage buildings which sits adjacent to greater Port Phillip Bay, and there is something very special about that. We also need to see a greater use of our CBD. That is in some ways to state the obvious, but I am talking about not only the shopfronts but also the area above that-levels 1 and 2, which are largely vacant in the Geelong CBD. If we could get more life into them-if we could restore the heritage value of the CBD-we would go a long way towards revitalising the heart of Geelong. However, encouraging the use and upgrade of a private dwelling is very much the private decision of whoever owns that particular property-a decision which, of course, can be influenced by policies and initiatives of all three tiers of government, but which is at its heart a private decision. Providing encouragement and coordinating all of that become difficult issues. It is for that reason that on Monday, 6 December, I will be holding a summit on the revitalisation of Geelong’s CBD to get together all the people who can make a difference on this issue, to hear what problems exist in relation to the CBD-the problems experienced by the shop and property owners-and to get a sense of what has worked by talking to those who have restored their buildings to their former glory. There are a couple of examples of that, and those buildings look great. It would be good to hear from those owners why they restored their buildings, how much it cost and what benefit they got from undertaking that exercise. Most importantly, we need to get everyone around the table to see what solutions can be found to revitalise our CBD. It is the traditional heart of Geelong. The vital signs are still there; they need to be reinvigorated. not been seen for some 71 years-a hung parliament at the federal level. Whilst it is easy to dismiss a hung parliament for a range of reasons and issues, the truth is always compelling and always hard to dodge. The problem is that we have a government, in the form of Labor in the second term, now emasculated, through the deal with the Greens, and, through the hung parliament, relying on Independents. This is simply because the government lost its way and continues to lose its way. It executed one of the nation’s most popular prime ministers because of a series of numbers and polls. We know that the current Prime Minister exhibits worse numbers than Prime Minister Rudd had, for which he paid the price of being axed. The government lacks a compelling narrative. The government has completely lost its way. During the election the Prime Minister said that she would fix three incessant problems. Firstly, she said she would address the issue of climate change. She vowed, she promised, she stated categorically that there would be no carbon price but that a community gathering, a random choice of one person from each federal electorate, would gather together to solve the greatest moral challenge of our time. I thought we already had one person from every electorate in the nation and I thought they were elected to make decisions. The Prime Minister said MAIN COMMITTEE",290,Governor General S Speech
334,Mr Robert (Fadden) (6.14 Pm),"The end of August 2010 saw a phenomenon that hasshe would fix climate change by having no carbon price and by gathering a random selection of individuals. She said that she would fix the issue of irregular maritime arrivals by having a regional processing centre in East Timor. And, of course, she said would fix the mining tax by having a discussion, an agreement, with three out of the 3,000 mining companies. We now know, a number of months down the track, that the community gathering of individuals is a farcical idea. It was at the time and it is now. The carbon price that the Prime Minister vowed would never come in of course is now coming in. Labor may well be in government, but the unholy alliance with the Greens means that the Greens are in power. A carbon price is now centre stage. A committee now exists where, for the first time in the parliament’s history, to be a member you cannot walk in with an open mind; you must subscribe to an anthropogenic view of climate change and you must agree that a carbon price is the only way. It is an appalling way by which to construct a committee of this parliament. The mining tax has completely come apart, as the Prime Minister would appear to have gone back on her word again with respect to royalties. The regional processing centre simply goes from farce to farce. The Prime Minister is unable to explain in any detail how it would work. What is the boundary of the region from which people would go into this processing centre? Is the region made up of countries, for example? If people who are seeking refugee status enter Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, the Philippines, East Timor or Indonesia does that mean that they qualify to go to the regional processing centre? If people enter Borneo does it mean that anybody who steps foot across the border into Sabah or Sarawak, into Malaysia, can get transported to the processing centre? The Prime Minister is unable to explain how the boundaries would work. She is unable to explain the funding arrangements. She is unable to explain why she spoke to the President of East Timor rather than the Prime Minister. The East Timorese parliament will have nothing of it. It is an unmitigated and absolute disaster. Now we have a government that is struggling, in alliance with the Greens, needing Independents to continue to get legislation through and lacking any degree of spine to take reforms. The Prime Minister, at that great ‘Light on the Hill’ lecture, proudly said that she would continue to have a reform agenda, as if she had a sweeping majority in the House. The only reform that the Prime Minister could possibly comment on, when pushed, was a website. May I remind the Prime Minister that a website is not a reform; it is simply a website. The government it is now struggling across a range of issues-the carbon price that it said it would not have, the mining tax negotiated with three out of 3,000 miners that has now been reneged on, a Murray-Darling scheme that is a disaster to the point where rallies of up to 5,000 people are joining together to denounce what they see as a sell-out by this government. The number of irregular maritime arrivals-people coming on boats-this year has eclipsed 6,000. It is the highest number of people coming by boat, literally, of any government. Over 128 boats have come. Since Labor watered down the asylum seeking policy in August 2008 it has been a magnet of immense proportions that has been pulling people and drawing people to Australia. The government would have us believe that almighty push factors are continuing to draw those seeking asylum to Australia. Yet every single organisation-the United Nations, the Red Cross and the IOM-state categorically that the push factors have not changed. Only one MAIN COMMITTEE thing has changed: a Labor government is in power and Australia’s border policies have been watered down. The government now has no reform agenda moving forward. It has no answers to the issue of skilling Australians. It has watered down the skilled migration program, and of course beefed up the family reunion program, as Labor did last time it was in office in the HawkeKeating years. It has watered down the 485 visa program to the point where a whole range of students in their tens and tens of thousands have not yet realised that once they finish their courses they are not eligible to claim a 485 visa to stay in the country. I say to Labor: when those students realise what was done on 1 February this year, how many of them do you think will suddenly claim asylum considering the 45-day rule has been withdrawn? We are already seeing riot after riot, and even now there are asylum seekers on Christmas Island who have sewn their lips together because of what this government has done. The government needs to focus on tax reform including the GST and the range of ineffective taxes that exist across the Commonwealth. It needs to look at the issues of income-tax cuts and address the raft of family tax benefits that have caused a massive money-go-round. It needs to redress the issue of immigration and focus on skilled immigration rather than family reunion immigration, and of course it needs to toughen our borders. The government needs to address the issue of defence and national security. The Prime Minister issued his national security statement in December 2008 and promised that there would be regular updates of those national security statements. I do not know what the former Prime Minister’s definition of ‘regular’ is, but we have not heard hide nor tail of national security since that statement was delivered. Furthermore, even the wording in the statement is not being followed. It is not hard to see the northern borders and Operation Resolute to quickly realise that our national security statement is being paid lip service. The government is involved in a strategic reform program to seek $20 billion of savings to the Defence Force over 10 years, ostensibly $2 billion a year, although of course it ramps up. A lot of this has been achieved by $8 billion of projects being pushed in the out years to the point where the government has stated that they will continue for the next 10 years at least to have a real increase per annum of three per cent for the defence budget. But because the massive projects have been pushed out, because contingency funds have been pulled out, in reality for the government to continue to realise that three per cent growth in real terms each year, they will need to go to six per cent real growth because of the funds they have stripped out. The government trumpeted an Australian Army Future Force including a Reserve Future Force, but now appears to be walking away from that. The 2009 white paper had a range of issues in there, everything from massive capability improvement through to 2030 to simple things such as a range of capability to be transferred from the Reserves across to the Regular Army. We are yet to see hide or tail of those capabilities that will be transferred to the Regulars, and of course there is only a page and a half on funding for this massive capability up to 2030. The government needs to get a reform agenda and a focus to where it is going. At present the Gillard government is simply serving up the scraps from former prime minister Mr Rudd’s table. It does not serve the nation well. It does not serve our future well. That is the legacy of a campaign that came so perilously close. In Queensland nine seats changed from Labor to the coalition, thanks in many ways to the Queensland Liberal-National Party and the merging of the two parties. In Fadden, thanks to MAIN COMMITTEE the help from a large number of volunteers and a great campaign committee, we achieved a swing of 3.8 per cent and increased, more importantly, the primary vote by 10 per cent. We saw these swings right across Queensland as people realised that what they had hoped for and what they had voted for in Kevin Rudd in 2007, what they thought was simply ‘John Howard lite’ turned out not to be at all. There was that great Liberal ad just before the ‘night of the long knives’ which talked about a lemon and showed the former Prime Minister’s face on the lemon. It talked about how terrible it is when what you hoped for and dreamed of turns out to be a lemon. I think Queenslanders realised that to be only too true. Queensland is a canny state. It can see through charlatans at a hundred feet. Queensland did exceptionally well. I welcome the new members from Queensland into the parliament. I wish to put on the record my thanks to the great campaign committee and the people that worked so tirelessly to record a tremendous result in the electorate of Fadden. To campaign director Steve Houlihan and the great campaign committee of Robert Knight and Kerry Knight, Phil Hunniford and the many others, I say a huge thank you. Thanks to my own staff: Felicity, Margaret, Glenn, Kristyn and Mary, who worked tirelessly to ensure we got a great result. Thanks to those who spent days and days on street stalls ensuring the public had access to all the information they needed. Thanks also to Daniel and his wife Lisa, David Callard and many others. Thanks to those who manned over 300 booths to ensure people had a choicenoting of course that half the booths were not even manned by Labor, which was a bit of an anti-climax really. To those who worked so hard, I say a great thank you. I give thanks for the great support of Simone Holzapfel and Darren Sly, Kenton and Rachel Campbell, Bruce Mitchell, John Chardon, Philip Charlton, Susie Wright and many others. Their support was completely and utterly invaluable. I give thanks to the former Prime Minister, the Honourable John Howard AC, who came up and ran an incredibly successful dinner and delivered a speech of 40 minutes-off-the-cuff with no notes-that encapsulated the situation beautifully and foretold what would happen as the campaign rolled out. I say thank you also to the Fadden community, where so many things were promised should a Liberal-National government be elected. They were simple things that the community could understand: fences for the Labrador cricket club; a new roof for the Riding for the Disabled club, where horses are used to help critically disabled children come to grasp a whole new meaning of life; and the great Green Army projects we are rolling out across community gardens. I made a public deal with the mayor of the Gold Coast that if we were elected then I would put in four community gardens and he would stump up with four men’s sheds. In front of a 100 blokes from Mensheds Australia, we shook hands and agreed on it. Next time, Mayor, that deal will come through. There is also a great CCTV program for Neighbourhood Watch. We had a tremendous raft of policy there that the community could believe in. There were simple tangible things the community needed to get on with. In many ways that is what the community needs. Whilst roads, bridges, ports and great infrastructure are important, at the end of the day community groups want to get on doing what they have always done. They want government to get out of the way and realise that Canberra does not know best. Canberra does not know what my schools need in infrastructure; my schools do. That is why we made it very clear that if a coalition government was to win then we would honour the BER funding but we would give it to the schools. We would give it to the school princiMAIN COMMITTEE pals and the P&Cs because they have a better idea of what they need than Canberra based bureaucrats. I stand by that. It was a great decision. It is highlighted by the fact that the private schools in my electorate have done so exceptionally well because they got the funding whereas the state schools in my electorate have suffered because the funding has been hijacked by, what the polling shows to be, the most dreadful, awful state government in history-the Bligh government-which squeezed 20 to 25 per cent off the top for ‘management fees’ and then decided what the school could use after that. If that is what government will deliver then I want none of it. I want the government to be small. I want the public service reduced, if that is what it is going to deliver. What the community wants is a say. What the community wants is to have ownership over its own affairs. What the community wants is government to get out of the way so that the community can get on with doing what it does best-which is delivering great things within the community. with standing order 192 the debate is interrupted. The resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. The member will have leave to continue speaking when the debate is resumed. United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child Debate resumed, on motion by Ms Parke: That this House: (1) notes that: (a) on 17 December 2010 Australia will celebrate the 20th anniversary of the ratification of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child; (b) the Convention on the Rights of the Child is an attempt to ensure that children everywhere have the best opportunity in life regardless of where they live, their race or gender, including the right to go to school, to have access to shelter and food, to play and to have their opinions heard and respected; and (c) there has been significant progress in that 10 000 fewer children die per day than they did twenty years ago but there are still 8 million children dying each year before their fifth birthdays of causes that are easily preventable through such simple and inexpensive measures as insecticide-treated mosquito nets, vaccinations, breast-feeding for six months, clean water and sanitation; (2) applauds the work done for the benefit of children internationally by United Nations agencies, in particular UNICEF (the United Nations Children’s Fund), and Non Government Organisations, such as World Vision, Save the Children and Marie Stopes International; (3) notes that while on the whole children in Australia fare better than children in other parts of the world, there remains significant issues to be tackled in Australia including child abuse and neglect, youth homelessness and the disadvantage suffered by indigenous children; (4) applauds the work done for the benefit of Australian children by the National Association for the Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect, as well as the Australian Human Rights Commission and Child Commissioners in the States and Territories; (5) welcomes the National Framework for Protecting Australia’s Children 2009 2020 as endorsed at the Council of Australian Governments meeting on 30 April 2009; and MAIN COMMITTEE",294,Governor General S Speech
335,The Deputy Speaker (Hon. Dgh Adams),"Order! It being 6.30 pm, in accordance(6) calls upon the federal government to further consider: (a) incorporating the Convention on the Rights of the Child in Federal legislation; and (b) appointing a National Commissioner for Children. Ms PARKE (Fremantle) (6.30 pm)-I am very pleased to note that in a few weeks time, on 17 December 2010, Australia will mark the 20-year anniversary of its ratification of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. It is a convention that sets out the obligations of nation-states to protect the rights and well-being of children as detailed in articles which go to such fundamental matters as health, education, freedom of expression, protection from violence and neglect, and access to representation and redress. In April this year, when the government announced the new Australian Human Rights Framework, it reaffirmed its commitment to human rights obligations contained within the seven core United Nations human rights treaties to which Australia is a party, including the Convention on the Rights of the Child. I am sure that everyone in this place can easily understand the necessity and the value of taking a focused and specific approach when it comes to the rights of children. Children as a group are inherently dependent, especially when very young, on the direct care of adults for their very survival, and they are especially vulnerable to neglect and abuse. Monitoring the extent to which the convention is observed and the extent of progress made by nations towards meeting its objectives is the responsibility of the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child. In addition to the committee’s general supervisory brief, there is also a reporting obligation on all signatory nations, and it is worth noting that the Australian government submitted its fourth report in July last year. It is also important to recognise that there continues to be scope for Australia to improve its performance when it comes to the rights of children. Indeed, following the receipt of the second and third reports, which were lodged in combination in March 2003, the UN committee, in its 2005 concluding observations, did note that, in addition to Australia’s significant progress towards realising children’s rights, there were nevertheless several areas of concern with regard to the position of Indigenous children and the issues of corporal punishment, youth homelessness, juvenile justice and children in immigration detention. Some of those areas remain a concern now. I note the comments made earlier this month by Norman Gillespie, the Chief Executive of UNICEF Australia, where he said: We have seen improvements in the welfare and rights of children over the last two decades but we still have serious concerns including the growing disparity of opportunity for children in the bottom 20 per cent and the widening gaps between indigenous and non-indigenous children in relation to educational opportunities. The overarching insufficiency in Australia’s case has been identified as the lack of an effective national children’s policy and accompanying assessment apparatus. As with other areas of national policy, a number of which this government has tackled and is tackling, there is a need to resolve the inconsistencies that currently exist between Australian states and territories when it comes to the rights and well-being of children. Having said that, this government has created, through the Council of Australian Governments meeting in 2009, two critical and far-reaching national strategies: the National Framework for Protecting Australia’s Children 2009-2020 and the National Early Childhood Development Strategy. Both make reference to and draw impetus from the principles contained in the Convention on the Rights of the Child. MAIN COMMITTEE Work is also currently proceeding on a national action plan to reduce violence against women and their children. All of these initiatives are hugely welcome and they are examples of work undertaken by this government to coordinate policy matters of national importance. I share the view of many in the children’s rights advocacy community that the creation of a national children’s commissioner would be a worthwhile addition to the existing framework. In fact, one key aspect of a commissioner’s role would be the independent and effective monitoring of the national policy framework. Other potential features of the role include a national community based education function and a role in coordinating the collection of data on the well-being of children and young people. As it stands, comparable national and international data is in a relatively poor state, with a number of significant gaps. The Australian Human Rights Commission, which has called for the creation of an Australian children’s commissioner, issued a discussion paper in October on the subject, which I recommend to interested members. It notes the support of UNICEF, Save the Children and the National Children’s and Youth Law Centre for this initiative. I also want to mention the prospect of Australia’s participation in the development of an optional protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child, CRC. This draft optional protocol would provide a defined and specific international mechanism for complaints about breaches of the CRC and, among other benefits, an inquiry procedure. It is in the nature of international agreements whose objects spring from a recognition of basic and common human rights that we consider their achievement as a global community, notwithstanding the fact that the primary obligation is for individual states to make the agreements true for their own people. Article 24 of the convention states that nations must: … recognize the right of the child to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health and to facilities for the treatment of illness and rehabilitation of health. And, in extending the obligations on states when it comes to health beyond their own children, article 24.4 says that states must: … undertake to promote and encourage international co-operation with a view to achieving progressively the full realization of the right recognized in the present article. The Millennium Development Goals, adopted in 2000, logically draw on the specific areas of healthcare provision, listed in article 24.2, (a) to (f), which include the imperatives: to diminish infant and child mortality; to combat disease and malnutrition, including through the adequate provision of nutritious foods and clean drinking water; to ensure appropriate prenatal and postnatal health care for mothers; and to develop preventative health care and appropriate family planning education. I welcome the commitment this Labor government has made to increase our development aid contribution to 0.5 per cent of GNI by 2015-16. I commend the Minister for Foreign Affairs on the substantial work he has already done in this area, as well as on his clear and strong call on all nations to renew efforts in meeting the Millennium Development Goals. On this point I also want to mention the incredible work that UNICEF does, particularly the work by UNICEF Australia. I have spoken before in this place on the literally lifesaving and lifechanging work that UNICEF undertakes with women and children in the developing world, whether it be in Papua New Guinea, India, Pakistan, Africa or elsewhere. When you see, as I have, initiatives that educate and support women in ways that will immediately impact on child health and when you see toddlers who are now likely to reach their fifth birthday, when MAIN COMMITTEE previously a number of them almost certainly would not have, it restores one’s sense that we can achieve good things and we can make progress. Last week, on 16 November, we marked the one-year anniversary of the national apology to the forgotten Australians. For me, it is natural to draw a link between that important occasion and the anniversary of the adoption of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child because the forgotten Australians were children who were not protected as they should have been. Article 19.1 of the convention states: States… shall take all appropriate legislative, administrative, social and educational measures to protect the child from all forms of physical or mental violence, injury or abuse, neglect or negligent treatment, maltreatment or exploitation, including sexual abuse, while in the care of parent(s), legal guardian(s) or any other person who has the care of the child. More particularly, article 20.1 states: A child temporarily or permanently deprived of his or her family environment, or in whose own best interests cannot be allowed to remain in that environment, shall be entitled to special protection and assistance provided by the State. Yet the children who were and who are the forgotten Australians did not receive that special protection. Our acceptance of responsibility, our sorrow and our sincere apology for the suffering of the forgotten Australians has a sobering resonance in the context of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. That episode in our history is a tragic demonstration of the vulnerabilities of children and of the susceptibility of government agencies to systemic failures when it comes to even the most basic protections. The two anniversaries, a month apart, should remind us of the terrible harm that can occur when the rights of children are not protected and should strengthen us in the ongoing imperative of recognising and protecting those rights. The third anniversary, in a few months time, of the national apology to the stolen generations will be another point of reflection. It is of course an anniversary which tolls a heavy warning on the unacceptable consequences of neglecting the rights of children. The stolen generations and the forgotten Australians are not people who exist in some sepia-coloured, less enlightened Australian past. They are with us now, with their pain and also their courage and resilience. As we look forward to the celebration next month of the 20th anniversary of Australia’s ratification of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, we should remember that this is not an ornamental document. It is not something we have signed up to, comfortable in the sense that such rights are a given in a country like ours, for we know that such complacency is the first step towards failing in our observation of those rights. The Convention on the Rights of the Child is instead a document to which we must renew our adherence year in, year out, and a document from which we derive a path forward to the better protection and well-being of children in Australia and for children everywhere. Convention on the Rights of the Child, more than any other human rights treaty in history, the protection of children and their advancement is not universal. Statistics from UNICEF show that, for every 100 children born today, 30 will suffer malnutrition in the first five years of life, 26 will never be immunised against disease, 19 will have no access to clean drinking water and 17 will never go to school-and, of those 83 that do, 20 will not reach the fifth grade. It is also estimated that over one million children are trafficked each year and forced into MAIN COMMITTEE",298,Private Members Business
336,Mrs Moylan (Pearce) (6.40 Pm),"Despite the fact that 192 countries have ratified the work. This was graphically illustrated last night on a program on the ABC called Compass. It looked at the issue of the estimated 23 million children who are slaves in various countries around the world, and I have to say that it was a very moving program. But, however bleak the situation, there are many positive developments which have occurred since the adoption of the convention in 1989. Globally, about 84 per cent of primary school age children are in class and the gender gap is narrowing each year. Increased international cooperation has resulted in organised networks exploiting children being brought down. And, each year, UNICEF responds to over 200 international crises, assisting children in need. I join with the member for Fremantle in acknowledging the tremendous work that UNICEF does internationally. Clean water and improved health services are reaching the most impoverished children and, as the motion notes, UNICEF figures reveal that, since the convention was agreed to, 10,000 fewer children die every day, in large part due to the work of UNICEF and other non-government organisations. I would like to take a moment to thank the member for Fremantle for bringing this motion to the House, and I endorse the sentiments expressed, particularly acknowledging the work carried out for the benefit of children both internationally and in Australia by many government and non-government agencies. I mention the government because I am aware that under successive governments outstanding work has been initiated through AusAID which has assisted children and through our Federal Police at a national level, where they have battled to deal with sex crimes, particularly those overseas. And then there are the many agencies at state level in mostly badly under-resourced departments of child protection battling the tide of abuse and neglect of children. I know they get a bad rap by the press, but a lot of the people working in those agencies have a very, very difficult job, and I think they attempt to discharge it under the most difficult of conditions, so I would like to acknowledge that. I suppose the only part of the motion that I have some concern about-and I am happy to have further discussion with the member for Fremantle-is about appointing a national children’s commissioner. I have some concern about whether or not we can achieve anything by appointing a children’s commissioner nationally because the protection of children is a matter for state governments. When I was minister, I had a portfolio which included abuse and neglect of children, but in practical terms the Commonwealth actually does not deal with the day-to-day issues, so I think we need to be very clear, if we are going to put money into establishing a children’s commissioner, about what the role of that commissioner is and whether it is actually going to make any progress in how we manage the terrible abuse and neglect of children that goes on in this country. I keep an open mind on that matter. Although the situation for Australian children is not as dire as for those living in many developing countries, the motion does note that Australian children face significant challenges, including homelessness, abuse and neglect, and we know that in many Indigenous communities children do not have the same opportunities that other Australian children enjoy. Next week, after the House has risen, I shall be returning to Canberra to attend a workshop on the National Action Plan for Young Australians, and I thank Dr Lance Emerson for briefing me and sending me an invitation to this important event. The event is being organised by the Australian Research Alliance for Children and Youth, and its aim, as Dr Emerson, the chief executive officer, tells me, is: ‘a long-term, comprehensive, overarching social marketing strategy like beyondblue or Quit to empower parents in optimising the emotional development MAIN COMMITTEE and well-being of children and young people and a national action plan for naught-to-24-yearolds rather than the current, ad-hoc approach to planning for children and young people. Within this plan there will be a national charter for interorganisational collaboration to maximise effort and ensure that we are working together to meet the needs of children and young people.’ The Chairperson of the Australian Research Alliance for Children and Youth is Professor Fiona Stanley, a Western Australian who has had a long and distinguished career in caring for the health and well-being of children and young people. The workshop builds on the work of the Australian Research Alliance for Children and Youth at a conference they held in 2009, where 590 delegates examined the theme ‘Transforming Australia for our children’s future: making prevention work’. I am hopeful that this workshop in Canberra will also progress the work undertaken in the previous parliament’s House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family, Community, Housing and Youth, of which I was deputy chair. This committee completed Housing the homeless: report on the inquiry into homelessness legislation, and I think some of us would be very surprised to see how many young people-and I mean very young people-end up living under bridges and on our city streets. They are very vulnerable. That report and the inquiry highlighted just how young some of these people are who are living on the streets. The other report was Avoid the harm-stay calm: report on the inquiry into the impact of violence on young Australians, which specifically investigated the issue of youth violence. The Housing the homeless report found that between 2001 and 2006 there was a decrease in the homeless youth rate for those aged 12 to 18, which was good news. The principal two factors for this decrease were early intervention for at-risk families and youth and the improved labour market for young people. As part of the continuing efforts to improve early intervention strategies, the committee investigated a broader strategy of social inclusion, which is also one of the pillars of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. To combat youth homelessness especially, the Regional Youth Development Officers Network submitted that inclusion strategies must aim to provide: … fundamentals of a decent life within their own community: opportunities to engage in the economic and social life of the community with dignity; increasing their capabilities and functioning; connecting people to the networks of local community; supporting health, housing, education, skills training, employment and caring responsibilities. Each of these areas is specifically mentioned in the Convention on the Rights of the Child, illuminating a unity of purpose between our international obligations and our domestic goals. In the Avoid the harm report a number of risk factors were identified that were more likely to lead young people to commit violent acts. These were categorised as individual, relationship, community or society. We discovered that there is clearly a link between early bullying, which is often learned from violent behaviour in the home, and later violence and, often, incarceration of young people in institutions because of that violent behaviour. I believe we need to work much harder on those early intervention programs so that we can deal with this particular matter. To finish up, Carol Bellamy, a former executive director of UNICEF, said: MAIN COMMITTEE History will judge us harshly if we refuse to use our knowledge, our resources and our will to ensure that each new member of the human family arrives into a world that honours and protects the invaluable, irreplaceable years of childhood. To that I say: hear, hear! Ms GRIERSON (Newcastle) (6.49 pm)-I am very pleased to have the opportunity to speak in support of the member for Fremantle’s motion on the rights of children. As a former principal and a teacher at the time, I welcomed the Hawke government’s ratification of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child in December 1990. In fact, I remember teaching a unit of work on the topic to some very interested children. AndI welcome the member for Fremantle’s efforts to protect and foster the rights of children. Since the convention was ratified we have made significant progress, both in Australia and internationally, in our efforts to protect the rights of children. Ten thousand fewer children now die each day than they did when the convention was ratified. It does not sound many but when you take into account 20 years of population growth it is pleasing. This reduction in the number of children dying each day has in part been achieved through the aid program of Australian governments and the development programs of Australian aid organisations. This is an achievement of which all Australians should be proud, and one which we hope to expand upon. Internationally, over eight million children continue to die each year. That is a significant figure. It is equivalent to the death of the entire population of Australia every three years. A preventable disease like malaria, for example, kills a child every 30 seconds and greatly contributes to anaemia among children, stunting their growth and hindering their development. At the millennium summit in 2000 the Australian government pledged, among other things, to work in cooperation with other developed nations to halt and to begin to reverse the incidence of malaria and other major diseases through the provision of insecticide treated bed nets and antimalarial drugs. We also promised to reduce infant mortality rates by two-thirds and to ensure that children everywhere were able to access primary schooling. That is why we are contributing $1.6 billion over the next five years as part of the United Nations Global Strategy for Women’s and Children’s Health, to reduce complications during childbirth and to improve the health of children under the age of five. We are also investing in education initiatives in Asia and the Pacific in the order of $744 million in the 2010-11 financial year to bring our official development assistance spending to $4.3 billion in 2010-11, increasing to between $8 billion and $9 billion per annum by 2015. In addition to the work of the non-government organisations mentioned in the motion, I would also like to applaud the work of PLAN, whose child-centred community development programs foster the rights of children, improve access to education and reduce child poverty. The Coalition for Adolescent Girls and Girl Effect, likewise, should be commended for their innovative work directed towards young women as the means through which to change people’s lives, their communities and nations. In the words of Girl Effect: If we can release girls living in poverty, they will do the rest. Girl Effect in particular has a very innovative approach, using social media to inspire other young people to assist and to take action. MAIN COMMITTEE In Australia there remain significant issues of child abuse, neglect and youth homelessness. The most recent report of the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare indicates that in Australia during 2008-09 there were 339,454 reports of suspected child abuse and neglect made to state and territory authorities concerning 207,462 children. Of the 162,385 reports that were investigated, 54,621 were substantiated, of which over 34,000 were in my home state of New South Wales. Particularly concerning is the disadvantage experienced by Indigenous children. An Aboriginal child is 7½ times more likely to be abused than a non-Indigenous child, and is more than nine times as likely to be placed in care. This is not acceptable and we do need to close that gap and ensure that Aboriginal children receive the same opportunities and caring and loving environments that many other children receive. I would like to dwell on the issue of the national commissioner for children. I also agree that we should appoint a national commissioner for children as the Australian Human Rights Commission has recommended. I heard the member for Pearce say that that would have to be very strictly defined. I think it would be an important voice for children and for fostering the protection and promotion of children’s rights in Australia. In the short time that I have spoken, 75 children will have died somewhere in the world from preventable causes. ‘The answer’, according to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Kevin Rudd, is ‘to honour our commitments even when the global economic environment is harsh, because for the poorest of the poor it is even harder’. Domestically, as a government, we must be proactive in our policy making and foster a rights based culture for all Australians, particularly our children, who are at particular disadvantage. I therefore commend the motion. support a motion reflecting on the 20th anniversary of the ratification of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, but no opposition can stand by and allow us to debate in a very banal and anodyne way on elements of that UN convention without identifying the complete failure of successive governments to provide shelter and protection to Indigenous Australian children. I am glad the previous speaker, the member for Newcastle, made a passing reference to that important area. Over the last three years we have seen a shift under the current administration, from inadequate effort to resolve Indigenous housing to inadequate Indigenous housing, with huge amounts of good money going after bad, while, in many cases, poorly run administrative programs have seen this government criticised-with which I absolutely agree. But I have even greater sympathy for the Indigenous children who do not receive housing because it is not being administered appropriately. We all know the history: it was a Territory government responsibility to provide shelter to Indigenous children, and they relied quite often on federal top-ups. But it was in 2007 when the game-shift occurred and the emergency intervention saw around $547 million committed over four years to Indigenous housing. That was meant to change things. It was meant to work towards providing Indigenous housing in those overcrowded communities where young children go to bed at night-let us not forget this-in crowded bedrooms, sleeping with extended family members or, sometimes, strangers, because of the lack of housing stock. And to gloss over that, in point (3) of MAIN COMMITTEE",301,Private Members Business
337,Mr Laming (Bowman) (6.55 Pm),"It is one thing to join hands in this chamber andthis motion, by saying that, ‘on the whole children in Australia fare better than’ children overseas, is to completely miss the point that nothing has been achieved in these last two years. We hold up the SIHIP program as an example of that, where we had the promise, originally, of $547 million, increased by $456 million to $1.1 billion, but then we had all that money going down the drain into houses that are not being improved with value for money. If we are concerned with, as we are in our debate on this motion today, the protection of children and the provision of adequate shelter, then we need go no further than the Bath report in the Northern Territory, which found that, for over 800 children, child abuse cases have not even been examined by the Northern Territory government. I do not care what their excuses are. In reality, what have we had? We had the year 2008, were nothing occurred except consultation on colour schemes for homes, massive administration, and bureaucracy moving through. By February 2009, not a single house had been built. By mid-2009, just two homes had been built. That was completely inadequate. Then, when we started investigating what was happening with SIHIP, the truth was revealed: there was no chance that 750 new homes could be built; no chance that 230 derelict homes could be flattened and replaced; and no chance at all that, under those current budget allocations, 2,500 improvements could be made. When we all held our breath, hoping that there would be improvements for children living in these squalid and overcrowded conditions, what happened? We started getting what were called ‘functional upgrades’ where they checked the plumbing, the electrics and then walked away-sometimes collecting $75,000 per home. Constructing dwellings in Indigenous Australia for $875,000 apiece, in communities where there are up to 20 or sometimes 30 people sharing a home-this is inadequate. I call for a minister who is prepared to go and sleep in those conditions and see what it is like first hand. We need someone who will say, ‘$1.1 billion of wasted money is simply not good enough.’ We see money being dished out to contractors, as we see the alliance breaking apart. It is an appalling situation for children-appalling. It is one thing to be debating a fairly banal piece of private member’s business here, but quite another to stand by while the following things are happening. The improvements to homes have been little more than functional. We have seen a complete stalling in some communities. We have seen a huge bureaucratic overlay-$45 million spent even before the first house was constructed. And then we have seen examples like those in Ali Curung, where they paint around a hole in the wall, where they provide nothing more than a bench. This is not a jail-this is a home for Indigenous Australian children. What are we left with? We are left with massive gouging by a program that has failed to deliver for Indigenous Australian kids. What we need is independent scrutiny-to step away from this current minister and the Northern Territory government-maybe through a judicial inquiry. But we cannot afford to look back on $1.1 billion in the rear-vision mirror and say, ‘Gee that could’ve been spent better,’ because there are thousands of kids out there who do not sleep or who, when they do sleep, are sleeping with strangers or extended family, listening to parties and seeing, as I have said, that dreadful combination of piss, petrol, potato chips and poker. They lead their lives unable to go to school, and unable to have a chance at employment or a healthy life because of the quality of their housing. MAIN COMMITTEE has expired. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria Debate resumed, on motion by Mr Sidebottom: That this House: (1) acknowledges the Government’s recent increased commitment to the replenishment of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, which: (a) increased the previous commitment of $145 million in 2008-10, to $210 million for the 201113 period; (b) recognised the importance of the Global Fund in the treatment and prevention of AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, the three major infectious diseases; (c) acknowledges the Global Fund as a highly effective funding mechanism for promoting global health and preventing 5.7 million deaths from AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria in some of the world poorest countries; and (d) recognises the need to better fund the work of the Global Fund to deliver increases in the provision of antiretroviral therapy, tuberculosis treatment, long lasting insecticidal nets to prevent malaria, and treatment of women for mother-to-child transmission of HIV; and (2) urges all aid donor countries in the world to fund their fair share of the global amount required by the Fund, which is estimated to be $20 billion over the next three years. member’s attention to the plight of millions of the world’s population, predominantly the poor, who are afflicted by the world’s three main killer diseases, being HIV-AIDS, TB and malaria and what it is that governments can do to save lives and ease suffering. Each year about five million people in the world die from these three diseases: approximately two million from HIV-AIDS, two million from TB and one million from malaria. These figures represent huge personal suffering for family and friends who lose loved ones, as many of us would know from our own experience. To many of those left behind, they also represent a familiar life sentence of poverty, disability, sickness and lost opportunity. The loss of the family breadwinner can mean that the remaining family members have insufficient food and may not be able to afford even the most basic health care and that children, particularly girls, must forego a primary education, something that most would universally acclaim as a basic human right. In 2000 the United Nations created the Millennium Development Goals, a set of eight goals based on the world’s main development challenges and designed to build a safer, more prosperous and more equitable world. Goal6 of the MDG specifically aims to halt and reverse the spread of HIV-AIDS and the spread and incidence of TB and other major diseases, including malaria. I am pleased to say that significant progress on this goal has been achieved. In 2000, the number of people dying from HIV-AIDS, TB and malaria was estimated to be six million annually. Today that figure has been reduced-if I can use such a term-to five million annually. MAIN COMMITTEE",305,Private Members Business
338,The Deputy Speaker (Hon. Dgh Adams),Order! The time allotted for this debate,307,Private Members Business
339,Mr Sidebottom (Braddon) (7.00 Pm),"The point of my motion today is to drawWhile there have been many governments and international organisations responsible for achieving that reduction, there is one organisation that stands out for its effectiveness in delivering health programs successfully. I refer specifically to the Global Fund to Fight HIV-AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria-pandemic nonrespecters of borders, yet all three are easily preventable and treatable. The global fund is the largest multilateral funder of public health programs in developing countries. It was established in 2002 as an international public-private partnership for the purpose of mobilising and intensifying the international response to the global epidemics of HIV-AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria. To the end of 2009 the fund has disbursed nearly US$10 billion. The work of the global fund has undoubtedly made a significant contribution to the global reduction in the number of deaths from the three diseases. The fund estimates that its own programs have saved 5.7 million lives since its creation. Indeed, in May 2010, The Lancet said, ‘There is no sector of government expenditure that gives a better human return’ than the global fund. The global fund is an international success story that serves as a model for the delivery of international development assistance not only for its effectiveness in saving lives but for the innovative approach it adopts. Financial allocation decisions are technically based and are transparent and there is a high level of civil society involvement in its decision making. On4 and 5 October this year, donor nations to the fund promised to replenish funding to the fund of US$11.7 billion over the 2011-13 period. I am pleased to say that the Australian government increased its 2008-10 commitment of $145 million to $210 million. These funds will be a good investment. They will enable the global fund to continue and expand on its existing programs, they will save the lives of millions more people, they will help to keep more people out of the poverty cycle and they will make a significant contribution towards achieving the health goals of the Millennium Development Goals, particularly goal No. 6. While I do not want to be critical of the international community’s replenishment of the $11.7 billion US fund, it needs to be acknowledged that, unfortunately, the level of funding promised will not be sufficient. Health advocates estimate that, in order for the global fund to fully realise its objectives, a total of US$20 billion is required. That is almost double the total amount promised. Time is fast running out for achieving the Millennium Development Goals by the target date of 2015. It will require more urgent action from the governments of the world, both donors and recipients. I call on members of all parliaments and governments to review their personal and collective commitment to achieving the MDGs and funding their nation’s fair share of the required global funding for the global fund to fight HIV-AIDS, TB and malaria in particular. It is time to make the achievement of the MDGs an urgent priority, the likes of which were illustrated in the global response to the recent global economic crisis. At the important microlevel of the program and on funding provisions, it is encouraging to note the following. In relation to HIV, by the end of 2009, global fund programs were providing: antiretroviral therapy-or the so-called ART-to 2.5 million people; 1.8 billion male and female condoms; treatment to nearly one million HIV-positive pregnant women to help prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV; 105 million counselling and testing sessions; and 4.5 million basic care and support services to orphans and other AIDS-vulnerable children. MAIN COMMITTEE As regards tuberculosis, six million people who have had active TB were treated, along with $3.2 billion invested in detecting and treating new smear-positive TB cases in some 112 countries. TB prevalence is declining as are TB mortality rates. Malaria prevention has been greatly aided by the distribution of 104 million insecticide treated nets. A variety of prevention programs have been funded, to the total of $5.3 billion, covering some 83 countries. Morbidity and mortality rates worldwide due to malaria have declined markedly and, in some cases, by more than 50 per cent in an increasing number of countries. It is estimated that some five million lives have been saved and hope restored for 33 million people living with HIV, the hundreds of millions of people who contracted malaria or who are at risk each year and the 10 million who contract active TB annually. The global fund is realising the extraordinary vision of its founders, donors and implementers. It has drastically intensified the fight against HIV, TB and malaria, as I mentioned, while contributing to improving health systems in the progress of achieving the MDGs. Virtual elimination of mother-to-child HIV transmission globally by 2015 can be achieved. Massive scale-up of HIV prevention programs and the provision of ART continues, as I mentioned earlier, although unfortunately universal access to comprehensive and evidence based HIV prevention, treatment, care and support remains distant. As I also mentioned, the prevalence of TB has significantly decreased over the last decade and the international target of halving the prevalence of TB could be met by 2015. Unprecedented coverage with ITNs and effective novel treatments have made great inroads into combating malaria. A rapid scale-up of prevention, treatment, care and support for these three pandemics has meant hope and, as the global fund annual report for 2009-10 testified, has had a positive impact on millions of lives. The report notes: Such unprecedented progress would not have been possible without the support of donors and partner organizations. That is at the heart of the global fund. The report goes on: In the coming years, continued, substantial increases in long-term financial commitments by donors-such as Australia-will be needed to consolidate these gains and to reach the MDGs by 2015 and universal coverage of HIV, TB and malaria services. 2010 is the year that should inspire extraordinary commitments from the public and private sectors to safeguard and build upon the already substantial achievements made over the past decade. I thank Ingrid Smethurst and Ian Sansom of the RESULTS Burnie group for bringing the work of the global fund to my attention as they have and for conducting their public campaign to make us all aware of what is a global issue and a global responsibility. ate the suffering of others. It is something that we seek to do as representatives in parliament, and it is a natural instinct in the everyday lives of most people. Australians are renowned for their generosity and their readiness to help others in distress. Before going into the substance of my speech, let me clear one little thing from my mind. I am governed by two overriding principles when it comes to foreign aid and the elimination of disease. First, I cannot abide those people who peddle the glib old mantra that charity begins MAIN COMMITTEE",307,Private Members Business
340,Mr Neville (Hinkler) (7.10 Pm),"Part of the essence of humanity is our drive to alleviat home. Charity does not begin at home; charity begins when you look into the eyes of a sick or starving child. Second, anyone who believes that we have eliminated smallpox, have almost eliminated polio, can eliminate AIDS-as the previous speaker said-or can eliminate malaria and tuberculosis by somehow cocooning Australia from the rest of the world and trying to escape our obvious interdependent responsibility lives in a fool’s paradise. As a nation we have an obligation to help foreign countries which desperately need our expertise, our manpower and-yes-our money to overcome the difficult challenges they face. I also believe that any Australian government, regardless of its colour, has the duty to ensure that our foreign aid budget and other allocations in the development assistance fields deliver the greatest good for the greatest number of people affected. Foreign aid has to be targeted at projects which empower Third World countries. There is no question that disease eradication, particularly amongst our neighbouring countries, is one of the best purposes our foreign aid can be put to. As someone who has a first hand understanding of the importance of the fight against devastating diseases such as HIV-AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria, I am happy to speak in support of the motion of the honourable member for Braddon on the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. At this time last year I was one of the parliamentary advisers to the Australian Embassy at the UN. I am familiar with the great work being done around the world in fighting these awful, debilitating diseases through the Global Fund and more widely through the Millennium Fund. One of the greatest efforts to overcome these diseases has been carried out through the Global Fund to Fight AIDs, Tuberculosis and Malaria. It was created in 2002. It is a unique partnership between governments, the private sector and international communities to combat three of the most insidious diseases still plaguing the planet. The Global Fund is currently the main source of finance to help fight these diseases throughout the world, providing a quarter of all the international financing required to combat AIDS, two-thirds of tuberculosis outlays and three-quarters of malaria treatment programs. Since its inception, it is estimated that the work done through the fund has saved around five million lives in some of the poorest countries on earth. In the same time frame, the fund distributed around $10 billion to help control the spread of HIV, tuberculosis and malaria, and invested more than $90 billion in specific control and treatment programs. These programs are saving around 3,600 lives every day and preventing thousands of new infections from breaking out. Australia committed $145 million to the fund for 2008 to 2010, and last month the government confirmed it would contribute again, pledging $210 million to the fund between 2011 and 2013. Some Australians might question the value of foreign aid, but in many cases we reap the benefits of the work we are doing in funding other nations, even in our own nation. As I said, the global fund is responsible for the control and treatment of HIV-AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis through South-East Asia and the Pacific, covering 24 countries in our region, including Papua New Guinea, Indonesia, Tonga, Vanuatu and the Cook Islands. It is important to recognise that malaria is a global issue; and, in the case of controlling the spread of malaria, the benefits to our region are self-evident. Many of the 60 per cent of malaria cases occurring outside Africa occur in the Asia-Pacific region, so this is not some remote disease in an even more remote country; this is something right on our doorstep. Ask the diggers who served in Papua New Guinea and the Pacific Islands in World War II. Ask the contractors who MAIN COMMITTEE work or have worked recently in Papua New Guinea or the Solomon Islands. Many of them have been struck down by malaria. It is a disease which has a serious economic as well as a human impact on poorer countries. It fuels a cycle of poverty, primarily afflicting the poor, who tend to live in malaria prone areas in poorly built dwellings that offer few if any barriers against mosquitoes. During my time at the UN, I spoke about Australia’s leading role in combating malaria in the Asia-Pacific region. Around one-quarter of the nations that have embarked on malaria elimination programs are located in the Asia-Pacific region, and through the Pacific Malaria Initiative we are providing targeted technical and management support to governments to implement their national malaria control plans. This initiative is already making significant headway. For instance, in the Solomon Islands, the malaria incidence rate was brought down from 199 cases per 1,000 in 2003 to 82 cases per 1,000 in 2008, while in Vanuatu the rate has decreased from 74 cases per 1,000 in 2003 to 14 cases per 1,000 in 2008. Australia also hosted the inaugural meeting of the Asia Pacific Malaria Elimination Network early last year. The network is another forum to help improve the technologies, skills, systems and leadership that are needed to decrease and eventually eliminate malaria in the Asia-Pacific region. A little closer to home, we recently heard about the dreadful outbreak of cholera in Papua New Guinea. But what most Australians do not know is that malaria is actually one of the leading causes of death and illness in Papua New Guinea. The global fund has invested around $70 million in malaria treatment and eradication programs in Papua New Guinea. Because of our proximity to PNG, this is relevant to us. Alongside this, Indonesia currently ranks third in the world for its overall tuberculosis burden. Because of our proximity to these two nations, we are particularly susceptible to outbreaks of both malaria and tuberculosis in Northern Australia. Recognising this, the coalition pledged $40 million during the recent election campaign to help establish a tropical health institute at James Cook University upon winning government. The money would have gone towards the construction of an Australian institute of tropical health and medicine which would focus on bacteriology and biomolecular sciences, urology and pharmaceutical chemistry. Older Australians would remember the famous Sir Raphael Cilento, a doctor from Queensland who was a world leader in tropical medicine in the 1950s. We need to repeat those sorts of things in the current age. In a nutshell, such work would advance us tremendously in the elimination of many of these scourges that the world suffers. Those of us who lived in the 1950s and 1960s would remember having the skin tests and going along to the mobile X-ray clinics. That way Australia eliminated tuberculosis. It had a tri-fold effect of detection, treatment and elimination and the end of a potential infection. We should not expect that we who got through that so lightly should not do something to help our neighbours through a similar crisis. And so I support the honourable member’s motion. and Settlement Services) (7.20 pm)-We are all involved tonight in a resolution that is of deep interest to many Australians. Only today I had a number of young advocates from Oak Tree, an organisation that campaigns in regards to Australia’s foreign aid level, visit me. This is an occurrence for many members on a very regular basis. One of the changes that we have seen in the political system over recent years is disillusionment with major parties but very strong engagement on issues such as foreign aid. MAIN COMMITTEE",309,Private Members Business
341,Mr Laurie Ferguson (Werriwa,"Parliamentary Secretary for Multicultural AffairsI welcome Australia’s increasing support for the Global Fund, which was established in 2002 to dramatically increase resources to fight three of the world’s most devastating diseases: AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis. That funding increase occurred at a crucial time. In the Guardian Weekly of 24 September 2010 there was a report that quoted Michel Sidibe, head of the UN HIV-AIDS agency. He talked of the momentous gains that have been made over the last few years but expressed concerns that European countries were giving $623 million less this year to HIV-AIDS programs around the world, and there was a shortfall of $10 billion in the funds needed to achieve universal access to HIV treatment. The Guardian Weekly article by Peter Beaumont said: UNAids said access to treatment for HIV has increased 12-fold in six years, and 5.2 million people now get the drugs they need. But another 10 million who need the drugs do not get them. He quoted Michel Sidibe as saying: “To sustain the gains we are making, further investments in research and development are needed–not only for a small wealthy minority, but also focused to meet the needs of the majority.” So this decision came at a time when there were some concerns that the economic crisis of the past few years, and the parallel failure of countries to meet their commitments anyway, was leading to a disturbing possibility that the significant gains being made would not be continued. AIDS has a huge social impact and an impact on the economic productivity of developing countries. The previous speaker talked about malaria affecting most, particularly, poorer communities because of the way in which it spreads. In contrast, AIDS often largely hits the remaining educational elite of many of these African countries. Disproportionately, they are the ones amongst whom it is prevalent. Those countries have already lost many of their educated experts to other countries-they basically seize the people trained or educated overseas. It is a very crucial issue. Around one million people die from malaria, mainly children under five, and over 300 million clinical cases are reported. Over half the world’s population in 109 countries is at risk of contracting malaria. Like AIDS, most deaths from malaria occur in Africa, with around 2,200 people dying every day. More than two billion people suffer from tuberculosis, of which 90 per cent live in developing countries, and obviously that is clearly related to the material conditions under which they live. We know that in Australia there has to be a lot of vigilance in regard to tuberculosis in the immigration intake. For a few years we had problems because we trusted people to fulfil commitments once they arrived here, rather than ensuring that they actually got rid of the condition through treatment before they arrived here. Each disease is debilitating and potentially deadly. When someone suffers from a combination of them it is even worse, particuarly with HIV-positive people contracting tuberculosis. The fund has a different, I think effective, way to deliver support and to combat AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis. The fund works closely with donor and recipient countries, other organisations and local communities to prevent duplication, which is important, and to integrate effectively into the delivery of health programs. In other words, there is a lot of cooperation with the local system on the ground and ensuring that there is not a situation where there are a MAIN COMMITTEE whole lot of overpaid Western professionals competing in the same market and basically falling over each other. By increasing Australia’s support for the global fund from $145 million in 2008-10 to $210 million for 2011-13, we are making a contribution to the health, well-being and productivity of developing countries. The global fund has received commitments of $11.7 billion over the next three years, but needs an estimated $20 billion. I am hopeful that Australia’s initiative on this front is such that it would precipitate action from a number of other countries. As I said, there have been concerns over the past year that despite the major advances being made it will not be held because of countries retracting their offers. really great successes has been the global fund to target these three major infectious diseases world wide. As we have already heard, they kill around 3½ thousand people every day and result in thousands of additional infections and enormous morbidity for families, particularly in developing economies. The origins of the fund go back prior to the year 2000, when a number of leading economists looked at ways to provide a carrot-effectively, a reward-for both nations and corporations that invested heavily in the solutions to what at that time were unsolvable problemsthe top three killers. Malaria, TB and HIV had for a long time taken hundreds of thousands of lives in the decades preceding the year 2000. Only then did a guy called Jeffrey Sachs, working together with Michael Kremer from the School of Economics at Harvard, first talk about a global fund. The initial concept was to have donor nations in particular put money aside that would serve to be a carrot attracting investment into new forms of pharmaceuticals that could one day help us to win this titanic struggle. In the intervening period, of course, the large nations, and particularly the G8 nations, got together with the pharmaceutical manufacturers and negotiated some very impressive breakthroughs where these expensive drugs, particularly the HIV drugs, could be provided at just a fraction of the market price. So all of the negotiation around the global fund was then able effectively to be turned into a leveraging instrument which, unlike the UN bodies with which it was working, did not have major in-country offices and did not seek to tell nations what to do. Instead, it just focused on the simple principles of working with national priorities and working as leverage rather than simply as a provider of services. It sought, where it could, to leverage in-country expertise, to do independent evaluation and to be completely balanced in the way they approached these three great killers. They did not focus unfairly on one intervention, one region or one disease. That was the essence of the global fund, and we have had three commitments to replenishing it. The most recent was on 4 and 5 October in New York, and was quite successful. There the second replenishment of $9.7 billion was increased to $11.7 billion. Over those three replenishments we have seen jumps of 80 per cent and then most recently 20 per cent. It is very promising that most of those who contribute funds have actually backed up the talk with walk. The moneys that have been committed are coming through. In fact, in the most recent replenishment, where they have achieved $11.7 billion, about $2.52 billion of that is expected to come when these donor nations are able to fund those commitments. The estimation is that we need $20 billion over this three-year period. In reality, we have just under $12 billion. That tells us that we are getting somewhere near but still not close MAIN COMMITTEE",311,Private Members Business
342,Mr Laming (Bowman) (7.25 Pm),"In combating international poverty one of the fewenough to what would be the ideal target. We know from national plans in the 83 nations that are afflicted with malaria, of the 112 with TB and around 140 combating HIV that the two really great challenges will be predominantly men having sex with men as the chief threat in HIV transmission and women having babies who are HIV positive. They will be the two key focuses around HIV because we are seeing an explosion-a radical jump-that has actually caused a J-curve in the reporting of HIV in these nations. With multidrug resistant TB, again, the challenge is to get the suite of drugs correct and to have them available in all nations. That was the real success of the last three-year period. Obviously, with malaria, it is insecticide impregnated nets that are available to people to reduce the chance of infection with malaria, particularly around dusk and while sleeping. I will now turn very, very briefly to those three millennium goals. The ones we are most optimistic about are: 6, which is the reduction of the dreadful communicable diseases; they are also contributing to goal 4, around child mortality being halved, and 5, maternal mortality being halved. The communique that came out from the most recent meeting in New York was really encouraging. They are pointing at country-coordinating mechanisms, CCMs, that allow this effort, which is fundamentally a financial instrument, to get down into countries and leverage the ability and the capacity on the ground. That means that it is being implemented slightly differently in each country, a real change from the struggle that these agencies have had before to coordinate multiple donors and to work with local capacity. Finally, it is good to see ACFID right here in Australia recommending with its five healthrelated recommendations: that 20 per cent of Australia’s aid be health related, 15 per cent be family planning related, a focus on avoidable blindness and of course their recommendations around treatment of those three conditions. We welcome the government’s increased commitment of $210 million. This is only one per cent of what is needed and is well short of our GDP as a contribution to global GDP, but still it is a very important contribution towards the Millennium Development Goals that could well be achieved by 2015. pired.

Home Insulation Program Debate resumed, on motion by Mr Hunt: That this House: (1) notes that the Australian Government has not released figures for the full rate of defects discovered under both the Home Insulation Safety Plan and the Foil Insulation Safety Program; (2) calls on the Australian Government to release the full rate of defects discovered under both the Home Insulation Safety Plan and the Foil Insulation Safety Program, including the: (a) number and percentage of roofs: (i) found to be unsafe; (ii) found to be faulty or substandard; (iii) found to be flawed, unsafe or substandard in any way; and (iv) rectified; (b) cost of repairing the faulty, substandard or unsafe insulation; and MAIN COMMITTEE",313,Private Members Business
343,The Deputy Speaker( Mrs D’ath),"Order! The time allotted for this debate has ex(c) total amount of money paid by the Australian Government to insulation companies for faulty, substandard, flawed or unsafe insulation; and (3) calls on the Australian Government to release information on the asbestos problem discovered under the Home Insulation Program, in particular: (a) the number of roofs containing asbestos that received insulation; (b) any specific warnings of asbestos risk given to installers prior to fitting the insulation; and (c) steps being taken to manage the asbestos risk for safety inspectors assessing roofs. information under the Home Insulation Safety Program and the Foil Insulation Safety Program. These two programs were put in place as a consequence and a recognition of the catastrophic failure of the Home Insulation Program. The Home Insulation Program-or the pink batts program as it has become colloquially known-has been arguably the greatest failure in program delivery in Australia since the Second World War. The facts speak for themselves. We start with 207 house fires according to the Auditor General’s most recent report. We move to 1,500 potentially deadly electrified roofs. Further still, we see that there has been a failure rate on the first 13,800 roofs inspected of 29 per cent, which have either substandard or dangerous insulation installations in some way or another. Let us assume that, because they have been targeted the figure is lower than that, we are still talking about well over 200,000 homes with potentially dangerous, deadly or substandard insulation. All of this leads to a roof repair bill of a minimum of $680 million, which could climb as high as a billion dollars. But none of this compares with the tragic linkages associated with this program. Four young lives were lost through association with this program. The coroner’s cases will follow. There have been prosecutions, but it is absolutely clear that there has never been a full and thorough investigation of the linkages that this program has had to those tragedies. That is why the opposition fully supports a royal commission. The Auditor-General was not empowered to examine the linkages between these tragedies and the program: the quality of the program design at ministerial level, the execution of ministerial conduct, or any of those elements. The Auditor-General was only empowered to deal with the program delivery by the administration, not by the executive. It is a fundamental failing of transparency under this government and there must be, and should be, a full royal commission, and we will prosecute that case going forward. Today, this motion addresses an urgent, immediate and imminent requirement on the route to that royal commission. It is about the disclosure of public safety information which has been withheld from the public. In particular, the motion notes that the Australian government has not released the figures for the full rate of defects discovered under the Home Insulation Safety Plan and the Foil Insulation Safety Program. It calls on the government to release the full rate of defects discovered under both the Home Insulation Safety Plan and the Foil Insulation Safety Program and, in particular, it calls on the government to release information on the asbestos problems discovered under the Home Insulation Program. The figures which comprise that last element were today the subject of a campaign by unions which identified the Home Insulation Program as the third wave of the great asbestos risks of the last 30 years. It was not the Liberal Party, it was not the federal coalition, it was not former members; it was the union movement which this very day identified the Home Insulation Program as the MAIN COMMITTEE",314,Private Members Business
344,Mr Hunt (Flinders) (7.31 Pm),"I rise to address the motion in relation to the release ofthird wave in the tragic march of failures relating to asbestos and the exposure of workers, the exposure of inspectors and, potentially, the exposure of homeowners as a consequence of the government’s Home Insulation Program. Against that background, it is negligence, folly and denial to keep these figures about defect rates and public safety from the public. The government’s task is clear. Its duty is to ensure that, no matter how painful it is to the members of the government, the full facts about public safety are disclosed and the full facts about the risks to homeowners are disclosed. The government’s argument is very simple: ‘Because we have been targeting inspections it may give a falsely high figure.’ One hundred thousand inspections have been carried out. That is an enormous sample and that figure will give a representative view of the failure rate within those houses that have been subject to insulation from the least reputable installers and the most dodgy fly-by-nighters. There is no doubt about that; that cannot be in question. What we see is very clear: that 100,000 homes will give a real and profound indication of the rate of failure. As we know, there has been an extraordinary level of failure under this program. The argument that it is too much to let the public know about the rate of failure and the rate of risk underestimates the public. The public, if given the right information, can make the right decisions. But it also shows contempt for the public, and that is contrary to the spirit of transparency with which this government was installed and contrary to the agreements around transparency. I would respectfully say to all those Independents who will consider how they vote on this motion that transparency must rule. There can be no doubt about that. Against that background, take not our word, take the word of the industry associations who themselves warned the government well over a year ago that the Home Insulation Program was a deathtrap waiting to happen. The National Electrical and Communications Association has written to the Independents. James Tinslay, the Chief Executive Officer, said in a letter last week: … the National Electrical and Communications Association (NECA) was the first body to warn the then minister, the Hon. Peter Garrett, of the potential dangers faced by the then proposed Home Insulation Program. He went on to say: NECA’s members and their employees who work on domestic premises are well aware of the risks related to working in roof spaces … He also says: Due to the confidentiality provisions of the government inspection contracts, NECA members are not able to provide details of the numbers of live roof spaces or those that have the potential to become live. This makes it very difficult for an industry to plan on how to address the ongoing dangers. Electrocution is a potential risk from nondisclosure, according to the chief executive officer of one of the two national bodies. Mr Tinslay in his letter went on to say: We believe that the release of this information is essential for NECA members, fire fighting and other emergency services, state electrical safety regulators, other tradesmen and especially householders themselves. The advice could not be clearer. The evidence has been palpable. The government ignored 26 warnings before the program was finally wound down. Throughout the second half of 2009 the opposition called for an Auditor-General’s inquiry, the first day of which was 28 August MAIN COMMITTEE 2009, almost a year and a half ago. The risks were manifest, the warnings were obvious, the steps were ignored and there were tragic consequences. But it is not just the one body that has pointed out the risks. The CEO of Master Electricians Australia, Mr Malcolm Richards, has written to me. In his letter dated 19 Novemberlast week-he set out the fact that there are risks to homeowners through electrical faults. He said: This finding is based, in part, on the initial results of the Federal Government’s Foil Insulation Safety Program… which were reported in the media earlier this year. He went on to say: We note that the full results of the safety inspections have not yet been released … He says that his body would support ‘any effort to have these figures made public in order to add to public understanding of the level of pre-existing electrical faults in Australian homes’. There is no doubt that the two leading bodies in Australia who represent those who work with electricity want the figures about the Home Insulation Program released. There is no doubt that the government is in denial. This motion should be supported. It is about public safety information. All members, I hope, will be able to back it. (Time expired) Ms SAFFIN (Page) (7.41 pm)-I rise to speak against the motion moved by the member for Flinders, and I shall carefully set out the reasons why. The government is extremely disappointed that the opposition has decided to move this motion in the House. To stand accused by the opposition of not putting the safety of Australian householders first is both unfair and misleading. The government has done two significant things, among others, on this issue. It has provided several opportunities to privately brief the opposition on the current safety inspection results and has consistently explained its reasons for not releasing this data prematurely. Furthermore, the government has also explained many times that the decision not to release the current inspection results is based on advice provided by the Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency. As I will discuss shortly, independent advice from the CSIRO also supports the government’s approach. I can say regretfully that the opposition has responded by refusing to accept the offer of a private briefing. It also continues to publicly distort the facts on this issue, which only serves to undermine the public confidence in the insulation industry and the current inspection programs. TonightI wish to reinforce to the House one more time why the government is adopting its current approach. The inspections under the HISP taken to date have not been done on a random basis. They have been targeted according to a risk assessment and focus carefully on safety issues. Safety is paramount. Given the importance of the targeted risk assessment, the government has commissioned the CSIRO to assist by conducting a statistical analysis of the inspection data to inform the HISP. In addition, the government has asked the department to commission a leading independent, internationally recognised consultancy firm to carry out analysis of the safety inspection programs and the results to provide advice on the extent of risk mitigation. Together, the inspections results data, the work conducted by the CSIRO and the report of the consultancy firm will inform the government’s future decisions on the safety inspection programs. When all of this work has been considered by the government it will be released publicly in the appropriate form. A considered release of this information will build further public confiMAIN COMMITTEE dence in the safety inspection programs. Confidence is vital for the future of the insulation industry. The government has acted upon the advice of the department in taking the decision not to release the data concerning the HISP safety inspection results at this stage of the inspection process. This advice is based on the fact that non-foil inspections undertaken to date are not a random sample and therefore are not representative of potential issues across the HIP. That was a fact noted by the ANAO in its recent report on this. The non-foil inspections are being targeted according to a risk assessment. For example, businesses that have been associated with non-compliance or fire incidents are being targeted, rather than installations of businesses that have no compliance issues. The release of the results of the targeted, risk assessed inspections would be misleading with respect to the incidence and type of safety concerns and the relationship between the incidents and the type of insulation product used across the 1.2 million households. The results would therefore be open to misrepresentation, potentially causing unnecessary apprehension. For these reasons, the results could also generate further disruption in the insulation industry by deepening the loss of confidence in the insulation market or segments of it when it may not be warranted on safety grounds-for example, where the issue relates to the manner of installation of a particular product rather than the product itself. In particular, I ask the House to consider that the politicisation and misrepresentation of the results would likely drive an increase in general household requests for inspections, taking inspectors away from the targeted safety program, thereby diverting resources, increasing costs and extending the time needed to inspect the houses identified by the risk assessment. This is a very serious consideration that has influenced the advice provided to the government. The government’s advice is that all these factors indicated it would not be in the public interest to release the non-foil inspection results until the inspection program is far more advanced, at which time a more definitive assessment could be given about the number of any further houses to be inspected, the remediation measures that may be required, the impact on the industry and possible future regulatory measures. The inspection data is also being shared with state and territory regulatory bodies and law enforcement agencies for the pursuit of non-compliance remedies, and specific elements of the data are sensitive in this regard. The advice provided to the government by the department concerning this issue has been very carefully considered and supported by the department’s audit committee that is chaired and attended by independent advisers. I also draw the House’s attention to the recent Auditor-General’s report into the HIPwhich the opposition supported given the auditor’s independence-which clearly found that the government’s remediation and safety inspection programs were appropriate and well designed. This was the reason that the Auditor-General did not find it necessary to make any recommendations in his report. All of these points, as well as an offer of a private briefing, were made by my colleague the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency, the Hon. Greg Combet, in a letter to the member for Flinders on 5 November. The honourable member for Flinders still has not responded to this letter, as I am advised. CSIRO has since written to the department on these matters, and I quote directly from this letter: The CSIRO opinion is that the data set of 58,000 inspections made so far does not provide a representative sample of the approximately 1.16 million population of installed households for the following reasons: MAIN COMMITTEE many of the inspections occurred as a result of calls to the Centrelink hotline by householders concerned about the quality of their installations. another significant component of the inspections thus far has arisen from a targeting program developed by PWC. As a result, among the total population of installed households, these 58,000 inspections would provide a misleading picture of the overall fire safety risk. In our view, the sampling we have proposed will provide more reliable estimates of (i) the overall fire safety risk and (ii) the impact of various risk factors on that fire safety risk. This independent advice from CSIRO completely supports the reasons the government has provided for not releasing the safety inspection results. Minister Combet wrote to the member for Flinders on 16 November providing him with the CSIRO letter and once more offering the honourable member the opportunity to receive a private briefing. I am advised that the member for Flinders has failed to reply. The opposition simply does not want to listen to the facts. Instead it wants to wreck the current inspection programs and force the government to pursue other options. In precisely the same way that it has been said it does not matter what happens with the NBN, the opposition leader has said, ‘Wreck at all costs.’ The issue of asbestos is also raised in the opposition motion and it is being addressed by the government. The government has recognised issues surrounding the inspection of the roofs containing asbestos. On 12 November a tender was released for phase 2 of the HISP which will seek to secure the services of a specialist contractor to resolve this complex issue. In view of all of the above that I have just spelt out I encourage the House to respect the government’s approach. I would also encourage the opposition to drop this motion and reconsider the government’s offer of a confidential briefing. Further the Foil Insulation Safety Program involves inspections of all 50,000 homes insulated with foil under the HIP. In closing, I reiterate that the government is extremely disappointed that the opposition has decided to move this motion. racy the public deserves to know the rate of failure of all inspections carried out to date and this government must be held to account. I support this motion because it is in the national interest but also because there is a great deal of anxiety amongst homeowners in my electorate of Bonner. Homeowners in Bonner have made numerous representations to me concerned about whether or not they are living in a house with significant safety defects. In addition a number of homeowners in Bonner have asbestos or a risk of asbestos in their roof but had foil insulation installed. These homeowners have a well-founded concern about safety but are feeling left high and dry in relation to these issues. They have been told that they must remove the asbestos from their roof before their house can be further inspected or the insulation removed. This is likely to be at an incredible cost and many of these homeowners are senior citizens. The government’s Home Insulation Program cost taxpayers $2.5 billion and from its inception it has been an outrageous failure of policy and implementation. As we all know now, and it is confirmed by the Auditor-General, this program was linked to at least 207 fires and the tragic deaths of four insulation installers. As we all know now this government rejected all attempts to warn them of the issues associated with this program and all attempts to shed light MAIN COMMITTEE",315,Private Members Business
345,Mr Vasta (Bonner) (7.51 Pm),"I second this motion. In an open and transparent democon what was really going on with fraudulent claims. This government preferred to put the safety of the public and the accountability of government below their own self-preservation. While the government now is conducting safety inspections of houses fitted with insulation, in October the Auditor-General’s report found that there had been a 29 per cent failure rate-that is, nearly one in three jobs done under the government program were dodgy or dangerous. The Auditor-General found a one in three failure rate but this government has decided that it will only inspect one in five houses at risk. That is not good enough. The most striking issue is that the one in three failure rate discovered by the Auditor-General is based only on a small sample of nearly 14,000 homes. One hundred thousand safety inspections have been carried out now, so it is time to stop hiding the truth. Anecdotally, I understand that the rate of failure and the number of dodgy jobs is now much higher than one in three. In fact at one inspection that was carried out on Friday of last week an old Queenslander house with non-foil insulation was found to have failed Australian standards in three areas. Firstly, the depth of insulation was too low. Then there was not adequate clearance of cellulose around the downlights. Finally, the cellulose was not restrained around the cavity. They were all failures of Australian standards. The inspector said that almost all houses he had inspected did not meet the Australian standards and in 100 per cent of cases he had found the specific issue of cellulose not being restrained around the cavity. So it is time for the government to come clean. Importantly, this motion also seeks to uncover the number of asbestos related problems. As I mentioned, homeowners with asbestos in their roofs are being left high and dry. It is outrageous for residents to be told that they must remove the asbestos from their roofs before any further inspection can take place or the insulation can be removed. Residents are well aware that the government had no problem in allowing the insulation to be installed in roofs with asbestos in the first place without appropriate oversight, so they must do whatever is necessary to assist these homeowners to rectify the issue that now exists. In the words of Mr Barry Reardon from my electorate of Bonner: The government has been responsible for getting us into this mess. It has a responsibility to get us out of it. It is unacceptable for this government to claim that the extent of failures should be withheld because its release could cause unnecessary apprehension. What is causing unnecessary apprehension in the electorate is the lack of information for the public to make informed choices, particularly in relation to whether or not to remove or remediate the insulation installed under this program. I urge all members of this House to support this motion. It is in the public interest to do so. sons the government should not release information relating to inspection results at this time. I would like to spend the time that I have focusing on the steps that the government has taken to wind down the program and to deal with the issues in an open and transparent manner. On 10 March this year my colleague the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency outlined the main priorities for the government in remediating the Home Insulation Program. They included, firstly, to put in place a household inspection program, to identify and address the extent of safety and fire hazard concerns, to mitigate risk and to thereby reassure householders who have had their homes insulated under the program; secondly, to assist industry and employees adjust to the termination of the program; thirdly, to identify and put in place MAIN COMMITTEE",319,Private Members Business
346,Mr Stephen Jones (Throsby) (7.56 Pm),"The member for Page has outlined the reaprocesses to deal with issues of non-compliance and fraud; and, fourthly, to identify any failures of administrative processes within government associated with the design and implementation of the Home Insulation Program. Over the last seven months the government has made significant progress against these objectives. This was reinforced in the ANAO audit report, which stated: Substantial work is also currently being undertaken by DCCEE to rectify safety issues and address concerns raised by the many stakeholders involved in the program. In implementing the remediation programs, DCCEE has incorporated many of the lessons from Phase 2-particularly in regard to governance arrangements and bringing in program management experience to meet identified priorities. Safety remains the government’s main priority, and a comprehensive safety inspection program has been established, in which a minimum of 200,000 homes that had foil and non-foil products installed under the program will be inspected. The government has already completed over 110,000 inspections. However, a lot more difficult work is needed to be done. From the moment the government closed the Home Insulation Program on 19 February, it has been transparent in determining what went wrong and what it is to do to fix the problem. For example, the government has established and supported a number of inquiries into the program, and I will go through each of those. Firstly, there is the ANAO report. On3 March 2010 the minister requested that the Auditor General conduct an audit of the HIP. The terms of reference to this inquiry were determined by the Auditor-General, and they were able to access all relevant material, including cabinet documents. The ANAO report was tabled on 15 October this year. Secondly, there is the review of the administration of the Home Insulation Program. The review of the administration of the Home Insulation Program was commissioned by the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet to examine and report on the effectiveness of the program design, administration and delivery arrangements. It was undertaken by Dr Allan Hawke AO and completed on 6 April this year. The review identified problems in program governance, design and administration, risk management, compliance mechanisms and capacity issues. Thirdly, there was a Senate inquiry. The Senate Standing Committee on Environment, Communications and the Arts also conducted an inquiry into the program and tabled a report on 15 July. Fourthly, there were coronial inquiries. Coronial inquiries are still ongoing into the tragic loss of four people that were associated with the Home Insulation Program, and the government has agreed to provide funding for legal representation of the families associated with the coronial hearings. Fifthly, an insulation advisory panel was established. When Minister Combet assumed responsibility for the program, he was determined to seek the views of industry experts in terms of how the government should proceed with elements of the program. Consequently, he established an insulation advisory panel which included Dr Ron Silberberg, Mr Tony Arnel and Mr Peter Tighe. Sixthly, there are monthly reports. The government is also producing a monthly public report on the Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency websiteA division having been called in the House of RepresentativesMAIN COMMITTEE Sitting suspended from 8.01 pm to 8.14 pm expired. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. Daw Aung San Suu Kyi Debate resumed, on motion by Ms Saffin: That this House: (1) welcomes, on behalf of the Australian people, the release of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi from house arrest; (2) congratulates the Burmese pro-democracy movement for its steadfast resistance to military rule and ongoing campaign for democracy; (3) calls for the immediate and unconditional release of the more than 2,000 political prisoners still detained in Burma; (4) calls upon Burmese authorities to embark on a genuine process of national reconciliation and engage in dialogue with all of Burma’s ethnic groups; and (5) calls on the Australian Government to: (a) make the most of this opportunity to bring about lasting reform for Burma and its people; (b) reinforce the campaign for political reform in Burma with increased engagement through government and diplomatic channels; (c) maintain efforts to enforce a universal arms embargo against Burma; and (d) support at the highest levels of Government the efforts of Aung San Suu Kyi and her colleagues to restore democracy and peace. Ms SAFFIN (Page) (8.15 pm)-The reason I put this motion before the House in those terms is to seize the moment on the release of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi after many years of house arrest-the last period of which having been about seven years-and seize this opportunity to look at how the country and the people can move forward. As a matter of public record, I hold views and have made comments about Burma, its people and the ruling military regime; over a long period of time. I have made many comments about this issue. But, at this point in time, there is a feeling, and a willingness and a wish, particularly on behalf of the people, to say: ‘Let us all try and work together. Let us see how we can make the changes necessary in Burma. We have the international community, and friends like those in Australia, to work with us to give us that support.’ When Suu Kyi was released she came out to her house, and then the next day she spoke at the National League for Democracy headquarters and said a number of things. They were not surprising to me. They were consistent with her conciliatory approach. She, like others, knows that national reconciliation is needed in Burma, particularly to try and restore some sort of political peace and peace in other areas. She said that she wanted to speak directly and honestly with the generals who jailed her so that they could work for the betterment of the country. She has always said that, in fact. That is what she has always said. There is lots of speculation: ‘Why did they let her out at this time? What are they thinking?’ People are speculating and saying, ‘Maybe it is because the elections are over, they think that MAIN COMMITTEE",320,Private Members Business
347,The Deputy Speaker (Ms Ae Burke),"Order! The time allotted for this debate hasthat’s gone and she’ll have no influence and no power.’ I think that everyone knows better than that. She has enormous influence and enormous authority in her country. In Burma, she is simply referred to as ‘the Lady.’ That is how people talk about her. When they drive past her place on University Avenue, without her knowing people will often show absolute respect and make a gesture of respect as they drive or go past. People do not have all their hopes and aspirations in one person, but she embodies a peaceful Burma, a prosperous Burma, a Burma that is truly united. That was the Burma that her father, General Aung San, envisaged as well. I have said before that, when she went back to Burma in 1988 and spoke-for the first time very publicly-at Shwedagon Pagoda, she went there as her father’s daughter and left there as a leader in her own right. Everyone was curious and excited to see the daughter of the national hero come to speak. She means it when she says: I think we all have to work together. We will have to find a way of helping each other. She says further: I don’t believe in one person’s influence and authority to move a country forward. One person alone cannot do something as important as bringing democracy to a country. If my people are not free, how can you say I am free? We are none of us free. That brings me to the political prisoners. I note that the military regime said that there were no political prisoners in Burma, but there are political prisoners in Burma. There are over 2,000 of them. One of them who got jailed for about 93 years, Khun Htun Oo, is a leader of the Shan people’s ethnic nationalities party, the Shan Nationalities League for Democracy. He received 93 years, which just seems extraordinary, because he was a political operative too. He is in jail. There are political prisoners and we have to work to ensure that we advocate that there are no political prisoners and that they come out of jail. One other thing that Suu Kyi said is: I have been listening to the radio for six years. I think I’d like to listen to some real human voices. That is a very human and a very telling comment. That was one of the first comments she made when she came out. That brings me to Radio Australia. Radio Australia has a Burmese broadcast program. That was introduced by our government and it is something that I know gets listened to very well in Burma. In fact, it is on first thing in the morning. There are other radio programs that are broadcast into Burma, but it is early in the morning and I know that a lot of people listen to it. It is really important, particularly in countries where there are not a lot of media for them to engage in, and people do love the radio. So that is a good thing. One of the things that I would say if I could have a conversation with General Than Shwe, which is pretty hard to do, is: ‘Now is the perfect opportunity. Now is the time. You have had the elections, even though they were not free and fair. We know all about that and it is a matter of public record. They are out of the road, Aung San Suu Kyi is free and she has made it very clear that she wants to talk and work for the betterment of the country. The time is right to seize that opportunity.’ That is very difficult, particularly because military dictatorships by their very nature can become quite secretive, paranoid and fearful and can operate in a military model of command and control. That can change. He can actually change that. AmI being naive about it? No, because I have seen it in other countries. I have seen people change. I have seen dictators change. I have seen military regimes transition. We have all seen it in our MAIN COMMITTEE lifetime in many places. It can happen as well in Burma. There has been conflict there for a long time. There are a large number of ethnic nationality leaders and we need those changes to happen. I was really pleased with the response of everyone and I want to thank the people who are speaking in support of this tonight, because it is something that we all agree on. It is something where the House comes together and says, ‘This is a statement that we agree with.’ We can operate in that truly bipartisan way. I was really pleased to see that our foreign minister spoke with Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, and hopefully there will be a visit to Burma in the near future. Also, the Prime Minister sent a letter directly to her through our ambassador in Burma, stating that people in Australia support her. The motion tonight is clearly about recognising that now is the time to work smart and work well with all the leaders in Burma and work in such a way that they can give voice to their aspirations. As Aung San Suu Kyi says: ‘Please use your liberty to help us achieve ours.’ That is what we continue to do. (Time expired) moved by the member for Page. Importantly, it focuses our attention at this time on the release from house arrest of a modern-day hero, Burma’s Aung San Suu Kyi. Aung San Suu Kyi’s unwavering commitment to a democratic future for her people and her inner strength in the face of decades of repression have won respect the world over. She is today’s most conspicuous flag-bearer for Mahatma Gandhi’s doctrine of seeking political change through peaceful resistance. It was Gandhi who said: Nonviolence is the first article of my faith. It is also the last article of my creed. It has been no different for Aung San Suu Kyi. While the world rejoices in Suu Kyi’s release, it is but an incremental step on a long path to real and lasting change in Burma. How Australia and the international community responds to these recent developments will be critical. Before outlining in more detail what I consider are some of the key factors at play, it is worth recounting the life of this remarkable woman. Her family history and personal journey to this point provide an important context in which to understand her indomitable determination and resolve. Aung San Suu Kyi was born in 1945 to Aung San, commander of the Burma Independence Army, and Khin Kyi, the senior nurse of Rangoon General Hospital. Two years later, her father was assassinated, leaving her mother to become a senior public figure and later Burmese ambassador to India. Suu Kyi was educated in New Delhi and later Oxford University where she met her future husband Michael Aris. In 1965, she moved to New York first to study and then to work at the United Nations. In 1972, she married Michael Aris and travelled with him to the kingdom of Bhutan, where he was a tutor to the royal family and she worked in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. It was not until 1988 that Suu Kyi returned on a more permanent basis back to Burma to provide palliative care to her sick mother in Rangoon. In that year the resignation of the military leader of Burma, General Ne Win, sparked mass protests and Suu Kyi called publicly for multiparty elections. The National League for Democracy, the NLD, was formed that year and Suu Kyi took on the role of General Secretary. As her popularity rapidly grew, the military placed her under house arrest on 20 July 1989. Despite the restrictions placed on her, the NLD won the 1990 elections with 82 per cent of the parliament’s seats, but all to no avail. The military dictatorship denied any form of democratic government and continued the brutal suppression of Suu Kyi’s human rights. In 1991, MAIN COMMITTEE",322,Private Members Business
348,Mr Frydenberg (Kooyong) (8.25 Pm),"I rise today to speak in favour of the motionSuu Kyi received the Nobel Peace Prize but understandably rejected the military offer of free passage to receive the award and visit her family abroad knowing that she would never be allowed home. Despite all that she has suffered, including spending 15 of the last 21 years under house arrest, she remains defiant and optimistic. Even when her husband, Michael Aris, was dying of prostate cancer in 1999 and was denied permission by the Burmese government to visit her one final time, she would not be broken. We must accept this is a woman who knows her people, who knows how the international political system operates and has faith in the path that she has chosen. We in the international community therefore owe it to her and her people to do all that we can to bring pressure to bear on Rangoon’s brutal military dictatorship. In her words, ‘Please use your liberty to promote ours.’ It is a plea we cannot ignore. Australia’s response must be multifaceted and combine a series of diplomatic, economic and assistance based approaches. It must be a balanced approach and not one based solely on isolating the regime. First, we are right to place travel restrictions and financial sanctions against 453 of Burma’s leadership class. There must be a price to pay. Second, we must continue our sanctions on defence exports to Burma and encourage our international partners to adopt a similar approach. Third, a substantial aid program to Burma is important as nearly one-third of the nearly 60 million Burmese live in abject poverty. The civilian population also suffer greatly from a high incidence of HIV-AIDS and poor levels of community health and disease prevention. Problems on the ground have been compounded by natural disasters, including devastating cyclones and floods. Fourth, we must continue to expose the human rights abuses that are carried out on a large scale in Burma. As I wrote back in 2007 in an article in the Age, in Burma thousands of children are kidnapped to become child soldiers, and torture and sex slavery are used as political weapons. Despite knowledge of these tragedies, a number of countries in our region seek to preserve their economic and strategic relationships, most prominently in the energy sector as Burma has the world’s 10th largest gas reserves. These countries protect their economic and strategic relationships ahead of the more important commitment to protecting and upholding universal human rights. In this vein we must continue to call for the immediate release of the over 2,000 political prisoners held in Burma. Fifth and finally, we must combine these strategies with a policy of engagement with the Burmese hierarchy. Under President Obama the United States have moved their approach to a more active policy of engagement. They found that isolation alone did not get the desired results. This must be welcome, particularly the visit earlier this year to Rangoon by US Assistant Secretary for East Asian and Pacific Affairs Kurt Campbell. We need to work with the United States, Japan, India, Korea and our partners in ASEAN to bring about change at the top in Burma. Indonesia’s President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, SBY, has an important role to play in this regard. As a former general, as a person who knows Burma well and as the leader of ASEAN’s most powerful member, he is strategically placed to take a leadership role. Australia has a very good relationship with Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono and Indonesia. We should use our good offices with the president and his country to identify appropriate opportunities to partner with them in this important mission. The case for change in Burma is more pressing than ever. Aung San Suu Kyi’s release has given the case fresh impetus. Australia, as an important player in the region and committed as we are to protecting human rights, cannot stand idly by. I therefore support the motion and MAIN COMMITTEE support Australia playing an ever-increasing important role in bringing democratic change to Burma and protecting its people’s human rights. Ms PARKE (Fremantle) (8.34 pm)-I rise to support the member for Page’s motion. In the Quiet Land, no one can tell if there’s someone who’s listening for secrets they can sell. The informers are paid in the blood of the land and no one dares speak what the tyrants won’t stand. In the quiet land of Burma, no one laughs and no one thinks out loud. In the quiet land of Burma, you can hear it in the silence of the crowd. In the Quiet Land, no one can say when the soldiers are coming to carry them away. The Chinese want a road; the French want the oil; the Thais take the timber; and SLORC takes the spoils … In the Quiet Land… In the Quiet Land, no one can hear what is silenced by murder and covered up with fear. But, despite what is forced, freedom’s a sound that liars can’t fake and no shouting can drown. That poem is called In the Quiet Land, and it was written by Daw Aung San Suu Kyi. I thank the member for Page for her important motion regarding the release from house arrest of Aung San Suu Kyi, who I know is a close personal friend of hers. The Nobel peace prize winner and Burmese democracy leader has been the conscience of the nation in the oppressive society of Burma and a source of inspiration to people all over the world for more than two decades. The Nobel prize committee chairman, Francis Sejersted, called Aung San Suu Kyi ‘an outstanding example of the power of the powerless’. The woman who challenges one of the world’s most repressive military regimes stands only five foot four inches tall, weighs 45 kilos and has the gentlest of manners. Ms Saffin-She’s tough. ence hero General Aung San, was assassinated when she was only two years old. In 1990, she won landslide national elections in Burma as the leader of the National League for Democracy, yet she has spent 15 of the last 21 years in some form of detention. During her early years of detention, she was often in solitary confinement. She was not allowed to see her two sons or her husband, who died of cancer in March 1999. She has grandchildren she has never met. MAIN COMMITTEE",324,Private Members Business
349,Ms Parke,"I note the member for Page’s comment: she is tough. Her father, independAung San Suu Kyi has suffered these personal agonies with calm and dignified conviction and strength, famously saying: The only real prison is fear, and the only real freedom is freedom from fear. What personal suffering she has experienced, she says, cannot be compared with that of thousands of her followers who have been imprisoned, tortured or killed. Indeed, there remain more than 2,200 political prisoners in Burma, including pro-democracy activists, monks, students and journalists, who are being held in the country’s 43 prisons and in an unknown number of labour camps, many serving sentences of several decades after trials with very limited or no access to legal representation. It is important that we do not allow the welcome news of Aung San Suu Kyi’s release to cloud our sense of the ongoing misery of many Burmese people, including the many ethnic minorities. A number of commentators have remarked that, in releasing Aung San Suu Kyi, the military regime hopes to achieve international legitimacy and deflect criticism from the recent general election. Noted author on Burma Bertil Lintner has written: “It is a public relations exercise for foreign opinion after a totally fraudulent election …” Nevertheless, like his Holiness the Dalai Lama in his steadfast commitment to dialogue with China about Tibet, Aung San Suu Kyi appears committed to engagement with the regime in Burma. I note the member for Page’s comments about this being a momentous opportunity to achieve change and that this is perhaps not the time for cynicism but for positive and smart thinking. Greg Sheridan, writing in the Weekend Australian, has noted that increased engagement by Australia in Burma may consist of further aid for Burma’s people, who, he notes, currently receive ‘among the lowest aid support in the world’ at US$8 per capita. In contrast, neighbouring Laos receives US$80 per capita. As noted by the member for Page in her motion, the release from house arrest of Aung San Suu Kyi is a welcome event, and it is to be hoped that Australia can assist Burma in making the most of this opportunity to bring about lasting reform for the Burmese people. It is somewhat ironic that Aung San Suu Kyi is being asked to speak at this year’s Nobel peace prize ceremony in Oslo, which she could not attend in 1991-and it is to be hoped that she will be permitted to travel-while this year’s Nobel peace prize winner, Chinese human rights activist Liu Xiaobo, remains imprisoned and unable to attend the ceremony. I commend tonight’s motion regarding Liu Xiaobo moved by the member for Melbourne Ports. These events demonstrate how important it is that the citizens and parliaments of free countries like Australia do our best to support pro-democratic reform in other parts of the world, including China and Burma. I started with a poem from Aung San Suu Kyi and, like the members for Page and Kooyong, I will end with her plea: Please use your liberty to promote ours. Ms O’DWYER (Higgins) (8.39 pm)-I join with the members for Page, Kooyong and Fremantle in welcoming the release from detention of Aung San Suu Kyi. She has been detained, on and off, for 15 of the last 21 years. Her detention came about because of her leadership of the National League for Democracy, which won over 80 per cent of the vote in the 1990 election. Aung San Suu Kyi is a woman whose efforts to promote democracy in Burma can rightly be described as truly heroic. For as long as the Burmese military junta has attempted to cling to power through a corrupt regime that is in clear defiance of the will of the MAIN COMMITTEE Burmese people, Aung San Suu Kyi has been prepared to sacrifice personal comfort and safety in the face of a repressive regime to stand up for the democratic rights of the Burmese people. Aung San Suu Kyi, in her famous ‘freedom from fear’ speech in 1990, said: It is not power that corrupts but fear. Fear of losing power corrupts those who wield it and fear of the scourge of power corrupts those who are subject to it. Her words so accurately characterise the plight of millions of people around the world whose lives are at the mercy of a despotic government whose aims are not to enhance the welfare of the people but to consolidate their power by subverting democracy and, ultimately, destroying it. This fear has characterised tyrannous regimes throughout history and has no better characterisation than a number of the communist regimes of the 20th century. Aung San Suu Kyi’s fight for democracy is not only for the people of Burma but for everyone who suffers, or has suffered, due to the lack of democratic rights. It is fitting that a motion such as this should be moved in the Australian parliament. As a free and democratic country, Australia should show support to those who fight for freedom in a country ruled by fear and oppression. Australia has never had to fight for democracy. We are the beneficiaries of a long-established Western tradition. Yet Burma ceased to be a democracy in 1962 when General Ne Win led a military coup. This remarkable turn of events led Burma on a path to socialism and tyranny. Suu Kyi returned to Burma in 1988, originally to care for her mother, herself a prominent Burmese political figure. Her father was a famous commander of the Burma Independence Army. She came to lead the pro-democracy movement, which became particularly vocal after the retirement of General Ne Win. On 26 August 1988, she famously addressed half a million people at a mass rally in front of the Shwedagon pagoda in the capital. She was detained under house arrest in 1990, along with many others, by the newly established military junta. She was released in 1995, placed under detention again in 2000 and released in 2002. In 2003, pro-government militia attempted to assassinate her, but her driver managed to get her to safety. She was detained for a third time. Aung San Suu Kyi was willing to undergo extreme harassment, arbitrary arrest, years of home detention and an attempt on her life in order to secure democracy in Burma. She was forced to forgo a home life to fight for the freedom of her people. She was separated from her husband and her children and has never met her grandchildren. Aung San Suu Kyi’s release from prison on 13 November, after years of incarceration, represents an important step forward for democracy in Burma. For now, Aung San Suu Kyi is free to travel the country and speak to her people, reviving the pro-democracy movement. But we can be in no doubt that the regime will be observing her activities very closely. Throughout Aung San Suu Kyi’s promotion of freedom in her country she has eschewed those who have called for violent resolution. Her path, while a difficult and long one, has always been a peaceful one. This has taken great moral courage. Her commitment to peace was recognised by her award of the Nobel peace prize in 1991. Despite her recent release, there can be no doubt that the country is still tightly and brutally controlled by a military regime that cares nothing for individual rights. There are still more than 2,200 political prisoners, and these are only the prisoners we are aware of. Before the most recent election the military junta changed the constitution to stop Aung San Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy contesting the election. It is no surprise, then, that the miliMAIN COMMITTEE tary regime was returned in an election that was not free or fair. Aung San Suu Kyi deserves both our admiration and our support, and it is fitting that we pay tribute to her in the Australian parliament. expired. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. Population Debate resumed, on motion by Mr Ripoll: That this House notes that: (1) the Intergenerational Report predicts Australia’s population may reach 35.9 million by 2050; (2) population growth continues to be centred around Australia’s capital cities; (3) the electorate of Oxley contains parts of Ipswich East, one of the statistical areas that has seen the largest population increases in Australia between 2004 and 2009; (4) continuing population growth is placing pressure on the sustainability of Australian cities and the lifestyles of their residents; (5) a ‘business as usual’ approach to planning and development will no longer be sufficient for the future needs of Australian cities; (6) building Sustainable Cities must become a policy priority for all levels of government; and (7) the future sustainability of Australian cities must include a need to ‘decentralise’ the capital cities and encourage major employers, such as government department, to regional and outer urban centres. port Australia to 2050: future challenges was released. I have spoken about this report many times, and I will continue to raise issues from this very important report, because it shines a light on where we will be as an economy and as a nation in about 40 years time. Among other things, the report projected that by 2050 Australia’s population will be around 36 million. This is a projection based on middle-range population growth, but even the ABS low-growth projection suggests that Australia’s population will grow to at least 30 million by 2050. But it could be much higher, based on modelling. It is important to note that this is not a target; it is merely a projection as to where we might be. Australia’s capital cities still account for the vast bulk of population growth-in fact, nearly all of it. Almost all Australians live on the eastern seaboard in our major cities. The concentration of population in capital cities is projected to grow from 64 per cent in 2007 to 68 per cent by 2056. Of course, this will be an increase not just in the percentage but in the actual numbers as well, and it is quite significant when you take that as a totality. From 2004 to 2009, Queensland’s population grew by over half a million people, the largest growth of all the states and territories. This is, of course, why Queensland and other states like Western Australia struggle with infrastructure: because of the very fast growth in population and all the associated problems that come with it. Queensland’s average annual growth rate for 2004 to 2009 is 2.54 per cent, second only to Western Australia. I think it is pretty obvious to people reading or listening to this that these are the two booming states. The Oxley electorate, my electorate, which is really part of the Western Corridor of South East Queensland, is part of the statistical area called Ipswich East. This contains suburbs such MAIN COMMITTEE",326,Private Members Business

351,Mr Ripoll (Oxley) (8.44 Pm),"Early this year the Treasury’s 2010 intergenerational reas Springfield and the Greater Springfield region; older parts of Ipswich such as Redbank and Goodna; the Inala/Forest Lake region; and the western suburbs of Brisbane-the Centenary suburbs. This area of Ipswich East experienced average annual population increases of 7.3 per cent for the period from 2004 to 2009. This equates to nearly 20,000 people over that five year period, most of whom have probably moved into the Greater Springfield region. This place is firmly among the 10 areas with the largest population increases in Australia. Here the growth is new, and it is working well; it is welcome growth. But the population growth in Australia’s capital cities and larger regional centres is placing enormous pressure on the sustainability of our cities. The fact is that Australia’s major cities are choked. We need to acknowledge that whether it is in Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne, Perth or Adelaide-wherever it is across the major cities in Australia where the majority of people live-it is having an impact, including an impact on our lifestyle. Traffic congestion, overcrowded public transport and increased utility charges are just a few examples of the way population growth is being felt by Australians. This is not to cast some poor image of Australia as a small nation of just 22 million; it is just the reality and the fact that, as a nation that is still young, we have not quite grasped the issue of how to deal with population in urban centres. To make a comparison of what I am trying to say, I will paint a picture for you. Australia has 22 million people. The city of Tokyo has 22 million people. The reality is that development will continue in Australia; that will happen by necessity, and it must happen to accommodate our growing population. But we are not keeping pace in terms of housing. In fact, the National Housing Supply Council’s State of supply report 2010 set out that the housing shortage is currently 178,400 dwellings. That is a lot of people if you start adding that up in terms of families and people that are without. In Queensland there is a shortage of 56,000 homes, and this is exceeded only by Sydney. The projection of houses required by 2029 is 3.2 million additional homes, and I am just not sure that there is yet a collaborative approach in this country that will quite meet that challenge-although I do have to say that this government is working hard to acknowledge that and to meet that challenge. We can see from these figures that just stopping development is not the answer. Australia does need new homes and new infrastructure, and we need to in some way meet all the shortfalls that we will be facing either at the lower end, the middle area or, indeed, the higher end of population growth forecasts. But these figures are not about a pessimistic view. To me, they present us with an opportunity to build sustainable cities and to look properly at the way we deal with infrastructure and the way we live-the way that we build a home and what is seen as supposedly normal in the way we conduct ourselves. The building of sustainable cities must become a policy priority for all levels of government and, for that matter, for industry when considering Australia’s development needs. This government’s Major Cities Unit is a step in the right direction. The Major Cities Unit is working with all tiers of government, major stakeholders and the community to provide input on urban policy. We need to get the balance right. In fact, we need to get the mix right-the mix between development, lifestyle, infill developments, the release of land and the development process, which to my mind currently is just too long. It takes too long from the time somebody purchases a block of land to the time they can bring that through to somebody actually living in a house on it. We need to do better at all these levels. MAIN COMMITTEE The Major Cities Unit will also work across portfolios to provide an integrated plan in such areas as climate change, housing, and health and innovation, all of which are linked. This is the real challenge when we talk about sustainable cities. It is not just about lifestyle and having a home; it is about the transport mix, the housing, the jobs and where we work, eat, play and live, rather than just where we might live and then travel to work. This is a good start. The Major Cities Unit and Infrastructure Australia and a range of other policies that were brought on by this government are a step in the right direction, but more work needs to be done. There needs to be better regulated development, not to stymie growth but to maximise and coordinate its potential. A new estate needs to have coordinated transport and jobs, roads in, roads out and rail. That needs to be done in cooperation with industry to make sure that there are jobs where people live, that commerce has an opportunity to develop and grow where people live and that there are options to allow a greater diversity. There needs to be recognition that the business-as-usual approach of people living on the city fringes and then commuting to the city centres is completely unsustainable and will fail. It places too much pressure on our road and transport infrastructure, something which I am sure everybody in this place understands fully and appreciates every day. Most state governments have produced plans for the future development needs of their capital cities, and most target infill development-the use of land within a built up area. This will provide between 50 and 70 per cent of new housing in the future. Infill development is good and is one way of addressing development, but it is not the only way and it is not the solution. Large swathes of the inner cities cannot simply be demolished so that high-density buildings can be built. The National Housing Supply Council has found that infill development faces the major barrier of being too expensive. Base land also costs, and the particular challenge of having to accommodate existing structures means that in all of our major cities, except perhaps Sydney, it costs more to build a two-bedroom unit at an infill location than it does to build an equivalent three-bedroom house with a backyard in a greenfield site. There are many challenges ahead and many more things that we can do. Living in highdensity inner city regions may be attractive to some, but is not the only solution for all Australians. There are many families who still want to live within a reasonable distance of the lifestyle of the city and all of the facilities that it brings but want to have a yard and parksaccess to a lifestyle that is affordable and also access to work. This can only happen on the fringes of our cities and in the regions. The future sustainability of Australia’s cities must include a need to decentralise, and this is where I think there has been a real breakdown between the three tiers of government. This is new stuff. In a lot of ways, planning to deal with these issues is no more than perhaps a few years old. In the past cities just grew and developed at their own pace, based on whatever local government authorities decided might happen or where governments might have spent some infrastructure money. The aim should be to get people to work, to play, to study, to go to the doctor and to have facilities and shops all within walking distance of where they live. Leading demographer Bernard Salt calls this plan a mosaic city of self-contained regions, where the majority of people have a 15to 20-minute commute instead of one hour or more. For people who live in Sydney that is sometimes two hours. The key to achieving this is to decentralise the jobs. Major employers such as government departments and industry ought to be encouraged to move to suburban and regional centres. MAIN COMMITTEE There is much more that can be done in this area. I am doing all I can by highlighting the issues here but also by talking to ministers and looking at a holistic approach to how we can achieve this. We can get the balance right, whether we have 30 million, 36 million or 50 million people by 2050. We have a great opportunity to have real control not over the number of people who live in this country by 2050 but over the sort of lifestyle they achieve by that time. (Time expired) Australia’s population will reach almost 36 million by the year 2050. We are undoubtedly in an age of growth and will be for the foreseeable future. From a personal perspective this makes me consider that when my 17-year-old son, Charlie, reaches my current age, our nation’s population will have increased by 60 per cent. Are we making suitable preparations for this kind of increase? As our population grows, will our nation grow with it? Like any worthwhile business, do we have a master plan for our own development? It should be a government’s obligation to plan for the future and make provision for such growth. Our world will not end at 2050, hopefully, but it is becoming increasingly apparent that there is a genuine absence of federal policy designed to seek the most efficient development and population spread for our country. Sometimes it appears that our population increase has taken us by surprise, with more and more people simply shifting into two major cities, and no incentive to look beyond. At a meeting of town planners recently, one commented, ‘Had we known Sydney was going to grow like this, we would have planned very differently.’ This has brought us to a point of paralleling the perils that plagued the major northern cities of the United States in the seventies, choking on their overpopulation and insufficient infrastructure, the cost of living and the cost of doing business rising to a breaking point, and crime rising as more and more people could not afford to live in their own cities. A shift occurred through a huge investment in infrastructure, resulting in a new wave of growth and enormous migration to what is now referred to as the sunbelt, stretching from Florida to California. In particular, the population of Atlanta, Georgia, grew 60 per cent in just 20 years, from 1960 to 1980, preceded by an intensive campaign of road, rail, airport and housing developments together with an active chamber of commerce that attracted big businesses to relocate their headquarters to Atlanta to enjoy cheaper running costs whilst providing an improved quality of life for their employees. In quick succession, businesses recognised the advantages of relocating to the southern regions. The arguments were comprehensive and have stood the test of time in providing companies with greater efficiency and a competitive edge. Businesses and families were attracted as a result of the master planning that had taken place. The highways and airports were built in anticipation of future needs rather than just trying to keep up with existing needs. This helped to facilitate growth, to the point that Atlanta’s international airport is now the busiest in the world. Over recent times we have witnessed Australia’s acceleration at a furious rate without any form of master plan. Development has been ad hoc, leading to haphazard housing construction and insufficient transport infrastructure. It could be argued that Sydney and Melbourne have already gone past the need for strategic master planning because we were travelling too fast and simply missed the signpost. Without genuine master planning of our nation, the disproportionate growth of the major cities has occurred while regional areas have been left behind. Maximum efficiency will be achieved through the construction of vital infrastructure MAIN COMMITTEE",329,Private Members Business
352,Mr Alexander (Bennelong) (8.55 Pm),"The Intergenerational Report predicts thatservices just in time to meet current needs. This is a far better option than the current scenario we witness in our major cities whereby the available services are not even coming close to meeting current needs. The greatest problems facing our major cities, especially Sydney, are the cost of living, which is directly attached to the cost of doing business, and the quality of life that this cost affords. The electorate of Bennelong that I represent is a perfect example of a concentration of all of the factors that impinge on this quality of life: overdevelopment, overpopulation and infrastructure not keeping pace. If we had had appropriate master planning, and just-in-time infrastructure construction had occurred, all the needs of today’s population and into the future would have been catered for in the most efficient and effective way possible.

Flinders Electorate: Community Services not the usual types of grievances, where we are casting blame upon one level of government or another. They are grievances in relation to the legitimate concerns of different community groups which need to be addressed, and now is the moment to turn and address those points of disadvantage. The first is in relation to the You Are My Sunshine Foundation and the cause of young children who suffer from neuroblastoma. It is a condition of which I was not aware previously. My exposure to the condition came about as a consequence of discussions I had with Judi Donahoo on the Mornington Peninsula and also on Phillip Island recently. WhilstI was there she explained to me that she had lost her young granddaughter, Kahlilla, or Lilly, at age five. Lilly was a beautiful young girl who had suffered from neuroblastoma. With so many of these young children, 60 per cent of cases in the late stages will not live. As the father of a five-year-old, I found this quite extraordinary. Judi is setting out to raise money for awareness of this condition to help train doctors in early stage diagnosis. At this stage, late stage treatment is not successful in many cases. Early stage diagnosis is the best way to find a cure. In honour of her granddaughter, Judi and her family and others helped to set up the You Are My Sunshine Foundation. It was launched on Phillip Island in September 2009. To date, it has raised over $70,000 towards early diagnosis and a cure for neuroblastoma. This condition accounts for about 15 per cent of childhood deaths. I applaud the work which is being done. I ask that many members of this House contribute to and look at how they can highlight the work of the You Are My Sunshine Foundation in their own electorates. It is a worthy cause.

Hastings, as part of the work of Frankston/Peninsula Carers, has been selected as the site for a new community housing project. It is the Hastings model. It came about because of the process of deinstitutionalisation-a worthy goal. But the deinstitutionalisation of many people who were part of psychiatric facilities in Victoria, New South Wales and right across Australia was not accompanied by an appropriate mid-stage transition path. What we need in Australia at this moment in time is a very strong movement towards supported accommodation. That is the Hastings model. They have a small number of people who have particular adult disability needs in a supported environment, with assistance to live there, with assistance to develop and with assistance to maintain their condition. As part of this process, 13 of the 20 homes will go to the aged and families on low to moderate incomes. Seven of the 20 homes will be available for intellectually and physically disabled adults. The problem that elderly carers face is real, significant and profound. Many of them live in great fear of death or incapacity and of their adult child with a disability being left to fend for himor herself. This is not a fault for which any government should be held to account. It is a failure to recognise that the deinstitutionalisation process in and of itself was not enough. This is the moment when, as a nation, we have to turn towards recognition that supported accommodation does not represent reinstitutionalisation; it represents the necessary minimum of support for people who live, in many circumstances, on the fringes; who require additional assistance; who require support; and who require maintenance. It is this process of supported accommodation which the Hastings model has set up. Karl Hell-who, sadly, passed away over the course of the past year-was one of its founders, along with Joy and David Jarman. I know Joy and David well, and I knew Karl well. All of them have been concerned about their own children-adults with disabilities. They should be very proud of their work, and Karl’s family should be very proud of what he has achieved. The Hastings model will, I believe, spread around the country and provide a form of supported accommodation. We worked hard to get the support of the state and federal governments after we fell out of office, and I thank those at both levels who were able to assist. I am delighted that the building, which is within 100 metres of my office in Hastings, has already begun. I can see the progress every week as I return from parliament, or on any one day if I am in and about my electorate office. That leads me to a third group which is in need of assistance: Phillip Island farmers. The farmers went through the period of drought, they coped well and they managed their water resources. Now, unfortunately, because of a broader, overarching state policy, those within the Bass Coast Shire Council have been greatly concerned by rate rises of up to 200 per cent within five years. The rates apply to farms on land within the Bass Coast Shire. It is not the shire’s fault; it is the fact that the shire has not been appropriately resourced for the challenges of a low rate base with a massively high rate of growth. Some individual rates have risen by more than $10,000. This has crippled farmers. We do not think it is fair or appropriate. The state should ensure that there are equalisation payments to the Bass Coast commensurate with its rate of growth, not just its population level. That is extremely important. I grieve for our farmers and seek assistance and relief for them by saying to the state government of the day, whoever it may be after this Saturday, that there must be a process of equalisation for the Bass Coast, particularly for the farmers who mainMAIN COMMITTEE tain the green wedge land which makes Phillip Island and the Bass Coast such a beautiful place. China chill’s was an isolated voice warning of the need to rearm and to stand up to the resurgent power of Nazi Germany. Most famous was his criticism of Neville Chamberlain’s appeasement of Adolf Hitler. In a speech to the House of Commons, he bluntly and prophetically stated: You were given the choice between war and dishonour. You chose dishonour, and you will have war. I usually follow the law of argumentation which rules that the first person to mention the Nazis automatically loses any argument. In this speech I will not focus on the horrors of Nazism or seek to compare any country to Nazi Germany or any policy to that of the Nazis. Rather, I will speak of Churchill’s view on how democratic nations of the world should conduct their foreign policies when faced with a rising giant and potential rival and how these views have relevance today. It is undoubtedly the case that, in the context of the current financial crisis and the induced weakness of Western countries, the modern-day rising giant is China, which has begun to flex its muscles as never before. Almost every significant country is struggling to come to terms with China’s increasingly aggressive diplomacy, while quietly and with too little scrutiny China has been acquiring ever greater military capabilities. Countries to have felt the Chinese diplomatic blowtorch include: France, due to pro-Tibetan, pro-democracy protests during the Olympic torch relay; Vietnam, due to territorial disputes; Japan, due to the arrest of the Chinese fishermen in disputed waters; Norway, due to the deliberations of the Nobel Committee; and of course Australia, due to the failed Chinalco takeover of Rio Tinto and the subsequent unjust imprisonment of Australian citizen, Rio executive Stern Hu, shamefully given up by his company. China’s approach has essentially been to use economic and other consequences to suppress any criticism of its policies. Indeed, in many countries including Australia there have been voices openly advocating a policy whereby Australia should not say anything likely to aggravate China. Somewhat similarly in the 1930s, there were those who thought the best path was to say nothing which could provoke a bellicose Germany. Mr Churchill was full of contempt for those of this view and in one speech he said: I hear it said sometimes now-that we cannot allow the Nazi system of dictatorship to be criticized by ordinary, common English politicians. For Churchill, a submissive policy of noncriticism would simply lead to more and greater impositions. He said: I foresee and foretell that the policy of submission will carry with it restrictions upon the freedom of speech and debate in Parliament, on public platforms, and discussions in the Press… Then, with a Press under control, in part direct but more potently indirect, with every organ of public opinion doped and chloroformed into acquiescence, we shall be conducted along further stages of our journey. In Churchill’s time ‘national sovereignty’ was used by dictators as a shield for international criticism of their policies. To this Churchill said: MAIN COMMITTEE",333,Grievance Debate

Words all countries should remember when deciding how to respond to the actions of nondemocratic states. Each year the Pentagon makes a report to congress called Military and security developments including involvement of the People’s Republic of China. Its 2010 edition makes concerning reading. Here is a taste. It says: China is developing and fielding large numbers of advanced medium-range ballistic and cruise missiles, new attack submarines equipped with advanced weapons, increasingly capable long-range air defense systems, electronic warfare and computer network attack capabilities, advanced fighter aircraft, and counter-space systems. … … … In total China’s military budget will be estimated to be US$150 Billion, far surpassing any other country, except for the United States. Other than within the five walls of the Pentagon, in my view, too little attention has been given to the growth of Chinese military power. In a paper which won the Secretary of Defense’s National Security Essay Competition, Australian Brigadier General John Frewen wrote that China’s intention to launch its first aircraft carrier within five years could be potentially a source of instability in the Asia-Pacific. In his words: The unintended consequences of Chinese carriers pose the greatest threat to regional harmony in the decades ahead., Another game-changing weapon is China’s Russian designed ‘carrier killer’, dubbed the ‘Sizzler’ by NATO. Newsweek recently ran a front-page article on the Sizzler. Apparently, it can ‘reach farther and fly faster than the West’s top antiship missiles in the America’s Harpoon and France’s Exocet’. The article continued: China sees missiles such as the Sizzler-and a missile currently in development known as the Dong Feng (DF)-21D-as key to its growing naval power in Asia… [it] could turn part of China’s sub fleet from a manageable threat to a “very problematic” one … according to John Patch, Professor at US Army War College. In Churchill’s day it was not the development of new missiles but the development of long range aircraft which was upending previous military calculations. As he said then: The Navy was the “sure shield” of Britain. As long as it is ready in time and at its stations we could say to any foreign Government: ‘Well, what are you going to do about it?’ We cannot say that now. This cursed, hellish invention and development of war from the air has revolutionised our position. I certainly hope Western defence agencies are provided with the means to develop a reliable countermeasure to these new missiles because, if such a countermeasure is not produced, then one day, like Churchill, we may be cursing this ‘hellish invention’, but we will be referring to it as the DF-21D. Similarly, parallel to Chinese military developments we see the development of Beijing’s ‘string of pearls’ strategy the development of Chinese ports throughout the Indian Ocean, from Gwadar on the Arabian Sea in Pakistan to Hambantota in southern Sri MAIN COMMITTEE Lanka to Chittagong in the Bay of Bengal. All of these are a part of an integrated, energetic, expanded naval strategy. Democratic nations must speak out for what is right-for human rights and for democracy-and support one another when pressure is brought to bear on them. I believe that, rather than making conflict more likely, if democratic countries form a united front and hold true to our convictions, conflict will be less likely, as China and other non-democratic countries will not be emboldened by easy diplomatic victories. I believe the Obama administration’s diplomacy towards China over the past year provides an example of how to handle relations with China. Throughout 2009 the US accommodated China in the hope of gaining cooperation; little was achieved. This year, however, seeking to engage China as much as it can, the US has stood firm on a number of important issues. It has backed Google’s stance on censorship. It has backed Liu Xiaobo’s Nobel Peace Prize, making him a bigger celebrity. Most recently, the US has stood strongly with its democratic allies, stating that mutual defence treaties with Japan embraced the disputed islands. In my view, Australia has not always managed its relationship with China as well as the United States has this year. I believe, however, that Foreign Minister Rudd’s zhengyou China policy is the one that Mr Churchill would respect. It is based on dialogue and constructive criticism rather than appeasement. Mr Rudd described the zhengyou as: … a relationship of mutual respect, but we’re also able to talk about the things on which we have different views without threatening the underpinning relationship. I note that another important part of Mr Rudd’s foreign policy when he was Prime Minister was to acquire 12 powerful Australian submarines for Australia’s defence. This is a policy which I supported when Mr Rudd announced the plan, and I continue to support it into the future in the national security interests of Australia. Zhengyou is about respect, and I certainly do not think China will be less respectful of us for being so well defended. The New York Times recently reported that China had formally asked European nations and Australia to boycott the Oslo ceremony at which the Nobel Peace Prize would be awarded in absentia to the imprisoned Chinese democracy activist Liu Xiaobo. I think it is an important moment in the West’s relationship with China. Either weakness can be shown or a strong stand can be made. The response to such an outrageous demand should be for all countries to make a point of sending high-level representatives. If they do not, and they bow to the Chinese demands, then a statement made by Mr Churchill in the wake of the German invasion of Czechoslovakia will again have currency: … the terrible words have for the time being been pronounced against the Western democracies. Thou are weighed in the balance and found wanting. remind the member for Melbourne Ports of the provisions of standing order 64, which indicates that he ought not to refer to the former Prime Minister-or for that matter, any other member-by his name and should use his title.

359,Mrs Mirabella (Indi) (9.17 Pm),"I rise to speak about a very pressing issue and continue to make everyday life quite an anxious event for so many individuals and so many families. As I spoke to people right across my electorate during the course of the election campaign and since then, there was one theme that resonated time and time again, and that was the rising cost of living. Victorians have experienced extraordinary increases in the general cost of living under both state and federal Labor governments, which are simply out of touch and out of control. Not a day goes by that my constituents are not failed by both Premier Brumby and Prime Minister Gillard. There are a number of things that feed into the general cost of living. As we know, interest rates are a key factor and, as we have seen over the last couple of years, this government have lost total control over interest rates and have lost total control over their spending. They are addicted to spending not millions but billions. It is as if they have a tube feeding their very survival through their addiction to extraordinary spending. That is putting pressure on interest rates out there in the marketplace. They might try and claim in public that they are doing something about banks, for example, and that they are trying and working to increase competition but, as we all know, this is all talk. They are behind the game on this and they were highly embarrassed by the coalition’s comprehensive nine-point plan. They are trying-not very well-to play catch-up, but it is too late and we know that. The once great Labor Party that, as Beazley Snr had said, used to be full of the cream of the working class was now full of the dregs of the middle class. The Labor Party has gone even further and has been hijacked by the extreme Left. It is clear now that, while Labor might be in government, the Greens are most definitely in power. This is not good for country Australians and this is not good for every single individual and every single family that is suffering with ever-increasing costs of living. A party that used to stand up for the working family is now standing up for the elitist ideology of the inner-city Left. A party that used to represent the concerns of the Aussie battler is now representing the political activists who will, inevitably, spell the downfall of the modern-day Labor Party. I mentioned before that Victorian families are amongst those who have been hardest hit by the increasing cost of living in the last few years. I think we need to look at some important details and figures. If you take one particular cost, the price of electricity in Victoria, under the Howard government in 2003-04 there was a zero per cent increase, in 2004-05 there was a fall in the price, in 2005-06 we saw a 0.1 per cent increase and in 2006-07 we saw a 1.2 per cent increase. After the election of the Rudd-Gillard government in 2007-08 we saw a whopping increase in electricity prices in Victoria of 9.3 per cent, and it got even worse in the following year, rising by a massive 13.3 per cent. This was and continues to be hugely damaging to many Victorians and many families. In the following year, 2009-10, there was a 15.5 per cent increase. These are extraordinary increases. It is one thing for the Prime Minister to stand up in front of cameras and say she is concerned about the increased cost of living; it is another thing to understand what pressures drive prices up and cause families to go without. During the election campaign I am sure that Labor supporters across the country breathed a collective sigh of relief when the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister emphatically ruled out a carbon tax. After dealing with such sharp increases in electricity prices during the first term of a Labor government, the prospect of a tax that would further compound prices would have definitely pushed families over the edge. On 16 August, when the Prime Minister said, ‘There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead,’ people believed her. Again, MAIN COMMITTEE when she was asked the question on the day before the election, the Prime Minister categorically stated, ‘I rule out a carbon tax,’ and she was lying at the time. She said anything that she knew would help her get elected. Who will suffer at the end of the day? Ordinary Australians who are struggling, who are at the margins now-they are the ones who will suffer because of this Prime Minister’s vanity and desire to win at any cost. If people were in any doubt about the Prime Minister’s words, her deputy sealed the deal when he said on 15 August: Well, certainly what we rejected is this hysterical allegation that somehow we are moving towards a carbon tax … So anyone who even raised doubt that the Prime Minister was genuine was called hysterical, and these were the Treasurer’s words. What is hysterical is that just one month after the Prime Minister said, ‘I rule out a carbon tax,’ when she was asked again she said: I think the rule in, rule out games are a little bit silly. AndI am sure when she said that she tilted her head, very ‘Kernotesque’, from side to side and gave a little girly giggle, as if that was to excuse her very serious responsibilities of ruling for all Australians and looking after their concerns and their welfare, and that includes doing everything in her power as Prime Minister to keep prices down. Is it any wonder that Labor’s popularity is at an all-time low, is it any wonder that union chiefs are warning Labor about the Greens’ rising power and is it any wonder that Australia has lost all faith in Labor’s ability to make basic decisions regarding easing cost-of-living pressures? Labor might be in government, but the Greens are in power. This could not be more true than at the federal level. And it may be-and I hope not-replicated at the state level in Victoria. Last Wednesday the Prime Minister wrote a piece for the Sydney Morning Herald entitled Carbon price now or we’ll pay later. The article captured the political reality of the modern Labor Party: no heart, no soul and certainly no integrity; say one thing before the election and do the exact opposite afterwards. I would have thought that the Prime Minister would have taken a hint from the failure of Copenhagen. It makes no rational sense to impose a growth limiting tax on Australia’s entire economy before the rest of the world moves in that direction. A carbon tax now would destroy jobs, send investment offshore and further increase the cost of electricity. Essentially, what the Prime Minister’s article said was, ‘Let me make you pay more for electricity now or you’ll have to pay more for power later.’ It is one of those Orwellian arguments that we have come to associate with this particular Prime Minister. It was like reading talking points straight out of Senator Brown’s office. After three years of astronomical increases in electricity prices, not to mention the rising cost of groceries and out of control interest rates, the last thing that people in my electorate in the outer suburbs of metropolitan centres and in country Australia want or can afford is a carbon tax. There is more than one way to achieve our goal of reducing emissions by five per cent-a goal that I might add is a bipartisan commitment. Just like there is more than one way to deliver universal and affordable broadband-also a bipartisan commitment-there is a better way. The Prime Minister will not take the hint. She will not look at a better way. In her vanity and her stubbornness, she is digging in her heels and refusing to consider other options, MAIN COMMITTEE whether for the reduction of emissions or the introduction of better communications. You would think that she would have learnt from the failures of her immediate predecessor but she has not. You would think that after President Obama dropped his plans for a carbon tax that the Prime Minister would reconsider. But it is not her decision anymore; it is the decision of the Greens. As Victorians go to the polls this weekend, they face another very real choice: a coalition government committed to reducing the pressure on families or another Labor-Greens alliance. (Time expired) Light Rail Study Tour Ms GRIERSON (Newcastle) (9.27 pm)-I would like to share with the House some of the experiences and outcomes arising from a recent study trip that I undertook in June and July of this year. The purpose of the overseas study was to have direct briefings about and to view first hand the operation of modern light rail systems in Dublin, Montpellier and Bordeaux with a view to preparing a working paper on the suitability of a light rail system for Newcastle, the city that I represent in the Commonwealth Parliament of Australia. All three cities selected have similar population catchments to Newcastle and, like Newcastle, both Bordeaux and Montpellier are regional cities. Montpellier is located two hours inland from the major coastal city of Marseilles. The French light rail systems that I inspected were designed by Alstom and the Dublin Luas system was designed by Sinclair Knight Merz as part of a consortium. I would like to acknowledge the assistance of the Newcastle office of SKM and also of Alstom Australia president and managing director Chris Raine and sales director Mr Jean de la Chapelle in organising briefings and inspections. I acknowledge with gratitude the briefing prepared and delivered by Michael Sheedy and Danny Vaughan-respectively the director of light rail and the operations manager of the Railway Procurement Agency in Dublin-and the assistance of Ben Dunne from the Irish parliament, who gave me a tour on the Luas. In particular, I also thank Mr Gerald Kowalski, the customer director for Alstom Transport for the cities and local authorities of France, and Mr Jean de la Chapelle, Alstom Transport’s platform director and tender manager, for their individual briefings and guided inspections of, respectively, the Montpellier and Bordeaux light rail networks. Their willingness to consider the many questions that I put to them and their generous hospitality was very much appreciated. In this debate tonight I do not have enough time to cover my entire study tour, but I would like to share some of my conclusions and some of the features of Newcastle that recommend it, in my view, for an urban renewal approach that includes light rail. First, though, it is important to state upfront that light rail has been an important part of the solution adopted by European governments to ageing infrastructure, urban decline and the need to cut carbon emissions. In the three cities I visited the light rail systems were successful drivers of population, productivity and public transport growth. As Australia faces the challenge of making its cities more sustainable, more productive and more liveable, light rail has a major part to play. I regret that we lag behind in this area, but the good news is that cities like Adelaide, Hobart and the Gold Coast are preparing for light rail as an important part of their urban redevelopment. I hope the city of Newcastle will one day join them. In my study report I state the following conclusions. An integrated approach to urban planning and design in each case study has delivered effective light rail networks, which facilitated urban consolidation and renewal, CBD regeneration and population and economic MAIN COMMITTEE growth. An integrated approach to transport planning and urban planning maximised the effectiveness of all modes of public transport-bus, light rail and heavy rail-in the case studies. An effective, integrated transport and urban planning approach to light rail networks directly addressed ways to facilitate increased cycling and walking. In France, funding support from the national government was dependent on cooperation across municipal governments. Whereas attempts to amalgamate local governments had not been pursued, the conditional funding approach provided an important impetus to planning across council boundaries and cross-council cooperation. This measure would be very applicable to the Australian setting and indeed to my region, which has several councils impacting upon transport routes. The European Union provided one-off funding for the three light rail systems linked to the need to reach emission reduction targets. The emission reduction targets set by the European Union were important policy settings for the success of funding for light rail networks. Clearly, setting targets and introducing a price on carbon are important steps in attaining financial viability for light rail networks and systems. As an incentive for passenger take-up of light rail in Dublin, the national government made the purchasing of an annual pass a tax deduction, reducing an individual’s gross salary and therefore taxable income by the amount of the annual pass. This is an incentive that I think should be considered for implementation in Australia wherever light rail systems are introduced, particularly in the initial phase of operation. The French cities successfully introduced light rail systems in a way that proactively reduced car usage and carbon emissions. Car parking was prohibited in many areas or was severely restricted. The pricing of parking was set to discourage car use. Light rail was given complete planning priority over vehicular transport. Urban planning in Australia, of course, has a long way to go to fully embrace such an important ethos. The Bordeaux and Montpellier approach was more strategic and holistic than the Dublin approach. Interestingly, the Dublin system suffered from a lack of agreement between two municipal governments. Where have we heard that before? But plans had been prepared to remedy that situation. In both Montpellier and Bordeaux, there was a commitment to delivering a significant network, sufficient to be a catalyst for the desired environmental and economic outcomes. In all three cities visited, light rail is embraced by the public as affordable, safe, flexible and convenient transportation and is seen as an acceptable alternative to car transport. It was frequently described to me as middle-class transport. However, in observing the three systems in operation clearly they were all providing transport solutions to a diverse client base. Initial capital infrastructure costs are unlikely to be recoverable in a simple financial inputoutput model. However, a holistic cost-benefit analysis that takes into account the cost of factors such as urban congestion, car emissions, road maintenance and accidents as well as the ‘opportunity cost’ of the negative impact of poor transport facilities on economic growth and urban renewal would be important to any feasibility study for the construction of light rail networks. While it is unrealistic to expect to recover initial capital investment for major light rail networks, it is important to cover operating costs and move towards a profit-making enterprise. These conclusions provide guidance, I would suggest, to underpin the design and construction of light rail networks. The light rail networks that I have studied in Bordeaux, MontpelMAIN COMMITTEE lier and Dublin were truly inspiring. They showed what can be achieved when a multidisciplinary and cross-government approach is applied to the challenges of regenerating cities, providing urban consolidation, greater sustainability and effective transport solutions that reduce emissions. In each of these cities the population has increased markedly, and economic growth has been a strong feature of the new modern transport networks. I am a strong advocate for such an approach in the city I represent, Newcastle. Newcastle is a regional city which has experienced CBD decline over the past two decades. The success of both the Building Better Cities redevelopment project and the popularity of large suburban shopping malls contributed to this decline. But in Newcastle the CBD decline was exacerbated by the 1989 earthquake that saw the major regional hospital, the Royal Newcastle Hospital, seriously damaged and eventually replaced by a new hospital, the John Hunter Hospital, in a suburban area. Other large employers like Energy Australia also abandoned their CBD locations and relocated in suburban areas. Some in our city suggest that in spite of the success of the Honeysuckle precinct along the harbour front, the heavy rail spur line that separates the harbour from the CBD retail area acts as a barrier to CBD regeneration and new investment into the CBD. However, for others the heavy rail is the major arterial link to the growing commuter areas of Maitland and the Central Coast. Undeniably, with competing needs and opposing viewpoints, finding a way forward has been difficult. Over 30 transport reports have been prepared by the state government but an integrated approach to transport and planning is some way off. As the federal member for Newcastle, I have a responsibility for some areas of development proposed in Newcastle. In particular, the expansion of the university into a larger CBD campus is, from my viewpoint, an important anchor project, one that I believe will not only increase retention rates and improve the student experience but also provide an employment anchor for the city, increase population and visits into the CBD and thereby increase the demand for all services including retail, hospitality, personal, financial and transport. After completing a light rail study overseas, I am convinced that the other project that will lead to CBD regeneration and urban consolidation is a light rail network in Newcastle. Since the election I have been working with three local experts in transport and urban planning to test the assumptions regarding light rail against a Newcastle context. Our preliminary work does suggest that a light rail system in Newcastle would be appropriate for the city. In particular it offers a way forward that would overcome the disconnect between the harbour and the CBD retail area and would offer a rapid link between the two university campuses. For Newcastle, light rail would make it easier for everyone to enjoy the city’s great lifestyle, it would breathe a new life into the Newcastle’s growth corridors and light rail would link our knowledge and people centres with smart transport for the 21st century. Lonely Planet recently chose Newcastle as the ninth best city to visit in its Best in Travel 2011. When you visit Newcastle you would be struck by the work of Renew Newcastle, which is activating empty shops with creative enterprises. You would marvel at our working harbour, beautiful beaches and the friendly nature of the people. We are an earthy city with a great future. It is my belief that a new city-wide light rail network would be an important driver and catalyst for the city of Newcastle to realise its potential as one of the country’s best citiesprosperous, sustainable and liveable. MAIN COMMITTEE I look forward to the discussion paper on our urban environment and cities to be released by Minister Albanese later this year and see it as an important first step to realising a better future for Newcastle. I also look forward to releasing the working paper prepared with some resident experts before the end of the year. Murray-Darling Basin Dr STONE (Murray) (9.38 pm)-As we know, the Murray-Darling Basin is very much in the news at the moment, with people considering the needs of environment, agriculture and communities. The point is that each element is dependent on the other. If you have the environment in a bad condition, quite obviously farmers, who depend on natural resources for their agribusiness production, would also be in great strife. I want to talk about the fact that we need to manage the environmental flows in the Murray-Darling Basin just as carefully as farmers manage their irrigation water. It is not just a case of saying, ‘Here is 7,000 gigalitres or 3,000 gigalitres and that is going to solve the problems of the Murray-Darling Basin river system.’ I know in metropolitan Australia some people just focus on the number and say to themselves, ‘The job must be right because we have committed a certain volume of water,’-end of story. Unfortunately it is the beginning of the story in how the basin ends up, hopefully with a sustainable ecosystem and agribusiness production into the long-term because, quite frankly, no country in the world can now afford to destroy its agriculture base. No country like Australia, which depends on food production not only for domestic consumption but also for export can afford to deliberately and callously do away with the major means of production in the biggest agricultural sector in Australia, the Murray-Darling Basin. Some two out of every five meals in Australia-if you want to think about in that context-are grown in the Murray-Darling Basin. The environmental flows have long been considered in the whole scene, as evidenced by when they were first allocated. In fact, the first environmental flow to the Murray and northern Victorian wetlands was in 1979, quite some time ago. We had in 1993 the Murray-Darling Basin Ministerial Council allocating an annual 100 gigalitres to the Barmah-Millewa Forest for environmental flow. Environmental water allocations have been used since then in 1998, 2000, 2002, 2005-06. We had a very serious drought in the recent period but now with the rains we have an excellent opportunity to back up floods with environmental flow in the year 2010. The tragedy is that the Barmah-Millewa Forest, which is of course the biggest red gum forest in the world, including 26,958 hectares of freshwater wetlands, is at the moment experiencing the worse blackwater event that anyone has seen in the last 200 years. We have experienced that blackwater event for the last 2½ months. What that means is that you have deoxygenated water, you have excellent tannin levels so high that the Murray crays, an endangered species, are now exiting the river because they can. They are actually crawling up the sides of the banks and into the forest. They are transparent, meaning that they have been starving for some time, and people presume the dead fish are on the bottom of the water. We had a very serious blackwater event on the Wakool River one month or so ago. In that very tragic outcome, in the south-west of New South Wales, tens of thousands of native fish were killed, including 30-year-old breeding Murray cod, another endangered species. The president of Wakool River Association says he has seen dead Murray cod floating in the river and he feared hundreds of kilometres could be affected by that blackwater event. The point MAIN COMMITTEE about that event is that it could have been avoided or made less serious by an environmental flow being put down at the right time to dilute the blackwater that was killing the wildlife. The water became anoxic, low on oxygen, and the fish suffocated. We have a serious problem and yet the locals were not able to activate a dilution flow in time to save those breeding cod. In the Barmah Forest as we speak you might wonder why there is the worse blackwater event in anyone’s memory. That is because, sadly, a forest like the Barmah-Millewa is not just a great series of gum trees, red gums in this case, growing over 68,000 hectares. It also consists of a lot of streams, lagoons, wetlands and the great Moira grasslands. Unfortunately over time there have been different watering regimes where we now see the partial environmental flooding over the years causing a greater growth of red gums choking a lot of the natural channels of waterways. We have also seen as a consequence more canopy and a huge build-up in leaf litter. In the past, in times when Indigenous Australians, including the Yorta Yorta and the Bangerang, were in control, managing and owning this area, they undertook regular cold burns. They did mosaic burning all through the forest and they kept down this huge leaf litter on the forest floor. Unfortunately they are no longer managing what they once did. When the cattlemen took over some grazing in the forest, they too did some mosaic burning, copying the Indigenous practices. Now there is no cold burning of any real description occurring in the Barmah-Millewa Forest and so one estimation is that there have been about 20 tonnes of leaf litter per hectare accumulating. When you put a huge flow of water over that, you have disaster. You have the biggest blackwater event that has ever been recorded, as I have said. That has led to the huge loss of wildlife, particularly the Murray crays, an endangered species which at the moment should not be harvested at all. They are moving into their breeding cycle. They are up on the edges of the banks and moving to the forest and dying. We have the grasslands that have been inundated by this blackwater dying because the vegetation that is inundated by this toxic water cannot survive. We have a whole range of endangered species in the forest, including the straw necked ibis and the Australian white ibis, the yellow billed spoonbills, great cormorants and so on, which has led this to be a Ramsar listed wetland. WhatI am saying is that in the Guide to the proposed basin plan there has to be an understanding that we need skill and expertise in managing the environmental flows in the various icon sites across the basin. We do not have that skill anymore. The flood event in the Barmah Forest was avoidable. The blackwater was observed; it could have been diluted so that we did not have the massive kill that is now occurring in that ecosystem. Indeed, we should have been having the cold burns in the way that the Indigenous Australians did their burning, which kept the leaf litter under control and made sure that the Moira grasslands remained open and, therefore, a great habitat for a great range of waterbirds and marsupials. Unfortunately, we have neglected to bring those skills forward into the 21st century. The Murray-Darling Basin Plan must balance community, environment, irrigator and critical human needs in a plan which delivers us into the 22nd century and beyond. If we do not have skilled environmental flow management, if we do not take a hard look at how we currently manage environmental flows that have already been dedicated to the system-there are hundreds of gigalitres right now in store for the environment-if that work is not done then we are going to see more devastation, not less, as the years go by. Barmah Forest regularly supports 20,000 or more waterbirds. At the moment it is a stinking, toxic mess. You do not want to walk in the water. People have been warned in the media not to let the water touch MAIN COMMITTEE them downstream in the Murray and Edwards rivers. We are now approaching the peak tourist period, when people would normally be going boating, waterskiing and fishing in those stretches of the Murray. They are now being warned that the water is toxic. Blackwater events are natural, everyone concedes that, but not on the scale that is now affecting the great Barmah-Millewa Forest. Sadly, it was avoidable with proper management and understanding. We have to make sure, therefore, that we take the opportunity we have right now to take the Guide to the proposed basin plan and make it a reasonable guide through the various reviews of that plan that are going on. I have talked before about the Senate Standing Committee on Rural Affairs and Transport inquiry, the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Regional Australia inquiry and indeed the socio-economic impact inquiry that the Murray-Darling Basin Authority itself is carrying out. That work has to look as hard at the issue of environmental flow management as it does at the issue of how to put on-farm water use efficiency back into the equation. Australia has the most magnificent ecosystems; its great habitats and biodiversity are the envy of the world. But we also have the responsibility of managing it properly. We have not, to date. It has been the public sector which is supposed to be managing these sites and the environmental flows. They have got to get smarter. They have got to consult the locals, who know better from managing these systems over generations. At the end of the day, we can move on to see the environment and community winners. (Time expired) Murray, I too rise to talk about the challenge and opportunity of having a unique ecosystem in Australia and of having the responsibility of managing it properly. My concerns, from a local electorate point of view, are coastal, representing the mid-North Coast of New South Wales. Part of the formal agreement that was reached with government was to get a release of a full response to the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Climate Change, Water, Environment and the Arts inquiry into climate change and environmental impacts on coastal communities, chaired by Jennie George. This was a bipartisan report, supported by the deputy chair at the time, Mal Washer, into coastal erosion issues throughout Australia, which is an increasing headache for all levels of government to deal with. Whilst the topic of the previous speaker was the Murray-Darling Basin, many of the issues she mentioned about the management of ecosystems and of natural resources hold true for the coastal areas of my electorate. This is important work with regard to coastal erosion. It is not only about the loss of land in millionaires row, up and down the exclusive streets on the Australian coastline; it is about the loss of open space and the rapidly increasing speed of the loss of coastal lands. This is increasing problems for local councils and various approval bodies dealing with local lands because the boundaries to determine where to do development and where to protect biodiversity are moving so quickly. On the North Coast of New South Wales and in my electorate there are two areas where there are particular concerns. At Old Bar, in the Greater Taree City Council region, there has been a significant increase in the speed of the loss of coastal lands. There is a boutique hotel there which will start to lose property if the loss of land continues at the rate it has for the last decade. One individual, Ross Keys, has had orders to knock down two of his houses at a time when refinancing from the banks during the global financial crisis hit him from another angle, so the huge problem for that individual is an example that this is a real MAIN COMMITTEE",337,Grievance Debate
360,Mr Oakeshott (Lyne) (9.48 Pm),"Picking up on the final words from the member forissue affecting real people. As well, in Lake Cathie, also in the electorate of Lyne, there is the potential loss of beach right up to a local street, Chepana Street. At the current speed, a loss of local infrastructure to the community is not too far away, just like what happened at Kingscliff, further up the coast, where the foreshore road went into the water and there were significant losses of open space during the heavy seas in winter. Likewise, there has been a recent Land and Environment Court case at Byron Bay and the ongoing issues between landowners and the local council there. Those are four North Coast examples and I am sure there are many more right around the Australian coastline that emphasise the point that this is a real problem affecting communities that desperately needs coordination and leadership from the Commonwealth level. That is exactly why a former member of this place, Jennie George, chaired the inquiry by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Climate Change, Water, Environment and the Arts that did receive bipartisan support. A lot was made of the release of that committee’s report in October 2009, more than 12 months ago. I remember, as you would, Mr Deputy Speaker Slipper, that nearly a whole question time was spent on this, with the Prime Minister talking at length about the importance of the issues raised in the report. There were 47 good recommendations, all along the lines that it is time for the Commonwealth to start to play at least a coordination role but preferably to take a leadership role in dealing with coastal erosion and the many inconsistencies that are faced at a local planning level. An example, again from my communities, is that all the legal advice that the various councils are receiving is different. While there are some common themes, the recommendations on how to deal with those common themes are inconsistent in parts and are therefore creating greater headaches for the local councils and planning authorities, including about what to do from a legal liability point of view in addressing loss of lands and potential development approvals. I want to highlight in particular the two areas of greatest interest that I urge government to act on. One is on the legal questions, in an effort to support both local councils and also state agencies. There was a recommendation for the Australian Law Reform Commission to do some work in this space. I hope the government takes up that recommendation soon, as well as the recommendation about insurance issues. I think both the legal and the insurance aspects can drive a coordinated approach for more sensible planning throughout the coastal zone. In addition, there are issues around emergency management. Whether or not you believe the science of climate change, the reality is that we are seeing more events in the coastal zone, and they are becoming more significant and therefore causing more damage to both private and public infrastructure. So engaging the emergency management sector in some preventative work is, I think, a valuable recommendation that is still waiting to be picked up. There was also a very good recommendation by the Natural Resource Management Ministerial Council for further work to be done in that regard. The loss of sand dunes is not just a loss of sand; it is a loss of natural resources and biodiversity in the coastal zone. That also has significance and does deserve further work. That brings me back to a related issue, Caring for our Country. There have been some changes to the Caring for Country program. It would be nice to think we could get the forward estimates to show an increase in funding for Caring for our Country rather than a decrease, and that is certainly a continuing push at my end because it is related to a response to MAIN COMMITTEE this report. If the government is going to be serious about responding to these 47 recommendations, catchment management authorities and the various bioregions within them will need to be engaged at a more significant level, and programs like the Caring for our Country program are the vehicle for that engagement. SoI would strongly encourage the government to (a) respond to this report and (b) act on the details, such as considering programs like Caring for our Country in the forward estimates. This is a report that is waiting for coordination and leadership. It does pick up on the previous speaker’s words-that we need to get serious about natural resource management in this country and there are economic benefits if we do. The recommendations talked about Kakadu, the Great Barrier Reef and wetlands, which the member for Murray was also taking about. They are all captured in the coastal zone, and the lack of action in the coastal zone will see the loss of many unique parts of Australian life and Australian ecosystems. I would hope that the government responds, responds soon and responds strongly to this report that is still waiting for direction from government. Broadband Network and existing technology. I listened with interest to Ministers Roxon, Garrett and Snowdon during the sitting today, and to their responses in respect of the merits of the NBN. WhatI found disappointing was the fact that we did not also cover the existing technology that is currently used and still extremely effective. I refer to the work I did in health, where telemedicine and telehealth were significant aspects of providing diagnostic work around otitis media, both in New South Wales and Western Australia but particularly in Western Australia in a broader context. The importance of the advances made in telemedicine is that they have enabled city based specialists to diagnose children and adults in country towns; provide the level of detail required both for their local GP and in the context of a patient having a better understanding of the health problems they are facing; and then have the capacity to discuss the treatment proposed, the merits of transferring to the capital city or, alternatively, having treatment at the local level. I think there is also a need to look at capacity, when we roll out any technology, around the skills that are required by people operating the systems that are established. In listening to Minister Snowdon make reference to Aboriginal medical services, I saw considerable merit in what he outlined. However, there is also a recognition that that technology is now harnessed and used by Aboriginal community controlled health services around the nation. To that extent, the NBN, whilst it has merit in the way in which it is being proposed and articulated within the House, does not take into consideration existing systems. Part of the challenge is that there are a number of areas in which government resourcing is required to address some very particular issues around infrastructure, youth programs, hospitals and a range of other issues. I am of the view, even though I have not read the business plan for the NBN rollout, that there is the capacity to look at existing infrastructure and utilise that infrastructure in a way that not only enhances its function and role but also makes it very targeted towards the things that are being sought. I also recognise that small businesses certainly draw down heavily on technologyMAIN COMMITTEE",345,Grievance Debate
