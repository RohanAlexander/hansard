0,"House Of Representatives. Thursday, 4 March, 1926. Absence O'f Mr. Speaker. The Ci","EKIC announced that in the unavoidable absence of Mr Speaker (Hon. Sir Littleton Groom), the Chairman of Committees would, under Standing Order No. 22, take the chair as Deputy Speaker. thereupon took the chair at 2.30 p.m., and read prayers. ForiiTH GENERAL REPORT. man, presented the fourth general report of thp Public Accounts Committee. Ordered to be printed. brought under the notice of the Prime Minister the question of the opening of the National Parliament at Canberra, and requested that the opening day should be the 26th January, the anniversary day of Australia's foundation. The right honourable gentleman was good enough to intimate that he was not opposed to the suggestion, but I see that in one of the speeches he made during the Eden-Monaro election campaign he referred to March, 1927, as being the time when Parliament would sit in Canberra. I ask whether he has abandoned the idea of having the opening ceremony on 26th January, 1927, and if we are now to understand that the Parliament will be opened at Canberra in March of that year. I made recently I dealt with the time when the Seat of Government would be permanently transferred to Canberra and the legislative and administrative functions of the Commonwealth would be carried on there. I made no reference to any particular date which might be decided upon as appropriate for the official opening of the Parliament at Canberra. I did not say definitely that the transfer of the Seat of Government to Canberra would take place in March next, but that I hoped it would be in March, or in the early part of next year. It is obvious that the Government cannot mako any definite statement as to this date, because should anything intervene to prevent Parliament from sitting at Canberra on that date it is possible that certain individuals might claim compensation from the Commonwealth. No such definite announcement can be made, but all the indications are that we shall go to Canberra early next year. question is that I believe that visitors from the other side of the world as well as from other parts of Australia will desire to be present at the ceremony of the opening of Parliament at Canberra, and the fixing of a particular date would give them an opportunity to make necessary arrangements. ber, of course, refers to the official date",14,Setup

30,Mr Prowse (Forrest) [2.49],"Ievidently was in an nncomfortable position. He had vivid recollections of those days when he held the same views as were uttered by the honourable member for Perth yesterday. One would hesitate to repeat now some of his previous speeches in this chamber. base bis remarks on figures that had manifestly been supplied to him from an interested source, and not from one that would give a properly balanced view of the subject. The sum total of his reckoning was that Australia was in an excellent position; that ofeir primary producers were benefited by the high t a r if f ; ancl that, generally speaking, they were now infinitely better off than at any other time in the history of this country. I suppose the right honourable gentleman's fiscal views are influenced by his constituency and the interests he represents. Probably he signed the letter sent to all parliamentary candidates by the Australian Industries Protection League. The letter was sent to me, and I regarded it as almost an insult that the paid agents of the big combines, that are protected by the legislation of this Parliament, should t r y to bamboozle candidates to undertake, under pressure of an implied threat, that if returned they would vote for high protection. This is the letter I receivedDear Sir, As a candidate for election, and a possible member of the Federal Parliament, your views upon the fiscal question are extremely important. At the moment, the protectionist versus free trade issue is more or less obscured by the conditions under which the election is being fought. But seeing that the recent tariff has not yet received the assent of Parliament, those who are elected in the present contest will be called upon to determine its fate. If, as is expected, otlier tariff changes are recommended, the new Parliament will also be charjred with the responsibility of dealing with a further number of items. In the circumstances, if a supporter of the protectionist policy, will you kindly sign and return the attached letter at your early convenience. The. league is a non-party organization. It vvill not, therefore, recommend or support any particular set of party candidates. Buti t will, within a reasonable distance of polling day, publish the replies received. Waiting your favour, Yours faithfully, -I. HUME COOK. P.S -In the event of this letter remaining unanswered, it is proposed to set against your name: ""No Reply."" The letter accompanying it wasThe Secretary, Australian Industries Protection League, 372 Flinders-lane, Melbourne. Dear Sir, In reply to your communication of the 15/10/25, I beg to state that I am a proH e tried to tectionist, and if returned to Parliament, will vote for adequate protection to Australian industries. Yours faithfully. Candidate for the constituency of but if that document was signed by many members in this chamber, as doubtless it was, even the able speech delivered last night by the honourable member for Perth must prove futile. I can understand that the right honourable member for North Sydney spoke under great difficulties. When he represented the Constituency of Bendigo he professed to realize the handicaps imposed upon the primary producer by the tariff, but last night he denied that there were any handicaps, and argued that high protection was wholly to the advantage of the primary producer. He buttressed his argument by figures which had doubtless been supplied to him by Mr Hume Cook, but he did not tell the committee that whereas in 1890 the number of sheep in Australia was 97,881,220, i u 1920 the number was reduced to 77,897,555, a reduction of 20,000,000 in 30 years. able member account for that? that a decrease of 20,000,000 sheep represents a corresponding diminution of wealth, and I shall show that the rabbit pest is mainly responsible, and that the policy of high protection prevents the pastoralist from dealing with that pest. Of cattle the number in 1890 was 10,299,913. In 1920 the total had reached 13,499,737, a pitiable increase of 3,200,000 in 30 years. The number of sheep per head of population in 1890 was 14.86, and in 1910 13.88. The right honourable member for North Sydney quoted quantities or values as either suited his argument : but he must have been aware of the fact that the apparent prosperity of the wool and wheat industries is due to the high prices that have prevailed during recent years. Those prices are in no way attributable to the fiscal policy of Australia or to Federal or State legislation. They",17,Tariff Customs Andexciseduties

34,Mr Prowse,"It must be obviousare governed entirely by tbe world's conditions, and the legislation of this Parliament does not affect them one iota. The .wheat-growing industry is practically stationary; certainly the area under crop is not increasing. Great prosperity might have been expected to follow the introduction of improved cultivating and harvesting machinery, but that has not occurred. The right honourable member for North Sydney spoke of the time when wheat was reaped with a sickle or a scythe. He omitted to mention the fact that in those days Australia was engaged almost wholly in the production of gold and wool, and grew only sufficient wheat to feed . its own people. ' The advent of modern machinery should have meant a rapid increase of wheat production and export, thus bringing new wealth to the country, and replacing tbe fading mining industry. Agricultural methods have improved as rapidly in Australia as in any other country, but the fact must not be forgotten that all other wheat-exporting countries have adopted all the mechanical inventions and advantages which the Australian producer enjoys. The machinery employed in other industries also has been improved. farmer could reap 1 acre of wheat with the sickle he can now, in the same time, reap 20 acres. Only by the cultivation of increased areas and the export of greater quantities of wheat to pay off the national debt can Australia derive the maximum, advantages from the adoption of labour saving machinery. Duiing the general election the honourable member for Henty( Mr Gullett) said that if the Governments had paid half as much attention to the development of the primary industries as they had paid to the secondary industries, the wealth of Australia would be three times what it is today. The wheat industry is not progressing because of the enormous load placed upon it . That high protection is responsible for the increased cost of production is confirmed by the Melbourne Age, which in a recent issue published this articleWIL L THE GOVERNMENT ACT? is it not timo that the Commonwealth Government took a definite and decisive action tection. RecentlyI had a conversation to curtail the vicious profiteering which is being practised. Almost every branch of trade concerned with supplying the necessaries of life to the public is under the doprogressing he informed me that it was in mination of combines which seem to have a direct dispensation to plunder the people at tlieir own sweet will. Throughout the city and suburbs, and, indeed throughout the Commonwealth, there is such a marked similarity between basic prices charged that householders have long since come to the conclusion that prices are arbitrarily fixed by associations of manufacturers, wholesale merchants, and retailers, which peremptorily forbid members to sell below the ordained rates. This deplorable condition of affairs is a legacy of the war. It should have died with the war, but instead it has continued to flourish without exciting the attention of the Governments, which are supposed to be guardians of public rights and interests. The present Commonwealth Government has an excellent opportunity to distinguish itself by taking prompt and effective action to prevent profiteering, and clip the wings of the great combines which are daily becoming more powerful. That newspaper has beeu largely responsible for the present state of affairs. It says that I am sound in some aspects of my policy, and I return the compliment. The Melbourne Age was on sound lines when it published that article. Combines are at work under shelter of the high tariff wall that has been built round Australia. Protection is a veritable cornucopia for trusts and combines, Whereas formerly the and industrial unions. I say, with the Melbourne Age, that this is an excellent opportunity for the Government to act, and prevent these people from further fleecing the publics-to compel them to give a reasonable opportunity and a fair deal to the average citizen. This tariff schedule is a one-sided arrangement, enabling one section of the community to fleece the people. That the manufacturers themselves are not too sure of their ground is evident from the following statement made by Mr Wilson Gray, the chairman of the Chamber of Manufacturers, on the 18th October, 1924: The Australian manufacturer had arrived at the stage when a larger market must be found. The one method was to increase our population, tout the present progress was quite inadequate to fulfil the demand. The only alternative was overseas, and there the manufacturers were denied admission owing to the cost of protection. I invite honourable members to ponder over that thoughtful and considered statement. It is clear that our manufacturers want overseas markets, which they are unable to enter because of high production costs in Australia due to high prowith one of our boot manufacturers. When I asked him how the industry was a bad way. "" But,"" I said, "" Have you uot enough protection to enable you to carry on? "" "" Oh, yes,"" he replied, "" we have ample protection. of fact we are doing 96 per of the Australian double the present protectiou we could not, remaining 4 per cent., because it represents fancy work, and it would not pay us to get that class of business."" said I , "" why do you not employ more hands, and sell your products abroad ? "" His reply to that question was significant. "" Our trouble in Australia,"" that production costs are too high."" would appear then that under certain of our secondary industries reached the adult stage, and are quite helpless overseas markets right Sydney( Mr Hughes) last evening quoted figures of wealth by our secondary Those industries do not bring a shilling of new money into Australia, and I repeat that high protection is placing an undue burden upon the backs of our primary producers who, besides producing cheaply for tlie people of sell tlieir surplus products abroad, and bring new money into the That is the difference between the two types of industry. at all to the boot industry, the steel industry, or, indeed, any other industry. would like to see them established in this country if they can justify tence, and prove of real service to the community. man invited us to consider the wages bill paid by these secondary industries. who pays the wages of Hugh employees?

Both parties to this sinister alliance recognize that the consumer must be despoiled in order to provide high wages for the operative, and high, or at all events moderate, profits for. his employer.

The members of the Opposition should listen carefully to what I am about to say. It w ill be fresh in the memory of all honourable members that some time ago the report was made to this House that rabbits were doing tremendous injui y to crops throughout Australia, and that certain farmers had insufficient financial standing to get credit from their banks to enable them to fence their farms properly to combat the pest. Honourable members were moved to tears by the tale that was told, and said, "" We shall set aside £250,000 to be distributed amongst the States to these down-andout moneyless settlers."" £48,000 was given to Western Australia, and a Labour Minister administered the grant. policy, the Minister for Trade and Customs passed on the instruction to the States receiving the grant that the wire netting purchased by the money must be Australian-made. who, to protect a secondary industry, would take the sugar out of a baby's milk. The Labour Minister distributing the grant in Western Australia instructed his under-secretaTy to communicate the facts to me, and I quote the following letter, dated the 25th November, 1925: Dear Sir, By direction of the Hon. the Minister for Lands, I forward herewith a statement of the activities, so far as this State is concerned, in connection with moneys made available for tlie purchase of wire netting under the provisions of the Advances to Settlers Act 1923. A copy has been forwarded to each Western Australian member of the Senate and House of Representatives in the hope that the facts may be of use when occasion arises. He gives a great deal of information, the whole of which I do not purpose to read, although it might all be read with advantage. I draw special attention to this On the Canadian and American statementThe Commonwealth Government decided that only wire netting of Australian manufacture was to bo supplied out of funds made available under the Act. He proceeds to deal with the prices at which wire netting was purchased, and works out the total cost of wire netting supplied at Australian prices, plus handling charges, at £43,340, absorbing almost the whole of tbe grant. He mentions the fact that tenders for the supply of English wire netting were received, and that the last tender received was for 254 miles of 17 x 1^ x 42, and the fact that the. Australian ""article of this type was priced at £ 5 9s. 3d. per mile in advance of the English price, exclusive of duty, for netting of similar quality. He saysThe Commonwealth Government restriction as to the use of Australian material is the determining factor in purchasing, but, apart from this, the imposition of the anti-dumping duty would prevent any advantage being taken nf the English price. . . . 290 miles of English netting could be purchased, if duty free, at the same price as 254 miles of Australian netting of the type referred to. The difference equal to the cost of 36 Of that sum, miles of fencing was extracted from the down-and-out settlers to run a factory in Australia, and the rabbits must continue But, true to the protectionist to eat out our farmers. The statement is made in the communication from which I quote thatThe difference of 36 miles would be sufficient to supply about eight additional settlers. By taxing wire netting we add to the costs of the primary producer. Rabbits threaten to destroy a settler; he cannot secure a penny advance from his banks aud he is compelled to give £ 5 9s. 6d. per mile of wire netting to a factory in Melbourne or in Sydney. The thing is economically unsound. I ask the Minister to say whether it is a fact that this industry has received bounties to the tune of £200,000, and is selling wire netting more cheaply in New Zealand than the down-and-out settlers in our own country.

Heath has been on a mission to Australia and other Dominions to report to the I m perial Government, which has in a friendly way decided that if it can be scientifically advised as to the way in which it can help the Dominions by the investment of money it will provide cheap money for the purpose. Sir Frank Heath was deemed to be qualified to advise the British Government on the subject. He has visited Australia, and has now, I believe, gone on to New Zealand. He did not pretend to make his report here, because he said that must be left unti l he returned to the Old Country; but he said enough while he was here to indicate the policy we should adopt. I quote the following concerning his visit to AustraliaSir Frank Heath, Secretary to the British Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, has almost completed the investigations vermin off his holding, and do not let which he was invited by the Prime Minister, Mr Bruce, to undertake. These investigations, which were begun in October, relate to the possibility of closer co-operation between the British Department and similar institutions in Australia. It is expected that the development Australian manufacturers of both countries will be aided as a result and that Imperial trade will be promoted. Dealing with primary and secondary industries Sir Frank Heath saidI have heard a great deal about the interests of primary and secondary industries, and one hears people talk about the competing interests of those industries. I have already pointed out elsewhere that in my judgI t is being sold ment the needs of the primary industries must stand first, because it is the exportable surplus of the primary industries which is paying for the interest and sinking fund of your large external debt.

If tlsit is so it is of the utmost importance to the secondary industries that lhat credit should remain available. This can remain available only if the lender is assured that interest on the sinking fund can be provided for, and this depends on the primary industries. If you What can increase the productivity of your primary industries, you are making it easier for your secondary industries to develop. Therefore your manufacturers should help in all things I should like to direct the to improve the primary industries of Australia. There can be no question of rival interests. is foolhardy to fall out with I suppose that no man is better qualified Sir Frank to sum up dispassionately the position in which Australia is placed than is Sir Frank Heath. He naturally recognizes and says that the money that is derived from our wool, wheat, and other primary products, amounting to 96 per cent, of our total production, goes to finance the credit of the whole concern, and that it is upon the success of the primary industries that our secondary industries depend. It must be clear to honourable members that if we close down those primary industries MrE . RILEY We do not want to do that. are doing it without wanting to do it"". It should be our first care not to hobble them, and not to impose unnecessary duties and burdens upon them.

61,Mr Prowse,"Honorabl e memberstheir true iuterests in this matter, but in sist upon the imposition of higher tariff duties. When the last tariff was submitted and Mr Massy Greene expressed Utopian views as to the way in which things were to flourish aud industries to increase in Australia, some one asked him whether imports would still keep up. He said that the volume of inqsorts would not be so great, and that revenue from that source would decrease. But the fact is that the revenue from imports has materially increased. The higher we. raise the tariff, the more we place ourselves in the hands of the enemy. The cost of £»oods is becoming prohibitive. The working man must buv in dear markets, and is, therefore, compelled to approach the Arbitration Courtf or increased wages. This tariff schedule will be another burden upon him. When higher wages are paid lo the workmen, the manufacturer decides that it is time for another increase i u the tariff, and so the vicious circle continues. Our manufacturers have told us that we cannot sell our manufactures abroad. Are we aiming to keep ourselves like blackfellows? I have admired the PrimeM in ister in his desire to promote trade with, and to give preference to, the Mother Country, but I am. afraid that these tariff proposals will wreck his good intentions. The Prime Minister went to England with his idea of preference. He visited Leeds, Leicester, and other places, aud he put an excellent case before the manufacturers there. idea of eating Einpire products, and the House of Commons set aside £1,000,000 to further the scheme. What is the present British view of our tariff ? The Sydney Mo-rniiiy TJerahl published the following statement by a British manufacturer with whom an Australian business man conversed : -Well, I suppose you find tliat Australia is not in very good odour here after that last tariff of yours. You know we feel that Mr member for Newcastle ( Mr Watkins) has a Bruce has not played the game. He caine to Leicester, talked about the consumption of Australian fruits, Australian butter, and the rest, and fairly rammed Australian produce down our throats. He goes back to Australia and puts a prohibitive tariff on the very goods we make. I use the word "" prohibitive "" advisedly, because many of the articles we produce are now taxed from 100 per cent, to 200 per cent., and in certain instances even more. Look at the duty on cheap cotton undervests and infants' dresses. To cite one specific instance : We make an infant's silk nnd wool dress, costing 3s. (Jd. each. I understand that this would now be rated as a "" costume,"" and the duty would amount to 8s. or 9s. each. That is not protection. That is prohibition. If your Mr Bruce permits Mr Pratten to do things like that, he will get a few home truths the next time he comes to Leicester. A friend of mine, a manufacturer of cotton undervests, went to Edinburgh, a few days ago, and the first thing he saw was a great advertisement, "" Eat Australian tipples."" Eat Australian apples-no t if I never eat another apple as long as 1 live ! That is the feeling that is being engendered in England. We are not reciprocal in our sentiments in any shape or form . A French trade delegation came here after the war, and its members most courteously pointed out to us that the French people could and did make certain articles used in Australia, but not made, here. They also pointed out that the trade relations between France and Australia were £7,000,000 to £1,000,000 in our favour. We seem to think that we are the only pebbles on the beach. We continue to talk about this country being self-contained. There never yet was a self-contained country. Trade relations must exist. It would be possible for us to pay off our national debt by the exercise of a saner policy respecting the development of our national resources. I am afraid that the Prime Minister's hopes for Australia's advancement will be dashed to the ground if the Minister for Trade and -Customs takes tbe bit in his teeth and gives f u l l effect to these tariff proposals. As against the speech delivered by the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes), They became impressed with his I wish to quote the speech that was made by tbe present Postmaster-General( Mr. Gibson) when dealing with the previous tariff. Beferring to ihe settlement of returned soldiers on the land in ' New South Wales, he saidThe duties alone, on the cheapest set of agricultural machinery that these men can get, amounts to £130. Therefore, honourable members are placing on every man who is being put on the land a tax of £130. The honourable son who is going on the land to grow wheat. That, young man will have to put his hand in his pocket to the extent of £130 to meet the extra charge on his machinery over and above what lie would have to pay if the articles could be obtained at the old rates. The rates on agricultural machinery bave been still further increased. Are not the State Governments, as well as the Commonwealth Government, in collaboration with the Imperial Government with a view to settling some of the British surplus population on thc land in Australia? Isi t a sane policy to levy a tax of at least £130 upon these settlers in order to The tax on a settler on a f a i r l y substantial f a r m would be much higher than that. It is a severe handicap upon him, and w ill inevitably lead to the abanspeak in opposition to that item donment of his holding. He w ill then return to the city, but cause, as was stated by the right honourable member for North Sydney, the work was made uninteresting to him. under present conditions, successfully compete in the world's markets. Not one honourable member of the Opposition w ill say that this is unfair. We should give the men on the land a chance to make good, and not load him witli a tax of £130 on his agricultural machinery to benefit our secondary industries. Our Australian sons are more fit to go on the land than a "" new chum "" from England. I am not speaking disparagingly of the British immigrant, but he does not know our Australian ways. He comes here in the : hope of making a home in the bush, but his efforts are futil e because of his ignorgeneral discussion. ance of Australian conditions. He is not half as capable as a young Australian, who knows too much to take on the job. We cannot find profitable markets for the produce of our settlers, and because of this our group settlement system is not the success that it should be. The vouner settler is taxed to the extent of £130 on his machinery, yet the Melbourne Age protests when he asks 3d. a pound more for his butter. Unless thesp conditions change, I agree with the honourable member for Perth( Mr Mann) that the day of reckoning must soon come. If we refuse now to calculate the consequences of such a policy, then I am sorry to say that we must learn our lesson by bitter experience. general debate on the tariff proposals appears to have ceased, I presume that we arc now to discuss the first item. I know that one or two otlier honourable members desire to speak. The first item is under discussion at present.

But I wish to criticize, to some extent, not only the policy that we have adopted in the past in dealing with the tariff, but also the Tariff Board's method of. carrying out its work. In so doing I do not wish for one moment to associate myself with the criticism that has been levelled against the board by the honourable member for Perth. The honourable member should have supported his statements by quoting specific instances in which tbe board had shown prejudice, or a disinclination to hear evidence fro m those who were opposed to an increase of duties.

70,Mr Bell (Darwin) [ 3 . 5 9 ],"I do notMinister should inquire into it i m mediately. Failing action by the M in ister, this Parliament certainly should require that the fitness of the members of the board to continue in office be investigated. In regard to the fiscal policy generally, I agree w i th the honourable member for Forrest that the treatment meted out to some industries is not f a i r and equitable. To a great extent, I endorse tlie complaint that the agricultural industry has suffered from the imposition of high duties. Possibly the mining industry is penalized even more severely because, although it has to pay higher prices for tools and machinery, it is entirely unprotected. which could be helped by the tariff have been refused assistance. The saw-milling industry especially has suffered. high duties imposed upon machinery and implements have increased the cost of production, but the Tariff Board, in a recent report, said that it could not recommend further assistance to the sawmilling industry, except by an increase of the duties upon timbers imported for case-making. I do not desire honourable members to assume that I am attempting to state f u l l y the claim of the saw-milling interest for an increase of duty. board's inquiry will probably be reopened, and those engaged in the industry w ill have another chance to present their evidence. I do say, however, that the industry is in a precarious position. Tasmania many mills are closed down because their products cannot compete successfully with imported softwoods. board reported that, in the main, i m ported softwoods do not compete w it h hardwoods. I can find nothing in the summary of evidence to confirm that astonishing statement. Anybody acquainted with the building trade must know that hardwood weatherboards have to compete with baltic weatherboards, and that large pieces of oregon are imported and sawn into scantlings. In support of its statement that softwoods do not compete with hardwoods in the building trade, the board said that, in the years when the i m portations of softwoods were large, the consumption of local hardwoods was greatest. That extraordinary argumeut indicates that the members of the board do not understand the timber industry, [55] for it must be obvious that, in the years when imports of softwoods and the consumption of hardwoods both reached their maximum, the building trade was flourishing, and great numbers of houses were being built in the suburbs of the capital cities. In coming to the conclusion that increased tariff duties were not necessary to the continuance of the sawmilling industry, the board could not have taken into consideration all the relevant factors. It is generally recognized that the inquiry must be re-opened, and I hope that the Minister w ill insist that those engaged in the saw-milling industry shall be afforded a chance to present their Some industries case f u l l y , and answer some of the statements contained in the board's first report. H i g h freights are another serious The disability upon the timber industry. Tasmania sends large quantities of timber to Port Adelaide, and the freight from Burnie, the nearest port, to Port Adelaide, for 30-ft. lengths is 9s. per 100 super, fuet. The freight upon similar sizes from Baltic countries to Port Adelaide is 3s. 3d. Honourable members w ill see at once how tremendously the Tasmanian timber industry is handicapped by costly freight. Clearly, the greatest cause of this high cost of transport is the NaviThe gation Act. The arbitration laws also have increased the cost of production. I say nothing at this moment against those statutes, but surely Commonwealth laws which obviously increase the cost of In production and marketing should be taken into consideration by the M i nister when an industry is applying The for increased protection. A primary industry is entitled to at least the same protection as is given to secondary industries, but such assistance has been refused to the timber industry. In regard to agriculture, I agree that the farmer has suffered to some extent from the high duties upon implements and machinery, but I do not endorse the proposal that local manufacture should be encouraged by bounties in lieu of tariff duties. Taking a selfish view of that proposal, I realize that if bounties were substituted for Customs duties, the farmer would have to provide, at least, his share of the extra revenue required to pay them, and the reduction in the cost of implements and machinery would probably be not sufficient to compensate for the increased taxation. if bounties are to be paid for the production of agricultural machinery, they should, in equity, be paid in respect of mining and other industrial machinery also, and the extension of that for m of stimulus would impose an enormous strain upon the finances of the Commonwealth. But as the farmer has to pay heavily for the machinery he uses, and so bears a large part of the burden of fostering the secondary industries, he also should be protected. tain cases protection has beeu afforded. Potato-growers are protected to the extent of 20s. a ton. This is hardly worth considering, because potato-growers are subjected to more difficulties than any other primary producers. potato-growing is more or less of a gamble. tirely destroys a season's crop. Frosts also are a constant menace, and prices vary so much that the growers are in a state of uncertainty, unti l their product has been marketed. protective duty of £ 6 a ton, are in a much better position. The unequal treatment meted out to potato-growers calls for careful inquiry. I sliould like to have an opportunity to discuss the matter with the Minister; I would not be unreasonable in my demands on behalf of our producers, but a duty of £ 1 is not sufficient. Potato-growing is a very i m portant industry in Tasmania, and those engaged in the business should receive fair treatment, because, in common with other primary producers, thtey have to bear their share of the burden of assisting our secondary industries. asked for the removal of the duty because it rather seriously affected their trade with the United States of America. been removed, and I think it will be admitted that our onion-growers have benefited from the protective duty, notwithstanding that it may have been responsible for retaliatory measures in other countries. I hope that the Minister will give heed to my remarks, and take such steps as may be necessary to ensure in creased protection for our potato-growers against competition from New Zealand. Recently contracts have been made with New Zealand growers at £ 6 10s. a ton for delivery in May and June. Australian potato-growers cannot produce profitably In any case, at that figure. I support the policy of protecting our secondary industries. A young country like Australia could not progress without protection. I join issue with the honourable member for Perth( Mr Mann) and those who think with him on the fiscal issue, but every government should endeavour to mete out equal treatment to a l l sections of the community. Protection is a measure of taxation, because we derive the bulk of our revenue from tariff duties, and the In cerburden should fall equally upon all. ' The primary producer is entitled to protection because he has to find his share of taxation-in my opinion he pays more than his share because he is taxed not only upon his income, but also upon his capiI n many respects tal, by means of the land tax. This is the most iniquitous tax that has ever Occasionally Irish blight enbeen levied upon any class in the community . Eveni f the primary producer shows a loss on his year's operations he is still called upon to pay land taxa tion. I admit that our farmers Onion-growers, with a have benefited from the development of the manufacturing industries in Australia. We cannot by a system of migration people our so-called empty spaces simply by placing people on the laud and expecting them to make a livelihood. We must provide a market for their output. In this respect I agree with the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr. Hughes), who said last night that our best policy is to encourage our secondary industries, and by transplanting the unemployed from the Mother Country to Australia manufacture a greater proportion of our raw materials into the finished product. There will then be a chance to put our young Australians on the land with a reasonable prospect of success. They understand our conditions, and are more likely to make good than are migrants from the Mother Country. As the right honourable gentleman said, the only way to induce more people to go on the land is to demonstrate that it w ill be profitable; and the only way to make land settlement profitable is to provide more mouths in Australia to eat what we produce im this country. We want a greater consuming population in Australia. It is the lack of this population that has retarded the development of our primary industries, because production costs and transportation",26,Combines At Work Forcing Up Prices Soaring Cost Op Living

If we had 100 cities like Melbourne or Sydney, farming would be more profitable than it is to-day, and if , by.the development of our secondary industries, we can utilize a greater portion of our raw materials, we shall do something to ensure the prosperity of the Commonwealth. these reasons, I am a convinced protectionist; but, in closing, I should like to repeat that in working out the details of our protectionist policy, we should see to it that equal treatment is meted out to all sections of the community. apparent that very little interest is being taken in the debate. I do not know whether there is an unholy alliance between honourable members on the M i nisterial benches and honourable members opposite, but one cannot help feeling that this proposal to place an extra burden on the people, and to make possible extra profits for the manufacturers of Australia, meets with the general approval of honourable members. protest, however, against temptuous attitude of the Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Pratten).

One was the statement of the Minister with regard to the attitude of Western Australia; another was a remark made by the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) concerning the possible decline of GreatB r it a in ; and the third had relation to foreign traders. The Minister, in his reference to Western Australia, did not state the case fairly . studied the position, he would have found that importations fro m the eastern States, include a large proportion of goods from other countries, and amount to over £7,000,000 a year. This volume of trade indicates that Western Australia is paying considerably more by way of customs taxation than the amount mentioned by the Minister. Prior to the bookkeeping period, Western Australia was paying a far higher average per individual than any of the other States. The Minister has the records of the department available to him, and should have put the case fairly. I wish to refer also to the published report of remarks by the Minister for Trade and Customsi n Sydney, in which he said that the tariff was an issue at the last election. That statement was not correct, for the tariff issue at the election was wholly submerged by another matter of supreme importance. I had much in formation on the tariff issue that I desired to submit to the electors, but I For withheld it , except the one statement that I feared that if we turned the National Government out and put a Labour Government in , even higher duties would be imposed I am exceedingly sorry that the right honourable member for North Sydney, even if he thought it to be so, should have referred to GreatB rita in as a declining nation. I have great f a it h in the recuperative power of Great Britain, who, I believe, w ill return to her original supremacy. She has incurred enormous obligations. She is paying interest on her war debt in f u l l , while not receiving interest from other nations to which she advanced money. Her effort is magnificent and wonderful, and I am exceedingly sorry I that anything should be said, especially the conby one who did such magnificent work for the Empire and Australia during the The war, to reflect, even in a small degree, on the future prosperity of the Mother Country. true? that GreatB r it a in was declining, it would be as well to hold our tongues; but I do not believe that the statement is true, and I resent the in ference, which too often arises from apathy. How long could we continue to If he had hold this country without the protection of Great Britain? How could the honourable member for Melbourne ( D r . Maloney), and those who support his policy, create artificial conditions here except by borrowing large sums of money ? If we had not the backing of Great Britain, where could we obtain that money in the future? Those honourable members on this side who oppose the tariff have been classed as "" for e i gn traders."" I resented that accusation when it was made, and I resent it now The honourable member for Maribyrnong ( Mr. Fenton) recently asked a question that",28,Combines At Work Forcing Up Prices Soaring Cost Op Living

75,Mr Gregory,"E v e n if we thoughtcontained an unwarranted insinuation. There is no doubt that an organization called the Town and Country Union was recently formed. A number of persons who believe that we are retrogressing in our fiscal policy have formed that organization, and have contributed money to supnort it . They have a secretary, who is circulating propaganda throughout Australia, under the impression that he is doing good to this country. Are the operations of that organization any different from those of the manufacturers' unions? Who paid for the large advertisement that appeared in the Argus newspaper this morning ? None of the money of any of these organizations is coming in this direction. When the last tariff was being discussed, the insinuation was made in the Industrial. Australian that sums of money were being contributed to support the free trade policy in Parlialiament. That was a libel, and free traders in this House felt very much inclined to take legal action for damages. by another journal that other honourable members could be bought. that we actually had been bought. The allegation was that money was being obtained for improper purposes. If a person believes in a free trade policy, he is justified in telling the people that free trade is best for the country; but when the tariff is approved, is this Parliament to be supreme? If we pass this tariff, will the Minister be allowed to alter it? Will the Railway Department of New South Wales, as it is doing to-day,' continue to charge specially low railway freights on goods of Australian manufacture? be allowed to levy extra fees for permission to install petrol pumps not made in Australia? Will the friends of the honourable member for Maribyrnong ( Mr Britain, and under. protection in the Fenton) be allowed to meet together, and say, "" If you build a big factory in this country, and import the iron and steel required, we shall declare the job ' black' ""? opinions. I do not believe that Australia Who is to be the supreme authority, the Parliament or outside organizations and individuals? The newspapers have had very little to say on this subject, and some needed, but I do not say that that protecof them approve of high protection; but what will they say to the Minister's stateport duties. It might be provided by ment that, in the near future, he hopes to place a heavy duty on newsprint? An answer to a question asked the other day indicated that the Postal Department is subsidizing the press to the extent of £270,000 a year. If we square that account, and put a duty on newsprint, I think we shall find that some of the newspapers, especially those of the type of the Herald and the Age, will be less pronounced in their desire to place an impost on every section of the community but themselves. I have been wondering why there should be so much fear of free trade propaganda. Very few people in this House, or in the country, voiee their opposition to the heavy import duties. Some of the newspapers suggest that to oppose protection is unjustifiable and improper, and even immoral. I should like honourable members to read Woodrow Wilson's book, Let there be Light. It deals mostly with tariff questions, and urges the need for reform in connection with them. It points out, as I have done here, that the United States of America cannot be a free trade country, because revenue must be derived from import duties, but urges duties that will prevent unscrupulous manufacturers and large corporations from obtaining undue power. In one of his speeches, he very quaintly said, "" If an organization contributed 100,000 dollars to our political funds, the members of it would naturally look for protection."" The same statement might be made of organizations in this country, and the fatuous approval of increased taxation on the people tells its own tale. Freetraders are fighting an uphill battle. Surely we can approach the subject on the understanding that every member of this committee desires to do the best he Will municipal councils can in the interests of this country, although we differ in our beliefs. One who believes in free trade, who has studied the conditions under free trade in Great United States of America, and has come to certain conclusions, ought not to be accused of ulterior motives if he voices his can aiford to be free trade.

89,Mr Gregory,"Neithe r I nor thecircumstances, that we are at least approaching the danger point. I believe that we have passed it . We have been borrowing far too freely. appear to think so. much higher rates of interest than formerly. If we could get our money for 3 \ per cent, as we used to do, there might be some prospect of our public seavices paying; but when we have to pay f ) | per cent, for money to build railways, the projects are foredoomed to operate at a loss. Now, when the average rate of interest on money that has been borrowed for railway purposes is only about '4 per cent, or less, our railways, in many cases, are being operated at a loss; and the position must become much more serious as the rate of interest continues to rise. The high cost of living in Australia makes it almost impossible for primary producers and manufacturers to build up their industries on a substantial basis. The fact stares us in the face, in spite of what the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) said last night, that our primary industries are not developing satisfactorily. The Year Book sets out the facts very clearly. It must be apparent to honourable members that a good deal of the increase shown in the figures quoted last night by the right honourable member Sydney was accounted for by increased creased production. If the goods exported in 1923-4 had been sold at the same price as the goods exported in 1913 it would be found that we had made no progress. prices in 1923-4 were the same as in 1913, we should find that the value of our exported agricultural products had increased from £10,677,734 to £18,495,051. That is a fair increase certainly, but it is accounted for principally by the wonderf u l change that has taken place in agricultural methods, due to the increased use of superphosphates, and to great developments in the Western Australian wheat belt. The figures for the pastoral industry for 1903 and 1924-5 on the same basis are £42,057,346 and £30,884,298: for dairying, £3,854,734 and £ 3 , 9 7 8 , 6 2 1 : killed the mining industry. I do not say for mines, £14,712,212 and £9,269,370; and for manufactures, £2,304,693 and £2,160,110. It is remarkable that with the vast territory we have available for pastoral purposes, the industry has declined, so f a r as its export trade is concerned. We have an enormous back country suitable for cattle and sheep, but it is not being used. In the western division of New South Wales there were nearly 9,000,000 sheep in 1900, and today there is scarcely one. The Minister for Trade and Customs knows that the flocks have disappeared because of the ravages of the dingo and the rabbit, but he is not making any move to enable the settlers to wire-net their holdings. He should be glad to provide wire and wire netting duty free, but he will not do so. He has said, in effect, "" I am not going to allow any oversea manufacturers to compete with the Australian makers of wire n e t t in g ."" He has certainly provided a bounty. He has, in fact, overwhelmed the manufacturers with money, but he will not allow any competition. would lay on the table all the correspondence that he has received from the British wire netting manufacturers and from the H i gh Commissioner recently, we should be in a better position to discuss the matter. I assert, without fear of contradiction, that there has been no dumping of British wire netting in Australia, yet a dumping duty has been imposed. No more preposterous statement has been for North made in any Parliament in the world than that made by the previous Minister values and not by inof Trade and Customs that 75 per cent, of the rabbit netting manufactured in Great Britain was for home consumption. That is the sort of argument that we have been compelled to listen to. Who Assuming that the deserves our most sympathetio consideration-the man in the city who has every convenience that it is possible to give him, or the man who has the courage to go out and develop our back country ? Instead of encouraging people to settle in outback areas, we discourage them by imposing heavy Customs duties and heavy shipping and railway freights' on all their requirements. We do not give them a chance to make good. Although the export trade of the dairying industry has made some progress, it has not developed to anything like the extent we expected it would, and the tariff has practically that it has been entirely responsible for closing down the big mines in Kalgoorlie, but it , together with the Navigation Act",31,Combines At Work Forcing Up Prices Soaring Cost Op Living

The Mount Morgan mine, m spite of great assistance from the Queensland Government, worked at a loss for a long time, and then had to close that some honourable members, like the down. According to my calculations, the ore it waa produoing was worth 50s. a ton. In any other country of the world it could have been mined at a profit. Although wages are higher in the United States of America than here, ore of that value could be profitably worked. manufacturers would develop a big export trade. destroy all opportunity. I wish to refer, under this heading, to the report of the Tariff Board on agricultural implements. The statement is made in it that our farmers get their agricultural machinery for 27 per cent, less than the Argentine farmers have to pay for theirs. Before the war, our man* facturers used to export between £250,000 and £300,000 worth of agricultural machinery to the Argentine every year; but that trade has gone. Why has it gone? If agricultural implements can be bought for 27 per cent, less here than in the Argentine, we ought still to have a magnificent market there. The Minister of failure. well here that it is not worth the while of the manufacturers. The figures I have quoted will show that our debt has increased five-fold since 1903, and our taxation four-fold, while our export trade has seriously diminished. What would be the position of Australia if wheat and wool were at the same price to-day as before the war? People may regard the future without trepidation, while the preplements in competition with Canadian sent high prices prevail, but when prices fall, they will be in a serious plight. They will then literally groan under the income taxation that is imposed on them, for their purchasing power will be sadly reduced, and they will curse those who plight. Our cities will feel the depression first. We should seriously consider the outlook, and strive to make conditions such that we shall be able to face such a period without fear of absolute disaster. I do not suggest that we should abolish every duty, but I do say that Parliament went duty mad in 1920. The result has been that almost ever since we have had manufacturers of every description applying for still higher duties. I know honourable member for Maribyrnong, consider that we should place such heavy duties on all machinery and other products as would compel their manufacture here; but I do not believe in that policy. If it is acceptable to honourable members generally, let them raise the Nobody expected that our yellow flag of prohibition at once. We are reaching the point of prohibition. I Our artificial methods urge that we should cease to interfere in industries, and that we should follow the work lines that have been adopted by Canada and the United! States of America. If there were less going slow, if men were paid according to the work they did, and if our methods of manufacture were up to date, I believe that we sliould prove ourselves to be as efficient as the people in any part of the world. The Minister, the Tariff Board, and members of this Parliament say, ""We need protection against countries employing cheap labour; we do not want our people to have to compete against manufacturers in countries where the industrial conditions are not so good as they are here."" But was that question raised should tell us the cause in connection with the manufacture of Probably, they do so agricultural machinery? We know that in some cases artisans employed in the manufacture of agricultural implements in Canada were receiving wages from 30 per cent, to 100 per cent, in excess of those paid here, and yet a demand was made for the imposition of high duties on such machinery. There is nothing the matter with our workmen; and why can we not manufacture agricultural immanufacturers paying the same or higher wages? Some one made public the fact that one of our agricultural machinery firms doubled its capital in two years. The answer to that by honourable members who support the protectionist policy have brought them to this is that they will watch such a firm and see that its prices are reduced in the future. Isi t the business of a government department to discover whether goods are being sold at too high or too low a profit ?

My point is that what has occurred in such a case proves that high duties are not necessary, and no effort has been made to reduce them. We may say that a certain industry should be established here aud carried on under conditions that will give it a chance son's magnificent workshop in Castleto succeed, and it should, therefore, be given some assistance. But when we find it making f abulous profits, such as have been made by agricultural implement firms, by the firm I have mentioned and by ofcheTS whose names can be read in the Stock Excfeamge list, we should consider whether the assistance afforded them by the tariff is not more than they are entitled to . receive. should decide the assistance in the shape of Bounties or duties necessary to enable Australian industries to stand up against the competition of the world. orable member say one word -against the profits made by importers. papers with me at the moment, but I shall be able to show that tihe protection given to many industries, not only by the duties imposed, but also by the'natural advantages they enjoy, is immense. The right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) referred to our trade with Great Britaim, and the Minister quoted the concessions made to British traders under the tariff. We have all along shown a preference to trade ""with the Mother Country. I hope that we shall continue to do so, m> matter what duties are imposed. But I recollect that not long ago the Minister altered the regulation requiring 25 per cent, of British material or manufacture in British goods receiving the benefit of preThey could not adopt such a course as ference under our tariff, and insisted that, that, and what they did was to send a in future, these goods must be 75 per cent, of British material or manuf acture. The Minister knows all ought to be 1-00 per cent. That is how honourable members make a great mistake in regard to building up trade in this country. Some time ago I had telegrams from box-makers in Brisbane and Sydney complaining of the duty imposed -on .the pulp wood imported for has it done the manufacture of boxes. I received a long letter from a manufacturer of oil engines at Ballarat pointing out that, beoause of tiie high duties on iron and steel, he was unable to carry on his industry unless increased duties were imposed on oil engines. He must have a higher duty on oil engines, because the cost of the material he uses in their manufacture is increased by the duties on iron and steel. Let honourable members consider Thompmaine. In the early days of the Western Australian gold-fields Thompson's supplied nearly the whole of the machinery used in the mining industry. Thompson's compressors, winding plants, batteries, arad almost every other description of miming machinery were to be seen all over Western Australia. The Australian industry at that time was able to compete Parliament with foreign manufacturers of such machinery. only 7s. a day. here were higher than those paid in the Old Country at the time. I read some time ago of a firm in Great Britain that was weaving a magnificent quality of linen from yarns received from Belfast. Some Belgian manufacturers offered it a yarn much better than that supplied from Belfast, and at a lower price. The firm realized that if it did not purchase the Belgianm m some comipetitor in France or in Germany would do so. It , .therefore, decided to purchase that yarn, and was able to supply a better quality of linen than it had previously supplied. The Belfast yam manufacturers were indignant at the loss of a trade which they had held for generations. If they had been in Australia they would simply have gone to the Minister for Trade and Customs of the day and secured the imposition of a duty on yarn. -eouplp of men over to Belgium to make invesKgaiions.

The BrokenB ill Proprietary people are again asking for increased duties on iron and steel.. If these duties are imposed the cost of a l l manufactures using iron and steel will be increased. Those carrying on such manufactures, which we should like to> see established here, will have to ask for increased duties on similar manufactures imported into this country. The cost of production must be still further increased, and this w ill mean bad times for the primary producers of this country. I have referred to the increase in the percentage of British labour or material required to secure preference for British goods under our tariff, and in this connection let me say that for the manufacture of wire and wire netting British manufacturers wereable to get rods much more cheaply from Belgium than in Great Britain. They were thus able to keep their factories going, continue the employment of numbers of people, and carry on against competition from other countries of the world. Our tariff legislation has been open to serious objection. If we pass a law here for the imposition of a certain duty it should be effective. power of the Minister to vary it in the slightest degree without coming to this Parliament for authority to do so. Minister should have the extraordinary powers that he has. . A proposal by the Minister is submitted without sufficient information, and accepted by the great majority of honourable members. When the tariff schedule was presented the duties on textiles were at once imposed u n t i l validated by the Parliament, and had to be collected. Yet the Minister issued an instruction to the Controller of Customs dated the 29th October, 1925, in these termsCotton tweeds for which firm order was ferent from that we have now.

I do not think the Minister should have such a power. We should consider the exercise of such a power in relation to its effect upon trade with foreign countries. The present Minister for Trade and Customs will realize that I am not reflecting Tha practice that upon h i m ; but we might have a Minister in his position who would do something gravely offensive to another natioai in regard to the trade between the two countries. If a quarrel takes place between a trader here and another in Japan or Canada, the issue is confined to them, and their respective countries are not brought int o conflict. But when the government of a country takes action damaging the trade of another country very dangerousconsequences may ensue. taken by that government is .to prevent in j u r y to the trade of its own country? ing, is that the Parliament alone should have the power to take such action. and Customs has nothing like as much power as the President of the United States of America. the power vested in the President of thc United States of America, which, however, is the same as that of our GovernorGenerali n Council, and not that of thc Minister. I do not think the honourable member would approve the acceptance It should not be within the here of the standard of morality said to be associated with tariff matters in America. The powers given to the M in ister for Trade and Oxistoms here are There is no reason why the altogether too great. On the 29 th July, 1921, when the measure conferring these powers was submitted, the Melbourne Age, which is a great protectionist journal, saidTariff making by officialdom and executive act is a degradation of representative government.

The Minister also said that the tariff has brought about no restraint of trade, but my information proves the contrary. . I draw special attention to the action of Lysaght Limited, in connection with pastoral supplies. correspondence sent to the Customs Department showing that this manufacturer in one instance refused, to supply wire netting to a firm because it had advertised that British wire netting was better than the Australian so or not I do not know; but surely the Minister should have been able to judge whether the advertisement taste.

These huge corporations only to restrain trade, but also to fix prices. The wholesale price of iron and steel is fixed by the Broken Hill Proprietary Company, and we know that the price of wire netting is fixed by Lysaght Limited and Rylands. slightest doubt that there has been restraint of trade on the part of these firms, but we have heard little of it from the Tariff Board. tralia is the peopling of our vast areas.

110,Mr Gregory,"'That is not the questhe people realize that it is not the worker who is benefiting by high protection, and that we are building up huge corporations that grasp the whole of the profits that are being made from manufacturing. So far as Western Australia is concerned, the Country party and the Nationalist party before the elections came to the following agreement: That as the present high tariff is inimical to bhe best interests of Western Australia, the full strength of the two associations shall be devoted to securing a substantial reduction in the existing tariff. that was entered into in Western Australia. It continuesThat as a reduction oan only be secured through our parliamentary representatives, neither party shall give its endorsement to any candidate not in agreement with this policy. That, subject to the above-mentioned conditions of policy being accepted as the basis of an appeal to'the electors, the Primary Producers Association is willing to co-operate with the United party of Western Australia in running a joint team, consisting of two representatives of the United party and one representative of the Country party, for the forthcoming Senate elections. The .team so selected shall receive the endorsement and support of both associations, and no other candidate shall be nominated, endorsed, or supported by either association. accepted by the Government's representatives ? from which the honourable member can form his own deductions. When the 1920 tariff was discussed I did not, except in relation to mining, make a remark regarding the effect of the tariff on Western Australia. I knew that it would h it ua hard, but I had no desire then to make an appeal so far as Western Australia was concerned. But the effect there has been so disastrous that I view with great misgivings the future of that State unless it either controls its own Customs or the Commonwealth Government reduces the Customs duties. So far back as 1915, the Tariff Commission referred to the difficulty of Western Australia, under the tariff and the grave effect that it would have upon that State. The Tariff Board iu its report directed special attention to the disadvantages of Western Australia, under the TariffA c t and the Navigation Act , Then the Disabilities Commission concluded that under present conditions Western Australia could only obtain real relief by taking control of its own Customs; and with this Parliament, as at present constituted, only such a policy will satisfy us. TheM i nister has given us to understand that in the near future the duties on paper, cotton, cigars, o i l , iron and steel will be reconsidered. I do not know what is proposed regarding paper or cotton. But in regard to cigars, when the 1920 tariff was being discussed, I had statistics prepared which showed that if all the cigars then consumed by the people were imported, the duty on them would be sufficient to enable a pension of £200 being given to every man, woman, and child engaged in the industry, and even then £86,000 would remain unexpended. We know what was the position when a duty was put on shovels. A t that time fifteen men were employed in Australia in that industry. now. but it does not give us a cheaper shovel. Then, in regard to oil, we invested largely in the Oommonwealth O i l Refineries Limited, and certainly our partners in that firm seem to be doing remarkably well under the agreement. They obtain their own price for the raw product, and charge their own freights. They are making an enormous profit, but the Government have benefited little from it . member oppose that agreement? because I did not like the Government becoming interested in industries, and I like it less to-day. I have always fought against the Government entering into competition w it h private individuals -taxin g the people, and then using that taxation to work in competition w it h them. The iron and steel industry is the key industry in Australia, and if it be necessary to build it up, we should do so by a bounty, as we did in 190S. A bounty was then given to the iron and steel manufacturers to enable other manufacturers in Australia to obtain cheaper raw material. On the 22nd of A p r i l , 1915, the Tariff Commission reportedI t is of vital importance, for the successful development of our manufacturing industries, that raw materials for the purpose of manufacture should be made available at the least possible cost.",36,Combines At Work Forcing Up Prices Soaring Cost Op Living

I i i 1912, Mr Delprat, the then general manager of the BrokenH ill Proprietary Company, in giving evidence before a select committee of the New South Wales Parliament upon the bill which was afterwards passed, to enable the Newcastle Steel Works to be started, gave this evidence:Q. 291. 1 presume you are going into these works believing that you-""can compete succesThe refully, so faias iron .and steel are concerned, with tbe markets of the outside world?

RILEY He soon changed his tune. changed his tune when he learned that the honourable member and others, who voice the shibboleth of high protection, are prepared to accede to every application for an increase of duties. In 1914, when the Labour party introduced an amending tariff, which left these items free, the honourable member and others were satisfied to grant the duties that were asked for. In 1920, when further enormous increases in duties were made, honourable members were again satisfied to yield to the manufacturers' requests. And now the secondary industries are asking for still further assistance. Their greed is insatiable, and some honourable members are prepared to give them anything, so long as it is given in the name of protection.

And speaking of the proposed alteration of duty w i th regard to steel rails, he saidWhen the bonus was initiated it was for the purpose of establishing the industry, and it has done so.

Unlike the BrokenH ill Proprietary Limited, he did not establish his works on tiie seaboard so that big ships could load alongside the mills: he went 100 miles into the interior and, in the face of troubles and disabilities, ""made good.""

I cannot Labour members who delude themselves into the belief that these high duties are beneficial to the workers. About cent, only of the bread-winners of Australia are engaged in the highly protected industries. In the boot-making industry, which has enjoyed high protection for many years, the average wage is less than that of a bricklayer's labourer. Generally speaking, the average wage in the unprotected industries is greater than that in the highly protected industries. will admit that in many of the highly protected industries great numbers of girls are employed. statistics in regard to male labour only; female labour is dealt with separately. In 192-2 the average full-time weekly earnings in the blooming mills in the United States of America were, for heaters, 62 dollars; for rollers, 71 dollars; and for heaters' helpers, 43 dollars. In 1919 and 1920 heaters' wages were nearly 82 dollars, or £ 1 6 a week. In manufacturing and jobbing shops machinists were receiving as high as 55 dollars, and machinists' helpers up to 38 dollars a week. Yet the Americans can sell their machinery in Australia at half the cost of the locally-manufactured article. sold in Australia is not always the price in the country of origin. tainly the prices I have quoted for reapers and binders are those at which these machines are sold to the farmers in Canada and the United States. I am desirous of doing everything possible to build up the secondary industries, but we cannot ignore the fact that some Australian manufacturers are making enormous fortunes. Honourable members opI am merely pointposite must be aware that the promises made to the workers in 1908, when the was practically new protection was introduced, have never In 1921 I prepared some been fulfilled . If we could induce our workers to join forces with the manufacturers, accept a share interest in the industries, and be paid according to their output, they would be able to produce, not only local requirements, but a surplus for export. It is a monstrous system under which I and the honourable member Thus a very big for Adelaide( Mr Yates), who is a much younger man, must be paid the same understand the stupidity of wage in a workshop. Such a system must bring the good worker down to the level of the slowest of his fellows. In the per United States of America and Canada, most of the higher-grade artisans have motor cars, and generally enjoy a higher standard of comfort than do the men engaged in similar occupations in Australia.

This Parliament should establish a Tariff Board composed of two independent of protectionist and free trade interests, and a president who would have the status of a judge. That body should investigate all industries, and advise Parliament as to how they could be helped. I believe that if Parliament were supplied with reliable information from such a body, even honourable members opposite would not be so ready to do everything possible to put more profits into the hands of the manufacturers. Throughout the speeches of those honourable members who prefer any goods to those produced in their own country, is the implication that the Australian workers are not so good to-day as in day3 gone by, and that generally they are not giving fair value for the wages they receive. The honourable member for Swan( Mr Gregory) referred to me, and I shall show that the reference was imfortunate for his argument. My father was im ported to work in a protected industry. In his early days he was a shoeing smith in an English mine, but finding the work too strenuous, he became a maker of fireproof safes, and was eventually engaged to come toAustralia. would not have had the opportunity to come to Australia, but for protection, and I , being his son, followed him in the factory where he was employed, so I am well acquainted with factory work. say unhesitatingly that, having regard for their rights as human beings, men in manv factories have to work far too long at laborious occupations. work means. It was the proud boast of my employer that his establishment was thoroughly up to date, and, as he put it , the best factory of its k in d . south of the line. Under the piece-work system, and prior to the introduction of our factory legislation, I saw piece-workers pitted one against the other, and the rates of pay gradually reduced u n t i l a man had to work like a galley slave to make a decent living. I challenge contradiction by any honourable member who cares to get into touch with those who have worked in factories where piece-work rates obtained. In the factorywhich I have i u mind, tub. bucket, safe, and oven makers had to go for their lives under the piece-work system. Apprentices in the last two years of their apprenticeship were given what specialists, were called half piece-work rates. Some of them, being expert in their particular branch of the trade, were able to earn more than the best journeyman in the place, but, month after month, the reducing process went on u n t i l at last it was almost impossible for even the most expert bucket-makers to make a decent living at the piece-work rates offering. In some instances a man was given what was called a "" g o o d "" job together with a "" b a d "" job so that he could make a living. Men engaged in the making of rain-water tanks (Adelaide) [5.44] were in the same position. Piece-work rates were cut because the output of the factory had to be marketed in competition with imported articles. LuckilyI was employed in a shop that did not adopt the' piece-work system, but on several occasions there was agitation for it . I was always opposed to the principle, not because I was afraid of it I can say, without egotism, that I was as clever at my trade as any young man in the shop, and piecework would have paid me--bu t because I believed that it was wrong to p it one man against auother in any industrial establishment.

On r the contrary, it should be tightened up, even if we have to pay a little more for articles of Australian production. fortunately, the working man cannot get much out of the tariff. If prices of commodities decline the working man will not benefit, because down will come his wages. Honourable members who object to the schedule know that immediately a drop occurs in the cost of production the "" bosses "" come along to the Arbitration Court with an application for a reduction of wages in keeping with the decline in the cost of production. They are the people who are in the vicious circle. It was truly said last night that any concessions that have been secured by the workers in Australia have been won from employers at the point of the bayonet. Honourable members who favour a reduction in tariff items would have us believe that their object is to ease the burden on the working classes. Their reasoning is quite fallacious. told, is going to the dogs, and' all because of the high protectionist tariff. Unfortunately for their line of reasoning, the figures are against them. The Year-Book of Australia completely refutes the argument of our free-trade friends. The livestock statistics are a complete answer to their pessimism, and I remind them, that the workers of Australia have never been spoon fed or fostered to the same extent as the pastoralists. who have had gifts of wire netting and bounties on meat in tended for export. ""As for the worker, it matters not if , owing to a fire at his factory he is unemployed, the landlord knocks at the door on a Monday morning and must get his rent. We never hear of £150,000 being voted for necessitous workers, although, as has been shown so clearly, they contribute just as much as the pastoralists and others to the creation of community wealth. Their position is being inquired into by the NationalI n surance Commission; but if we may judge by previous experience, anything that the worker is likely to receive in the way of unemployment insurance will be in the nature of a charity dole. He will have to strip himself naked to prove his claim before he gets anything. The Labour party has never protested against any attempt to assist the primary producers of this country. The honourable member for Wakefield ( Mr Foster) many I deprecate this attempt to years ago was Minister for Publio Worksi n the South Australian Government. He will remember when the first Seed WheatA ct was passed to assist neUncessitous farmers in that State. He must alsoremember that in the following year another b ill , consisting of one clause, was passed to postpone repayment of seed wheat advances; that a similar measure was passed in the next year, and finally the entire liability was wiped out. Working men never get this kind of assistance from ParliamentThere have been "" poor "" funds instituted by the press and philanthropic institutions in the various States. People have been invited to assist necessitous working men, but never has there been a straight out grant, as in the case of our primary producers. I do not say that this for m of legislative assistance is wrong. I have voted for it because I realize how essential it is to keep our people on the land. The honourable member for Wakefield w ill The country, we are also recollect, no doubt, that the late Mr. T. Price, when Premier of South Australia, threatened to import wire netting in the interests of the farmers unless the i m porting merchants released wire-netting supplies w it h in the State at a reasonable price. Mr Price also threatened to i m port superphosphates unless the importing and manufacturing interests ceased selling sand instead of superphosphates to the farmers.

137,Mr Yates,"I agree with the honorWithout adequate protection, Australian manufacturers cannot be expected to meet competition by mass production plus other natural advantages of overseas manufacturers, who have their market at their door, whereas we are 12,000 miles away. We wish to see this country properly developed and managed in the interest of the nation. Broad acres and billy-goats do not make a nation. It is the peoplethat count every time. The live stock statistics in the Year-Booh show that in 1890 Australia had 10,290,913 cattle, 97,SS1,221 sheep, and 891,138 pigs. In 1923, notwithstanding the influence of Labour Governments in several of the States, the operation of arbitration courts and wages boards awards, not to mention the alleged "" go-slow"" policy, there was a substantial increase. sponsible for the live stock in Australia are not the men who meet in Menzies' Hotel, in Melbourne, and direct their accountants to ascertain how the things are going on their station properties. The men responsible for the cattle and aheep being on the hoof are the drovers and managers of the stations. It is they who bear all the heat and burden of the day, perhaps not seeing a city for years, and perhaps never being able, like the owners, to marry and rear families. I have nothing to say against the stationowner except that I want him to view the other fellow's position as he would like the other fellow to view his, with consideration for the individual. I have stated the number of live stock for one of the best years revealed by the Year-Booh. In 1923, our cattle numbered 13,357,508, our 897,874. Onlyi n the case of sheep was there a decrease, and from what we know of the ramifications of the wool trade, we can assign reasons for that. To explain the decrease honourable members need only take into consideration the export of frozen mutton. The reasons for the decrease are all revealed in the book. A similar decrease in the figures relating to cheese is explained by the figures for milk. There has been no material decrease in the numbers of cattle, sheep, and pigs. sheep before the war. for the best year before the war. A culties that he cannot easily surmount, million sheep more or less is of small but there are very few instances of that importance. The honourable member for Swan spoke of sheep where there were no sheep. Let him talk to well-informed shearers, who will be able to tell him of many former sheep-runs on which Sir Sidney Kidman has broken down the fences and replaced the sheep with cattle. That man is making a desert of the centre of Australia. There are many things that explain the difference in the figures, but the decline has not been such as should cause us any considerable worry. number of sheep and cattle should be ever so much greater. they would not be greater even if fencing wire, wire-netting, and all the other reThe people requirements of the farmer were cheapened.

Eventually the debt was written off. When we consider the figures showing the quantities of wheat, wool, wine, butter, cheese, sugar and other things produced in recent years, we cannot help concluding that no man who has been on the land for any length of time ought to owe the Government a penny. The honourable member for Wakefield knows much better than I that when the Canowie estate was cut up and sold at £ 1 1 10s. an acre, it was land.

I do not know how that When man puts into operation the golden rule"" Do Junta others as you would be done by,"" restrictive tariffs will be superfluous. Let me return to the TearBook. The number of live stock in this country is compared in the Tear-Book with the population. Per head of population in 1890 the number of cattle was 3.27, the number of sheep 31.06, and the number of pigs 0.8. In 1923 the number of cattle was 2.31. of sheep 13.88, and of pigs 0.16. Those figures do not show any substantial decline in prosperity, especially when one considers the development that has taken place in city areas. When we compare the progress made in this country in the short time we have been here with that made in other countries, we have reason to be proud. The rearing of sheep is probably a greater industry than the rearing of cattle, and in that industry Australia is first among the countries of the world, with the Soviet republic second. Among the other countries mentioned in the Tear-Book are the Argentine, United States of America, France, and Italy. Australia must have progressed when ahe can maintain that position ahead of all other nations. In the cattle industry we are tenth on the list. If sheep production does not reveal the wealth of a country, perhaps wool production does. The two industries are correlated. In 1919-20 the quantity of wool produced in Australia was 663,249,164 l b . I am stating quantities rather than values, because the honourable member for Swan( Mr Gregory) said' that as prices fluctuated they did not always disclose the true position. If, however, the quantity of wool is produced, the work has been done, whether the price is obtained or not. In 1923-4 wool production fell to 590,820.185 l b .",42,Combines At Work Forcing Up Prices Soaring Cost Op Living

To show that in the matter of wool production Australia, is not the decadent nation that the speeches of those who advocate foreign trade would suggest, I shall compare our wool production with that of the rest of the world. While the wool production of Australia in 1923 was 590,820,1S5 lb., that of the rest of the world was 2,797,327,000 l b . ; so Australia produced more than 21 per cent, of the world's supply. This cannot be such a bad place after all. leave it . the value of our exported pastoral products was £65,095,676, of which wool accounted for 87 per cent. skins and some other side lines made up the other 13 per cent. In view of these figures it cannot be said that the tariff has ruined the country. built up the wool industry. The gravamen of the charges levelled against our protectionist policy by the honourable member for Perth( Mr Mann), the honourable member for Forrest( Mr were not. Large areas were bought for Prowse), and the honourable member for Swan( Mr Gregory), is that the tariff has caused stagnation in our primary industries. On the strength of the figures, that I have quoted, I deny it . We have been told that the acreage under crop in Australia is decreasing, but the figures for the year 1919-20 and 1923-4-13,296,40 7 acres and 16,531,186 acres respectivelydisprove progressing, and not retreating. spite of the influx of immigrants into Australia the area under cultivation per head of the population increased from 2,507 acres in 1919-20 to 2,875 acres in 1923-4. Those satisfactory figures disprove the argument of the honourable member for Swan that protection is stopping immigration. Eveni f there was some decrease in the area under cultivation, it might be accounted for by the unsatisfactory method of settling soldiers on the land. Our repatriation may have experience has not been pleasing in some respects. The great patriots, who urged men to go to the war and themselves remained at home, showed their patriotism after the Avar by selling land to the Government for soldier settlement at exorbitant prices. The gentleman who won the Adelaide seat from me after the war a gentleman who was younger than I and eligible for war service, but remained at home and urged others to go to the war-bough t an estate in South Australia, known as the Pinery, for .soldier settlement. In the subsequent inquiry into this biggest land scandal that South Australia has known, evidence was given to the effect that the Pinery land was too wet for fanning, too dry for fishing, and good for neither. MrH . M . Addison, who has been in the land-selling business ever since I can remember, .said that it was doubtful whether it would be possible to make f a r m in g pay on the Pineryi f the land had been bought at .£6 10s. an acre, but Mr Blundell, the Hides and gentleman to whom I have referred, paid .€9 10s. an acre for it for repatriation purposes. The land profiteers are responsible for any reduction in the area under cultivation by returned soldiers, and not the tariff. settled on Crown lands in South Australia. soldier settlement at extremely high prices.

There are persons in the community who rob the working man of his earnings on the one hand, and the producer of his production on the other. They are something like the K in g William-street farmers in Adelaide, who rob the community every day of the week, and every week in the year, but at election time plead w it h the real farmers not to vote for the Labour party. In spite of all these circumstances, the wheat yield of Australia continues to increase. cultivation may result in a reduction in flocks was pointed out in South Australia when certain large sheep runs were being subdivided for closer settlement, that all the men who would settle on smaller blocks would keep a few sheep, and so the aggregate number of sheep on a given area would probably not f a l l f a r short of the number that the squatter ran before the property was subdivided. the Year-Book shows that the wheat yield of Australia has been larger since the Avar than before. fourteenth in the Year-Book list which shows the average yields of the countries of the world. know that there are some countries that produce over 40 bushels of Avheat. to the acre, but hoAv much Avheat do they produce? The higher yield is due, not to better methods »f working, but to better climatic conditions. In the list showing the total wheat yields of the countries of the world Australia is eighth. preceded by the United America, India, Canada, Soviet Republics, Erance, Argentine Republic, Italy, and Spain. 3 per cent, of the world's yield. with that, but with pointing out that Australia is not in the sorry plight described by the honourable member. I am glad that it is not possible to represent in Hansard the tears in his voice and the tremble and shake of the papers he held in his hand as he was delivering his speech. If that could be done, those to whom Australia OAves money would put the country up for auction, and sell as a bad proposition. But we are in a satisfactory position in regard to both our pastoral and agricultural industries. The average Avheat yield in Australia per acre in 1920 was 12.53 bushels, and in 1923 it Avas 14.98 bushels. I am well aware that Denmark produces an average of over 40 bushels to the acre, but that does not detract from the A^alue of our production. Sitting suspended from G.SO to S p.m. The increased area under for Forrest knowing the wheat industry as he does, and the productive capacity of the soil of Australia, w ill not deny the splendid results from the efforts of the primary producers in the last few years. I shall quote a few figures, so that it may not be said that I am bolstering up a case by assertions without backing. Before the war in 1914, when Australia experienced one of the most severe droughts which it has ever had the misfortune to go through, the wheat yield Reference to for the year was, approximately, 24,000,000 bushels. That wil l give some idea of the wheat yield of Australia in a bad season. Prior to that year there was the biggest harvest ever known up to that time in Australia. It yielded, approximately, 103,000,000 bushels. In the year after the yield dropped, as I T h a t may be true; I have said, to 24,000,000 bushels fro m practically the same acreage. In the following year, 1915-16, the farmers and others engaged in agriculture were recompensed for the disastrous failure of the previous season by a harvest of 169,000,000 bushels from practically the same acreage, and wheat that year realized She is a price which was then unprecedented in States of the history of Australia. The price for home consumption was 4s. 9d. per bushel, and wheat sent overseas realized 5s. 3d. a bushel. 8s. 6d. a bushel. with just now is the return to the primary producer in Australia under the dreadful tariff of which the honourable member for Forrest complains.

178,Mr Gregory,"And many of themy point is that if the producers of wheat did not get a satisfactory return for their labour they could not put the blame on the Minister for Trade and Customs. They must attribute their loss to some cause other than the tariff. A t the time to which I refer the leader of the conservative element in South Australia was the Honourable John Darling, who followed his father as manager of the great wheat firm of John Darling and Sons. made of the handling of the wheat. about who was responsible for that. I am satisfied to know that it was not the working man.' If the wheat pools got into the hands of persons who were incapable of managing them; those persons were not drawn from the ranks of Labour. They were drawn from amongst the people who urged the electors not to vote for Labour with its pooling systems and socialistic ideas. The complaint is made that the primary producer is fleeced on every hand, but it is not the working man who fleeces him. Very few farmers' labourers retire on their earnings as f a rm labourers. Very few of those whose toiling and moiling are responsible for the products of most industries retire on the earnings of their labour. It is those who manage them who retire. John Darling was practically premier and dictator of the conservative element in South Australia. to the facts. has only to refer to the records of the time to find that what I say is correct. John Darliug was head and tai l of the Liberal and Conservative organizations in South Australia. He ruled the government of the day, though he did not himself accept the responsibility of the premiership. pushed out of the position immediately got back to it with the aid of the Labour Opposition, and would not resign. The House adjourned against h i m , and he had to be scraped off 'the henches, which he reached by the efforts of John Darling and his coterie of Liberals and Conservatives. An y one who knows Adelaide and South Australia is conversant with the rise and progress of John Darling. He was able to take advantage of an opportunity that came to him, when the firm of John Dunn and Company, of South Australia, got into difficulties. John Dunn died, and his father took over the business. Later, one of the grandsons got into the hands of certain people, and it was not long before the f i r m became insolvent, and its assets were realized at very much less than their actual value. That gave an opportunity to old John Darling and his son to enter into the wheat business in the way they did. When the younger John Darling died, he left nearly £2,000,600 behind him . I commend that information to the honorI am not concerned able member for Wakefield ( Mr Foster), who was one of his supporters. He was one of John Darling's puppets at the time, when the howl went up from the housetops that the electors should vote against Labour men and keep them out of Parliament, because they were the enemies of the fanners. The younger John Darling became a millionaire from the profits he took out of the farmers. Honourable members opposite have complained that the farmer has not. received a f a i r return for his labours. They say that the farmers do not get what they earn. I am pointing out where the money goes and who it is that receives it . Those who receive it are the people who f a r m the farmers. It is not lost to the farmer because of the tariff. If the farmer does not get a f a i r return for his labours, it is due to his own political foolishness.

The following year the tariff came into operation, and one would have naturally concluded from the remarks of some honourable members that the industry would have been completely wiped out. But what are the facts. In 1923-4, the exports of dried fruit s were 43,581,329 lb., valued at £1,243,272. Yet we are told that the tariff is crippling prodiiction, and is driving returned soldiers from their holdings. knows that that increase was due solely to the repatriation policy of the State Governments. the development of our national life ?

I base my on the figures contained Book. rect, but the honourable member's deductions are wrong. may make his own deductions. Nothing else can be adduced from those figures than the fact that we are producing an enormous quantity of dried fruits, notwithstanding the imposition of the tariff. My case is unanswerable. I come now to the wine industry, which is related to the dried-fruits industry, and shows practically' the same result. Instead of condemning these industries, we should be lauding them; but honourable members of the Country party prefer to decry Australia's productivity. patriation policy of the States helped the wine industry. orable member's argument, every industry in Australia is languishing, with the exception of those in which returned soldiers are engaged.

It is the foreigner who appreciates our sparkling wines. Australians refuse to drink them, and w ill not give the winemaker an opportunity to produce wine equal to the imported article.

In 1919 the production of bacon aud am quoting from the hams was 57,758,592 lb., and in 1923 are rubbish. I come it had risen to 67,600,747 lb. Having regard to that increase of nearly 10,000,000 lb., If a i l to see that the tariff has detrimentally affected this industry. If high duties are responsible for the result I have mentioned, for goodness sake let us have more of them. These figures are a sufficient answer to those who say that the imposition of Customs duties is sending Australia to the dogs. The production of poultry and eggs is mainly, a side line of dairy farming ; but in 1919-20 the value of these products was £8,166,094, and in 1923-4, £9,036,033. The tariff has not even frightened the fowls; in spite of Arbitration Courts, too, they did their job as of yore. They did not "" go slow, '' and I dare say that if the eggs were cracked four out of every five would be found to have double yolks. Turning to an industry which should interest the honourable member for Forrest( Mr Prowse). I find that the revenue of the forestry departments increased from £389,544 in 1919-20 to £740,292 in 1923-4. Even the production of the forests doubled. I suppose that a good The factories are making deal of labour was employed in securing that result, and in the face of those figures nobody can justly allege that the timber workers aregoing slow and cannot hold their own against the Americans, or that the Japanese could do twice as much work for a third of the wages. Mining is the most arduous and hazardous of the primary industries, and it takes the greatest toll of life and health. Honourable members are aware that the miners The producers know which had to fight tooth and nail for every improvement in their wages and working conditions. I remember asking the meaning of the term "" bank to bank,"" and I was told : "" The time of a factory employee starts from the sounding of the whistle. The time of a commercial traveller commences when he entrains on Monday morning, although his business call had the awfu l effects upon may be at a town hundreds of miles away.

211,Mr Yates,"Of course; commercialhad to fight for everything they have got out of the industry, are now reproached w i th "" go-slow "" tactics. We are told that Australian workmen spend too much time at the races; that they go too often to football matches, and that "" t w c u p"" is about all that they know. What are the facts ? I have already shown conclusively that as producers of wealth they have established a magnificent record. I tur n now to the silver-lead industry for f u r ther confirmation of my statement. In 1919-20 Australia produced 5,886,947 fine oz. of silver, 80,175 tons of lead, and 17,119 tons of zinc In 1923 the figures had risen to: silver, 7,223,236 fine oz., an increase of nearly 2,000,000 oz.; lead, 124,570 tons, an increase of over 44,000 tons; and zino, 41,158 tans, an increase of over 24,000 tons. In what respect has the tariff crippled the mining industry or hampered production ? In 1919 the industry employed 7,576 persons; and in 1923-4 only 5,894. Whilst the number of employees decreased by approximately 2,000, the increased production, in tbe case of silver alone, was over 2,000,000 fine oz. should bear in mind that silver is produced in Hobart electrolytically, and that it is now quite a different proposition. up-to-date methods of extraction are employed, 'but )my question is-> "" Has the tariff injure d the industry?"" figures for the baser metals show that in 1919-20 Australia produced 80,941 tons of pig-iron, and in 1923-4, 94,350 tons. Again, there was a substantial increase to confound the statements of those Avho declared that the tariff has been responsible for a slowing-down of production. The same position is disclosed by the figures relating to the coal-mining industry, notwithstanding the doleful story about the increased cost of mining machinery, higher labour costs and transport charges, plus the iniquitous provisions of the Navigation Act. the output of coal in Australia was 10,455,096 tons, and in 1923-4 our "" goslow "" miners produced 12.517,430 tons. Most people will conclude from these figures that the Australian workman is doing his job very well, and that there was no reason on earth for the Government to introduce a measure to deal with workers who may agitate for improved conditions in their respective occupations, though there might have been good reason for a bill to deal with profiteers and others who get in between the producer and the consumer and fleece the people. An examination of the statistics relating to our secondary industries discloses the same healthy state of affairs. In 1919-20 there were 16,251 factories in Australia. In 1923-4 the number had risen to 20,189, an increase of nearly 4,000 factories. Employees in ' 1919-20 numbered 376,734, and in 1923-4 429', 900. The value of the raw materials required for our factories in the latter year was £197,038,726; and the value of the output, representing value added by the manufacturing process, was £348,577,583, compared with an added value, in 1919, of £292,536,608. In 1919-20, each employee produced £777 worth of manufactured products; in 1923-4, this figure in creased to £811. Employees in our secondary industries are doing a very f a i r thing by their employers, so it ill becomes any honourable member to suggest that the Australian working man adopts the go-slow policy, or that the tariff is destroying his efficiency. The speeches made by honourable members who are opposed to the schedule have merely been a recapitulation of the propaganda literature published in the free trade interest. It is true that more The figures I have quoted show beyond all doubt that the Commonwealth has made substantial progress since the' in The troduction of the last tariff, and, unless it can be shown that some of the items in the schedule have been included merely for revenue purposes, I shall vote for the fullest protection to Australian industries.

UnlessI am convinced that the tariff is likely to operate harshly or injure the Commonwealth, the schedule w ill have my whole-hearted support.

The speech of the honourable member was most un-Australian, and most unreasonable. Judging by their speeches, he and other honourable members who followed him are prepared to accept any but Australian goods. member for Perth said by innuendo that the Tariff Board was not straight. He did not cite facts to prove that statement, but said he would do so later. We may therefore look forward to more speeches by what the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) described as "" marathon orators."" The honourable member spoke of certain things which, he said, ought to be "" suspiciously inquired into."" But all his suspicions were directed at the Australian manufacturer and worker; he has no suspicion of the foreign trader. for Forrest( Mr Ts there not reasonable ground for suspicion regarding the supply of foreign oil in this, country?

When the vote on this tariff is taken, the honourable member for Forrest( Mr Prowse) will learn who they are. I do not know of any case of a man who has turned from protection to free trade, but there have I should be sorry been notable instances of free traders becoming protectionists. One was the greatest of free traders, the late Sir George Beid, at one time Prime Minister of this count r y , who, before he died, became a firm protectionist. The right honourable member for North Sydney is another instance of a converted free trader. For many years he fought the free trade battle, but last night he said, "" We must change our opinions according to circumstances."" The circumstances in Australia to-day are such as to warrant the continuation of the Protection policy which this country adopted years ago. The honourable member for Perth referred to the power of the Minister for Trade and Customs under the tariff, but the powers of the Minister are as nothing when compared with the powers of the President of the United States of America, under the tariff of that country.

The President must do that within fifteen days. The honourable member for Perth said there was no such thing as unfair competition. But the Tariff Act of the United States of America, whicli in population, production, and wealth is an infinitely greater country than ours, says that there is such a thing as unfair competitionSection 316 makes unlawful unfair methods of competition and unfair acts of importation which have the effect or tendency to injure or destroy an industry in the United States efficiently and economically operated, or to prevent the establishment of sueh industry. What about the unfair competition of countries which, with a stroke of the pen, repudiated thus relieved themselves of hundreds of thousands started from scratch to send goods to this country. In 1919-20 Germany exported worth of goods to this country, but in 1924-25 £2,252,000 the people of Australia that they should trade to such an extent with a nation that world war.

I ask the honourable member whebelieve ther he ean buy Canadian newsprint today for £18 a ton. The newspaper proThe New Zeaprietors of Australia are not receiving the benefit of the £3 a ton preference granted at the price he should pay. to the Canadian manufacturers of newsAustralian print. The case would be different if there were a newsprint industry in Australia, but, in the absence of that, the Some honourable Canadian trader is able to take almost f u l l advantage of the preference we give Zealand him.

232,Mr Jackson,"Judging by figuresmoderate protectionists, there are certainly no moderate free traders. A member of Parliament to-day must either be a protectionist or a free trader. I should like to know to which category the honourable members for Perth, Forrest, and Swan belong. moderate protectionist is a moderate free trader. but those honourable members do not agree with it. The honourable member, for Swan said that this country could never be independent under protection. How does he propose to make us independent under free trade? We must either be dependent or independent. Many persons, when arguing about the tariff, regard it only from the financial point of view, but to me it is more important than nation is involved in it, for we must make our key industries secure. It is all very fine for honourable members to say that there will be no more war; we must be prepared for war. The adoption of a free trade policy will not help use to prepare for war; nor will it give any scope whatever for the development of the brains of our people. There are already too many ""wood and water joeys "" in Australia. If we are to be exploited by such combines as the American oil and film companies, at least we should be able to tax them; but some successfully avoid taxation, notably certain oil interests and the film combines. We can deal with the Australian combines, and the honourable member for Forrest( Mr Prowse) will fail in his duty if he 'does not help us to regulate the operations of the foreign combines. The big oil companies, by raising the price can hardly be questioned, and she is of petrol recently, will take out of the pockets of the general community in Australia more than twice the cost of the imported petrol pumps that they propose to install in the first few years. Some honourable members who have participated in this debate have had a good deal to say about honour in trade, but have not mentioned the dishonourable tactics of the foreign combines which are bleeding our people to the extent of millions of pounds a year. The honourable member for Maribyrnong ( Mr Fenton) introduced a discussion on petrol pumps recently, and the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes), who supported him, said that, although he was obliged to pay 2s. 2d. a gallon for petrol in Australia, he had bought it in America for less than Is. a gallon. What tremendous toll the American oil companies are levying on our people! So are the American motor car manufacturers and film producers. Honourable members who read the financial columns of the daily press will recollect seeing a statement last week to the effect that General Motors, the big American motor car corporation, had further watered its stock and paid a tremendous dividend to its shareholders. Its profits last year amounted to scores of millions of dollars; and Australians, who spent something like £11,000,000 on motor cars that year, contributed a considerable amount to the total. I was pleased to that. The safety of this hear the Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Pratten) say yesterday that he hoped that an all-Australian motor car would be produced in the not too-distant future. Honourable members who complain that our tariff is unjust to other countries should inform themselves a little of affairs abroad. After the war, when there was a tremendous amount of unemployment in the ""United States of America, the Government there did not tinker with a tariff, but absolutely prohibited the importation of certain manufactures, with the object of stimulating their production in America. A t the same time the steel manufacturers entered into an agreement to pool 10 per cent, of their output and dump it on foreign markets to break down local competition. These moves were successful in practically eliminating unemployment there. The supremacy of America in the world's trade strongly protectionist. I wish to point out to those honourable members who bave said a good deal about British trade, that many millions of pounds' worth of British manufactures are re-exported. Britain took every advantage of the preference we granted, to her. She sent a lot of her work to Germany, had it returned in an almost finished state, then put the finishing touches to it, and then exported it as British workmanship so that she could avail herself of our tariff privileges. The honourable member for Perth( Mr Mann) said yesterday that while the tariff barriers of the dominions were two-thirds",52,Combines At Work Forcing Up Prices Soaring Cost Op Living

234,"Mr Jackson""","That is my opinion,higher now than they were a number of years ago, foreign countries had reduced their tariff, in the same period, by one-fifth. A comparison of that kind is of little use. To make his case sound the honourable member should have stated the original basis on which the trade rested. Another incomplete argument that he advanced against the tariff was that years ago 83 per cent, of Australian imports were British. America at one time in her history had, also, to import practically the whole of her no money to trade. I do not agree, howrequirements from Great Britain. In the face of the statement of the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr of them within Australia. It is better Hughes), that in the last four years our imports from Great Britain had increased by more than £100,000,000, it is ridiculous to say that British manufacturers are unable to jump the tariff hurdle that faces them. Actually that increase was in three years. Under the tariff schedule before us we are proposing to give Great Britain additional preferences to the value of £500,000. mentioned this further great concession. Britain, as a matter of fact, ia very late, in recognizing that there are two sides; to a bargain,, and that there is such a thing as trade reciprocity. Britain ten times as much preference as she is giving us. told by honourable members who support the free trade principle, that if a country buys our produce we must buy goods from it of equal value. If that is so, I should like them to explain to me how it is that last year we bought goods from the United States of America to the value of £29,000,000 and she took goods from us to the value of only £11,000,000. The balance of trade between ourselvesand Canada is substantially in favour of our sister dominion. In spite of that, Canada is imposing a dumping duty on Australian butter. Instead of quoting inconclusive figures on a percentage basis, instead of volume, to show that we buy considerably ""less from England to-day than a few years ago, the honourable member for Perth would have been better employed in showing the downward trend of British exports to America, and the upward trend of American exports to money from somewhere to pay us; where Britain. I agree with the right honourable will she get it ? member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes), that Great Britain is losing her hold on the world's trade; she certainly has not the hold on it that she had twenty years ago. If the Great War had not occurred in 1914 Germany would have obtained in a few years by means of peaceful penetration what she failed to get by the war. We have heen told that it is of little use for a country to produce The United States of goods and store them. We must not only produce, but sell; otherwise we shall have, ever, that it is necessary for us to export our goods, to sell them. We may dispose: business for us to produce our requirements than to import them. We have been asked what will happen if the tariff reduces our collections through the Customs. I take it that every employer, as well as every employee, in Australia is a potential taxpayer. Eor that very reason we should take evea-y step possible to ensure that foreign combines, as well as local manufacturers, pay No free trade member has taxation in accordance with the profits they make here. I have referred to the oil companies and to the film, producers; and I could mention other similar commercial groups. Is the lesson of the war entirely lost on certain members of. the community? If I had had my way, we should have waited some years longer before, lifting the embargo on tbe importation of German goods.. If the payment of Germany's war indemnity to us depends upon, us buying German goods,, we should be well advised to forgo it altogether; for the importation of German goods to Australia can only result in the unemployment of Australian workmen. I deny that we are obliged to buy manufactured goods from the countries that buy our raw materials.. There is no reason why we should buy German pianos and mouth-organs and such things; but Germany, being a non-producer of woorli, must buy wool from somewhere. Australian wool is equal, if not siiperior, to that of any other country, so that if Germany wishes to manufacture superior woollen goods she will realize the wisdom of buying Australian raw material, hut we shall not be necessarily obliged to take her manufactures in payment.",53,Combines At Work Forcing Up Prices Soaring Cost Op Living

Whered i d she get the money to pay us? nations. same thing. We are not obliged to buy German goods. We did not buy them during the war, and we got on very well. The honourable member for Perth asserted that the tariff unfairly affects Great Britain. It is said that trade between countries should be reciprocal. If that is so, then trade between Australia and Great Britain is reciprocal, because last year we bought £65,000,000 worth of goods from Great Britain, and she took goods from us to the value of £64,000,000. To describe asreciprocal the trade between Australia and Canada, or Australia and the United States of America, would be a joke. Certaiu honourable members seem never to have a favorable word to say of any Australian industry.. I have referred to the agricultural implement industry, and I now refer briefly to the Australian sugar industry.. It seems to me that tlie service which the sugar industry rendered tor Australia, during the war, and the early post-war period, has been very readily forgotten by some honourable members. When the people in other countries of the world had to pay Is. a Ib., wholesale, for sugar a lb. the safe side. Wheni n some countries people had to pay Is. a l b . , wholesale, for sugar, the Australian consumers were obtaining sugar foE years at 3d. and 3Jd. a lb. saved the f r u it industry of this country. It made the condensed-milk industry. It helped quite a number of other Australian industries, notably, confectionery. people of Australia readily forget the service which the Australian sugar industry rendered this country in 1915, and up to 1922 or 1923. If the Government had not assumed control of their business those engaged in the Australian sugar industry could have exacted from Australian consumers the same toll as was exacted from consumers of sugar in other countries. It will be many years before we shall have repaid the services rendered the Commonwealth by the sugar industry. It stood the test of war, which is a test of any industry. embargo upon imported sugar now ? The honourable member would let any Australian industry go. Suppose that we wiped out the tariff altogether ? ber interjects that no one has suggested that, but I entirely misunderstood, the three-hours' effort of the honourable member for Perth( Mr Mann), if he does not desire that the tariff should be wiped out altogether. He asserted that there can be no such thing as a moderate protectionist, and, therefore, in his opinion, the tariff must go. He made a number of quotations from American writers of articles on economics, who soared high above the realm of practical things; but I remind the honourable member that in spite of those American writers, the United States of America is still a highly protected country, and in 1922 and 1923 she increased her tariff materially. America is a highly efficient nation, and why did she increase her tariff? It was because she knows very well that it is impossible for her to carry on with her 110.000,000 of population without a tariff against the rest of the world. The trade of America and Germany was established under protectionist tariffs. Australia can, and will, do the same. It seemed to me that the honourable member I want to keep on for Perth could not have been serious when he said that Australia is on the verge of a financial crisis. We should be on the verge of the worse crisis the country has ever known if we. were to tinker The Australian sugar industry with the tariff. I am not going to permit it to be whittled down to the slightest extent, because the crisis that the honourable member forecasted would come-if it is coming at all, and I I do not intend to let the do not think it is-fa r more rapidly if we had a reduced tariff. We find that this continent, w it h its 6,000,00 of people, is Great Britain's second best market. That is not a bad argument in support of the claim that .we give more than a reasonable preference to Great Britain.

England is held up to us as a shining example of the benefits of free trade; but her low tariff is the reason that no fewer than 1,250,000 of her people are unemployed and in receipt of the dole at the present time. I do not know what the result will be in England within a short period if she does not repeat in other cases what she did some time ago when she imposed duties on silk to meet the condition of the silk industry and thus secured the re-employment of numbers of people in the industry, and its further extension. the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) that England's position at the present time is precarious. Unless she does something to protect her home market, which is a tremendous one, she must shortly begin to go down hill very rapidly. The honourable member for Swan referred, to the increase in taxation in Australia, and blamed the tariff for it . very considerable credit in England That is entirely wrong. He quite forgot that there appears in our annual budget a sum of not less than £29,000,000 to cover war expenditure. It w ill be a long time before that expenditure is materially reduced. £415,000,000 have been raised by the Federal Government since 1915, and yet the tariff is blamed for the high cost of living and increased taxation in this community. One would think that Australia is the only country that has in creased its taxation. I have looked up some figures, and I find that in the United States of America, in 1916, there were 437,000 persons who paid tax on incomes. In 1919 the number had in creased to 5,332,000. This was in the country which is probably the wealthiest in the world, and certainly has most of the gold of the world in its vaults to-day. America, found it necessary to raise 81,200,000,000 in taxation in 1919, or more than twice the amount it raised from that source in 1916. This is the country that by its manufactures made all the money it could out of the war and then came in in 1917 to win the war. I admit that the entry of America into the struggle was the deciding factor in the victory of the Allies, but before entering the war America made every penny she could out of it . I say that we have not much to thank America for so far as her trade is concerned. One of the best reasons which can be advanced to induce us to help the Empire is the load which Britain is carrying, and if we are to increase our tariff we should have no hesitation in increasing it against a country like America, or against France, which, apparently, is not anxious to honour its obligations to pay its debts to Great Britain. The British Empire seems to me to be carrying a heavy burden of debt for almost every other country, whilst America has exacted her pound of flesh from England. Great Britain must be carrying a debt of hundreds of millions I agree with for countries like Russia, and we should do everything we can to help her. If in order to do so it should be found necessary to raise our tariff against America and other foreign countries, I should give such a proposal my support. A couple of years ago there was a financial crisis in Australia, due to the fact that whilst we had established a it could not be transferred to this country because the British Government prohibited the export of gold. The honourable member for Perth has said that money or gold is sent out of a Loans to the amount of country only in settlement of a trade balance. Between two and three years ago, we very badly wanted some gold in Australia. I know a Sydney firm that wished to buy its winter requirements of blankets, amounting in value to £40,000. It bad practically placed this order with an Australian firm, and went along to the bank to get the money. The bank authorities said they were very sorry, but. they could not lend it . Two days later, the same f i r m went to the same bank and borrowed £40,000 to bring out the blankets required from England. I know a boot manufacturer who got an order for £12,000 worth of boots. He wanted an advance of £2,000 to pay for the raw material he required. H is bank could not give h i m the £2,000 for his operations in Australia, but it advanced the necessary funds to enable h i m to i m port the whole of the boots he required from England.

254,Mr Jackson,"first of all, to reply to one or two of th© statements of the honourable member for Adelaide( Mr Yates). I desire to refute his statement that the late Mr John Darling was the head and tail of the liberal organization in South Australia. Nothing is further from the truth, and. I give it the most emphatic denial. should know a good deal more about it than the honourable member, because I am a member of that organization and he is not. By interjection, I referred to the celebrated remark that has been widely circulated in South Australia-""To hell with the farmers !"" The honourable member gave the credit, or the discredit, of having originated that remark, to a certain gentleman whom he named. My information is that it was made by a different member of the organization. Its use by two members suggests that it represents the thought of at least a portion of the party to which the honourable member for Adelaide belongs. calmness of reflection I think that the honourable member will regret his reference to my not having gone to the front. I do not care a tinker's benediction what the honourable member says about me, but in fairness to my wife and family of young children I consider that the slur which he cast upon me should be publicly repudiated. It must be patent to all that I have the shortest stature of any honourable member in this House. That was the reason why, at the outbreak of the war, I was not considered eligible for active service. I ascertained that I had no hope of being accepted, my authority for that statement being a lieutenant friend of mine. LaterI made several inquiries to see if the regulations regarding height and chest measurement had been relaxed sufficiently to admit me, but. on each occasion I found that I had neither the requisite height nor sufficient chest measurereport from the board appointed under this ment. ""When I finally came within the scope of the regulations, I enlisted, notwithstanding the fact that I was a married man with four young children, and was strongly advised by a number of digger friends that it was not my job. 1 make this statement, not for self-glorification, but in justice to my wife and children. When I left the town of Gladstone, in which I had lived for a number of years, and in which I had done a great deal of work for returned soldiers, a gentleman who spoke on behalf of and at the request of returned soldiers, said, in reference to me, "" Tho departing resident has been the best friend that the soldiers of Gladstone have ever had."" The honourable member for Adelaide dealt lengthily with the dried fruits and wine industries, of which he I admittedly, knows very little. them as the honourable member. ber quoted figures to prove that the production in the dried fruits industry had increased. The question is not one of production, but whether the growers can sell their products at a profit. Even he should know that there is at present on the notice-paper a bill to amend the Dried Fruits Advances Act of 1924. The precarious state of the growers rendered it necessary for the Government to make advances to them. When the time for In the repayment arrived, they were unable to discharge their liability, and an extension of time was granted. But even at the expiration of the extended period these men, who, according to the honourable member, are in a flourishing condition, were unable to pay. was flourishing. I merely quoted the figures that appear in the Oommonwealth Year-Booh. ber said that the industry was flourishing. have referred provides that repayments may be made in two instalments, spread over a period of two years. Clause 10L readsNotwithstanding anything contained in this act, the Minister may, upon the receipt of a act, release any grower either wholly or in part from his indebtedness in respect to an advance made to him under this act. That is a proof that the industry is not in a flourishing condition. Its production has certainly been great, but it has really suffered from over-production, and the growers have not been able to sell their products at a profitable price in the markets of the world. The generally accepted reason is that, from various causes, the cost of production in Australia is so high",57,Combines At Work Forcing Up Prices Soaring Cost Op Living

261,Mr Parsons,"The bill to which Ithat the growers cannot compete w i th other countries in which thc cost of production is lower, and the distance to the markets of the world shorter. conditions exist in the wine industry. The information that I shall place before the committee was obtained by me from persons who are engaged in the industry. The honourable member for Adelaide said that the production of wine in 1923-4 was 14,500,000 gallons. For his information, I may mention that in the year 1924-5 the production declined to 32,500,000 gallons, because of climatic conditions. The normal consumption of Australian wine is 9,000,000 gallons. It w ill thus be seen that there has been over-production in that industry also. were not able to carry on, and the industry was in a state of collapse. The Commonwealth Government had to come to their assistance. Let me show what this industry has done. Originally there was an excise duty amounting to 6d. per proof gallon on for t if y in g spirit. reason for the imposition of that excise was to secure funds w it h which to cover That was found to be insufficient, and the excise was raised to 9d. In 1915 revenue was badly needed, and the excise was raised to 6s. per proof gallon purely for war revenue. ducers were led to believe that they would obtain -some relief after the Avar. The excise of 6s. per proof gallon is really equal to 10s. on pure spirit. No other country has excise on fortifyin g spirit, and this is a factor that should be taken into consideration in discussing the tariff. A bounty was asked for of 4s. a gallon. Great Britain also gave preference to our wines. figures w i ll indicate how essential the bounty is to enable us to dispose of our surplus Wine and Spirit Gazette of the 24th October, 1925, records the sale of Spanish"" Tarragona"" tawny wine at from £10 10s. to £12 a pipe, which Avorks out at a little less than 2s. a gallon. Avines, oAving to the fact that they have a shorter carriage, and do not travel through the tropics, can be under 30 per cent, -of alcoholic strength, and are ' therefore subject to the British tariff of 2s. 6d. a gallon. The wine in bond costs 2s. a gallon, casks included. The duty is 2s. [66] 6d., which means that the cost of the wine out of bond in London is4s. 6d. The cost of Australian sweet wines f.o.b. Similar at 5s. 6d. a gallon, less 4s. bounty, is Is. 6d. The casks are of oak, and ar® priced at the rate of Is. a gallon. The freight, insurance, and landing charges amount to 10d., and the duty on wine over 30 per cent, strength is 2s. I might explain that the British duty on wine of over 30 per cent, strength is 6s. We get a preference of 4s., which reduces the duty to 2s., and this makes the cost of our wine 5s. 4d. out of bond, London. It Avill be seen, therefore, that the cost of our Avines is 5s. 4d. as against 4s. 6d. for cheap Spanish wines. Against this is the fact that Australian wines contain about The grape-growers 5 per cent, more spirit, and this makes it possible for us to compete w i th foreign Avinesi n Great Britain. There is no doubt that a crisis would have occurred, and many of our soldier settlers Avould have been ruined, if the Government had not come to the assistance of the grape groAvThe sole ers. It is to the credit of the Government that it was prepared to assist men AA'ho had fought for this country and who the cost of supervision. really had a right to expect something in return.

A ton and a half of grapes is a low estimate for a non-irrigated area.

I would point out that any disaster to this industry w ill fall mostly on the returned soldiers on the irrigated The following areas.

The honourable member for Adelaide( Mr Yates) quoted figures to show that the grape-growing industry was in a flourishing condition, but the fact that this industry has produced so much does Spanish not count for anything. What counts is that these settlers shall be able to carry on at a profit. It is common knowledge that without a bounty from the Government it would be absolutely impossible for these settlers to carry on. The honourable member for Adelaide has endeavoured to mislead the general public. say that the grape-growing industry is in a flourishing condition. he had not studied his figures more carefully than he did. I come now to the tariff and my attitude towards it. first care of the Government the primary producers, because them it would be impossible for this country to carry on. I believe in the establishment of secondary industries, and in protection as a means to this end. Ave must be careful that wo do not go to extremes when imposing duties. I am not a prohibitionist, but I do not believe that the price of any foreign articles necessary in this country should be prohibitive because of the effect of the tariff. a great mistake to put a duty on ths whole of a certain class of imports the Australian industry can only produce, Say, 2£ per cent, of our requirements. would suggest a bounty in such a case. I have studied the amended tariff item by item, and I shall discuss several later, particularly tiles. business for the last 27 years, ever since I left school. to any one who has a knowledge of soft goods, that either the Tariff knows little about the textile trade, or has been woefully misled. imposed that, to use a colloquial sion, ""would make a cat laugh."" Minister,, when introducing said that children's vests were turned out at as low as 9s. 6d. a dozen at one factory in Australia. under the tariff is 2s. 6d. It is really a joke, and is not a tariff at all. I can easily see where the mistake has arisen. The full-sized garment was in tlie mind of the person responsible for the imposition of the duty of 2s. 6d. was rightly imposed to shut out some of the rubbish that was coming here by placing it under the garment tariff. the person concerned did not understand the trade well enough to bear in mind the fact that the tariff would also apply to children's vests and underwear So the Minister is proposing a duty of 2s. 6d. per garment on vests which, in small sizes, can-be purchased in Great at 4s. per dozen. An ad valorem duty of even 300 ner cent, would be moderate, in comparison with this impost of 2s. 6d. on Mr Parsons. It is absolutely wrong to a garment worth ""4d. in the factory. An iniustice in connection with this duty is It is a pity that that the delivery of goods which were on order when the duty was imposed was delayed until the termination of the seaThe men's strike, and the importers then found should be their warehouses stocked with an article without saleable at about Is., but on which they had to pay a duty of 2s. 6d. Household sewing cottons up to 400 yards in the reel have always been admitted free under the But British preferential tariff. I can see no other reference to cottons in this schedule except "" sewing threads and sewing cottons, n.e.i., 25 per cent."" I have handled cottons, wholesale and retail, and as agent for a British manufacturer. The It is cottons used in factories which produce ready-made clothing are on reels or cardwhen board frames carrying about 2000 yards, and it seems to me that these cottons are I to be subjected to a duty of 25 per cent. If that is so. the manufacturers will be penalized, but that surely cannot be the intention of the Minister. That item is items another indication that the Tariff Board those relating to texeither knows very little about the softI have been connected with this goods trade or has been misled. In regard to cotton tweeds, I shall have a great deal Some of the items show to sav later. Since 1906 I have been actively interested in country stores, and Board have sold thousands of pairs of cotton tweed trousers. When I was on the land Duties are I used trousers of cotton tweed and expreswhat is known as ""shoddy."" For the The information of the Minister, I may say the tariff, that that term does notrefer to cotton tweed, but to a cheap, rubbishy woollen material produced from scraps and floor The duty on each garment sweepings. I have always advised my customers against the purchase of "" shoddy "" ; indeed, I refused to stock it . But there are such materials as engineers' twist, naps, and strong cotton tweeds which have taken the place of the old-time The duty moleskin. The cotton tweed is not only easier to wash-and we should remember"" that the worker's wife has no electrical But washing appliances-bu t also> has all the wearing properties of moleskin, besides being more suitable to a warm climate. A person wearing woollen tweeds or serge generally. trousers in the country suffers purgatory from burrs and prickles, but these vegetable nuisances do not attach themselves Britain to cotton tweed. The heavy duty which is being imposed on this class of clothing will be paid principally by the workers both in the towns and on the farms. No doubt the intention of the Minister is to encourage the manufacture of cotton tweeds in Australia. I am not advocating the use of the cheap, rubbishy stuff that is imported from Japan. Japan? The merchant imports it , and the country storekeeper buys it from him. ingly bought any of this material from Japan, but I have sold sound British cotton tweeds. a friend in the trade that it is very cotton tweed from Australian manufacturers. W h a t is to happen while local factories are getting ready to supply the demand ? Are the State Parliaments to be asked to amend their legislation so that people may be allowed to go about iu a state of nature, or will the workers be compelled to wear woollen tweeds that are more costly, less durable, and uncomfortable ? If a cotton-tweed industry can be established in Australia, rather than impose a prohibitive duty Parliament should offer a bounty u n t i l such time as local factories can supply a reasonable proportion of Australia's requirements. member is not aware that from twelve to fifteen mills in Australia are making cotton tweeds. wonder why, for months past, they have been refusing orders from people who are prepared to pay cash, but cannot stock their warehouses because supplies are coming forward in an inconstant trickle. I know something about this subject, and I know the difficulty of getting supplies from factories. The proposed duty on children's vests w ill do more than prohibit thc importation of these articles. after year I have placed orders for vests -women's , children's, and maids, O.S. and small in all sizes-and as I was able to pay cash I could get f u l l cash discounts, but I could not get my orders f u l filled by Australian factories. Sometimes I would get O.S. vests and sometimes small women's sizes, but frequently for month after month I was short of maids', children's, and infants' sizes. quently, when the winter came on, and customers began to cry out for these sizes, I was compelled to go to the warehouses and ask them to supply me with vests of British manufacture. My patriotism led me to t r y to encourage Australian manufacture, but by doing so T lost trade. that? have only given up my business in the last two or three months to take on the political job of representing Angasi n this House. I am not tryin g to mislead the Minister. I am speaking in quite a I am informed by friendly way, because it is my desire to see the tariff an effective one, and one in difficult to get supplies of which there are no silly mistakes harmful to the workers as well as to the primary producers of Australia. In general, I agree w i th the tariff, but there are one or two defects which I should like to see removed from it . To me, speaking with the experience of a lifetime in the soft-goods trade, these seem to be absolutely ridiculous. I do not think the Minister wants to impose a schedule of duties which w ill afterwards be a laughing-stock in Australia and. elsewhere. Therefore, I appeal to him to give these matters serious consideration. In that respect I am sure I shall have the support of the honourable member for Wakefield ( Mr Foster), who has had longer experience in the soft-goods trade than I have had, and whose opinion the Minister w ill respect. member change his opinion if it can be proved that the Australian factories can supply the whole of the requirements of the community ? possible, I do not think the Minister wants to impose a duty of 2s. 6d. against Great Britain on an article, which can be produced in Australia for 9s. 6d. a Year dozen. That is a duty I would impose to prohibit the importation of goods produced by coloured labour. A t any rate, it is an impost which is incompatible with our general attitude towards Great Britain. The Minister, and also the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr. Hughes) have emphasized the fact that we have a preferential tariff in favour of the Mother Country, but there Conseis nothing in favour of the Mother Countryi n a duty of 2s. 6d. on an an article which can be bought for 4d.
