7,"Page 3450), On Motion By Mr Watson","the Constitution, In my opinion, the question should be settled this session. Honourable members have seen all the sites which aie likely to be chosen, and nothing remains now but to select one for the Seat of Government. The tacit understanding has been arrived at that during the discussion of the motion for the second reading of the very simple Bill now before usin some respects it is almost too simplethe merits of the rival sites should not be discussed. I think that understanding a wise one, because there is enough to occupy our attention, during this debate, at sufficient length without such discussion. The first question which arises is whether the form of procedure adopted is that which is most likely to result in the -settlement of the matter this session. The procedure proposed is similar to that adopted on the last occasion when the matter was before us, but I regret that the Government have not seen their way clear to take the responsibility of proposing a site. The Bill before us was introduced by them in the Senate, and, with certain small modifications, has been forwarded by that body to this House..; but the Government, like their predecessors, take no responsibility in regard to it. I fear that without such Ministerial responsibility, we may on this occasion come to the lame and impotent conclusion at which we arrived last session, so that the subject may be hung up indefinitely. Mr G. B . EDWARDS prognostication of the Prime Minister is correct. I am not now so particular as I was as to the choosing of one or other of several very good sites which have been suggested, so long as we come to some determination; but I endorse the opinion expressed by the right honourable member for Adelaide last session, that the question has been before us so long, and has been dealt with in such a peculiar fashion, that the time has arrived for the Government to acknowledge their responsibility in regard to if, and to put forward some definite proposal for acceptance or rejection by Parliament. ment would have taken that responsibility; but I find that, instead of doing so, they have been content to introduce' into the Senate a short Bill in which a blank was left for the insertion of the name of the district to be chosen. That blank has been filled by the Senate, and we are now invited to ratify their choice, or to substitute some other name. It would have been better for the Government, acting on the official advice which they had obtained, to propose the selection of some site, leaving it to the Parliament to say whether it would or would not accept that site. I am rather sorry that the B ill was first introduced into the Senate. I hold that the measure should have been introduced' in the first instance into this Chamber. There is a certain amount of doubt, in my mind, upon the point-upo n which I have had the honour of conferring with Mr Speaker, who disagrees with me-whethe r the B ill should not constitutionally have been introduced here. We are asked in this measure to settle almost all the preliminaries in connection with the acquisition of the Federal Territory, and it seems to me that by passing it we shall leave the Executive in the position to perform all the acts necessary for the establishment of the Seat of Government. There would be nothing to prevent the Executive from negotiating for the acquisition of the Territory, for the purchase of which this Parliament would have to provide the money, and, without doubt, if .they arranged the terms on which the Territory should be acquired we should be committed to carrying them out. If that be so, we shall, by passing this measure, commit Parliament to a considerable expenditure, and, consequently, in my opinion, the B i ll should have been introduced into this House in the first instance. That course was adopted in the American Congress, when a question similar to that now before us was I hope that the under consideration. The Bil l relating to the acquisition of a site for the federal capital was first introduced into the House of Representatives, and thence forwarded to the Senate. Mr .WATSON -The Senate would not agree with the honourable member's argument. Mr G. B . EDWARDS -Some honourable members think that there has been no delay in settling this question. They urge that it is of such magnitude, and is surrounded by so many difficulties, I had hoped that this Governthat we have made as much baste as could reasonably have been expected under the circumstances. Again, I should like to revert to the facts connected with the settlement of a similar difficulty in the early days of the American UnionI t seems to me that, so far as we have gone, history is repeating itself, except that the early American statesmen approached the question with a greater desire for settlement at",12,South African Honours
8,Mr Watson,"I do not think so.the earliest possible moment than has been manifested by the statesmen of the Commonwealth. The matter was brought up in the very first session of the American Congress, which was held at New York. A Bill was introduced into the House of Representatives, and led to the most heated debate of that session. The representatives of the Southern States wished that the federal capital should be situated on the Potomac, whereas the gentlemen from Pennsylvania, who represented a considerable section of the active political life of the day, wished to return to Philadelphia, which had been the seat of the old Continental Congress prior to the Union. The House of Representatives, after a stormy debate, agreed, as a matter of compromise, to fix the seat of government on the Susquehanna. In this form, the Bill was forwarded to the Senate, which amended it by substituting ten square miles adjoining Philadelphia for the proposed site on the Susquehanna. The House considered this amendment, and practically agreed to it, . but returned the Bill to the Senate with some minor amendments, which, in the then state of feeling on the part of the Southern representatives, led to the measure being .shelved for tbe session. The question was again brought on at the beginning of the serond session of Congress,and it was then decided that the seat of government should be fixed for ten years at Philadelphia, and thereafter permanently on the Potomac, at the site now occupied by the city of Washington. the delay which has taken place here occurred in America, I may mention that within ten years the Parliament of the United States met at Washington. A good deal has been said with regard to the draw. a strong anti-New South Wales feeling over backs attendant upon the establishment of the Seat of Government in a so-called bush capital. It is a well-known fact that -the members of the United States Legislature put up with very considerable inconvenience in the early days of the meeting of Parliament at Washington. I have read that Mrs. Adams, the wife of the then President, dried her washing in the pre-sent audience chamber of the Capitol, which was then unfinished. The members of the United States Parliament had to do the best they could in the way of obtaining accommodation in those days. We have .to look forward to a similar state of affairs, and I do not think we need fear that honourable members will be unwilling to submit to the hardships and difficulties connected with life in a Federal capital in the initial stage. I hope that we shall avoid many of the mistakes that were made in connection with the establishment of Washington. We should at least guard against the cardinal blunder then made in the selection of a site. The spot selected for the site of Washington was unfortunately a large marsh, and very large sums indeed have been spent in draining and making it. fit for use. I trust that we shall profit by this experience, and that we shall also share the view of the Americans that such a matter should be settled as speedily as possible. They foresaw that the. trouble over the question would increase, if they did not arrive at an early decision. Delay in our case also appears to be fraught with danger, and is the great weapon used by the opponents--if 1 may so style them-of the rights of New South Wales under the Federal compact to have the Capital. fixed within her territory. All the measures that, are taken for delay, whether or not they are so intended, certainly will have the effect of prejudicing the rights of New South Wales under the Constitution. These efforts to delay a settlement are doing as much as anything else to foster that spirit of parochialism which every one seems to decry, but which so many seem to be doing something to encourage. I regret that some of our great metropolitan newspapers have done as much as probably the most malicious individual could do to foster this parochial spirit, and to create difficulty between the two States which are To show that nothing like principally interested in the settlement of this great question. Nothing could be more anti-Federal than the spirit of the articles which have appeared in the Age. Their general tenor has been such as to stir up the question of the Capital, and all the methods adopted for creating delay are apparently intended to prevent that State from securing 'her undoubted rights. I . do not think for one moment that any one can accuse the representatives or the people of New South Wales of desiring to do anything with regard to the settlement of this question in any other than a thoroughly Federal spirit. There is no desire on their part, for instance, that Sydney should be the capital. It has been suggested on more than one occasion, and even in connection with the amendment we are now considering, that if the representatives of New South Wales agreed to a certain alteration of the Constitution, the State -should have the seat of the Federal Government in Sydney or contiguous to it. As I stated before my constituents in New South Wales, I do not desire any such alteration of the Constitution. I wish to see its provisions faithfully observed, and before I resume my seat I think I shall be able to show that in giving effect to them we shall incur less expense, less trouble, and shall secure something infinitely better than we shall do by fixing the Capital either in the midst of tlie city of Sydney or contiguous to it. Another objection of which use has been made by the opponents of the scheme has reference to the area of the Federal Territory. I regret to say that the Bill, which, in this respect, must be fathered that when the Constitution laid it down that by the present Administration, again embodies the principle of demanding from New South Wales an unusually large area of territory for the purposes of the Federal Capital. To my mind, we should not entertain any idea of creating a sort of Federal State. We do not want-that. this Bill does not represent the dimensions of a cattle station. Mr G. B. EDWARDS I am aware that we are accustomed to associate our notions of land holding in Australia with large areas. But, at"" the same time, there should be no desire to create a separate Federal State as the seat of the Commonwealth Government.' ThoughI , in common with many other honourable members, believe that, where the nature of the country permits, or even suggests it, we should increase the minimum area of ioo square miles embodied in the Constitution, if by so doingwe can more naturally define its boundaries by means, say, of a river, or a chain of mountains, I hold that we are going the wrong wav to work by declaring in this Bill that the area shall not be less than 900 square miles. Any extension of that sort must necessarily excite-^as I fear many.of its advocates intend it to excite-the ' animosity of New_ South Wales regarding the intentions of this Parliament in respect of the Capital Site. From the present temper of the people of that State, and from the spirit which was evinced by its last two Governments, I can conceive that New South Wales is quite prepared to meet in a liberal way any reasonable requests by this Parliament.' Nevertheless, I hold that to put a pistol to the head of the Government of that State-as is attempted to be done in this Bill-wil l defeat the end of many of us who desire to acquire a larger"" territory than the minimum area prescribed in the ""Constitution. If the site selected by this Parliament is in a locality where it will be a distinct advantage to obtain an enlarged territory, I do not think that any difficulty will be experienced in securing it ; but to incorporate any such demand in this Bill will probably lead to many differences. The right honourable member for Swan, who is as.patriotic as is any honourable member of this Parliament, who is sincerely interested in the welfare of Australia, and who in this matter has no particular leanings either towards Victoria or New South Wales, was forced by his sound common sense to admit the Federal territory should embrace a minimum area of 100 square miles, it meant that that area should be exceeded if necessary, and that possibly an area of 200 square miles might be acquired. But no reasonable interpretation of that particular provision of the Constitution can suggest that we should seek to acquire as much as 900 square miles, without the matter first being made the subject of negotiations between this Parliament and the Government ' of New South Wales. The New South Wales Federal Association an organization which, I venture to say, has the interests of Federation very warmly at heart, and which is imbued with an enthusiasm of the broadest possible character-hel d a meeting on Friday evening last, to consider the present position in regard to this Bill. At that gathering the following resolutions were unanimously carried :1. That in the opinion of this Committee in naming the minimum of 100 square miles as the area for the Federal territory, the framers of the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act meant that about 100 square miles, or even up to 260 square miles, could be requisitioned for by the Federal Government, but it was never intended that the very much larger area of 900 square miles would have to be given by this State, as now enjoined in the clauses of the Seat of Government B ill before the O mmonwealth Parliament. The proposals in that measure are, consequently, contrary to the letter and spirit of the bond of union, as understood by the electors voting for the Amended Constitution Bill after the original B ill had been rejected by them at the first referendum, so that a compromise directing the Capital Site to be in New South Wales had to be subsequently inserted. 2. That this league, therefore, respectfullyprotests against the excessive area proposed to be taken from New South Wales for a site for the Federal Capital, as the rules of the league adopted in 1883, provide for its "" advocating, promoting, and after its attainment, defending",13,South African Honours

That copies of the forthcoming resolutions terests of everybody concerned. be forwarded to the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth and the Premier of New South -Wales. I claim that these resolutions, which were passed by the organization in questiona .body which, to my knowledge, as a member of it, is actuated by the sincerest patriotism in its widest possible sense--constitut e simply an expression of justice and of the common opinion of the. people of New South Wales concerning this attempt to make the area of the Federal territory very much -larger than there is any necessity for it to be. sult in the Commonwealth Parliament Moreover, any such attempt will engender friction with the New South Wales Government, and will possibly land us in a difficulty. It is now known that the late Premier of New South Wales, Sir John See-in opposition, I believe, to the opinion of the majority of the people of that State-a t one time offered to re-open this question by endeavouring to amend the Constitution so as to permit of the Capital being located either in Melbourne or Sydney. That is the spirit of the amendment submitted by the honourable member for Corangamite. He seeks to effect an amendment of the Constitution so that the Seat of Government may be permanently located either at Sydney or Melbourne. I hold that Sir John See advocated the adoption of that course-as did also many writers in the public press, including Senator Dobson, and Mr Dangar, a gentleman who is closely identified with the interests of New South Wales-as a concession to the prejudices of other States. I claim that there is no desire, either on the part of New South Wales, or of any of the other States, to depart from the letter of the Constitution in this respect. It is better for us to carry ,out the original arrangement, and before I conclude my remarks, I hope to be able to show that it will be more economical for us to do that, than to reopen the whole question, so as to permit of the Capital being established either in Melbourne or Sydney. many advantages to be gained, and many 'dangers to be lavoided by adhering to that arrangement, and by erecting our Capital in some portion of the territory of New South Wales which is suitable for the purpose. The amendment submitted by the honourable member for Corangamite has not the slightest chance of being carried, although I credit its author most fully with an honest desire to bring about a settlement of. this question, in the inButI would point out that that amendment, if supported at alii will be supported by persons who are not actuated by the same high and honourable motives. It will be used as a sort of red herring-to be dragged across the trail to prevent the settlement of this question. Many,"" will doubtless support it, who have not the slightest idea of giving effect to it. Their action will be prompted rather by a desire to delay a settlement, in the hope that some new condition of affairs will arise, which will rebeing permanently located in Melbourne. I. cannot vote for the amendment, because I do not think that those outside this Parliament who would support it would be actuated by the same high motives which iprobably dictated its submission to the House. In moving it the honourable member for Corangamite referred to the two national parks, each comprising some 36,000 acres, in the vicinity of Sydney, and said that one of these might well be chosen as the site of the Seat of Government. The same suggestion was made by the Sydney Daily Telegraph during the Federal campaign. That newspaper sent aCommissioner to one of these parks to map it out as a site for the Federal Capital, and even produced pictures showing a fortress in the style of Warwick Castle, a proposed residence for the Commander-in-Chief, after the design of Windsor Castle, and views of gondolas moving up and down the placid waters of the salt water inlets which exist there. These proposals were put forward as a bait to induce the people of Sydney and suburbs to vote against the Commonwealth Bill, in the hope that, if it were rejected, it would be so amended as to allow of the Federal Capital being established in one of these parks. As I interjected, when the honourable member < for Corangamite was speaking, however, a visitor to either of these parks would see that, although attractive and romantic, it was utFurther, there are terly unsuited for any such purposes as we contemplate.

It is not often in the world's history that an opportunity is presented to create a city-to lay out a city in accordance with ideal conditionsPrior to the foundation of Washington, there are so few instances in history that we have to go as far back as the creation of Constantinople, some 330'years after Christ. Prior to that, again, the only instance which I can call to mind is that of the city of Megalopolis, which was created in Greece some 370 years before Christ. cities were each laid out on a plan which was observed from the very beginning. We have now an opportunity to appreciate and avoid the blunders which are admitted to have been made in the case of Washington. We have an opportunity to create a city which will be not only a satisfaction to ourselves, but an object of interest to the whole world, and I can see no reason, financial or otherwise, why we should not successfully carry out such a scheme. This Commonwealth will, in future, be the scene of large activities. nised by most writers that the activity of the world will be made much more manifest in the region of the Pacific than it has hitherto been-that that region will rival the other great trading areas of the earth's surface. We ought to create the Commonwealth Capital with a thorough appreciation of the future destiny of Australia. The Capital ought not only to show in the concrete all our ideals of the beautiful, but it ought to be designed to be the centre of our intellectual life, and the heart of our nationalism and patriotism. The future city should more than realize the dreams of Plato, of Bacon, and of Harrington, possessing as we do the additional advantages, of the latest practical ideas of the electrician, the scientist, and the sanitary engineer. We can, I think, create a model city, which will be a delight to Australians, and the admiration of the world, and, as I said before, without any expense to the people of the Commonwealth. I i will, I believe, be a city of which we shall be proud; and for that reason I give the Bill my hearty support, though I shall oppose those provisions which, by causing friction with the State of New. South Wales, might prove detrimental to the acBut our object complishment of our object. If we are to have this question settled, we should recognise that it is not necessary or desirable to say to New South Wales-""If you do not give us 900 square miles, we shall not settle the Federal Capital question."" We have only to determine on what we desire, and then say to New South Wales"" This is the spot which we think best suited for the purpose; how much land can you give us ?"" If that course be taken, I believe we shall be met in a spirit of the greatest liberality.' not only by the reigning powers of New South Wales, but by the whole of the people of that State. The question is said to be complicated by some constitutional difficulties. The point These has been already raised whether this Parliament or the Federal -Government is entitled td select and acquire territory, or whether we ought not, first of all, to obtain an .offer of land from New South Wales. For my own part, I do not think we need trouble ourselves with those constitutional questions. If we go in a Federal spirit to the people of New South Wales and tell them what site we think is best suited for our purpose, I believe we shall be met in the same spirit, and that we shall be told to take as much land as we like within reason. It is recogWe may then hope to proceed with proper caution, and erect the necessary buildings for the use of the Commonwealth; and I believe that in a few years this Parliament will be able to meet in the Federal Capital. Though we shall be under some disadvantage at first, I have no doubt that ultimately we shall feel that we did right in pressing forward the solution of this important question.

A paper has also been circulated, setting forth the motion of the Minister as it will read if the amendments of which I have given notice are carried. The firstnamed document contains a series of figures and illustrations designed to explain the effect of my proposal. to trouble honourable members with the matter, but I think that the choice of a site is of sufficient importance to justify us in endeavouring to determine the right method of selection. That is my. apology, if one be needed, for my present action. I am sure that every honourable member desires that the site chosen by our ballot shall be that which is really the preference of the House as against' any other site. typical method of obtaining such a result would be to take each of the proposed sites in pairs, pitting one against the other,, in which case the site which on a series of votes had beaten all the others should be really the choice of the House. But the difficulties in the way of carrying out such a ballot are considerable, and there is also the possibility of that happening which has occasionally occurred in regard to the cricket matches played between teams representing the three largest States of the Union, when A has beaten B, B has beaten C, and C, in defiance of all the laws of logic, has beaten A. avoids even such a contingency, and at the same time insures a determination founded upon the actual choice of the House, I take it that it is desirable to adopt it. do not profess to be the parent of the proposals which I am now explaining. Every mathematician of note who has considered the matter will vouch for my statement that the scheme I put forward absolutely insures the selection of the actual choice of a majority of those balloting, which is what we wish to obtain. TheI think the right proposal of the Government-whic h was the scheme we followed last time-is that each honourable member shall vote for one site, the site obtaining the smallest number of votes in the first ballot being struck out, and a fresh ballot being taken in regard to the remaining sites, the votes for the unsuccessful site being in each case transferred to the remaining sites. Thus, by a series of exclusions, it at last happens that only one site is left, which is, of course, that chosen. That scheme has To this many advantages to recommend it, but it is open to the grave objection that it is not only possible, but probable, that the site first rejected may be that which would have been the -choice of an absolute majority of honourable members if it had been pitted against every other site. The proposal which I am now putting before the House is not the same as that which I put before honourable I am sorry members on the last occasion. At that time. I merely wished to carry out the Government scheme by one ballot instead of by a series of ballots. My present proposal differs essentially from my original proposal in that it prevents .a site from being rejected which is really the choice of the majority of honourable members. Befoie proceeding to explain 'the system whose adoption I urge, I would remind the House that the The method of voting and the method of scrutiny are two very different things. The method of voting proposed is that the names of the sites-whethe r the three suggested by the Government or any others-shal l be printed on the ballot-papers, and shall be numbered by those balloting in the order of their prefeience, the voter putting opposite the name of the site which he most prefers the figure i ; opposite the site he next prefers Dhe figure 2, and so on to the end of the list. If there were eight sites, they would be numbered by voters with the figures 1 to 8. When the ballot-papers have been Buti f a scheme can be found which so marked, there are at least five different ways in which they can be scrutinized, and the question for us to determine is whether there is any method of scrutiny which will I obtain absolutely satisfactory results. The Government method of striking out after each ballot the name of the site which has received the lowest number of votes is, in principle, similar to the method of marking the ballot paper in order of preference with the figures 1, 2, 3, and so on, and scrutinizing by the method of transferring the votes given to the site lowest in the list to the",20,Schedule
42,Mr Batchelor,,21,Schedule
43,Mr Mccay (Corinella),"I have givenother sites; but to show the unsoundness of that method, since it is possible, under it, for the real choice of the majority to be beaten at the first ballot, I have prepared an illustration which is printed in the paper to which I have referred. I have named the three sites, Melbourne, Sydney, and Brisbane, since none of these places' can be chosen by t'he House. assume that seventy-one votes are polled; of which Melbourne received thirty, Sydney twenty-four, and Brisbane seventeen. If the Government method of selection were adopted, the name of Brisbane would be struck off the ballot-paper, and, on the second ballot, the seventeen votes cast for that city would be distributed between Melbourne and Sydney, one of which would win. Brisbane, although defeated on the first ballot, might actually have been the preference of the House. It may have been that of the thirty who voted for Melbouhe, twenty preferred Brisbane as their second choice and ten preferred Sydney; and of the twenty-four who voted for Sydney, twenty preferred Brisbane, and four preferred Melbourne, as their second choice; while of the seventeen who voted for Brisbane, ten preferred Sydney, and seven preferred Melbourne, as their second choice. Now, with only three sites, there are six orders of preference possible, namely,"" Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane,"" which I shall term ClassI . ; ' "" Melbourne, Brisbane, Sydney,"" which I shall term Class II . ; ""Svdriev. Melbourne, Brisbane,"" Class III ' . ; '""'Svdnev, Brisbane, Melbourne."" Class IV.;"" "" Brisbane, Melbourne, Sydney,"" ClassV . ; and "" Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne."" Class VI . Of the thirty who voted for Melbourne as a first choice, I assume that ten preferred Sydney as a second choice, and Brisbane as a third choice; while the remaining twenty preferred Brisbane as a second choice, and Sydney as a third choice. Of the twenty-four who originally voted for Sydney, I assume that four preferred Melbourne, and'twenty preferred Brisbane, as their second choice. Of the seventeen who voted for Brisbane, I assume seven would put Melbourne second, and ten would put Sydney second. Pitting Melbourne against Sydney, the result would be that in ClassI . Melbourne would get ten votes, and Sydney none; in Class II . , Melbourne would get twenty, and Sydney none; in Class III . , Melbourne none, and Sydney four; in Class IV., Melbourne none, and, leaving Brisbane out of consideration, Sydney twenty; in Class V., Melbourne seven, and Sydney none; and in Class VI . , Sydney ten, and Melbourne none. Adding up the figures, it will be seen that thirty-seven first preferences go to Melbourne, and only thirty-four to Sydney, so that Melbourne beats Sydney. Now, pitting Melbourne against Brisbane, I the results are that in ClassI . Melbourne obtains ten preferences; in Class II . , twenty; and in Class III . , four; while in Classes IV., V., and VI . , Brisbane obtains twenty, seven, and ten preferences respectively. Adding up the figures again, we find that Melbourne obtains preferences totalling thirty-four, and Brisbane preferences totalling thirty-seven, so that Brisbane beats Melbourne. Now, comparing SydneyI wish to show, however, that and Brisbane in the same way, we find that in ClassI . , Sydney obtains ten preferences; in Class II . , Brisbane twenty; in Class III . , Sydney four; in Class IV.. Sydney twenty; in Class V., Brisbane seven ; and in Class VI . , Brisbane ten, giving Sydney thirty-four, and Brisbane thirtyseven, so that Brisbane beats Sydney. In other words, when Melbourne and Brisbane are contrasted, Brisbane wins; and when Sydney and Brisbane are contrasted, Brisbane also wins. Therefore, every one will agree that Brisbane is the, choice of the House, because it has beaten each of the other places. Yet these are the very figures in the Government scheme under which Brisbane is the first to be rejected. These are thefiguresthat I have used to i l lustrate the unsoundness of the system proposed by the Government. They show that the system of dropping the site which obtains the fewest number of first votes may result in the actual choice of the House being defeated at the very outset. My system works out with exactly the same result as that of pitting each site against each other site. Honourable members will mark 1 against their first choice, 2 against their second choice, and 3 against their third choice. The scrutineers will then make a list, and, still using the names I have mentioned, will place opposite Melbourne, for instance, the figure marked against it on the ballot-paper. If Melbourne were marked 1. they would place that figure against its name. If Brisbane were marked 2, they would place the figure 2 against it, and if Sydney were marked 3, that figure would go opposite the name of that place. After the whole .of the voting papers are gone through, the scrutineers will add up the totals. My illustration shows that Melbourne was marked i upon thirty papers; that is to say, thirty I'S would be marked on the scrutineers' list opposite the name of Melbourne. Then again, if honourable members will look at the classes mentioned on the first page, they will see that in classes III. and V., Melbourne is second on the list, and in classes IV. and VI., is third. Therefore, upon eleven papers, Melbourne was marked 2, and eleven multiplied by two gives Melbourne twenty-two points. Then, Melbourne is marked 3 in classes IV. and VI. There are thirty ballot-papers in those classes, and, therefore, Melbourne is entitledto ninety points. The addition of the figures 30, 22, and 90 gives a total of 142 points for Melbourne. Sydney is first on the list in classes III. and IV., and, as the number of ballot-papers in those classes was twenty-four, is entitled to twenty-four points. Sydney comes second in classes I. and VI., in which twenty ballot-papers were used, and is, therefore, entitled to forty points. Sydney appears third on the list in classes II. and V., in which twenty-seven ballot-papers were used, and, as twenty-seven multiplied by three gives a total of eighty-one, is entitled to that number of points, making altogether a total of 145. Taking Brisbane in the same way, that site was marked 1 in classes V. and VI., in which seventeen ballot papers were used, and, therefore, is entitled to seventeen points. Brisbane is marked second in two classes, II. and IV., and as forty ballot-papers were used in these classes is entitled to eighty points. Brisbane was placed third on the list in classes I. and III., in which fourteen ballot-papers were used, and is, therefore, entitled to forty-two points. The result is that Melbourne has a total of 142; Sydney, 145 ; and Brisbane, 139. These figures added together give an aggregate of 426 points, which, when divided by three-the number of sites--yields an average of 142. Then, as every site whose total is above the average ihas to bedropped, Sydney, which, in my illustration, stands in that posiand that the voting could be so manipution, has to be thrown out of consideration. Then only two names are left on the ballot-paper. The results would work out in exactly the same way if there were twenty sites. If my illustration be followed, it will be found that on the re-numbering of the ballot-papers Melbourne comes first on thirty-four of the ballot-papers, and Brisbane first in thirty-seven cases. Therefore Brisbane wins, as would have been the case if each site had been compared with each other site. A ll that honourable members are called upon to do is to mark a single ballot-paper, and the scrutineers do the rest. The system of averaging and knocking out the sites which have above the average of points, and retaining those which have below the average, and, if necessary, re-averagingagain, insures the adoption of the absolute choice of the House. The system could not very well be used at a general election, because, if the scrutineers had to count up 20,000 ones, twos, and threes, their work would be stupendous. In an election of this kind, however, with a small number of vote's, it is possible to adopt it and produce such results as I have shown. The paper which I have circulated shows further, that the system previously adopted might result in the site which was most favoured by honourable members being rejected at the first ballot, whereas my scheme insures that the actual choice of the electors shall be finally adopted. Some honourable members may ask whether my scheme does not present opportunities for the manipulation of votes. I do not suppose that any honourable member would be guilty 01 any such thing, but it might be suggested"" Could -not an honourable member, by placing 3 opposite the name of the site of which he was most afraid, as compared with that which he most strongly favoured, place it at a disadvanage ?"" An Honorable MEMBER -That is what they would naturally 3b. think they would put the figure 2 opposite the name of fhe site which was second in the order of their choice. Suppose, however, some honourable members placed the figure 3 opposite the name of the sife which they feared most. Two things might then happen. First of all, their action might result in the selection of the site of which they least approved. The alteration of two or three votes would be sufficient to bring about that result. Suppose, however, that that did not happen, lated as to knock out the site most favoured, the only result of not voting properly would be to make my system as bad as, but no worse than, the one proposed by the Government. No manipulation of the votes by some honourable members could prevent others from placing the figure 1 opposite their first choice. Therefore, at the very worse, however much the votes were manipulated-assuming ' chat such a thing were",21,Schedule
44,Mr Mccay.,,23,Schedule
45,Mr Mccay,"I 3o not think so. Ipossible-it would only result in the system degenerating into something like that proposed by the Government. It could not be any worse, and its manipulation would require a great deal more cleverness, and involve many more risks. If by manipulation of votes honourable members defeated the site which they most favoured, and brought about the selection of that which they least desired, they would probably regret it afterwards. I do not suppose for a moment that any honourable member would do such a thing/but perhaps it is as well to point out that the risk attached to manipulation is that of bringing about the selection of the site which would not have been chosen if the voting had been genuine. In any case the wrong done could not be greater than that which might result under the system proposed by the Government. If honourable members vote in the real order of their preference, my scheme, which is very simple in its operation, although, perhaps, not easy to explain, will ascertain by purely mathematical calculation the final choice of the House. Although it may seem complicated, and after explanation may not appear any simpler, that fault must rest with me, and not with the system. An Honorable MEMBER -Would it not be simpler to put all the names in a hat? adopt a system that produces absolutely fair results than follow one which might lead to an absolutely wrong conclusion We have heard a great deal with regard to the attitude of Victoria on this question, and contemplated breaches of the Constitution; but T think that the division which has just taken place should afford a sufficient answer 1 ro these observations. I think that when we are about to choose a Capital Site, which cannot well be altered once the erection of the buildings is commenced, when we are about to consider one of the few legislative enactments that cannot be altered, we should not spare any pains 01 trouble to secure that the site chosen shall be the actual and true choice of the House, rather than the result of any fortuitous system of voting. Therefore, I move That paragraph b be left out with a view to insert in lieu, thereofthe following words :"" Members shall number the sites in order of preference, numbering their first preference i , prove all that I have claimed for it. Intheir second preference 2, and so on."" That is the first step. There are two features in my scheme. One relates to the voting, and the other to the scrutiny. The voting is simplicity itself, and the scrutiny presents no difficulty. The scrutiny, however, is quite distinct from the voting. Once an honourable membei has voted, his preference ballot paper can be scrutinized in various ways. For example, we might scrutinize it by the single transferable vote method, under which honourable members would be called upon to strike out the places which received the fewest number of first votes, and which would simply be the Government scheme over again. My proposal is one which has been absolutely tested by mathematical results. Every mathematician of repute who has studied the system declares that it automatically insures a result exactly similar to that which is achieved by pitting each site against every other site. Thus, upon the ballot being taken, the absolute choice of honourable members is ascertained. It affords no opportunity for the manipulation of votes beyond this: that the pape s may be so manipulated as to make the scheme degenerate into the proposal of the Government. It cannot be made.less satisfactory than is the Government scheme, whereas if every honourable member, accord ing to his honest belief, votes for the various sites in the oider of his preference, it will avoid difficulties which the Government scheme cannot overcome. I do not apologize to honourable members for making these suggestions, because I feel very earnestly the necessity for adopting the best possible scheme. I quite realize the difficulties which confront me, in that honourable members who have not devoted any particular attention to different methods of voting may not become fully seized of the benefits of this system upon its first explanation by me. I quite appreciate the fact that I am open to little jokelets, such as are contained in the suggestion that we might put certain numbers in a hat and diaw for them, or that we are engaged in an arithmetical puzzle; but I claim that all that honourable members have to do is something which is well within the competence of all, namely, to number the sites in the order of our preference. That is not beyond the capacity of any of us. I trust that the Government will see its way to accept my proposal, because I am satisfied that in its working it will deed, it has been mathematically demonstrated that that is so. It is not a scheme directed against the manipulation of votes in any shape or form. It assumes that the voting will be honorably and honestly",23,Schedule
46,Mr Mccay,"It would be simpler tocarried out; as I am sure that it will. Itdoes not involve any reflection upon the bona fides of honourable members, but it represents an effort to obtain a vote which will accurately reflect the desire of the House, which will insure that the wish of a majority is expressed in the result of the ballot. honourable imembers that in the motion submitted by the Minister there are two distinct issues. One has reference to the method of voting, which is contained in the various clauses and sub-clauses of the resolution ; the other is practically a votingpaper, which it is proposed to set before honourable members in the form of the schedule. an Electoral Act, and in the schedule a ballot-paper containing the various sites to be voted upon, and I suggest to the House that it is desirable to separate these two matters in the discussion. With the consent of the House, therefore, I propose to prevent any discussion upon the places mentioned in the schedule during the debate upon the clauses. When the schedule is reached honourable members will be at liberty to discuss the question of whether districts or sites should be mentioned, and, if so, how many. propose to preclude incidental referende being made to any of the places which are named in the schedule. ber be allowed to show, by way of illustration, the effect of voting in a particular way ? tive value of districts or sites is not introduced, I shall not object, but the question of whether honourable members should vote for three sites or districts, or for more, ought to be discussed upon the schedule. That is not touched by the question of the method of voting to be adopted. I propose, therefore, to confine the debate to the question of the method of voting to be adopted until the schedule is reached. in the way of carrying out the suggestion N which you make, sir. Very great importance must be attached to the two issues together. I understand that the Minister of Home Affairs has submitted one resolution, and I would point out that we are not now in Committee upon the Bill. Seeing that the Minister has submitted his proposals as one resolution, I am not aware of any parliamentary law which prevents an honourable member from discussing any part of them. I know, sir, that you do not wish to make parliamentary law, but I cannot remember any case in which an honourable member, upon being asked to consider a series of resolutions with a schedule, was precluded from discussing both the resolutions and the schedule simultaneously. I suppose, sir, that you would not insist upon taking the course which you have suggested if it had the effect of prejudicing the rights of honourable members in discussing the series of resolutions? It is an important matter. portance of the subject, and consequently made the suggestion which I did. There are two distinct issues involved here-*In the earlier clauses we have issues which have nothing to do with each other. Under our Standing Orders it is quite competent for any honourable member to suggest in reference to any complicated issue that questions should be put separately, and I merely intimated that, with the consent of the House-by common consentI should follow the course proposed. If there be no objection raised, I shall follow that course completely, but if there be any objection urged, of course I shall not press the point.

It is merely a matter of opinion, that is all. I do not impute to Ministers anv wish to do other than the fairest possible thing. At the same time. I appeal to them to go back to the method which was fully considered when we dealt with a similar Bill in the last Parliament.

It saysBallot-papers shall be distributed to honourable members, containing the names of the sites mentioned in 'the schedule hereto.

In the southern district -we have Tumut and Tooma, which are farther apart than are Dalgety or Bombala. The distance between Tooma and the town of Tumut is about forty or forty-five miles. sixty miles.

The distance between Dalgety and Bombala is not more than that which separates Tumut and Tooma. difference. between Tooma and Tumut, only to show that, although they are in the same district, they are absolutely different sites. There are many other towns in the same district. I know that the Ministry and their supporters are anxious to do what is fair. This is too serious a matter not desire that any place shall be unfairly knocked out.. us desire that a nasty taste shall be left in the mouths of the people in reference to this matter. We do not wish to raise even a suspicion that there has been a secret grouping in order to shut out some particular site. individually ? The matter was very carefully thought out by the late Government, and that system was adopted when the question was dealt with by us last session. I should not take exception to this proposal if I did not see not a technical, but a practical objection to it. Honourable members in favour of Dalgety and Bombala would combine to vote against Lyndhurst, the western district site, although a number of those who would vote for Bombala would prefer as an alternative to vote for Lyndhurst rather than Dalgety. sites have already been reduced by ballot to one-Lyndhurst . the fact that there is only one site in Che western district, but I wish to point out to the Ministry that in my opinion there are members in favour of Bombala who, if I do not think that that site were rejected, would prefer Lyndhurst to Dalgety. Then there are others in favour of Dalgety who, if that site were rejected, would rather vote for Lyndhurst than Bombala. The effect of grouping can Dalgety and Bombala together would be such that the supporters of those two sites would be forced to vote together against the selection of Lyndhurst. If the issue to be determined were the district, rather than the site, to be selected, the respective supporters of these two sites in the one district would naturally be banded together as against the third site. If there were fwo sites in the Lyndhurst district which had considerable support, the proposed system might balance; but as there is only one site in the western district, the respective supporters of Tumut and Tooma as well as the supporters of Bombala and of Dalgety could unite against Lyndhurst. result would follow the adoption of any method. We do favoured voting Dalgety No. i and Lyndhurst No. 2, or Bombala No. i , Lyndhurst No. 2, Dalgety No. 3, and so forth, would not be forced to vote against Lyndhurst if the sites, instead of districts, were voted upon. I have not a word to say against the perfect fairness, as a system, of the proposal made by the honourable and learned member for Corinella, but I see in it openings for abuse. ber cannot point to one that would make it less satisfactory than the Government proposal.

Air. DUGALDTHOMSON that the Minister only wants fairness to be observed; and I ask him, how we could get a fair vote under those circumstances? There are two sites, say, in the south-eastern district-Bombal a and Dalgety. Some honourable members may be absolutely determined, for particular reasons, that they will not vote for one of these two sitesthat they prefer any site to one of those two. quite ready, when the site which they favour to any rate, a second vote for one of the sites in another district. Vet the proposal to vote in districts gives such honourable members no opportunity to express their opinion as between the different sites. afterwards. woulcl be after those honourable members had lost their opportunity .to vote. Suppose, for instance, that an honourable member were in favour of Dalgety, but against Bombala, and that, rather than give avote for Bombala, he would vote for Tumut, Tooma, or Lyndhurst. able member is given no opportunity to express his view, but is forced to vote for a site he may not want, because the district in which there is a site he would be willing to support, if the site he first favoured were struck out has been voted down. the places, we should be confronted with fhe same kind of difficulty. a l l ; because if a range is given, say, within twenty miles of a place, we have distinct positions. own merits. If that right honourable member for East Sydney says, each site would then stand on its own merits, and would receive the consideration which honourable members desired to give it. An honourable member would be enabled to either give a site a first vote, or, if a site which he favoured more were struck out, a I am rather second vote, in' fair competition with the other sites. It is decidedly unfair, unjust, and improper to force men to vote in the way proposed. It would not matter so much, and might be fair, if there were three or four sites in each district; but it is not right to force honourable I know members to vote for a district, when they may be favorable to one site, and absolutely opposed to another site in that district. Altogether, I do not seewhat is to be gained by the method proposed. If any site has a majority in its favour, .and the sites are separated, that site cannot avoid getting the support of that majority. Why"" b o x "" the sites up?

An honourable member will know before he votes that he is in favour, perhaps, of one site in a district, while absolutely against another site in the same district. An honourable member might hot prefer either site as his first choice, but say, "" I would rather vote for any site in the list than one of those sites; yet by my vote for the district I may be forcing the selection of that site as the Capital.""

By the amendment, it seems to me, there would be a much better chance of getting a clear indication of the view of honourable members as to the value of the different sites. It may be too extreme, but if it is not, I certainly would suggest that that should be adopted, and an alteration made. hope that if it is not understood, the Ministry will have a thorough examination made of the proposal of the honourable and learned member, so that we may get as near to a complete system of voting as is possible. the sense of the House on the matter. Sir WILLIAM LYNE that all the members of the House quite clearly understand the amendment. listened to the speech of the honourable and . learned imember for Corinella, and I am not very clear on some points now, but I think that the principle of his proposal is a good one. Then, regarding the proposal to take districts instead of sites, I must say that I strongly advocate the taking of districts. I think that the alteration in feeling and the experience we have had since the last vote was taken is such as to show honourable members that it is not wise to fix on any spot until we have exhaustive information and the fullest detailed surveys. Buti f the Government be limited to a district it will be possible, by future examination, to get within that district the best spot. I do not know whether the names given to. the three proposed districts-southern , western, and south-eastern -ar e the best. honourable member suggest? Sir WILLIAM LYNE of the names later on I shall not be able to move an amendment; but when we get to that particular point I shall suggest to some honourable member that he should move an amendment. ber will not be able to move an amendment at a later stage. Sir WILLIAM LYNE sir, that, although I shall not be able to move an amendment, I could ask an honourable member to move one, unless the Government proposal. large one; the western district comprises all the western country of New' South Wales; and the south-eastern district is a large one, too. But there is not very much in a name if the distances from any spot are mentioned. I take.it that, as in the Bill, the Senate has defined the boundaries of the district which it prefers. Some spot might be mentioned, and a radius of so many miles round that spot might be taken, or else lines of demarcation might' be drawn, so to divide the three eligible places I distinctly, and thus enable honourable members to know exactly what they were voting for. I have described what has been done in regard to Dalgety and Bombala. Take, for instance, the Tumut site and the Tooma or Welaregang site. Although the site which has been referred to so much lately is partly on the Tooma holding and I do not think partly on the Welaregang holding, still it would be more correctly called the WelareI gang site than the Tooma site. From Tumut the distance is about forty-five miles direct. I find on measurement that Bombala is thirty-six or thirty-seven miles direct from Dalgety. Tumut from Batlow? ing at the map I should say that Batlow is about seventeen or eighteen miles from Tumut. miles. Sir WILLIAM LYNE I think that by the road Batlow is sixteen or eighteen miles from Tumut-it is, perhaps, fourteen or fifteen .miles direct-whil e from Batlow to Tooma the distance is about thirty miles. Tumberumba the distance is about eighteen miles. Sir WILLIAM LYNE I cannot say, I shall think but the map will show the distance. I have to take the distance as the road goes, because it is more familiar to me than the distance by a direct line. I should think that the distance from Batlow to Tooma is about thirty miles, and to Welaregang thirty-three or thirty-four miles. In regard to the two distinct questions before us, I would suggest to the Minister that, in I was saying, the first place, there should be an amendment made as to the method of votingwhether it should be exactly like the aimendment of the honourable and learned member accepted some for Corinella or not is a matter for further The southern district is a discussion-and that, in the second place, there should be certain definitions of the districts even if they are not named.

I should like the honourable and learned member for Corinella, who has taken up this matter, and seems to be adept at moving amendments of this kind, to consider that point before the matter is finally .decided.

Some time ago I was deputed by a society, of -which I am a member, to investigate various systems of voting, for the purpose of endeavouring to get a plan of preferential voting, which would be understandable by the voters, and yet would secure as nearly as practicable the wishes of the majority being carried out. I do not think that the system which my honourable and learned friend has proposed would, in practical working, have that effect, because it would be open to manipulation. It is idle for the honourable and learned member to say that every honourable member would inclination of every honourable member would be to give his first vote to the site in If it can be obtained by his gerous rival to the one he favoured.

I shall just give an example of how the proposed Â«cheme of the honourable and learned member may be worked. Assuming that there are seventy-three effective votes in the House, and, for the sake of argument, that there are twenty members who prefer Bombala to any other site, twenty-five members who prefer Tumut or Tooma to any other site, and twenty-eight members who prefer Lyndhurst to any obher site. gets twenty first votes, and its supporters divide their second and third votes equally between Tumut and 'Lyndhurst. That means that the number twenty will be placed against Bombala, the number fifty against Tumut, and the number fifty against Lyndhurst. Twenty-five members give their first vote to Tumut, but, fearing that Lyndhurst may defeat their own site, they decide to give their second vote to Bombala, and all their third votes to Lyndhurst. That means that the number twenty-five will be put against Tumut, the number fifty against Bombala, and the number severity-five against Lyndhurst. Then we come to Lyndhurst, which has twenty-eight first votes. who voted for that site may decide to, so to speak, mix it in the same way as did which would result in seventy votes being cast against Tumut and seventy against Bombala. Bombala would thus gain in all 140 votes, Tumut 145, and Lyndhurst 153, and, the average being 146, Lyndhurst, a , though obtaining the largest number of first votes, would, be left out on the first ccunt. last time, under the system now again proposed by the Government. happen again. The case I have put is purely supposititious, but it must be remembered that honourable members may be relied upon to cast their first vote for the site they most prefer, and to give the hardest knock they can to the site which they consider its most dangerous rival. ber's illustration, the result is the selection not of Bombala, but of the despised Tu mut. That is the hole into which the tricksters fall. adoption of a method which will secure, I therefore think that as far as practicable, the expression of the real opinions of honourable members. It is well known to those who have taken part in the conduct of elections by the members of friendly societies or other similar bodies that electors vote differently in the second and third ballots from the way in which they voted in the first ballot, and it is therefore very hard to secure the expression ot their true opinions. It appears to me, however, that the Government plan is the least objectionable, because it can be seI n the ballot Bombala cured from abuse by the means I have suggested. If Tumut be carried, although on a straight-out vote Lyndhurst would have been chosen, the advocates of the latter place can, by obtaining the recommittal of the Bill, or in some other way provided for in the Standing Orders, again test the feelings of honourable members in regard to the two sites. I think it is highly desirable that the manner in which every honourable member records his vote shall be made public for the information of the people outside. the ordinary 'way, by division ? practically the same result. If the B ill The members were recommitted, any one site could be pitted against any other site. method proposed by the honourable and learned member for Corinella which would prevent it being made known how each honourable member had voted ? 1 is a complicated one. It is wrapper! up in a maze of figures which would largely confuse the public. I know, from my own experience, that all these methods of preferential voting tend to confuse the public mind. What the public desire is a method of voting which they can easily understand, and it seems to me that an open vote is the best they can have. I admit that on the first trial the will of an absolute majority of honourable members may not be clearly expressed, but I believe that the forms of the House are such as u ill enable the ultimate expression of the opinion' of the majority to be obtained.

The Minister of Home Affairs has grouped them in three districts; Lyndhurst being the centre of the western district; in the south-eastern district are grouped Bombala, Delegate, Dalgety, and Coolringdonj while in the southern district are such places as Tumut, Gadara, Batlow, Welaregang. Last session the House was asked to decide between Orange, Bathurst, and Lyndhurst in the western district, but those who favoured those sites have .now determined to join, forces in support of Lyndhurst, and it seems to me that those who are interested in the sites in the southern and south-eastern districts should have a similar opportunity to combine in favour of one or other cf those districts. I think, however, that it is desirable to more strictly define the proposed districts. Thus, we might say that the western district comprises an area within, say, fifty miles-o r whatever other distance might be considered proper-of Lyndhurst; defining the south-eastern district as being the area within a radius of, say, fifty miles of Dalgety, which would include Bombala and the other sites there; and the southern district as the area within, say, fifty miles of Tumberumba, which woulcl include Tumut, Gadara, Batlow, Welaregang, and the other sites in that district. both of fairness and convenience, it is better to deal with the sites in districts. I do not think that every site would have a fair chance if theywere dealt with separately, because, for instance, honourable members who would join in voting for the southern district, might throw away their votes upon Gadara, Batlow, or some other site near Tumut, instead of combining as those who are supporting the Lyndhurst site have done. manly, because all the remaining sites are being grouped against Lyndhurst. there is no unfairness at all. My only desire is to exercise my vote to the best of my judgment. It is, of course, necessary that honourable members shall have due notice of the date of the proposed ballot. agree to that. reasons which have been advanced for the adoption of another method of voting, I think that we will do best by again follow1 ""g the method which was used last session. It must be remembered that honourable members are required to change their votes as the balloting proceeds, because, as certain sites are dropped out, their preference in regard to the remaining sites alters. If , however, the sites are voted for in districts, a member may vote for a district in order to secure the selection of a particular site, and if the district were selected, but the site which he favoured rejected, his vote would be practically nullified. It is therefore somewhat unfair to compel those who have preferences to vote for the site's in districts. Moreover, on the last occasion, three sites in the western district, two sites in the south-eastern district, and two in the southern district, were balloted for, and the system of voting for sites gave a degree of fairness which will not obtain if we now vote by districts, because whereas the number of suitable sites in the south-eastern district has increased, the number of such sites in the western district has decreased. I hope, therefore, that the House will follow the method adopted on the last occasion. The preferential system of voting may be theoretically perfect, but the results of open voting are far more satisfactory. The open voting system affords some check upon the manipulation of votes, be-' cause the results are published, and every From the ' point of view honourable member who transfers his support from site to site will probably be called upon by his constituents to give his reasons for so doing. I think it is undesirable that we should be called upon to fix upon the exact site for the Capital, and I regard the proposed radius as altogether too smajl. It should be extended to at least twenty-five miles Dalgety, for instance, is a long way from Bombala, and we might in dealing with those sites include the country within a radius of twenty-five miles of each place. In the same way, the Tumberumba and Tooma sites should be dealt with separately, and each should embrace a large area of country. We cannot reasonably be asked to determine the exact site of the Capital until detailed surveys have been made, and we should give the surveyors the fullest possible scope within a given district.

' With regard to the method of voting to be followed, honourable members must have been impressed with the imperfections of ' the system adopted on the former occasion. We all know that votes were manipulated to a very large extent, and that the process was an easy one. I much-prefer the method proposed by the honourable and learned member for Corinella, because, although under it manipulation of votes may be possible, it will be much more difficult than under the system formerly followed. I am strongly in favour of the proposal of the Government that a vote shall be taken in regard to the districts within which the Federal territory shall be located. great mistake to tie us down to any particular spot at this stage. member that upon the last occasion a large majority of honourable members voted in favour of a particular locality, which is now almost universally condemned as unsuitable. We may repeat that mistake if we again vote under similar conditions. In voting for a district, we can look at its general situation, and take into consideration its centrality with regard to the various States; its physical characteristics, climate, water supply, railway and other facilities, and all those other conditions which should weigh with us, apart from the selection of the actual spot upon which the Capital is to be built. It has been urged that if there were two sites in one district, one strongly favoured, and the other such that no one would choose it, honourable members might vote against the good site for fear that the bad one might be selected. We must, however, rely upon the exercise of common sense and reason in the selection of a site for the Capital within a given area, and I do not think that any fears of the kind indicated need be entertained. should merely select a certain district, and leave the question of choosing a particular site for further consideration. House this afternoon, feeling that the fairest course for us to pursue would be to take a vote in regard to each site, but the arguments advanced by honourable members, who are opposed to the selection of a district as against a particular site, have induced me to think that we shall act wisely if we content ourselves at present with selecting a certain district within which the Capital Site shall afterwards be fixed. In the western district, for instance, there is only one site, whereas in the south-eastern district there are two, namely, Bombala and Dalgety. fighting against one. the southern district, in which there are at least two sites, Tumut and Tooma. The unfairness does not lie dn the side indicated by the interjection of the right honourable member for East Sydney, because if a vote were taken with regard to each individual site, Lyndhurst would have the advantage of undivided support as contrasted with other districts whose claims would rest upon the varying attractions of two or more totally It would be a distinct sites. If we desire to arrive at an honest conclusion, and to do that which We must reis best in the interests of the Commonwealth, we should, in the first instance, vote for districts, and afterwards choose the exact site upon which the Capital is to be built. I have arrived at this conclusion after hearing the arguments used by those honourable members who are opposed lo this course, and who have demonstrated to me most clearly the injustice that might result from following their advice. I favour the proposal of the honourable and learned member for Corinella, with regard to the way in which the voting shall be conducted. It follows the method advocated by Professor Nansen, one of the most eminent of our University professors, who has given a great deal of time and thought to the perfection of a balloting system. I think that, by adopting the amendment, we shall be most likely to arrive at an honest expression of the preference of honourable members. It is true that the object of the system may be defeated if honourable members do not vote straightforwardly, but I assume, at the outset, that every member of At this stage we this House intends to act honestly. If , however, there should be any desire to manipulate votes, that object could be accomplished more readily, and at much less risk under the system of voting proposed by the Government.

In view of that experience, I submit that we are amply justified in adopting the same method on the present occasion, and consequently I shall vote against the amendment and support' the proposal of the Government. The question of the selection of districts opens up a very big matter, which also engaged our attention during the last Parliament. On the occasion referred to, I recollect that the honorsites, I claim that the site which was reable member for North Sydney was very desirous that a selection as between certain districts should first be made, rather than a selection as between particular sites. He submitted a proposal which might well engage the attention of the House at the present time. He proposed that the several sites contained in any district should be voted upon, irrespective of those embraced by other districts, and that whatever site commanded the largest support should be regarded as the most eligible site in that particular district. that a vote should subsequently be taken upon the merits of the various districts. The last Government decided to deal with I this matter from the stand-point of sites, and not of districts. As a result, the reports which have been submitted to us by the expert Commissioners appointed for the purpose of thoroughly investigating this question have dealt largely with the question of sites. Up to the present time, die matter of the territory to be acquired by On that occasion the proposal which the Commonwealth has not been considered, except in an indirect way. The only information in our possession, having reference to the question bf territory, is to be found in the original report of the late A considerable period was occuMr Oliver. That report .was supplied at the instance of the Government of New South Wales. In it Mr Oliver did not confine himself to the question of the suitability of certain territory for the Federal Capital site, but also took into Consequently, the matter is by consideration the capability of the surrounding district to support the population of a city of that character. All other reports, however, have dealt merely with the question of sites.

A t the outset I join issue with the Government By this process of as to the preparation of these reports.

There are others who will advocate the selection of the Lacmalac, the Tumut, Batlow, Tooma, and Welaregang sites. If,in the final selection, thes; particularly favoured sites are defeated, the probability is that, in the exercise of a second preference their advocates will favour either the Lyndhurst or the Dalgety site. intricate point in the selection of a site. Consequently, I prefer to act on the information which is contained in the reports which have been submitted to us, and to arrive at a decision in respect of the sites, especially as the question of territory, has not previously entered into consideration. Honourable members were invited by the Barton Administration, and later by the Deakin Government, to decide this question from that particular stand-point. The Bill which was introduced was merely intended to locate the site. We were informed that it would be followed by another measure, dealing with the question of the Federal territory. We were assured that that question would form the subject of further consideration, and of negotiation with the Government of New South Wales, and would be dealt with in another Bill. I do not know what the present Government propose to do in this connection. Apparently they have framed their Bill upon the basis which was laid down by the last Parliament. Whether they will adhere to it, or whether, like the late Government, they will turn round at the last moment and make it a measure for the selection of territory rather than of a site, remains to be seen. Apparently they propose to select territory, rather than a site, in the first instance. I claim that, in justice to ourselves, we ought to select a site, because Ave must necessarily rely to a very large extent upon the information Avhich has been supplied to us in official reports. I should prefer that each 6E site Avithin the A'arious districts should be voted upon, irrespective of the sites embraced in other territories. Whichever site in the southern, south-eastern, or western districts commands a majorityshould, I think, be regarded as the most: eligible site in that particular district.

For instance, there are those Monaro) I am at a loss to understand the arguments submitted against the GoA'ernment proposal that a vote shall be taken, not on sites, but on districts. It is easy for the honourable member Avho has just resumed his seat to say that Ave should vote only in respect of individual sites.

It seems to me that if we are to select one of these districts, very well for the honourable member to say it would be better, instead of calling them the southern, south-eastern, and western districts, and so forth, to call them by the names by which we know them best. They should be known as the Lyndhurst district, the Bombala district, the Tumut district, and the Murray, or the Upper Murray, district. If it is necessary that the site on the western side of the mountains should have all the chances of selection proposed to be afforded it, let us settle the question by voting on the Tumut district, the Monaro district, and the"" Lyndhurst district.

I am prepared to accept the Bill as it has come down to us from another place. It covers Dalgety and Twofold Bay as being within a fifty-mile radius. As we are to select not a site but a district, I favour the amendment proposed by the honourable and learned member for Corinella. Objection has been taken that under it votes might be manipulated, but no one ihas yet shown how any manipulation of votes could make the worse results achieved by it any different from the best results that could be secured by following the Government scheme. The honourable and learned member for Corinella has distinctly proved that his method would simply lead to t'he pitting of one site against another, and that we should thus be able to deal with the relative value of each. If that A Bill system w^ere adopted it would prevent arrangements being made to anything like the extent that would be possible under the Government proposal, and, therefore, I am strongly in favour of it. It would also place on record the opinion of every member in regard to this question. Every vote would be known. An. honourable member would vote No. i for the site which, he preferred, No. 2 for that which he considered to be the next best site, and so on, and we should arrive at a conclusion by one ballot instead of being compelled to have a number, as was the case on a former occasion.

After the elaborate reports, surveys, and Royal Commissions that we have had, the public will learn with astonishment that this House, instead of selecting or indicating a site for the Capital of Australia, has indicated a radius of fifty miles within which there may be one hundred sites. The result of it all will be that we shall be no further on than we were. Bill which came from the other Chamber .provides. ' as I think it is equally absurd. It is a most extraordinary thing to me to find that after the authorities have furnished all these called Batlow. reports, made all these surveys, and framed all these estimates, the' whole subject is reduced to utter absurdity by our now dealing with an amendment such as has been proposed. If the map is looked at, it will be seen that within the proposed fifty-mile radius we are practically making no selection of asite. We are not now choosing a site for the Capital, but the Federal Territory. tween the Federal Territory and a sitefor the Federal Capital is a very obvious one. been dealing so much with the question of a particular territory as with the question of a particular site for the Federal Capital. I have in my hand the report of a Royal Commission-appointe d by the late Government:-whic h went into all these matters in' a most careful and exhaustive way. Oliver also went into all these matters. In fact two years ago we got to a finer point than'is now suggested. If honourable members will refer to Hansard they will find that a number of definite spots were submitted. We were not tied down to a mile or two. But a radius of fifty miles on that map means nothing. A ll that this amendment means is, how far can we get the site of the territory away from Sydney? or whatever honourable members like. But what is meant is, how far can it be got away from' Sydney? Why cannot the question be dealt with in a straightforward way ? We are choosing a Capital Site now. throw the whole matter to the winds, after the lapse of three years. Two years ago we had a definite proposal made. For example, we had "" Tumut,"" which meant the immediate locality-that is any eminence or suitable place within a few miles. It did not mean Tooma or Cooma. It meant some place in that district. We knew what was meant by Bombala, Dalgety, Lyndhurst, Orange, Bathurst, and Albury. Those were not all wild-goose chases, but definite localities, on one of which the Capital of Australia was to be built. After dealing with this question for these years, and incurring all this expenditure, we have an honourable member proposing to throw the whole thing at large; to leave us in the dark as to where the Capital is to be by saying that it shall be, for example, anywhere within a radius of fifty miles of a given spot which have been inspected. only imitating what has been done in another place. The Bill contains a most extraordinary description. It is a Bill to determine, not the Federal Territory, but the Seat of Government. The distinction beeral Territory. is dealt with in the B ill : So far we have not It is hereby determined that .the Seat of Government of the Commonwealth shall be within that portion of New South Wales bounded on the north by a direct line running from the town of Pambula to the town of Cooma, thence due west to the border of the State of VictoriaThat is a pretty big order. and within f if ty miles of Bombala, in the State of New South Wales. There are two sites within fifty miles of Bombala. Surely we have got further than this-that as the result of this legislation we are to decide practically nothing? If the Bill, naming a district contained in the schedule as proposed to beamended, or even as it stands, were passed to-morrow, would there be any Capital Site fixed? Sitea fifty-mile radius!

Suppose that tliis amendment were carried, and that the Bill were passed containing one of the districts named. If an area answering, to the .description in the schedule were selected, would any Capital Site be chosen? Could any Government build a Capital on an inch of that fifty-miles radius without first coming down and getting a special Act of Parliament to fix the site? vent the House from defining the exact position five minutes after it has selected the area? this is not a proposal to select a site, but a proposal to get somebody boxed up somehow. You allow the disputants within this fifty-mile radius to knock some other place out, and when they have knocked it put, to selves. It resembeles very much the sort of fighting, when three individuals have to decide something. Two of them join together, and say "" Now we shall have a fight with this third man. and then have it out between ourselves."" I do not call that fair play. members admit that they intend to do an unfair thing, I have no more to say. understand that the Ministry have no desire to do what is not absolutely fair. The Bill is bad enough; but the amendment does not make the absurdity any less. I admit that from one point of view it limits the absurdity to a certain extent, because the term ""southern 'district"" means anything you like.

313,Mr Reid,"The method now proposedamongst those really interested in the matter when they find that, after all the time which has been occupied, and the expense which has been incurred, we are not to come to some definite resolution. If the Government had said-"" We are a new Government, and this is a new Parliament. We find that the information which has been collected is not satisfactory, and that it is not sufficiently definite or exhaustive to enable Parliament to choose a Capital Site, and we, therefore, ask honourable members, to wait until we have got more,"" their attitude would have been intelligible. would have been worthy of respect, however much we might have criticised it. But for the Government to come down with a Bill for the determination of the Seat of Government, and allow the public of Australia to believe that the Capital Site is to be fixed, and then to ask the House only to choose a district in which several sites are grouped, is quite another matter. The effect of adopting the Government proposal would be most unfair to the site in which I believe the people of New South Wales take imost interest. I have, however, already expresst.; my feelings on that matter. WhatI wish to point out now is that, if the amendment be adopted, and the schedule is left as it stands, we shall be proceeding in altogether a wrong direction. Instead of obtaining definiteness and finality, we shall be reopening the whole question again, and giving an opportunity for a repetition of the trouble. The Government have placed Dalgetv and Bombala in the one district, as though they are not rival and different sites. As a matter of fact, there will be the keenest division when these two sites come to be voted upon in the House, because, while some honourable members strongly support Bombala, others are as strongly opposed to the adoption of that site, and in favour of the adoption of the Dalgetv site. The inclusion of those two places in one district, therefore, is, to say the least, confusing. But it will have the most important effect in regard to the Lyndhurst site, because it will enable the opponents ot that site to join together in voting against it, and to reserve their opposition until they can get rid of an inconvenient adversary. They will unite their forces and votes until they get rid of the thiid party. I know that the Prime Minister is anxious to do his duty in this matter. He comes from the same State that I do, and knows the feeling there in regard to the question of , the Capital Site, and I beg of him to consider the point I am now putting to him. As the Minister of Home Affairs has stated, the more opponents there are the worse it is for the opponents. He had in his mind the case of an election, and so far as that is concerned his remark would apply, but the case here is very different. Here we have three rivals, each of which is supposed to occupy an independent position. There is not supposed to be any combination of two rivals against the other one, with the object of knocking it out. It There is supposed to be a straight-out fight between the three. The effect of the proposed arrangement would be to compel ths advocates of Bombala and Tumut to ally themselves against those who were supporting the third site. They would concentrate their forces naturally. There is nothing to be said against it, because the Government would force that course upon them. The advocates of Bombala or Delegate, on the one hand, and Tumut or Tooma on the other, wouldcombine against the western district site, not from any desire to manipulate the votes or to act unfairly towards Lyndhurst, but because the very circumstances would compel them to do so. The two opponents would become allies for the purpose of shutting out Lyndhurst, not from wrong motives, but owing to the method of procedure proposed to be adopted. They woulcl be at one in their opposition to the selection of the Lyndhurst site. They would say -""We must have the contest to ourselves,"" and they would, therefore, start by knocking out the third antagonist. I submit that that would not give all the sites a fair start. I admit that the subject is one of great difficulty. Instead of a fair start between three or five different places, we should have a forced combination of a number of sites against one. The moment that one site disappeared, the advocates of the others would begin to fight among themselves, but, in the meantime, they would have got rid of one of their adversaries. It would be a sort of triangular duel, but the conditions would not be fair to one particular angle of the triangle. Strongly as I object to what the Government propose, I must certainly oppose the amend-' ment, in the hope that, when we are dealing with the Bill, the Government will adopt a more reasonable interpretation than that of the honourable mfember for Gwydir. The honourable member's amendment, on the face of it, limits the. scope of the",46,Pairs
314,Mr Reid,"schedule. It does not seem very objectionable from one point of view, but if the Government accept it they will be prevented from' making their schedule more pointed. They will accept something which would compel them to deal with sites embracing the whole of the country within a fifty-miles radius. It would be unfair to deal with the question in that way, and I hope that the Government will consider the matter again, and will not accept the amendment. Sir WILLIAM LYNE (Hume) -The right honourable gentleman who has just resumed his seat is always amusing, and he was not less so than usual when he ventured to hope that the time would come when there would be no further Humbugging of the people. It is really most refreshing to hear such a sentiment expressed by him. The whole object of his argument was to secure for one site an advantage over all the others. If a western district site is to be considered, Orange certainly has claims far superior to those of Lyndhurst. from Lvndhurst ? forty miles. member is in favour of adopting a fiftymiles radius. if a territory were chosen in the western district, I should do my utmost to secure the selection of Orange, instead of Lyndhurst, as a site for the Federal Capital. The right honourable member for East Sydney wishes to persuade honourable members that an attempt is being made to impose unfair conditions; but my impression is that the question cannot be fairly dealt with except on such lines as those proposed in the amendment. In the B ill now before us we find that honourable senators have thought fit to mention one particular site, and also to provide for a larger area than that which would be selected under the conditions now proposed by the honourable member for Gwydir. any particular site. Sir WILLIAM LYNE honourable gentleman is correct. They propose that the Seat of Government shall be within the area bounded on the north by a line running from Pambula to Cooma, then west to the Victorian border. That would represent an area larger than that proposed by the honourable member for Gwydir. They impose a condition, however, that the Capital Site shall be situated not more than fifty miles from Bombala. If such a large area is to be embraced within a given district, a similarly comprehensive provision should be made with regard to others. orable members do not think so. The right honourable gentleman has been very free in attributing motives, and in implying that other honourable members desire to secure an undue, advantage for the sites which they favour, but the whole object of his argument has been to secure a special advantage for the Lyndhurst site. equalitv. orable member has very cleverly disguised his object, but I am convinced that I have indicated the motive which underlies his arguments against the amendment. The right honourable member for Swan directed my attention to the wording of the ConandI am not sure that the method of selecSection 125 provideswealth shall be determined by the Parliament, and shall be within the territory which shall have been granted to or acquired by the Commonwealth.

No ; the right site before we can ask for the territory, because we shall have to ask for the territory which will include the site. Sir WILLIAM LYNE No ; section 125 requires that the territory ""shall have been granted to or acquired by the Commonwealth.""",47,Pairs

The right honourable member for East Sydney seems to fear that we should take a retrograde step if the course now proposed were followed.

I think that the site should be called Welaregang, because that town is fairly in the centre of the district. The reason I did not submit the site previously was because I knew that in New South Wales generally-o r at least in Sydneythe feeling was in favour of acquiring a site to the westward of the metropolis. I also knew that the feeling was entirely opposed -to the action taken by the right honourable member for East Sydney in fixing the 100miles limit. That was, in my opinion, a ridiculous thing to do.

362,Mr Brown,"The whole of the inquiports also deal with the question of districts. The experts have considered the question of accessibility as affecting the various districts. One district is far more accessible than is another, but there is not much to choose between the accessibility of sites which are in the same neighbourhood. It is not so much a question as between the various sites, for example, on the Monaro table'-knd, as it is a question between the selection of one of the Monaro sites and, say, the western site. The suggestion that the Government wish to take a vote in a way that would be unfair to Lyndhurst is entirely contrary to fact. Our desire is that a fair expression of the opinion of the House shall be obtained; but I am satisfied that if the suggestion made by the right honourable member for East Sydney-that we should include the names of the various sites in the different districts-were adopted, Ave should not secure that happy iresult. The -western district has but one site, while in the others there are four or five different sites. favour the south-eastern and southern districts select one site from each. make a suggestion to that effect.

I am sure that the honourable member for Gippsland Avould not suggest that Lyndhurst should not be included in the list, and that a vote should not be taken as to the desirableness of selecting it . The process Avhich has been adopted in regard to the sites in the Avestern district might Avell be folloAved by iis in dealing Avith the other districts.

I am quite prepared to allow Lyndhurst to rest upon its merits, and if it cannot secure a majority of votes on its own honest merits we do not wish it to be selected. Those who are favorable to its selection feel that there are many new facts which warrant. its favorable consideration, and all that we require is the adoption of a system that will enable a proper decision to be arrived at, and one that it will be unnecessary to review at an early date. would there be in the Lyndhurst district ? was made that Orange should be included in the western district, but we are willing to accept the suggestion made by the Minister of Home Affairs that a site should be chosen from each district. trict has been selected? settled upon the district. stand the Minister to say that. that that was the suggestion which he made, and I think'it is a fair compromise.

I wish now merely to give notice of the contingent amendment I have indicated, so that the opportunity may not be lost. that the Government have not' seen proper to stand by their own proposal, because the latest idea is open to the gravest objection. There are three territories competing; and the object of the supporters of each is to discredit the others. Under the proposal of the Government nothing would be easier. The Prime Minister himself said that in the Monaro district one of the sites is immeasurably superior to the other. If the Prime Minister wished to discredit the Monaro district what would he do? He would vote for the worse site; and other members would take a similar course.

Now, in order to imprave the chances of that site, it is proposed to back down from the Government's original proposal, which was a wise and a good one, in order to discredit other sites-in order to give the latest site, which they have dragged in for the second time, a chance of being selected over the others. I intend to support the amendment of the honourable member for Gwydir, and I hope the House will see its way to do the same, or, at any rate, to adopt some better course than that now proposed by the Government.

There will be site within a territory, why not? a considerable number of voters for these different sites disagreeing as to the particular site, but agreeing as to the district. What may follow if the vote is taken in that way? It is not evident that an honourable member' who has in view a particular site in a district will vote for that district? When he votes for that district, it will be with the intention of securing the site which he favours therein, but that may be rejected. After Parliathe district has been selected, on a subsequent vote, the very site for which he gave his first vote in that, district may be put out, and he may not have the opportunity of recording his vote for a site in another district that he would have infinitely preferred to the one which has been left in. I quite agree that the Minister of Home Affairs has shown that the other proposal which I suggested previously may be open to some objection-that if we split up the sites into individual localities,.independently of districts, we may get a more concentrated vote in favour of a district which contains only one site than in favour of districts where the voting would be split, owing to the multiplicity of sites it contains. What is proposed now is a fair compromise, and is on the whole the most reasonable method of settling the difficulty. The honourable member for Gippsland' has said that we should not limit the area, in case we may miss some good position. If that idea were carried out to its logical conclusion Aye should not cut up New South Wales, but should take the whole State in case some site might be omitted by this division. other honourable members do object.

439,Mr Dugald Thomson,"A radiuswork in limiting the areas is to be thrown away, and we are to roam from one end of the State to the other to discover a site. The amendment of the honourable member for Gwydir is far too extensive in its range. It would nearly include Cootamundra on the southern railway line, and would extend to the Murray in the other direction. A change has been indicated in the views of honourable members. Although many honourable members who were previously in favour of Tumut seem now to be against its selection, yet in spite of their t opposition to Tumut it is the nearest township to that very Batlow centre, which is named, and it may be selected. When we are giving that vote, we shall not know that Tumut will not finally be the site chosen. Although since the last vote was taken, the opinion of honourable members seems to have changed against Tumut, yet in voting for the Batlow district we may be giving our vote for Tumut. We ought to know whether it is to be Tumut or Tooma in that district, not being confined to a point, but taking an area of, say, twenty-five miles round either place. Taking the southern district, we ought to know whether the site is to be not at Dalgety or Bombala, but within a reasonable radius of either place-a n area not too extensive to include sites which were originally rejected. The proposal of the Minister is, perhaps, the fairest which has been put forward. Previously I was in favour of the sites being voted for separately. member's purpose better. orable memberis very good at making insinuations. It only shows what the source must be when these insinuations, which are not very creditable, come from that source. I can only assure the honourable member that whatever my opinion may be, I have no site in my district to fight for. Whatever my opinion of any site may be, I have tried to form it on grounds not altogether relating to New South Wales, and further than that, however strongly I may feel in favour of one site or another, I only desire the adoption of a method of settlement which will be fair, and give advantage to none. I think that this last proposal removes ister in his proposal. an objection to my previous suggestion, which I admit I did not see at the time it was made; and that is that it might give some advantage to a district containing only one site as against districts which contain several sites if we were voting for individual sites. site afterwards ? other unfairness would come in, and that is why I say the Minister's proposal is a reasonable compromise. If we have three or four sites within a district those honourable members who are separately in favour of different sites can come together and outvote a district in which there may be only one site. The honourable member will see that there would be an element of unfairness in that. be in favour of the locality. orable member knows perfectly well that there may be two sites in one district, that an honourable member may be in favour of one of those sites, but absolutely against the other, and that if he votes for the district he will shut out the other districts containing a site which he would place second. If those honourable members who are against that district are sufficiently numerous to carry it, then he will lose the opportunity of placing a vote for a site in some other district. able though, is it? merely probable; it is certain. I know that there are honourable members who, as regards districts in which there are two sites or more, while favouring one, are absolutely against the other, and would prefer a site out of that district to that they are against in the district If that be so, and it is so, those members will lose their opportunity if a district is first carried, and a site in that district which they favour is thrown out. I do not for one moment anticipate what the honourable member for Gippsland speaks of, that there will be any want of genuineness in the vote, given openly, as it will be. If a vote is taken first as to the relative merits of sites in a district, and a site in each district is then voted against a site in the othe.r districts, that will be fair.

451,Mr Johnson (Lang),"I must confessopen a matter as the selection of a site for the Seat of Government. I shall be guided by no other consideration than that of what, in my opinion, is best in the interests of the Commonwealth as a whole. I shall not be guided by any parochial or provincial considerations, and I sincerely trust that in the settlement of a national question honourable members will not. I do not see that we can obtain any good result by voting for the amendment of the honourable member for Gwydir, because it would leave us in just as bad a condition as we should otherwise have been in. I can see that there, are grave objections to the first proposal of the Government, and I am very glad to find that they have shown themselves to be so readily amenable to a reasonable suggestion, and evinced what I believe to be a sincere desire to approach the settlement of this question in a fair, honourable, and straightforward spirit, irrespective of all considerations of parties. For it must be remembered that this is not a party question, and it should not in any sense be sought to be made one. I think that the last proposal of the Government-to reduce the number of sites in each district to one-is a fair and legitimate method of arriving at a speedy conclusion on this question, which I hope every one is desirous of seeing settled at the earliest possible opportunity. method of settling the question definitely and quickly. But for ' once I find myself in agreement with the honourable member for Hume, who has raised a point to which I incidentally referred when speaking on the second reading of the B ill ; and that is, the constitutional aspect of the. proposal before the House. I have always read section 125 of the Constitution to mean that the selection of the Federal Territory should be precedent to the selection of a site for the Seat of Government. It saysThe Seat of Government of the Commonwealth shall be determined by the Parliament, and shall be within territory which shall have been granted to or acquired by the Commonwealth. It seems to me that the words, "" which shall have been,"" presuppose the granting or the acquisition of territory before the fixing of the site of the Seat of Government within that territory. Mr G. B. EDWARDS -I s it not more likely that it was intended to insure that we get our grant, as it were, before we go on with the building of the Capital? r that interpretation. I do not wish to set my opinion as a layman in opposition to the judgment of legally trained minds. I take it that the Government, before introducing the Bill, paid full regard to that aspect of the situation, and satisfied themselves that they would be acting within the provisions of the Constitution in deciding to determine the Seat of Government before the territory in which it will be situated has been granted to or acquired by, the Commonwealth. That is a point to which I merely wish to refer in passing. I hope that honourable members will assist the Government in coming to a speedy conclusion in regard to a question which has been awaiting finality for so many years. It has been objected that certain of the sites now proposed were rejected by a previous Parliament; but I would remind the House that we are not bound to take cognizance of the actions of that Parliament, and that it is within our rights to choose any site we may please. I shall be prepared to give the Government proposal mv support. gret that the Government have not adhered to their original proposal. I cannot see any advantage in the new proposals over that first made, either from the point of view of those who advocate the selection of I can think of no better certain sites, or for the purpose of securing the best site in the"" interests of the country. It seems to me reasonable to select the Federal Territory before deciding upon the Seat of Government within that territory, and I think that the original proposal of the Government, amended as proposed by the honourable member for Gwydir, would be more likely to bear good fruit than that now before us. All kinds of .complications may arise if we proceed first to determine the exact site of the Federal Capital. On the other hand, if we choose first the Federal Territory, the whole mind of the House will afterwards be concentrated upon the selection within that territory of the best site for the Seat of Government. Before determining the site of the Fedeial Capital, we must say in what district or territory it should be situated, and it seems to me that all the arguments which have been advanced in favour of the proposal to first determine the site apply still more strongly if used in favour of the original proposal of the Government. While I am entirely opposed to the postponement of this question",57,William Lyne The Honourable Sive Surveys Have Been Made And Reports
452,Mr Johnson,It may be capable of,58,William Lyne The Honourable Sive Surveys Have Been Made And Reports
453,Sir John Forrest (Swan),"I refor a long period, I am not an advocate of extreme haste. I think we should notcome to a decision until the fullest information is should deal to-night with the Bill itself? available to us. During the last few days the name of a new site has been submitted. A good many honourable members visited it last week, and I gather from conversations which I have had with them, and from the reports which I have read in regard to it, that the place has a good many qualifications. Why, then, should we be called upon to determine to-night the exact position of the Seat of Government, when we do not possess full information upon the site to which I refer? will not be called upon to determine the site of the Seat of Government to-night. That is not to be done until the matter has been discussed in' Committee on the Bill. To-night we deal only with the mode of procedure to be adopted in choosing a site. that the schedule is to be amended. to is part of the motion which provides for the mode of procedure to be followed in choosing a site. look with some favour upon the site which .has been recently visited by some honourable members, but if we are to vote on the question to-night I must vote against it. I should like to know from you, Mr district. Therefore, I should like to know Speaker, what the procedure to be adopted really is. the motions now before it, certain names will be selected to appear later on a votingI paper. When the question now under discussion has been disposed of, the House will resolve itself into a Committee of the whole to consider the Bill which has been received from another place. At a stage in the consideration of that Bill progress will be reported, and the House will re-, sume. Then, on an occasion to be fixed hereafter, but not less than a day, and it may be more, after passing these motions, a ballot will be taken to select a. site. After that ballot has been taken, the House will again go into Committee on the Bill, v to insert in it the name of the selected site. it that we are to decide which of the districts which have been named we prefer, and, if that district contains more than one site, to determine which of them shall be chosen for the Seat of Government But was it not originally proposed that we not fully understood the procedure. WhatI wish the House to do is to first select the territory in which the Seat of Government should be located, and then, after a short interval has elapsed, to determine the exact site of the Seat of Government within that territory. That seems to me a more reasonable course than the course which is now proposed. I think that a closer examination of the districts which have been named, especially where they contain sites which have not been examined very closely, is necessary. We ought, for instance, to have more information in regard to the Welaregang site. That site seems to have many of what I regard as necessary qualifications, and it is not treating it fairly to ask us to deal with it before we have obtained more information in regard to it. There are not many districts, even in New South Wales, where a large water supply, an elevated situation, and fertile counfiry are to be found together, and the only two which have been made known to us are situated on the Snowy and the Murray rivers. I think that more difficulties will arise if we proceed, in the first instance, to determine the site of the Federal Capital, than if we first select a territory or from the Government why they have departed from their original proposal, which was a reasonable one, and in accordance with the wording of the Constitution. have no desire to influence the votes of others in regard to this matter. I look upon the choosing of the Federal Capital Site as of great national importance, and every honourable member should be free to exercise his own judgment in regard to it. The question is certainly not a party one, though I wish I could think that it will be treated by every one as a non-party question. Those who come from other States cannot bring to its discussion the feeling which has been displayed by the representatives of New South Wales, whose constituents take such a lively interest in it. The position now is this: Three districts, or territories, are open for selection-the Eden-Monaro territory, the territory which stretches from Tumut to the Murray, and the Lyndhurst, or western territory.

Bathurst will probably be outside the fifty miles' radius. within the 100 miles limit from Sydney. will not be affected by a mere resolution of the House. The proposal is subject to the provisions of the Constitution. I am sure that the honourable member for Canobolas does not desire to be unfair, and therefore I appeal to him to withdraw his amendment. I would point out that Bathurst is 145 miles from Sydney by rail, and that Orange is an additional forty-seven miles distant. But in a direct line the distance from the metropolis may be very much less. When the 100 miles limit was inserted in the Constitution, it was popularly supposed that 'that restriction would not exclude Bathurst from consideration. ing to a decision which was given in England, although it is 145 miles by rail or road from Bathurst to Sydney, that city is within 100 miles of .the capital as the crow flies, and consequently is regarded as being excluded from consideration. difficulty w ill probably arise in connection with the present proposal. the honourable member for Eden-Monaro and the honourable member for Hume actively supporting the amendment of the 'honourable member for Canobolas, it suggests that he is treading upon very dangerous ground. the weakness of the honourable member's position. lar coincidence that all the Western Australian representatives entertain the same view. construction of the Western Australian railway, but they are not prepared to give fair consideration to New South Wales. I have heard some extraordinary things in connection with that railway. one occasion, I recollect the right honourable member for Swan threatening to burst up the Federation if that line was not constructed. the honourable member that the question It will take-nothing away under discussion is whether the word "" Lyndhurst"" should be struck out with a I think so. view to insert "" Orange"" in lieu thereof. Therefore, the honourable member must not refer to the question of the Western Australian railway. endeavouring to show that the provisions of the Constitution should be complied with. I trust that the honourable member for Canobolas will not f a l l into the trap which has been laid for him by two such strong opponents of the Western district. MrM c DONALD (Kennedy) I do not feel that our position is quite clear in regard to this matter. We are asked to select an area within a radius of fifty miles of a. given point. Suppose that we choose a site for the Federal Capital upon the edge of that radius, what position shall we occupy in regard to the acquisition of 900 square miles of territory? It seems to me that that would be a very peculiar situation for the Federal Capital. We should thus defeat the very object of the Government in wishing to secure a territory, embracing an area of 900 square miles. But accordthe Federal Territory will require to be in Victoria now. proposal, if we select Bombala, we shall have to acquire some Victorian territory. The same contains the words "" the district in New South Wales,"" which govern it. a very large portion the honourable member that the question under discusison is simply whether the centre of one of these areas shall be Lyndhurst or Orange. That is the only question open to discussion. MrM c DONALD I quite understand that. A t the same time, I think it is only right that we should appreciate the position They are very anxious to secure the which we occupy. If we adopt the amendment, we shall make Orange the centre of the radius that the Seat of Government must be within In fact, upon fifty miles of Orange, but it will not affect 1 he territory.

542,Mr Joseph Cook (Parramatta),"question of the unemployed is under consideration the Government will not confine their attention merely to Melbourne, but will take a Federal view, and do all they can to provide work for unfortunate men. There is plenty of work which might be carried out in Sydney with immense advantage, and some has already been done, with the greatest possible advantage to the Department. I urge very strongly an extension of the work on any legitimate lines. I hope that the Government will keep this in mind when they are considering the question of the relieving the unemployed of Melbourne. MrM c DONA LD (Kennedy) I should like to urge upon the Government the necessity of undertaking similar work in Brisbane and other large centres in. Queensland. I can assure the honourable member for Melbourne Ports that the danger from the breaking and falling of electric wires on the electric tramways is much greater in Brisbane and Sydney than in Melbourne. carrying out of this work is more urgently needed in Brisbane than elsewhere, owing to the streets being so narrow. Already several accidents have taken place through the breaking and falling of electric wires, and serious damage has been done. circumstances, I would urge on the Government the necessity of carrying out similar work-ou t of revenue-in Brisbane and other centres in Queensland. honourable member for Melbourne Ports has raised a question which, I am certain, pertains to the capital of every State. If the Government can see their way to undertake the work, our streets will be more sightly, as well as safer for citizens. In this city animals, as well as human beings, have sometimes been destroyed in coming in contact with live wires. for the firemen, which is a very important consideration. which my honourable friend can speak with better information than I can. bane, Perth, Adelaide, Sydney, and Melbourne, the carrying out of this work is certainly needed. wires under the footpaths we shall be f o llowing the example which has been set in every other civilized centre in the world. pipes in one tunnel ? the honourable member that it should be done. If , for instance, the owner of a property in San Francisco will not put an arch under the footpath in front of his building, the municipality will carry out the work at his cost. By that means they have a ready mode of placing gas pipes and electric wires under the paths. That is an example which could very well be followed in Melbourne. No question of State against State is involved here. If the Government can see their way to do this work, they will help a body of men whom I am always sad to have to speak for. I spoke on their behalf many times in this chamber when it was occupied by the Legislative Assembly of ' Victoria. I am sorry that the necessity arises for me to speak now. I trust that when this Government are hoary with years, resting in the seats which they so well decorate, the unemployed question shall have been solved. I have seen no less than nine different Governments in Victoria, and I am sorry to The sav that they have not done anything definite to relieve the unemployed. Sir WILLIAM LYNE (Hume) I desire to ask tlie Prime Minister whether, if the Government are not prepared to take up the Manufactures Encouragement Bill, In these they will give me an early opportunity of trying to get it put through the House? Monaro) I hope that when the Government are dealing with the suggestions made by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, and other honourable members, they will not f a l l into the old groove of considering that all the unemployed are located in Melbourne, Sydney, and Brisbane, but will remember that there are some unemployed persons in the country districts. I trust that they will ask Parliament to provide forthwith the money for carrying out any works, repairs, and painting which have been recommended, or authorized, so that the distress in the country districts may be relieved. This is just the time of the year when a little work of that kind In Briswould come in very well. The Government would probably get the work done -well and cheaply at this season, because when If we put the electric there are a number of men out of employment they are always prepared to compete. As long as they get a reasonable price the competition will enable the Goput all the vernment to get the work done better than they otherwise could.",66,Encouragement Bill

550,Mr Mauger,"Not even in winter time.honourable member for Melbourne Ports talksabout "" no sweating."" This unemployed question is not one to joke about. Vt is one which the Government ought to take into its serious consideration. If it is to be made a mockery of in this House, for the purpose of gulling people outside, then let it be known. But I do not wish to do that. I am referring to works which are needed in my own district, which have been authorized, and for which the money is available. I ask that the men in the country districts shall receive from .the Government' as much consideration as the men in Melbourne Ports. why give them a lower wage than they are entitled to receive? district would be very glad to be able to sweat and earn some money: very well for the honourable member for Melbourne Ports to come here and interject. He has had his opportunity of addressing the House, but why should he always come here and try on this sort of business ? the interjection. The honourable member does not know what he is talking about. the action of the honourable member. am not making a mockery of the unemployed. I hope that the Prime Minister will also take into consideration the representations that were made to him on Saturday in Sydney by a deputation of wirenet workers, which I had the honour of introducing to him. The industry in Sydney employs 440 men. But the industry in Melbourne has been closed down, owing to the competition of cheap Germanmade goods. I placed before the honourable gentleman on Saturday information which clearly demonstrated that these German-made goods were being dumped into this country at a loss to the Germans, because they were trying to drive the locally-made wire-netting out of the market. the price. honourable member says, immediately the local works were stopped up would go the price. done in that respect. the honourable member may like to havehis little joke. He may come in here in a spirit of levity, and think it a good joke to laugh at the unemployed. But I am in earnest in this matter. orable member is rather too fond of doing that kind of thing. I think it is just as well to remember that it is a serious matter to the unemployed, and I hope that threpresentations which have been made, will be taken into serious consideration by the Prime Minister. The Government would not be justified in doing more with a view to relieving the unemployed-than carry out those works which in any case would be necessary. My honourable colleague the Minister of Home Affairs is now expediting the carrying out of works which have been authorized, or which we feel pretty certain must be undertaken and are likely to get the approval of Parliament. There is no doubt that, before very long, in all our large centres, the undergrounding of these wires will become_ an absolute necessity. The number of wires that we now have will be nearly doubled within a comparatively short time owing to the installation of a metallic return in connection with the telephone system. Itwill soon become imperative to nut the wires I under the road, so as not to interfere with the convenience of the people. For some time past we have had to incur considerable expenditure owing to the necessity of putting in other alterations. In Sydney, for instance, a large expenditure on the Post Office will not be completed until the end of this year. Constructing, as we do ar present, all our works out of revenue we cannot be expected to undertake everything in one year. is not' likely to over-lap Sydney, or vice versa. expenditure is debited against the State in which it is incurred. The Minister of Home Affairs has just informed me that he will give every consideration to this matter, and, in conjunction with the Postmaster-General, see how far these necessary works can be pushed on.
