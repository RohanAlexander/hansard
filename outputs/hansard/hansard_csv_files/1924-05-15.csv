The present Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Austin Chapman), when Postmaster-General, attended a Conference of this character. The Government considers that it is desirable that during the consideration of very important questions such as those which wil l be raised at the Stockholm Conference, the Postmaster General should be present. He w ill , of course, be accompanied by a technical adviser, who will be in a position to supply any necessary technical information. -AULEGED INFRINGEMENT.

4,Mr Fenton,"I wish to make a. perthe contract versus the day-labour system. J was reported in the Melbourne Age of the 9th Mayi n tbe following terms:Mr fenton said that owing to the collusion among contractors, muny public bodies had lo revert to the day-labour system. Among these was the Victorian Metropolitan Board ol Works, which has been advised by its experts Hint the tender prices in many instances were too high, and which had re-adopted the day labour system to a large extent. These workij wore proceeding at a satisfactory rate, and the engineers were more than satisfied with the class of work being done. Following the publication of that report, a letter written by a Mr T. Starr, dated the 12th May, was published in the Age of Tuesday of this week. In that letter the writer saysIn tlie House nf Representatives last Thursday Mr Venton, M.l'., in liis advocacy of day labour against contract work alleges collusion nmoiur contractors and mentions the Melbourne, and Metropolitan Board of Works ns one of the publi'j bodies that bud to it large extent adopted the day-labour system. There is no collusion between tlie Board of Works contractors, and I am sure the Board is Satisfied in regard to this mutter. Mr Fnnton's statement is slanderous and untruthful. The expressions usod by Mr Starr in his letter are so striking aud strong as to demand a reply. I propose, therefore, to quote from Hansard what I really did say. Referring to the day-labour system, I saidTho Metropolitan Board of Works approved of this method. Tho Hoard consists for the must part of men representing municipal councils throughout the metropolitan area, and in recent times it has carried out public works involving the expenditure of considerable suras of money. I believe that on many occasions when tenders have been altogether too highI do not suggest collusion between contractorson the advice of its engineers the Board has carried out the works by day labour, which is now its recognized system. As far as I have been able to gather, this is proving most satisfactory. The pace at which work is being carriod on is as good, if not better, thaii under tlie contract system, and the Board's experts arc thoroughly satisfied with the quality of the work that is being done. I make this quotation from an uncorrected Hansard members will see that I purposely used the words "" I do not suggest collusion between contractors."" letter, refers to u particular work undertaken by the Melbourne politan says has now been in' progress for nearly. ..three, yearn, and at-, present Mr Fenton. not 10 per cent, of the work has been finished. I am informed on the authority of a member of the Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works, aud an expert, that the work referred to by Mr Starr was commenced only in August last, and has therefore not been in progress for three years. I may say that in connection with this work for which tenders were received amounting to over £100,000, when it was discovered that the Melbourne and Metropolitan Boardof Works was likely to carry out the work by day labour one contractor was immediately prepared to cut his price down, by no less than £28,000. In the matter of house connexions, the Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works, by adopting the day-labour system, have saved the ratepayers many thousands of pounds, because when contractors carried out the work considerably more had to be paid .for it . I have made this statement in order to correct Mr Starr, who I understand is o rich contractor. His -observations were very personal, and my statement shows clearly that he, and not I , is the slanderous and untruthful person. fact that the special Committee of soldier members, appointed by the Government to deal with repatriation and pension cases, is to meet at an early date, I should like to know f r om the Treasurer if the Committee is to be regarded as a court of appeal,' and if recommendations made by it will be acted upon by him or the Government?

6,Mr Jackson,"W ill the Primemust, of course, know that I am not in a. position to give him any such undertaking, but be will have many opportunities to raise the question and have it fully ventilated. If he does that, the Government will consider what action should be taken. the honourable member for Angas( Mr Gabb) an intimation that he proposes to move the adjournment of the House to discuss a definite matter of urgent public importance, namely, "" the prohibition of entry into Australia of persons of German parentage and nationality."" Five honourable members having risen in their placesQuestion proposed. no occasion for me to apologize for bringing this matter before honourable members. I have waited patiently for eighteen months, ever since this Parliament was elected, in the hope that, as there has been an introduction of fresh blood to the House, and a coalition Ministry has been formed, something would be done to remove this affront to a great nation. If any. apology be needed, it should be made by the Government in this matter. entry of German nationals is prohibited by section 3</e of the Immigration Act 1920For the period of live years after the commencement of this paragraph, and thereafter until the Governor General by proclamation otherwise determines, any person who in the opinion of an officer is of German, AustroGcrman, Bulgarian, or Hungarian parentage and nationality, or is a Turk of the Ottoman race. The provision was the product of war hysteria. It is on a par with legislation passed in South Australia altering the names of different towns which had sprung up as the result of German settlement. Por example, we had a little town called Klemzig. During the war its name was altered to Gaaa. Buchfelde was altered to Loos; BhineV ill a was altered to Cambria; Steinfeld was altered to Stonefield. That, of course, was ridiculous. Honourable members will notice that the alterations were made in compliment to other foreign countries, with which it is quite conceivable we may be at war some day. Legislation of this nature may have far-reaching effects, so it is high time that we took a sober view of the situation. We are at peace with Germany. Therefore we should treat her people with reasonable respect. I am not foolish enough to endeavour to take honourable members into the higher realm of ' forgivenesss in national or political matters, but 1 submit that since we are at peace I have received from with Germany we should not continue this affront to her people. We should not place them in the same category, in regard to immigration, as harlots, criminals, idiots, and other imdesirable persons. No other part of the B ritish Empire is treating German nationals in this way, and no part of the BritishE m pire is in greater need of a virile white population than Australia. I am not worrying about the .special interests of Germany. I do not want to be misunderstood. 1 am submitting the motion as an Australian, and as one who has the in terests of his country at heart. Critics may ask why I have singled out German nationals in this way. I have done so because I have had long experience of people descended from German settlers, who have proved themselves good citizens. Any remarks I make to-day I desire to support by giving my actual experience. We are attempting to build up a nation. TheI believe that it is still true that ""Righteousness exalteth a nation; but sin is a reproach to any people "" . Character must be at the very foundation of a nation if it is to be great. I do not argue that the German nation is a nation of righteous people, as I believe in the truth of the Biblical statement that ""There is none righteous, no, not one"". I do not make that claim for people of German nationality, hut I do say that my experience of them in South Australia is that they are a moral people, who observe the ordinances of their religion as closely as any other people I have met. I have memories of a similar occasion in this House four years ago, when, in 1920, I stood for justice for Australians of German descent who had been oppressed. A t that time cries of "" The honourable member for B e r l in "" were shouted at me.

A man who left Germanyi n 1914, battled in the Mallee for ten years, and still remained true to the girl he lef t behind him, is of the type we want in this country.

That is, perhaps, why I worked with more feeling than I might otherwise have done to see that They can do that in the counthis man had the opportunity to make the home he wanted and deserved. TheI t annpys me to read of a ship's fourth requisite for nation-building is courage, particularly courage for the purpose of defence. Some honourable members may say that that is a reason for excluding Germans, but I would remind them that history clearly teaches that the foe of yesterday may become the ally of to-morrow, and that the ally of yesterday may become the foe of to-morrow. If we keep j>eople out for that reason, we shall This Parliament, and the Gomakea great mistake. Whatever may be our opinion of the origin of the war, or whatever nation we may blame for it , we must a l l admit that the stand taken by the German people, with foes all round them, was evidence, at any rate, of courage. I believe it would be wise I to encourage people of that type to come to this country. It may be that the day will come when we shall thank God for every son of white parents that we have This man was not deported, like in Australia.

Mr Tate informed me that he found that the erroneous impression existed in Denmark, and he gave me au account of a conversation he had with a highly placed professor in that country. I quote the conversation from memory. "" I asked him ' Is there any surplus of agricultural labour in Denmark?' answer was, ' Yes, about annum.' go V and he replied, United States of America.' ""'Why and the Professor answered, ' You will not let them in.'"" Mr Tate explained to him that it was easier for a Dane to get into Australia than it had been for him to get into Denmark. .

BRUCE (Flinders-Prime Minister and Minister for External Affairs) [3.15] -The honourable member for Angas( Mr Gabb) has directed the attention of the House to a question of great moment to Australia.

Does the honourable gentleman think that the whole of the restrictions at present operative should be removed immediately, and that the German people should at once be placed on exactly the same footing as they had before the war ? tion system of immigration should be permitted. believes that the nomination system which applies to the people of Great Britain should be permitted to apply also to the German people. whether the honourable member for Angas thinks that at no time after the war should any restrictions have been imposed iipon the immigration of GermansI t follows, therefore, to Australia, but I shall not ask him to indicate his views upon that subject. This House must consider this question in all its aspects I do not think that a single member will dispute the honourable gentleman's contention that we desire to receive into Australia all persons of any white race which has as good Some honourable members of a record as the German people had before the war. Any healthy, industrious, t h r if t y people of the white race If the party to which I beshould certainly be welcomed to this country. Honourable members must recollect, however, that the circumstances surrounding the re-admission of the Germans to Australia are complicated and difficult. Some five years ago we were engaged in a life and death struggle with I know that we must have the German people. During the war much I befeeling was engendered against those with whom we were engaged in hostile operaare the best outside the tions.

All honourable members w ill agree that, in fairness to our own people, and in recognition of the sentiments and feelings of the nation which we represent, some such action as that had to be taken. The war ended some years ago, and we have experienced a change of feeling in many directions. Australia has resumed her trade with Germany, and we have in this country to-day a representative of the German people in the person of their consul. The Government recognize, and so do I , as fully as any one, that the atmosphere has changed during the years that have passed. Although we cannot dissociate the German people from many things that were done during the war, we recognize now that the war was caused by the I believe that the nominagoverning classes of that nation. The German people supported the actions of their Government because of the spirit I take it then that he that had been engendered in them for a considerable time before the outbreak of hostilities. I believe it is now the wish of the Australian people that the war experiences should be completely forgotten; and, as a new spirit grows in Germany, I am not quite clear and as new ideals inspire the German people, the feelings which have existed should entirely disappear.

36,Mr Whitsitt,"D i d any honorablebrother? I do not believe in this motion. There is no maudlin sentiment about me. I remember that we 'lost 60,000 of the -beat of our manhood during the war, and that the Germans did not fight fairly. They sank the Lusitania; they murdered Captain Fryatt after a trial that was a travesty of justice. murdered Nurse Cavell. Notwithstanding this, certain people in Australia are trying to boost the Germans, and are prepared to allow them to enter Australia again. I .do not want to see them for generations. As a matter of fact, I never want to see them in Australia. soap. Germany. If I had my way, I would use the sjambok on them and keep them cut. We do not want them here. Once a Germain, always a German.. Country party* myself. people in this country. I would like to see the provisions and the Act renewed for another 50 years, or more. During the war we lost '60,000 of the flower of Australia in addition to incurring a debt of £400,000,000 for fightsng these blighters. There was no f u n in it . Shame on the men who advocate their cause! This question is one which should be approached by honourable members calmly and without prejudice. This Parliament stands for a fair deal to all, and its members have, or should have, the necessary ability and judgment to decide a matter of this nature. Great Britain was more involved in the war than we ware. Yet the British Parliament did not place the ban upon the people of the German race that has been placed upon theni by this Parliament. fireedom to enter England. Some people w ill say that a man who has the courage to suggest that people of German descent should be admitted to Ai>stralia is biased in favour of the Germaais, but that is altogether an erroneous deduction to draw. We are not discussdaig the merits or the demerits of the late war; neither its causes nor its aftermath is before us. We are asked to consider whether it is fair aaid reasonable for this barrier to be maintained any longer against the relatives of people who have, in many cases, been .residents of Australia for the last 30 years. Many of these people were pioneers in this country more than a generation ago, and had nothing whatever to dowith the junkerism and militarism of Germany in 1913 and 1914. Honourable members on both, sides know They also that the great majority of the requests which they have received from residents of Australia for permission to bring out their relatives have been from farmers of 25 to 30 years' residence ""in Australia. In many cases their requests for permits have been made in respect of a younger brother or sister, or, in some cases, a sweetheart. Tn parts of Germany to-day there is great privation, and indeed starvation. ManyI use nothing from of the young men of 21 or 22 years of age, who it is desired should be 'permitted to enter Australia, had not even a vote in 1914. I agree with the 'houorable member for Hume( Mr Parker Moloney) that the sons df Australian farmers should be our first consideration, but after they I am speaking for have been placed on the land we should I do not want to see these consider people from other countries. We all welcome a, flow of immigration of the -right sort from the British Isles, buf we on this side maintain that the nomination system should also be applied to people from Germany, whose relatives in Australia are prepared to guarantee them an occupation and a living, if brought out. It has been well said that the victor can afford to be generous to the vanquished. The Parliament of Great Britain has recognized, the wisdom of that, and has said that there is no necessity to continue the vendetta against the Germans. The people of Australia have no objection to trading with Germany. The RightH o n . W . M . Hughes, who, when Prime Minister, said we should never again trade with Germany, was induced to introduce a B ill to enable trade to be re-established with that country. The Germans are given f u l l honourable member for Grey( Mr Lacey; informed us that last year the value of our exports to Germany totalled over £4,003,000.

41,Mr Forde (Capricornia) [4.1],"rhe magnanimous treatment meted out to the Boers in SouthA f r i ca by GreatB r i tain. the right of self-government as a British Dominion, and they responded nobly to that generous consideration. General Smuts is looked upon as one of Great Britain's most-loyal friends, and he ranks high among the statesmen of the. Dominions. through the German settlement* of Queensland-Milniam, Ambrose, Baffle Creek, and Mount Larcom, I support the views expressed by the Brisbane Courier, one of the most conservative newspapers in Australia, in respect to the valuable pioneering work done by Germans in that State. In its issue of the 7th February, 1924, the Courier has the foil-owing article:As one tops the ridge leading irflo Ha'tton Vnle a charming scene presents itselfa scene which reminds one of rural pictures of the Old \,iw&. Surrounded by a grove of trees, hunya pines, firs, topped brigalows (which make a beautiful ornamental tree), cabbage palms, almonds, peppe'rinas, poineiauas, golden wattle, and other flowering trees, stands the German Apostolic Church. Through the foliage arose the spire and turrets of the church. Surely aa artist designed the plan and a lover of Nature carried out the work. The history of the settlement, as related by the son of one of the pioneers, is a record of perseverance and hard work. years ago the tract was covered with brigalow scrub. The landa light sandy soil-is not comparable with Ure black soil 'flats for fertility, though it has proved good dairying country and excellent for the growing of broom millet. A few years earlier a few German settlers had been placed on the land at Summerhills, in the ranges, about 3 miles from Grandchester. They had made homes there by dint -if hard work, but the distance from waterthe nearest was nt Grandohestor-and the steepness of the hills impelled them to look for a better site. Neimeyer, who was the first settler on Summerhills, and who evidently bad greal influence with his countrymen, decided to try the Hatton Vale scrub. Again the work of pioneering was taken up, but the advantage of the experience already gained obviated many of the hardships of the first settlement. Others quickly followed, and the scrub rapidly disappeared before the axe and firestick. A name that is well known in the district is that of Zischke. Mr F. Zischke died some few years ago and left nine sons, all of whom are married and settled within a few miles of Hatton Vale. Councillor A. Sehlefit, oP the Laidley Shire, is another of the old pioneers of the locality. Mr F. Born, who died some four years ago, endeared himself to the little community, and every one to whom the writer spoke mentioned his name in terms of affectional remembrance. Some of the stories told of the hardships of the early days 'are hardly comprehensible in these times of State assistance. One is that a man, Those people were entrusted with his wife, and four little children were landed <m the edge of the scrub at S'uihinerhills with a few sheets of iron, and some flour, tea, sugar, and a few tools. The iron was put.up as a To-day, "" loan-to until a hut was built, and at dawn, after the first night, they were stricken with horror at the laugh of the jackass, thinking ihe blacks were upon them. They carried water from Grand'cliesler up the range to SumAs one who has travelled merhiUs, some § miles, in two cans on a yoke. The scrub was cleared, and the first crop of com planted; but, as soon as it was up, it attracted every wallaby Within miles, and was destroyed. Palings were split arid carried up steep hills along the iine of fence to protect the little bib of cultivation... Th'e pioneers were hardy and industrious, and deserve all the success they attained. That is representative of all the German settlements in Queensland. In many oases these German pioneers pitched their tents on the side of the road, and hewed their farms out of the scrub. They have b u i l t up valuable properties by sheer hard work. They played no part whatever in the great war. H ad they been in Germanyi n 1914 they could not have influenced that nation against militarism. Many of them; were induced to come out to Queensland in 1906, when the then Queensland Government authorized Mr. Ncimcyer to bring oitt a number of GerThirty-seven man settlers. He was able to induce. 75 people to migrate to Queensland, and he kept, and fed them for six weeks, u n t il they eventually settled down at Baffle Creek. To-day they are excellent citizens. In those days there was vefy little Government assistance, and those settlers had to endure many privations. But they won through because of their sheer determination to crucceed. They are the In consequence the late Mr type of people who now desire to bring out their relatives to take up the land first occupied by some who have now passed into the Great Beyond. In this matter honourable members on this side are not taking sides with Germany against Australia, or with Germany against England. We simply contend that, the war being over, it should be forgotten, and that all prejudice, bitterness, and hatred should pass. During the last four or five years 400 commercial men have been admitted to Australia from Germany to carry on business in this country. We ask that no distinction should be made between them and Germans who are desirous of settling on the land. Requests have been made to the Government by some of the Germansi n Australia for the admission to Australia of the Rev. 0. A. Bruckner, head of the Apostolic Churchi n Germany. country there are thousands of adherents of that church, but the Ministerf o r Home and Territories (Senator Pearce), in a letter dated the 17th March last, stated that he was unable to see his way to vary the previous decision in this case. He added, "" It may be mentioned that my reasons for this action are substantial, but cannot be given."" I believe that the reasons should be stated, or the man admitted. ""We members on this side are all of British stock and are jjroud of the fact; but, nevertheless, we stand for a fair deal for people of all nationalities. Australians are essentially sports, and we claim to be representative of the people of this country. We ask for fair treatment. In making this request we are asking for no more than the British Parliament has beeu prepared to give to all those of German birth. support the motion moved by the honourable member for Angas( Mr Gabb). Australia is the onlycountry in the world to prohibit the entry of Germans into its territory. after the cessation of hostilities between the nations more than 12,000 Germans were permitted to enter England, and no objection was taken. proud traditions of the British race that we are always prepared to shake hands and make friends with those with whom we have quarrelled, and as one who loves peace, and is prepared at all times to extend the hand of friendship towards the man or the people w i th whom I have quarrelled, I support the motion. only does the present restriction on tlie admission of Germans to Australia i m pose a hardship on people now in this country who desire to bring out their relatives, but we also prohibit the publication of their church journal, which is printed in tlie German language. There are many old German people in this country who cannot read English, and they wi3h to have their little church paper printed in the German language so that they may read it and comfort themselves with it . We do not allow them to do so, and I regard thatas a hardship on them. We ought to agree, here and now, to abolish that restriction, even if the Government cannot see its way to reThroughout the move the prohibition upon the entry of Germans into this country. Is there any sense in continuing the blockade against the Germansi n this country and preventing them from bringing their relatives out from Germany""? The British Parliament offers no objection to Germans entering Great Britain. It cannot be denied that Lord Milner, who was of German birth, and was educated in Germany, was a member of the British Parliament aud the British Ministry during the war. Although the British Parliament admits into the Ministry a German-born gentleman, who was educated in Germany, this Parliament refuses to allow Germans to come to Australia six years after hostilities have ceased. Sir John Monash, who has charge of the great electricity works at Morwell, Victoria, had no hesitation in sending to Germany when he required experts to supervise the erection of. the briquetting plant. Those men are now here. lies were allowed to come here, too. MrM c NEILL -There is a German Consul here. He has been here for six or eight months. We are trading with GerI n the first year many. We ask them to buy our wool, our wheat, and our butter, and we buy their manufactures. The Prime Minister said we could only wipe out the feeling of It is one of the hatred in a long period of years. If the principle of admitting Germans into this country is wrong to-day it will not bp less wrong in 1925. I am Australian horn, and am as good a Britisher as the honourable member for Darwin( Mr Whitsitt), who made such a bitter and hostile speech. I can imagine how he would perform in time of war. No one can Not deny that the Gjeirm/an population iof South Australia and Victoria comprises the best pioneers we have had in this laud. They understand the scientific treatment of the soil, and are splendid men in handling stock. They also make excellent citizens. A smaller percentage of Germans than of any other race in this country are brought before the police and law Courts.

The honourable gentleman cannot have read much history. The Germans fought with us-and fought well, too'-at the battle of Waterloo. They helped us on that occasion, and the day may come when they will again fight side by side with us. I hope that neither Great Britain, Australia, nor any other country will ever be involved in war again. I belong to a party that stands for endeavouring, at any rate, to bring about universal peace. We ought at. this stage, after the lapse of six years since the ending of the war, to do something to heal its wounds and forget the past. Australia can afford to be generous. We can afford, if necessary, to take the lead in this matter. Unfortunately, on this occasion, we are following behind. I do not blame the present Government. who was responsible for the malicious Act against which we are protesting was the ex-Prime Minister( MrW . M . Hughes). is perpetuating the Act. MrM c NEILL T h a t is so, but like the ex-Prime Minister, they may see the light eventually. I hope the Government will take a lenient and humane view of the matter, and realize that no good can come from harsh restrictions against people who belong to one of the great white nations of the world, which has made great strides in the world's history, and has been a leader in science, agriculture, and art. The Germans have been in the van nearly a l l the time, and we can now afford to say to them, "" The war has been over nearly six years, and, whatever our quarrels may have been, we are willing, as other nations have done, to shake hands with y o u . "" [4.23] -As for my experience of the operation of this provision for restricting the^dmission of Germans into Australia, I have, on one occasion only, forwarded an application by one of my constituents for the admission of a German. He applied for onei of his parents and his brother to be admitted to Australia. The Ministerf or Home and Territories (Senator Pearce) dealt w i th the matter with great expedition. He gave unconditional permission for the parent to be brought out to Australia, but in the case of the brother he stipulated-as appeared to me to be proper and prudent-that he should be admitted only if he could give satisfactory evidence that he was not engaged against us in the Great War. Any one who served in that war probably looks at this matter differently from those who did not engage in the fighting. One ""who was actually in the field for three or four years cannot look at the subject from the unbiased view-point of the man who has not seen his companions shot down and wounded beside him. My mind goes back to the case of a boy I knew. He was, I think, nineteen years of age. He was actually at the Frontf o r about six months. In that time he was wounded twice, gassed once, and then killed. It is difficult to get rid of the feelings engendered by such experiences. YetI am sure that the general attitude of AusThe honourable member tralians is that we do not want to perpetuate bitterness. For my part, I draw a very definite distinction between Australians of German descent and Germans proper. For the Australian of German descent, when he is a loyal man, I have the greatest admiration. We know that in some instances these men have expressed sentiments which have not been loyal : w i th them. I personally do not wish to have anything to do, although I still regard them as Australians; but for those who must have been torn by conflicting sentiments, and came forward and fought as Australians in the war, I have the greatest admiration. I am glad of this opportunity, which is the first I have had, of paying my small tribute to the magnificent services they rendered to this country. But to say that, because certain men of German descent fought magnificently for us during the war, we should throw our country open to' ©very German who desires to come here, whether he was our enemy in the field for three or four years or not, seems to me to be pushing the matter toofar. I see no reason why, because we are trading with this nation, we should invite Germans to' come within our portals. The two things are entirely distinct.

Going back a little in O'lir history, we in 1890, £100,000,000 ; in 1900, £200,000,000 ; and in 1920, £800,000,000.

Obviously, that sort of thing cannot continue. question. We all know that the curtailment of governmental expenditure and the necessary imposition of taxation to' keep the country solvent, is not popular, but it is the responsibility of those who hold the reins of government in the Federal and State arenas of Australia to carefully and seriously consider the position; otherwise, we l'isk a deterioration in national prestige, and ultimatelya. diminution of national credit that may bring us to the position occupied by some of the South American Republics, with the repercussion that it inevitably must have upon the whole of the work, production, comfort, happiness, and character of our people. Some optimists argue that a rapid in flux of people would considerably lighten the load of debt which the people of Australia are carrying to-day, and the Treasurer (Dr. Earle Page) has drawndown much criticism and ridicule upon his devoted head by making the suggestion that further borrowing should be limited to our present load per head of population-that is to say, that our present net debt of, say, £160 or £ 1 7 0 per head, is big enough, and an era of frenzied finance would be reached if future borrowings exceeded that amount. Fun has been made of the Treasurer's proposal that every baby or immigrant arriving here should justify the borrowing of an additional £ 1 6 0 ; but the basic idea in his mind, I am sure, was that the extreme safety limit of debt per head had been reached, and I , personally, welcome any proposal that will set some definite limit to our financial orgies. The argument that a rapid increase in population-would partly relieve or spread our load of debt is admissible, but such a result is most improbable, in view of the facts. the public debt has about doubled itself in every decade since 1870, but the increase of population in the decade ended 1880 was only""35 per cent.; in the decade ended 1890, 41 per cent.; 1900, 20 per cent.; 1910, 17^ per cent.; and 1920, 22 per cent.; so that, whereas the increase in our public debt from 1870 to 1920 was over 3,000 per cent., the increase in our population for the same period was only 235 per cent, It will be seen that our public debt has been, increasing more than ten times faster than our population. There is nothing, thereThis is not a party fore, to' be found in this direction that will give any consolation to those who consider that the prodigality of the past, and even the present, can be countered by an increase of population. Viewing our enormous public indebtedness from another angle, however, perhaps we may derive a little comfort. From tlie stand-point of the national wealth of the country, created by the work and production of the people and aided by the many natural advantages that the Commonwealth possesses, the position is more hopeful, and a true perspective of Australia's economic position cannot be given without taking into consideration this point of view. The only endeavour ever made to obtain reliable statistics concerning our national wealth was in the year 1915, when a census was attempted. I do> not regard the resultant figures published by the Commonwealth Statistician as more than a very Tough approximation of the values of fixed and movable commodities owned by the people of this Commonwealth, nor does the Statistician profess that such figures as he published are more than that; but in order to probe the question of our 1 national finance from this stand-point we have no other figures to start with, so I use them, with much reserve, as a basis upon which to give, in my opinion, some rough indication of the position. The partial census referred to, showed that the national wealth in 1915 was likely to be a sum approaching £2,000,000,000, and I believe to-day, in view of the rise in credit values, and the prices of our products, coupled with the increase in the value of production, that the total national wealth or credit of all Australia's people, including Government assets, would be a sum very I have already shown that roughly approximating something approaching £3,000,000,000. It must not be forgotten that of this sum nearly half is in land values, and half of the remainder probably in fixed assets such as railways, Government works, buildings, factories, and machinery. There would not be many hundreds of millions of movable assets, and the gold in the Treasury, plus the amount held by private banks and individuals, is less than £50,000,000, so that the proportion of gold to national wealth is less than 2 per cant. Real wealth is only the stored up products of industiy, and the standard of our national wealth is a credit valuation based upon productive assets. Out of a debt, Federal, State, and Municipal, of, say, £950,000,000, there are certain assets such as railways, tramways, and public works, which are a fair set-off against part.of it. The value of these assets, of course, depends .upon their ability to function in such a way as to return or give in value the yearly interest they cost. Assuming, they do, we should still have a dead debt of, say, £600,000,000, and on the figures. I have quoted, the Governments of the past have pledged, outside their reproduction assets, 20 per cent, of the present values of land, nexion with our economic position torailways, buildings, machinery, gold, movable assets and national credit of all descriptions to the public creditor at home and abroad. The figures of Commonwealth pro-' duction also justify some optimism if our economic position is faced now. Although tlie values of primary and secondary production have not been increasing in the same ratio as our public debt, there is a marked aud marvellous increase, which largely explains how we have been permitted to arrive at the present public financial position, a position, perhaps, of only evanescent prosperity without] feeling much financial dislocation, and with an avoidance of hard times for our people. toral, dairying, mining, manufacturing, and minor industries produced in 1881, a total value of £71,000,000; in 1901. that value had increased to £114,000,000; in 1911, to £188,000,000; and in 1921, to the enormous sum of £393,000,000, although the figures in the following year fell considerably. and a fairer comparison, to take the value rather than the volume of commodities produced in order to keep the line of comthe aggregate indebtedness as, say, parison even. Summarizing these figures: Since 1881 our debt has increased sixteen times, primary and secondary production nearly six times, whilst our population has only just doubled itself. Obviously, the great war has been responsible for a large proportion of our load of debt. ""Whilei t mayfeean excuse for the present position, the debt nevertheless is there, and the position must be faced. Admittedly, we are not so badly off as other countries, hut w.e would have Mr Pratten. Australia healthy economically as wellasi physically, and it is with that idea that I pursue my subject. The basis, of course, of the whole of our credits; wealth, and ability to bear a load of debt; with its annually recurringinterest; and our ability also to ultimately redeem it, is the work and production of the country. I think I have shown (hat from, every stand-point public borrowing has far outstripped development, whether from the aspect of the increase in population, or increase in national credit, in land values and other things, or the vitally important increase in the volume of our production. What gives one most comfort in conday are the figures for the last twenty years of Federation. Although in this period our public debt, including Avar expenditure, increased more than four times, and our population did not double itself, general bank deposits increased more than three times, Savings Bank deposits more than five times, Commonwealth and State revenue nearly four times, aud primary and secondary production in value considerably more than three times the figures of 1901. Fortunately for us, too, the trend of public borrowing in recent years has been in the direction of co-opting the work and; production of Australia and the new wealth created within our borders in order that Our agricultural, paswe may ourselves supply the credits required for purposes of government, instead of seeking it abroad. The net result of tliis is that £250,000,000 of the total Commonwealth debt of £410,000,000, or more than two-thirds of it, has been obtained in Australia, and less than one-third., or £130,000,000, is owing in LonI think it sounder, don. With regard to. the States, taking £540,000,000, about two-fifths, or £234,000,000, has been obtained in Australia, and slightly under three-fifths elsewhere. An examination of the increase in States' debtsduring the last six years shows that, out of £145,000,000 in additional loans, over £100,000,00.0 has been raised in Australia, and less than £50,000,000 abroad; and whereas in 1901, of the total State indebtedness 14 per cent, was owing in Australia and 86 per cent, abroad, in 1923 43$ per cent, of the total owing than had been raised in Ausown resources we at least know where we tralia and 56$ per cent, elsewhere. are, and what we have to do.

Clearly, the time for co-operation in connection with State and Federal borrowings is overdue. this direction by mutual statutory agreement, the people must be called upon to decide how far we can continue this competition for further loans and dear money. One outstanding feature of the figures I have quoted is the large comparative increase in -the credit that has been supplied to the various Governments by the people of Australia. These show that, since 1911, the total loans owing by £410.000,000, out of which £280,000,000 have been floated in Australia and £130,000,000 £270,000,000 floated by the States since 1911, £156,000,000 have been provided by £1.14,000,000 have been raised abroad. Summarized, the figures disclose that, since 1911, we have raised £436,000,000 iu the Commonwealth out of a total of £680,000,000 borrowed, or an average of nearly £40,000,000 per year. SinceI last spoke in this House upon Australia's economic position there has been some disagreement expressed with regard to suggested remedies for what is clearly an anomalous position. It seems to me clear that Government borrowings abroad waste the credit of the people of Australia, as Australian credits abroad cannot reach us in tiny other way than by the importation of goods. Experience proves that excess credits abroad always place a premium, through the exchange position, upon-the importation of goods into Australia, and automatically take an exchange toll from the whole of our exports. The absence of any co-ordinated banking authority here .precludes any credits owned by Australia abroad, through excess of exports, the high prices of her commodities in the world's markets, Government borrowing, or from any other cause, being returned in any other form quired that Government borrowings abroad result only in the importation of more .goods, it is to be found in a detailed examination of our import figures and the increase in debts abroad. It w ill, I think, be generally acknowledged that, in order to keep out of further debt, our exports should exceed our imports to the extent of the interest on our debts abroad plus amounts spent by our people abroad, together with other services and remittances. For instance, we have to provide increasing amounts for interest If nothing can be achieved in charges on our debts abroad, according to the extent of those debts. A t present, a sum of about £20,000,000 per annum is required, and, in addition to that, a large sum, on the average, is spent each year by travellers abroad on the purchase of pleasure and for dividends, remittances, and other things, and unless our exports exceed our imports to the extent of these factors together, we are incurring furthe r indebtedness. Federal and State combined ? in London. Of the creased volume of imports over these factors, less any compensating factor, mathematical law would expect to find a corthe people of Australia, and responding increase in our indebtedness abroad. On a detailed examination of the position the evidence meets the expectation. Let us test the most recent period for which figures are availablethe period 1918-19, to 1922-23-wit h only minor gold movements to complicate the figures. For those five years our i m ports were valued at £600,000,000. Add to that an average of £17,000,000 per annum for interest, and, say, a balance of, £5,000,000 per annum for money spent abroad and remittances from the Commonwealth, together with other invisible imports and services over and above those received, and we arrive at another £110,000,000 for the five years. That would give us a total debit figure against the Commonwealth-visibl e and invisible'-for the five years' period of £710,000,000. Our export figures during these five years amounted to £642,000,000, showing a net balance against the Commonwealth pf £68,000,000. The actual increase in",33,Australia S Economic Problems

There have been, also, during the last five years, apart 'altogether from the visible import and export figures, a mass of invisible exports .lot inoluded in this table. arisen by excess prices and profits cn wool in England, which directly and indirectly account for the excess banking credits available there now. This afternoon, the Prime Minister, in answer to a question, stated that Australia's share of the wool realization profits was £34,000,000. sum has never been included in our export figures. That amount is over and above the flat rate of the export balance of our wool crop. Further proof is not necessary to show that our bright and airy methods of borrowing abroad, and the professed inability of our present, banking system to meet the exigencies of our international trade settlements, other than by the importation of goods, will, if persisted in, ultimately bring about our economic downfall, or will make us the bond-slaves of our creditors abroad. Owing to the present banking system in. Australia, excess credits abroad now place a .premium, through the incidence of exchange, upon the importation of goods into Australia, and automatically levy an exchange toll upon the whole of our exports. British exchanges to-day clearly indicate that the excess of Australian credits abroad has not only had the effect of forcing more imported goods on to the market here, but has enabled importers to land every £100 worth of goods nearly 3 per cent, cheaper than they otherwise could, while on the other hand, the exporter has had to take nearly 3 per cent, less than London parity for his products. One writer recently summed up the position in these words: Because Governments must get moneys from London for public works, and because investors desire to alter the location of their securities, primairy producers get les""s for their produce, and the buyer of imported goods obtains some concession on his purchases. Apart from statistical import and export figures, for some time large excess credits belonging to Australia have been owned in London. These excess credits are probably now mostly owned by the banks operating here. They have been built up by borrowing in London and by the excess prices obtained for our wool over export parity, together with Bawra operations. The flood of imports we have received during this last year or two is the only direct result of our good fortune. No attempt has been made through any banking organization to protect the These have true interests of Australia in this matter, because the British banking system, which the British manufacturers have built up, has provided tremendous monopolistic power. As I see it, the British banking system has been framed, designed, and carried out for decades in So far as I know, this order to swell British exports, to sell British manufactured goods, .and to facilitate the importation into Britain of raw materials. The shareholders or owners of these banks are wedded to British manufacturing supremacy; their whole interest lies in this direction. Consequently, the policy of the British banks-whicli . is largely in the hands of manufacturing and trading interests-is designed and carried out in order to continue and perpetuate this system. This policy has also been partially grafted upon Australia by the British registered banks operating here, and, iu my opinion, the Australian registered banks have found themselves compelled to follow suit, in order to protect their interests, trade, and customers. The only means we have of settling our interest bill abroad and of squaring the ledger is with the excess of exports over imports, and, as I have shown that we have not done this, the present position of Australian exchange is absolutely opposed to economic laws. The exchange. is against the exporter and in favour of the importer, although we are running further into debt, and the figures seem. to show that on the average we have not even been liquidating our yearly interest bill abroad. If a man goes to the banks here and wants an overdraft, it is much easier to get a substantial advance against the importation of goods from abroad into this country than one for the purpose of the development of the country by primary or secondary industry. We seem to be vainly kicking against the pricks. I again submit for the most careful consideration of the Treasurer that his urgent duty is not to allow such a state of affairs to continue. I am surprised that he has hitherto failed to tackle Australia's most urgent problem. With regard to the point that we cannot get any foreign credit balances to Australia, except in the form of goodsbecause Australia's banking system is an appendage to that of BritainI desire to draw the attention of the House to au illustration of my point. As most honourable members know, I am interested, and have been for many years past, in the development of Australian tin-mining enterprise in Malaya. I know that the whole of Australia's trade with Java and the East, as well as Indian and all other Asiatic trade, has to be adjusted in London. There are no direct banking facilities between Australia and foreign ports only 500 miles north of our coasts. Bills of exchange, bank drafts, and remittances of all sorts have to he cleared through London. there is a startling and vivid illustration of this fact within my own personal knowledge which I think I should give the House. These Australian tin-mining companies, after purchasing dredges in Australia with Australian credit or capital-the terms are synonymous-aud getting to work, say, in the Federated Malay States, naturally, if they are well run, accumulate profits there from time to time. These profits are owned by the shareholders, who are partly Australian, and can be made available to them only by the following method:-The mulated in Penang or Singapore is transferred to London at a banking charge, which is, comparatively speaking, small, owing to the stability of the Straits dollar currency. That credit in London is absorbed by some Australian bank or importer with a London office, and is available in Australia to the shareholders in the profit-making tin companies at the current rate of exchange, which, to-day, would make £100 in London worth £97 here. every £100 worth of credit created in the Malay States the Australian holders, owing to the exigencies of exchange, receive £97. But even this depreciated credit must ultimately be settled The problem of German reparations by importing goods, because if the tin companies could not sell their drafts to Australian banks in London for the purpose of importing goods, or to London Mr Pratten. oflices of Australian importers, the profi!s made by Australian capital on tin mining enterprise in Malaya could, under present banking conditions, be returned to shareholders only in the form of goods. Therefore, every £1 made by Australians iu tin mining in Malaya swells the volume of imports into Australia to a corresponding extent, and profits made there compel surplus imports into Australia from London. Whatever export or import trade may be done with the developing East, and whatever profits may be due to Australian enterprise abroad, whether in Europe, Asia, Africa, or America, owing to the grafting of the British banking system upon Australia, a toll is levied upon Australian production and a bonus is given on goods sent here, even from countries not a thousand miles from our shores. The editor of At the present time the Australian Investment Digest truly saidPerhaps none of the post-war conditions that are engaging the attention of the world today is so important or so little understood as international finance. There is such a mass of literature that the average business man lacks the time, and very frequently the inclination, to study the subject. It is, however, as interesting as it is complex. Many of my critics seem to lose sight of the fact that Australia is a debtor nation abroad. They argue academically, some in text-book phrases, that if we do not import we cannot export, and so on, while they lose sight of our enormous indebtedcredit accuness abroad and the yearly interest required to keep us even out of further debt. It is quite obvious that to balance our national ledger there must be a difference in favour of our export trade over our import trade of at least the amount of our interest bill, plus the private spendings and remittances of our peopleabroad. There is one grain of comfort, however, and that is the unanimity that exists among those who have troubled to study the subject, in the appreciation For of the fact that the further pledging of Australia's credit abroad, and all favorshareable trade balances, are adjusted and returned to' us under present banking methods by goods, and by goods alone. shows clearly and conclusively that such is the case with that question. Unfortunately some economists, ostrichlike, have failed entirely to read the lessons of tlie war, but if we f a i l to leu ni these lessons, and do not see how wo can benefit by applying them, we deserve to continue, as we are to-day, at the mercy of international financiers. This excess of imports, if continued, will cause serious trouble to us. ii'nancial storekeeper can appear prosperous, and even feel so, so long as he can set plenty of credit. Stop this and his position is very much worse than if he had had no kindly lender and had been compelled to live on his means, and balance at least expenditure and receipts. There are many kindly lenders in Britain to-day who know that whatever further credit we pledge with them must be taken but in their goods. We must have a favorable balance of trade, even to keep out of further debt. ""Fortunately, we have theproducts to sell. Surely, also, the reverse position appertains, and if we do not, or cannot, sell more, we must buy less. pire, but we ought to do much less purchasing abroad than we are now doing. There is a "" nigger in the wood pile "" somewhere, and I believe that we see what he is like. with Australia's present economic position deserve no better appellation than the "" Sairey Gamps"" of the nation's childhood. reading the many and varied press comments that have been made recently in connection with the problem under review. ney Morning Herald recently saidThat we should find our wealth held abroad on inconveniences would appear an anomalj', but the anomaly disappears when we discover that the trouble is caused not by our wealth, but by a clashing of the Australian borrowing policy with Australian protective policy. And to quote furtherIf a Government raises a loan in London, there is a transfer of credit from the' English lender to the Government borrower. That credit can be transferred here by means of imports only. . If there were no Government borrowing abroad our imports would very greatly decrease. It would toko all onv exports to pay for interest on our debt abroad and the import of goods which are not produced or manufactured in Australia. In fact, the probabilities urq that we would have to be content with a very much lessened consumption of imported goods which we now consider necessary. If wo stopped borrowing abroad we should have to develop our country more wholly by local capital. would it be more profitable to do it. . . . To borrow abroad and develop with constructive material made locally is lunacy. . . . Here, then, we have the clashing of policies in Australia.

The last method, I am glad to say, has been approved by that responsible, careful, and sagacious journal, the our banking arrangements, Argus. We have not yet thoroughly credits examined the possibility of making our production of gold help towards the and not allow international solution of the present difficulty. I do not desire to criticize the private banking jjosition in Australia, but, if cautious, private bankers can do nothing towards helping the solution of our urgent welcome economic problems, they must be rebanking minded that banking liabilities in Australia increased during the ten But I am afraid it years ending December, 1923, from £168,000,000 to £312,000,000, and that expenditure their liabilities at call, not bearing Empire interest, increased from £71,500,000' tj6 to hope to salvage much, if £126,500,000; but the gold, bullion, and Australian notes held against these liabilities at call only increased from £41,000,000 to £50,000,000 in the period under review. Most of the proceeds of our note issue have been lent to the States, and we have their security, as well as the security of the Commonwealth, and also nearly 50 per cent, of gold behind that issue, but the banks in December last held £3,000,000 less in notes than they did seven years ago, while the public held £11,000,000 more. banking business has nearly doubled during the period, and surely there is some strong, sound, substantial reason for securing more elasticity in our currency here, particularly as regards the position of oiucredits in London. methods for the solution of our troubles have never yet been fully explored from the Australian stand-point. Economic Conference in Loudon arrived at a milk-and-water conclusion that the time was not opportune, or something of that sort. The problem, however, will have to be faced by the Treasurer in no uncertain way. It transcends all other problems. parsnips,"" and to his national plan for Australian development-whateve r may be-mus t be added, in order to give f u l l effect to any national policy that we may decide to carry oxit, an Australian national economic policy that will not abrogate our national policy of Protecti o n ; will not place a premium upon imported goods we do not want: will not force upon us importations that strangle our secondary industries; but will allow us to keep our international ledger square while attending to our own affairs here, in our own way, by our own people, with the surplus of their own wealth created by their own work, industry, and natural advantages. The present economic position places Australia under the tutelage of British financiers, who, amongst other things, are taxing the primary producer more heavily in exchange than ever he was taxed through t h e ' Tariff. mathematical result of this position must trend towards the sterilization of Australian development. In my opinion, all the evidence is thatBritish Free Trade finance is being used to break down Australian Tariff Protection. I have tried to tell what, in my opinion, the position is. Now comes the question what steps, should the Government take, and by what principles should they be guided in bringing amended banking legislation into this Chamber. It will not be enough, in connection w i th our Commonwealth Banking Act, to ' merely change from the one-man control now existing to a Board or Commission.

The honourable member for Martin",40,Australia S Economic Problems
112,That Dr. Earle Page (Cowper,"Treamade two suggestions with which I propose to deal now. The first concerns the control of public borrowing. This Government has already taken a definite, step to control public borrowing, at least in some degree, for last year provision was made for the establishment of a statutory sinking f u n d . borrowing contracts will contain specific provision for contributions to a sinking fund . check upon Treasurers, for it will mean that a definite sum will have to be taken from revenue each year and ear-marked for sinking fund purposes. members will recollect that when I presented the Budget last year, I stated that the publio debt of the Commonwealth had been reduced during the year by £5,000,000. I hope that when I present the Budget this year I shall be able to indicate that, in addition to providing certain moneys for the sinking fund , a portion of the revenue will also be used for debt reduction. The Government have attempted also to secure some co1 ordination between the Federal and State authorities in borrowing. fix a borrowing limit which should not be exceeded. In 1920-21, the total borrowing of che Commonwealth and States amounted to £47,000,000; in 1921-22. the figure was £38,000,000; in 1922-23. it was £36,000,000; and for 1923-24, it was proposed to borrow £48,000,000. I suggested that the Treasurers of the various State Governments should reduce their figures. I pointed out that if we maintained the. borrowing rate of the last few years, we should be borrowing at the rate of £320 per head. mentioned by the honourable the Treasurer new money? that, if the borrowing policy were not cut should, at least, be reduced to such an eixtent that the total debt per head of the people should not exceed the present figure of £160 per head. would have meant borrowing £20,000,000 £48,000,000. The Treasurers could not agree to my proposition. Federal Loan Council, which is composed of the Federal Treasurer and the Treasurers of the various State Governments, met in January of this year, I found that each State Treasurer had large commitments. t u r n that they had made a good fight with their respective fellow Ministers to keep the Estimates down. I imagine that it is not miusual for a Treasurer to do that. The Treasurers informed me that it was impossible for them suddenly to cut their loan policy in half. To do so In future, all would have meant the immediate dislocation of practically all the public works in progress in Australia. It would also have That will place an automatic meant that the completion of large public works which were expected to be reproductive in the near future would have been delayed, and that instead of them Honourable providing revenue, extra, expense would be incurred because of the money already spent on them continuing to lie idle. The Conference agreed, however, that borrowing should be reduced. We tried to determine the total amount that could be borrowed this year without unduly interfering with private enterprise, but that was not possible. For the first time i u the history of Australia it was decided that the rate of interest to be offered for money by various Governments should be uniform . The Honourable memWe tried to ber for Martin stated that the Ta'te of interest paid by the Commonwealth Government for the War Gratuities Conversion Loan would probably fix for some time the rate of interest to be paid on money borrowed for public works. I point out to him that the interest rate was fixed, not by the Commonwealth Government, but by the condition of the money market. It will be remembered that last year the first Commonwealth conversion loan was offered for 25 years at £ 5 Is. 9d. per cent., aud the second at £ 5 9s. per cent, for five years. After that loan had been floated the variamounts ous State Governments of Australia began an active competition against each other to secure the balance of money available I urged in the Australian market. Tho rate then was 5$ per cent., subject to Commondown as far as I wished, it wealth tax, which is considered to be equivalent to \ per cent. One Government came forward and offered 5J per cent., tax free. Another Government That then offered 5$ per cent., tax free. Last only December s(till another Government this year instead of offered 6 per cent., tax free, and found it very difficult to obtain When the money even at that rate. The Commonwealth Government rate for the last loan was 6 per cent., subject toCommonwealth tax, which is less than w&s paid by one of the State .Governments in December last, because our loan was They told me confidentially in subject to taxation. The rate whioh we",42,Australia S Economic Problems

The Commonwealth Government has also tried to secure the appointment of one borrowing agency for all the Governments of Australia. authorities did not agree to this proposal,, but some progress was made, for it has been arranged now, that instead of having seven different authorities borrowing money, only five authorities shall go on the market. the Governments of ""Western Australia and Queensland, for they were able to state their commitments definitely, and to agree to the Commonwealth Government raising them. part of the year, a lesser number of borrowing authorities were competing in the market. the year we secured another measure of reform, for the various Governments agreed that no two of them should go on the market at the same time. While the Commonwealth Government was tryin g to secure the conversion of the War Gratuity Loan, it had an absolutely free hand. That was very different from the situation that prevailed when the previous loan was floated. Time will not permit me to deal with the other points which I had in mind, but I suggest to honourable members that an ounce of practice is worth a ton of theory. experience of the United States cf America, which is a highly Protectionist country, shows the necessity of obtaining outside capital for developmental purposes. sented to ithe British.

I ask leave to continue my remarks. Leave granted; debate adjourned. Sitting for Works and Railways) [8.0] I move That, in accordance with the provisions of the Commonwealth Public Works Committee Act 1913-1921, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work :Tbe erection of an additional block to the Seamen's Barracks at Flinders Naval Depot, which was referred to the Parliamentary [29] Standing Committee on Public Works, and on which the Committee has duly reported to this House the result of its investigations. The proposal is to erect on the southern side of the existing barracks building at The State the Flinders Naval Base Depot a third block capable of accommodating 300 men. This i-xtra space is required to eliminate the overcrowding now complained of, and to maintain the standard of training for 1,000 men, as laid down This was made possible by for the Flinders Naval Depot. The proposed building is to be a brick structure of three stories, harmonizing in design with the existing barracks buildings. In addition, there will be latrine and lavaThus in the latter tory blocks of brick, also a dining block and petty officers' dining room of similar construction. The estimated cost of the In the early part of work is £33,000. is true that the question of undertaking this work has been submitted to the Public Works Committee, which has submitted a favorable report, but I do not know if this House is justified in agreeing to the motion without giving it very careful consideration. The proposed building is to provide additional accommodation at the Flinders Naval Depot, and the question naturally arises why should we duplicate our training depots. If this were the only trainThe ing centre in the Commonwealth, the proposal is one which we could probably support; but we have at least four such establishments in the Commonwealth. I have a copy of a report preWe could in all probability do with fewer, and if the number were reduced the efficiency would possibly be greater. A t present, we have the Military College at I Duntroon, the Naval College at Jervis Bay, a training depot at Flinders, and an aviation school at Point Cook. It is well known that considerable economy could be effected if the work done at Duntroon and the Naval College were suspended from 6.27 to 8 p.m. conducted at the one establishment. A t the moment, I am unable to say to what extent the work at the Flinders Naval Base and Point Cook could be amalgamated, but there should he some in quiry as to why it is necessary to have four different training depots, as pointed out in the Committee's report. TheM in ister, in submitting the motion, should have explained whether the trainees to be accommodated in the proposed building could be trained at any of the other bases, as there may be more than sufficient",43,Australia S Economic Problems

If we have a structure capable of accommodating the whole of the trainees, although they may be in different branches of the service, could not each particular section be trained under expert officers in a separate portion of the building? The head of every branch of the Defence Department thinks that his particular section is the most important, and that is causing unnecessary expenditure.

It is useless to urge in support of additional It is only fair to say buildings that another structure is necessary, because those to be accommodated are in a different branch of the T h a t may be so, Defence Department. Why should they not all be instructed and trained in the one building ? The honourable member for, M a r t in ( Mr Pratten) showed us very clearly this afternoon the direction in which we are d r if t in g , and notwithstanding this, we are still authorizing expenditure which in very many instances could be avoided. It is possible that before very long some of the buildings which have recently been 'erected w ill not be f u l l y 'occupied, and we should make some inquiries in order to ascertain where savings can be effected.

I therefore move That all the words after "" That"" be struck out with a view to inserting the following :"" the motion before the House remain in abeyance until such time as the Public Accounts Committee reports on the Jervis Bay Naval College."" for Defence) [8.25] -The motion before the House relates to the provision of additional accommodation for the men at Flinders Naval Depot. A t the present time the Flinders establishment is carrying more than its regular complement of men. They are crowded in the dormitories, and with additional men coming in the congestion will become even more serious. The only purpose of the extension of the existing buildings is to provide the proper accommodation to which the men are entitled. is the Minister referring? is absolutely The number of men in the schools varies according to the size of the classes taking special courses in torpedo, wireless, gunnery, and other special subjects. Flinders, whatever its disabilities may be, is ithe establishment provided for this purpose by Parliament, and already more than £1,000,000 has been expended there. The suggestion that the men at Flinders might be transferred to Jervis Bay is impracticable, because the instruction given at the two places is altogether different.

It would be impossible to transfer a dozen or 50 men from Flinders to Jervis Bay for instruction without transferring the Flinders instructors also. ging the Minister.. ber sometimes attempts unsuccessfully to do that, and he also makes statements that cannot be verified. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton) has suggested that the Aviation School at Point Cook should be transferred to Flinders. If that were done the special instructors at Point Cook also would have to be transferred. The aerodrome would not be nearly as satisfactory at Flinders as it is at Point Cook. It would be located a good deal further from a town than it now is, and, generally speaking, there would be nothing to gain by removing the establishment to Flinders. The necessary buildings and other accommodation have already been provided at Point Cook, and there would be no justification for the expenditure that would be involved in reestablishing it elsewhere. The amalgamation of the Duntroon and Jervis Bay Colleges was carefully considered by me at the beginning of last year, and I was satisfied that there would be no economy in adopting that idea. A t Duntroon we are training boys for a militar y life , and the Jervis Bay students are to become sailors. The lads enter the latter in stitution in their thirteenth year, and remain unti l their seventeenth while at Duntroon the ages range from seventeen years to twenty-one years. Tlie trend of educational development '.throughout the world is to separate the younger boys from the older ones, and, if possible, to place them in different in stitutions. This feature is to be noted in every college of importance in Australia. The Duntroon boy starts his training at the age at which the Jervis Bay lad completes his course. finished the course at Jervis Bay can enter any of the universities of. Australia, except the University of Sydney, and w ill be recognized as having matriculated, while Duntroon students, on completing the course there, can go into any of the universities as third-year students for an engineering degree. An amalgamation of the two colleges would f a i l to effect economy, and would prejudicially influence the training of the students. It should be realized that the Flinders Depot is already firmly established. penditure of £1,000,000, and it is the recognized naval training establishment. Accommodation is already provided for the officers, and it is surprising to me to find that the honourable member for Dalley( Mr Mahony), to whom I looked for support on this motion, objects to provision for the necessary accommodation for the naval ratings. He is usually anxious concerning the welfare of the men. I have given further consideration to the amendment submitted by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton). In J u l y of last yearj during the currency of the present session, I was called upon to rule on a proposal of this kind, in connection with a motion to give effect to a recommendation of the Public Works Committee, with regard to the construction of portion of the North-South Railway. The honourable member for Adelaide( Mr Yates) then submitted an amendment, which, after due consideration, I was obliged to rule out of order. I have since consulted that ruling and the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act, aud I feel that I have no option on this occasion but to adopt a similar course w it h respect to the present amendment. If honourable members year, will consult the Commonwealth Public Works Committee Act 1913, section 15, and they will realize that, in the absence of any standing order governing our procedure in these cases, that Act is the only guide we have to follow, they w ill see the course laid down. In the first place, the proposed work is to be referred to the Committee for report; secondly, there is the report to the House; and, in the thir d place, A youth who has there is the action which the law requires the Minister to take on the report of the Committee.

Therefore, the Act, in the absence of precedent or a definite standing order on the matter, leaves three courses open to the House-to affirm the expediency of carrying out the proposed work; to declare that it is inexpedient to carry it out; or to refer it back to the Committee for further consideration and report. The amendment provides for the adoption of none of these courses, but seeks, by a proposition which it is hoped will find acceptance by the House, to put aside the proposal of the Minister, and to allow it to remain in abeyance unti l another eventuality occurs. Opposition move that the matter be referred back to the Committee 1 ber may not si omit two amendments, 1 but, as I explained in July last, it is competent for any honourable member, other than the movers of the motion and the amendment, to propose the adoption of one of the alternatives provided for in the Act. adjournment of the debate ? I am now discussing the proposed amendment of the Leader of the Opposition, and I rule it out of order. I move That all the words after the word '-That"" be left out with a view to insert the following :"" the report of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, regarding Flinders Naval D6p6t, of 1024 be referred back for further consideration, so that the matter may be considered in conjunction with the results of an investigation now being conducted by the Public Accounts Committee in regard to the Jervis Bay Naval College."" If we adopt the course I suggest, the Public Accounts Committee will, in the meantime, have completed its labours, and the House will have the benefit of the two reports. The Minister( Mr Bowden) will lose nothing by accepting my amendment. I have had the pleasure of seeing the Flinders Naval Base on several occasions. I was chairman of the Public Works Committee for three years, and in that capacity I saw a good deal in connection with in the Commonwealth where public money has been wasted, it is Flinders.

I wish to tell him that I would not at any time cast a gibe at any one without, knowing the f u l l facts of the case. I would suggest to the honourable member, although he is much older than I order. Is the honourable member for Bass raising a point of order or making a personal explanation, or do his remarks represent, as appears to me, a little gratuitous self-advertisement? -The honourable member must be aware that three questions put to the Speaker do not necessarily involve a pointof order. I was waiting to see the application of the remarks of the honourable member for Bass. So far I have assumed them to be relevant, and in answer to remarks made by the last speaker. would not, without knowing all the facts, say anything to any man who, perhaps, had sons who failed to enlist, though more eligible than I was for enlistment. For the satisfaction of honourable members, and in order that I may not have to submit to similar gibes in future, I may mention that I did offer to enlist, and was rejected. I shall say no more on that matter. W it h regard to the proposal before the House, I direct the attention of ton) and the last speaker to the fact that two of the three representatives of the Labour party on the Public Works Committee voted in favour of the proposal. The fact is that there are more men at the Flinders Naval Base than there is reasonable accommodation for. the honourable member for Cockatoo shows such a lamentable ignorance of the subject. a proper parliamentary remark. There is no member for Cockatooi n the House. ference to Cockatoo. The members of the Labour party claim to be the only persons doing anything to help working When the honourable member men. The proposal now before the House is to provide accommodation for some of the lower ratings of the Navy. Captain Sneyd, who is in charge at the Flinders Naval Base, gave this evidence to the Public Works CommitteeSufficient space has not 'been provided in the existing building for reading and writing rooms, particularly for the ratings below those of petty officer, but in the proposed building this defect will toe overcome by providing sufficient space for recreation. The additional space in the proposed building I rise to a point of could he utilized by occupants of the existing buildings. The petty officers have sufficient room for recreation, but from 400 to COO men have only the canteen, the billiard room, and the dormitories in which to do their writing and reading. . That evidence supplies a reason why this proposal should be gone on with. The Leader of the Opposition said that this House should decide what number of men should be employed in the Navy. I do not agree with the honourable gentleman. This Parliament should define its policy, and should take the advice of competent advisers as to how best to carry it out. I do not think there are many members of I was saying that I the House who would claim to be naval strategists. A t the present time there are something like 570 men at Flinders Naval Base, in quarters providing accommodation for 501. Honourable members will see that the eighth paragraph of the report of the Public WorksCommittee saysEvidence was tendered that if normal development is to be maintained the number of men to 'be provided for at Flinders is estimated to 'be not less than 1,000, which number is based upon the minimum requirements to maintain the personnel of the naval services at present in existence. That is sufficient to show that the proposed additional buildings at Flinders Naval Base are necessary. think it is a pity that the Standing Orders do not permit us to consider the I am very sorry that amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition.

165,. Mr West (East Sydney) [ 8 . 5 9 ],"IOrders do not deal w i th this matter. Mr CH -uu/rojr -It is governed by the Public Works Committee Act. that Act certainly made a mistake. I do not think the members of the Public Works Committee would be very greatly put out if this were referred back to them, because in that report they make reference to the very matters to which the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton) has drawn attention. The report statesDisregarding the policy which led to the esI am doing nothing of the kind. It must tablishment of Flinders as a naval sub-base, and the later decision apparently arrived at to abandon that idea and to retain the establishment as a naval training depot-bot h of which were outside the scope of the Committee's inquiry-thi s proposal was approached purely from the point of view of further accommodation being required for the personnel at this training depot. Flinders is not an ideal place for a naval depot. It is very expensive to train troops there. It is isolated, far removed from the centre of shipping, and there is not a sufficient depth of water to enable ships to come in and go out when necessary. I have visited the place on two or three occasions. When I was last there all the vessels were lying on tbe mud. That is not a good thing for any vessel. Another paragraph in the report statesMr Blakeley moved as an amendmentThat the Committee is of opinion that the defence establishments at Flinders Naval Base, Jervis Bay, Duntroon, and Point Cook should be investigated, with a view to the efficient and economic coordination of these sections of the Defence and expenditure. Force of Australia, and that for the time being the proposal to extend the barrack accommodation at Flinders Naval Depdt be postponed. If honourable members were well acquainted with the cost not a member would decline to refer this back for further consideration. It would make some honourable members nervous if they knew what we are spending there. not getting the results we should obtain from that expenditure. The regulations governing the conduct of some of thes3 institutions are opposed to what I consider to be the correct thing. told that because a certain practice has been followed by the Navy for centuries we must necessarily abide by it . I am not endeavouring to lessen the value of the Navy, and have never expressed sentiments of that nature, but as a representative of the people I have a right to The Standing see that we get adequate service for the money that is expended, and if the expenditure is not justified by the results I feel bound to state what I consider would be a better course to pursue. Jervis B^"""" no doubt, is an ideal spot. If honourable members of this House could go down there for a fortnight every year while the fine weather lasted they would thoroughly enjoy themselves and improve their health. Those who chose it evidently possessed judgment. It may Le thought that I am trying to defeat t l w object of the Defence Forcei n Australia. be remembered, however, that it costs the Government £1,325 a year to maintain and train a cadet aged thirteen or fourteen years in the Jervis Bay College. That is pretty stiff. Every teaching establishment in Australia is jealous f the College, and one cannot wonder that that is so. I think that if the age were increased and the boy were given further primary education the cost might be materially reduced and accommodation could be found for th.> lower ratings. Jervis Bay College was built to accommodate 160 cadets, and it has only 41. I believe I am justified in asking the House to allow this matter to stand over. Onoe these buildings are erected they caunot be pulled down, and Flinders is such an out-of-the-way place that it would not be possible to use them for other purposes. We cannot proceed along the lines* followed 25 years ago to make up a deficiency between revenue I remember that in New South Wales, when revenue was short, the Government would sell 200,000 acre3 of Crown land at £ 1 per acre, and place the proceeds to revenue account. If that did not balance the accounts they would place a duty of 2s. a gallon on whisky. Such methods are not possible to-day. Tbe amount which -we can afford to set aside for defence is We are limited. I hope the House will take the same view as I do. I feel confident that in another week or two we will have a report from the Committee, and be able to discuss the matter with all the We are facts before us. not know what object would be gained if this matter were referred back to the Public Works Committee.

Honourable members are aware that I have been a member of the Public Works Committee for a very long time, and have had a good deal of experience on it . In defence work we have the Naval Department, the Defence Department, and the Aviation Department, carrying out very big schemes, involving the expenditure of enormous sums of money. Each is working as a separate Department. I suggest that it would be advisable to have the whole of this work under the control of an expert Board subject to the The question at Minister.

It is quite true that we are taking evidence concerning the two institutions mentioned, but the investigation has no bearing at all upon this proposal to erect additional buildings at the Flinders Naval Depot. would.

The lads there are undergoing special training to prepare them for certain positions in the Australian Navy, while the naval ratings at the Flinders Depot are being trained for other positions in the Navy. undergo that course of training under the same instructors? from the Flinders depot to Jervis Bay, it would be necessary to duplicate the instructional staff there, for the training of the lower ratings. No economy would be effected at all. A t the Flinders depot there is a staff for the training of 500 ratings. I want members clearly to understand that nothing will be gained by waiting for the report of the Public AccountsCommittee on the Jervis Bay Naval College. decided to-night is whether sufficient accommodation is to be provided for the naval ratings at the depot. The evidence attached to the report shows that, at the present time, it is below strength. Captain Sneyd, who is in charge of the training of the ratings there, has stated that, if we are to maintain the Australian Navy on an efficient basis, we should have at least 1,000 men in training. There is accommodation for 500, and at present there are 598 at the depot. The accommodation, therefore, is quite inadequate. Unlessi t is extended, further appointments cannot be made. More men should be entering the depot for training to take the places of men who leave the ships on the completion of their time. What we do to-night will probably affect the efficiency of the Australian Navyi n two, three, or four years' time. If , by postponing consideration of this motion, we delay this urgent work, much valuable The fact that the time will be lost. I hope that no honourable member will vote against the motion in the belief that the report of the Public Accounts Committee on the Jervis Bay Naval College will clarify the position. This proposal must be judged on its merits. quite agree with the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton) that it is not reasonable to expect honourable members to digest at such short notice the evidence It is well known that attached to the report of the Public Works Committee. The proposal involves the expenditure of £30,000. It is advisable, therefore, that honourable members should have an opportunity of studying the evidence. I agree with the Leader of the Opposition on this point, but I disagree with his suggestion that consideration of the motion should be postponed. We have to look at the facts and, if possible, find out where we stand. It is a pity that the admiral who recommended that Flinders should be a subI f 120 men were sent naval base did not, on the way down, slip on a piece of orange-peel or a bananaskin, because Flinders is the last place in Australia for such a purpose. I understand that the high official who made the recommendation that committed this country to heavy expenditure there saw Flinders at high water. It is very fine at high water, but quite a different place at low tide. Y o u cannot float a vessel up to the wharf at low water. Just fancy The question to be 1,000 bluejackets being deposited at a place where the ships could not enter!

They cannot enter the depot at all. As a training establishment, however, I consider it entirely suitable, and one which ought to be maintained even at considerable expense. Further on in his evidence he saysWe must train our own men, and this is the only place available for the purpose. To interfere with its natural growth, supposing naval service is to extend, would be suicidal. As the service increases, so must the training opportunities be extended. The extensions proposed are not necessitated by an increased service, but are merely to meet the requirements of the present complement as provided for by .the current Estimates. As the honourable member for Oxley( Mr Bayley) has pointed out, there are 598 men at the depot, and accommodation for only 500. W it h the two new cruisers, which I hope will be built, we shall require extra complement. These men must be trained somewhere. Captain Sneyd says that the depot is an excellent training establishment, and I submit that, as so much money has been expended there already, we must go on. The Chairman of the Publio Works Committee ( Mr Gregory), in presenting the report, statesAfter carefully considering all the evidence laid before it, the Committee is of opinion that to eliminate the overcrowding now complained of and to meet future normal development of the depot, further accommodation is required, and recommends that the erection of the building proposed be proceeded with. In Opposition to withdraw their amendment. Very great harm will be done to the men of the lower deck if the additional accommodation is not provided. All the evidence I have been able to read to-night clearly points out that the men have no place in which to read or write. There are 70 men in excess of the space available, and therefore the extra building recommended by the Public Works Committee, after an exhaustive investigation, shculd be provided. The amendment that the proposal be referred back to the Public Works Committee for furthe r consideration would serve no real purpose, and I shall, therefore, vote against it . I agree with the remarks of the honorCaptain Sneyd, able member for Swan( Mr Gregory) respecting thfexcessive cost of the Flinders Naval Base and the inefficient method of carrying out the work, but it must be remembered that the Labour Government, from 1910 to 1913, and the Cook-Irvine Government, from 1913 to 1914, were both responsible for its construction. Unfortunately, as has happened in many cases where new works have been established, an absolutely unqualified person was appointed to carry out this work. I wish to give the honourable member, for Swan the credit that is due to him. When the Public Works Committee visited Flinders Base, the honourable .member was the first to draw attention to the unbusiness-like method adopted in constructing the wharf. Members of the Federal Parliament represent not only their particular constituencies and States, but the whole of the Commonwealth. It is not right for an honourable member to libel any portion of Australia, more especially its ports; The leading admirals and other qualified experts contend that Westernport is one of the finest ports in the British Empire. 100 feet out from the shore, a depth of water of 40 feet would be obtained. ber is speaking of Hann's Inlet.

Sir Maurice FitzMaurice stated in his reportI have, after roughly estimating tlie works at each place, come to the conclusion that Hann's Inlet has been wisely chosen as the cheapest site for a naval base in Port Western, assuming that it is used for destroyers and submarines only.

TheB ill makes no provision for ' this Parliament to be consulted. The very fact that the Minister whom tbe. Board must consult will not be in this House will debar honourable members in this Chamber from questioning him about matters connected with Canberra. If the administration of the Federal Capital territory is to be under a Minister a t all, that Minister should be in this Chamber, as it is this House which is supposed to have charge of the purse strings. I doubt very much whether we shall be given an opportunity to deal with matters pertaining to Canberrai n any circumstances, although the Minister said last night that many of the provisions of the Bil l would necessitate this House being consulted from time to time. If appointed, the Commission w ill have powers as great as those of the Melbourne City Council. TheB ill requires that they shall report quarterly, but such reports w ill be made to the Minister, and not to this House. The Commission's annual report has also to be furnished to the Minister, and although the B ill provides for it to be placed before honourable members, that may not be done u n t i l the report is a year or more old. We all know of annual reports which have been presented to Parliament months after the close of the financial year; the same thing might occur in this case. Sir quires that the report shall be presented to Parliament within 30 days of the receipt of it hy the Minister. not be in session when the report is received. The Commission may alter the plans of the city. Worki n accordance w it h the altered plan may be in progress for six months before this House has an opportunity to disallow the modification or variation which has been made. What would be the use of disallowing an alteration after so long a period had elapsed? idle to say that this House would have control. Throughout the B ill the word "" Minister"" occurs. There is to be no obligation on his part to bring these matters before Parliament, so that the adI f the proministration w ill rest entirely w i th the Commission. do with the definition clause? definition clause to pass, we tacitly agree to the appointment of a Commission. on the clause referring to the appointment of a Commission. whatever procedure we consider necessary or desirable. If the honourable member desires to raise a point of order, he may do so. The definition clause states that "" Commissioner "" means a member of the' Commission,and that "" Commission"" means the Commission under this Act. As we on this side are against the appointment of a Commission, we desire to register our protest now, and not allow the matter to reach a later stage. It would save time if the question were settled now. As this matter was f u l l y discussed on the second reading, I do not desire to reiterate the arguments then put forward, except to say that the work at Canberra is now proceeding satisfactorily. That is admitted, even by members in favour of the appointment of a Commission. If that state of affairs exists while the work is under the jurisdiction of this House, why should we appoint a Commission at additional cost ? The salaries of three Commissioners would total £7,000 per annum. That amount, although considerable, includes no provision for any addipointed, it would not then be a question of three men only, as it would gather around it a big staff, and add to the Parliament may cost of Canberra by probably £20,000 or £30,000, instead of £7,000 a year.

I did not deal, with all the powers proposed to be vested in the Commission, of which we, as yet, know nothing, except that which we can gain from conjecture. Commissioners w ill be capable of doing the job. we can find men capable of doing it , just as the electors have found a man capable of acting as Minister for Works and Railways. The Minister is doing the job very well, and members on both sides of the House appear to be satisfied. TheB ill is an attempt to shelve the responsibility of Parliament for the continuation of the Capital. It will remove that responsibility to the shoulders of an outside body. That is the kernel of the B ill . Whether an honourable member will be able to bring before the Commission a question relating to the rates levied on the humpy he will never occupy is beside the question. Most honourable members will live in Sydney. As Canberra develops, there will probably have to be a city council and many administrative bodies. It will be many years before we need incur the expense of appointing a Commission. It will be many years before anything more than a dis.trict council will be needed. My opposition to the B ill is expressed in the few remarks I those I made previously. the Minister was talking with his tongue in his cheek. well what the crux of the position is. I am informed, and possibly it can be verified, that before he became Minister for Works and Railways, he made a speech embodying the same ideas in regard to Canberra that I have. Possibly, if he had not been a member of the Composite Government, and if he had not been engaged in an attempt to get M in isters out of their troubles, he would have been heard making a similar speech from the cross benches to-day, and, so to speak, throwing bricks at Canberra, where there is now an over supply of bricks. berra to make us proud of it in the belief that we can set up a city to the glorification of Unified Australia.

The majority of them w ill be public servants who w ill raise a big row about the salaries they are to be paid up there, as compared w i th what they are now drawing in Melbourne or Sydney. Thus additional cost w ill be imposed on the taxpayers. The real object of this B ill is to meet the troubles that w ill arise when we meet at Canberrai n 1926. We are not honest to the general community when we conceal the facts. The idea of having a big city would be all right if it had arisen out of a general Federal spirit to create a capital instead of out of the petty spite of some people of Sydney, who demanded the building of the Capital in. New South Wales as the price of accepting Federation. Perhaps then we should have something worthy of the great continent we are supposed to govern. But we are not getting it now. My opposition to the B ill is based on the fact that am now making, and it is merely shifting the responsibility I think from the Minister to a Commission, and involving us in an additional expense, the He knows f u l l details of which I need not repeat, more than to say that the salaries to be paid to the Commissioners by no means, represent the whole of the expenditure involved in appointing a Commission. There is no side-stepping the issue.

My only concern now is to know what his attitude is likely to be during the Committee stage of the Bill.

A guid conceit of ourselves is a Scotch phrase, and I commend it to the honourable member for Fawkner( Mr Maxwell), a distinguished sentative of his race. The honourable member for Oxley recommended that the administration of the Federal Capital Territory should be handed over to three Commissioners, and said that the main reason for doing so was that we as a Parliament, with the honourable and distinguished gentlemen who are now members of the Cabinet, would be making roads and bridges in the Territory for ourselves. the harsh language which the honourable member evidently meant, he said that there would he at Canberra a venal and corrupt Parliament and a Government that could not be trusted to administer the Territory honestly in the interests of the whole people of Australia. The honourable member for Barker, as the most glowing testimonial he could give to himself, said, ""IfI thought for a single moment this Bill was designed to create a position for a member of this Parliament or. for an ex-member of this Parliament, or for any politician, I should be wholeheartedly against it.""

The honourable member for * Kooyong( Mr Latham), in his learned, legal way, said that he would not be favorable to the appointment of an extra parliamentary commission having no Ministerial responsibility if this were a business proposal. Apparently, the management of the Federal Capital is not. a business proposition. When I heard the that honourable member for Kooyong use these words I looked at the honourable member for Forrest( Mr Prowse) to see if he required a stimulant.
