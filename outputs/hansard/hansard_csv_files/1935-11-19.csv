I am quite content to leave my position in this matter rest iu the hands of honourable members. not propose to say much on this matter; indeed, I will not touch at all on the incident which occurred prior to the naming of the honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan), in respect of the conduct of either the honourable member or the Chairman of Committees. However, I emphasize that it is not correct to say that the honourable member for Batman, after apologizing to the Chair, did anything disorderly in committee. In this respect I think the memory of the Chairman of Committees is at fault. I pride myself on having an accurate memory. I was present at that particular time, and I challenge the Chairman of Committees, or any one, to indicate a single sentence which the honourable member for Batman uttered at that stage of the proceedings, that would justly bring down upon his head the charge which has been made. I say nothing whatever regarding the incident that occurred before the honourable member was named. apology was accepted the honourable member for Batman uttered no words beyond those contained in the motion which he moved: ""That the member for Barker be not further heard"". I am prepared to stake my reputation that what I have said is the truth. ter) [3.24] -Lik e most honourable members. I was not aware that this matter was to be raised. A short time before the House met I was given to understand that some question of privilege would be raised, but had no knowledge whatever of its nature. We cannot settle this matter on party lines. It should be considered on its merits. I feel sure, however, that debate at this juncture would not bring out the actual facts, because a number of honourable members now present were, like myself, absent at the time the incident occurred. I suggest that this debate should be adjourned. Such a course would give honourable members more time for reflection and to examine the actual facts associated with this matter, and would not prevent this discussion being continued at a later date. I move That tlie debate be now adjourned. ing orders areSpeaking"" To Order"" or Privilege. 283. Any Member may rise to speak "" to order "", or upon a matter of Privilege suddenly arising.

All questions of Order and matters of Privilege at any time arising shall, until decided, suspend the consideration and decision of every other question. On previous occasions the question has been raised in this House whether a debate on a motion of privilege can be adjourned, and there have been instances where such debates have been adjourned. However, in view of the Standing Orders which I have just read, and which cannot very well be misunderstood, I am of the opinion that leave of the House should be given to submit the motion.

HARRISON -Has the attention of the Minister for Commerce been drawn to statements of the honourable member for Indi( Mr Hutchinson), to the effect that methods of marketing Australian meat in England urgently need to be improved, that it was a depressing experience for him to see Australian meat alongside Argentine meat in the Smithfield market, that some Australian chilled meat was far below the standard quality, and that complaints were received from buyers concerning the variation of quality of Australian mutton and lamb?

The statement which appears in the press is, in my opinion, not correct. I saw Australian mutton unloaded at various ports of England and went to some trouble to inquire into the methods in vogue. On more than one occasion I complimented the shipping authorities upon the manner in which they handled Australian produce upon its arrival in England. whether the Government has specifically considered the allegations in the Auditor-General's report reflecting upon the worthiness of certain people in receipt of invalid and old-age pensions, and whether it, is the intention of the Government -to institute an inquiry of any kind in order to ascertain whether the administration of the Pensions Act, or the act itself, needs overhaul ting to prevent abuses of our pensions system? the report of the Auditor-General in the way of evidence to lead me to believe that any special inquiry is necessary into our pensions system.

The Qantas reserve aircraft at Singapore w i ll be placed at his disposal to aid ground parties or to perform any other special duty on which it would usefully be employed.

But, instead of doing so, he did not rise at all. The Chairman immediately put the proposed amendment, and I was the only member present who supported it. The honourable member for Hunter on concluding his remarks had left the chamber. As there was only one ""Aye"" there was no division, although honourable members on this side desired that the amendment should be divided upon.

Immediately I had finished speaking to the amendment I was called out of the House. It is difficult to escape the conclusion that something was put over the Opposition by the Minister, and it has placed me in an unfortunate position. The honourable member has suggested that the Minister for Defence, who is not even here to reply, "" put something over "" the Opposition. I ask that the honourable member be requested to withdraw those words. Opposition ( Mr Curtin) has told the House the reasons why he objected to the third reading of the bill being taken on the last day of the sitting, and he was in order in his remarks. The honourable member for Hunter( Mr James) has gone much further, and has stated that the Minister who was in amendment was discussed, "" put something over"" the Opposition.

In all probability, the offence or neglect would be sufficient to justify his removal from his position in the State Service.

Although the phrasing might not be particularly plain, it is just as well to retain the provision providing for an alteration of the membership of the board on the recommendation of the board by the action of the Governor General. [4.25)] I supported the amendment when it was previously considered by the committee. It has not altered the intention of the act in any way; nor has the amendment to that amendment, suggested by the Senate, which is merely a verbal one to make the position clearer. The original intention of the measure was to give the processing industry in each State a representative. Thus, the meat-works of Queensland are represented by the chairman of the MeatI n dustry Board; the commissioner controlling the metropolitan moat industry is the representative of the Government of New South Wales; and the general manager of the Wyndham meat-works becomes a member of the board on behalf of the Government of Western Australia. The Senate has not amended that representation. But the circumstances in South Australia are peculiar. The representative provided for in the bill happens to be the general manager of the Government Produce Department. I agree with the reason which actuated the honourable member for Wakefield ( Mr Hawker) in moving his amendment. Mr Pope is an authority with regard to meat-negotiations and is generally recognized by the industry as being an outstanding man in the trade; but the honourable member for Wakefield, foreseeing the apparent danger of a future general manager of the Produce Department knowing nothing about the subject of the export of beef, suggested that, after the retirement of Mr shall bb a member of the board, but Pope, the Metropolitan and Export Abattoirs Board, as in the other States, should have the right to nominate a person to the vacancy. The effect of the Senate's amendment is to make the provision more elastic as regards the choice of a representative after Mr Pope relinquishes the office. The honourable member for Dalley( Mr Rosevear) has raised an interesting matter, which the Senate might have been much better employed in endeavouring to clarify instead of devoting its attention to the amendment of the honourable member for Wakefield, inasmuch as no provision is made for tlie appointment to the board of any person appointed to fill one of the positions mentioned in sub-clause 10, who has been removed from office by the Governor General. The Minister has suggested that the difficulty may be covered by sub-clause 13 of clause 5, which gives the Governor General power to make an appointment when no nomination has been received. Clause6 provides that the board shall be a body corporate with perpetual succession, but it will not have perpetual succession if a member of the Meat Export Control Board does not represent one of the State meat exporting interests. There does not appear to be anything in the bill to ensure that continuity of State representation of meat exporting industries whicli is contemplated in clause 6. think that tlie difficulty can be overcome by amending the clause on similar lines to that suggested in the case of South Australia. been drafted which, I think, will overcome the difficulty mentioned by the honourable member. sertion of a further paragraph c, to readIn the event of any of the foregoing representatives being removed from the board and still retaining their position with any boards or freezing works, those in charge of such boards or freezing works shall have the right to nominate a successor for the remainder of the term. In the case of South Australia, it is provided that tlie person holding a certain position at the commencement of this act, when he ceases to occupy that position another body shall have the power to nominate his successor. South Australia is the only State to have that privilege. The wording of the clause is clear.

The Meat Export Control Board may recommend th© removal from the board of the representative of New South Wales, but the Government of New South Wales may say that it still proposes to retain him as the Metropolitan Meat Industry Commissioner in New South Wales. There would thus be conflict of opinion between the two authorities. If the bill is allowed to pass iu its present form, and provision similar to that made in respect of South Australia is not made in connection with the other States, one State may be entirely disfranchised, because of difference of opinion between the Export Board and the authority employing a particular commissioner. Minister suggested that the position could be overcome by some other person being appointed by the Governor General. But, according to the bill, nobody can represent New South Wales on the Meat Export Control Board who is not the person who for the time being holds the position of Metropolitan Meat Industry Commissioner in New South Wales. No other person would have any more right to sit on the board than I would have, because only specified individuals are to have the right to represent specified State that point. instrumentalities. I do not know whether the amendment proposed to be moved by the Assistant Minister( Mr Thorby) is preferable to mine, but I do not wish a position to arise whereby a representative of a certain State may be removed from the board and there is no power under the act to replace him. Minister for Commerce) [4.38] -As I misread the clause, the explanation which I first gave was inaccurate. The possibility of a. position arising such as that mentioned by the honourable member for Dalley( Mr Rosevear) is very remote, but at the same time it could arise. The member representing the Metropolitan Meat Industry of New South Wales could be removed from the Meat Export Control Board, and there is no provision in the bill, as it is framed at present, to appoint a successor. In order to overcome that difficulty, I propose to move that at the end of para[01] added:A t thu end of paragraph a, "" or in the event of that person ceasing in pursuance of this section to hold office as a member of the board, such person as is appointed by tlie Governor General on the nomination of the Governor in Council of that State"".

Paragraph c, referring to the position in The South Australia, is already provided for. This amendment of the Senate's amendment would overcome the possibility of any doubt arising as to the appointment of successors.

The honourable member for Dalley has suggested that although one of the representatives of Government abattoirs or meat works might be removed from the board by the Governor General, he might still retain his State position and in that event there would be no provision for the nomination of his successor. The amendments which I have foreshadowed will overcome this difficulty. regret that I was unavoidably absent last week when the discussion took place on the second reading of the bill.

Minister for Commerce) If the honourable member for Denison( Mr Mahoney) will look at paragraph a, he will find that there is provision for "" one member in respect of each State to represent the stock producers of the State."" paragraph e there is provision for the appointment of "" one member in respect of each State which exports more than 15,000 tons of meat annually."" I admit, would not include Tasmania, but under paragraph h the Commonwealth will nominate one representative to take care of all Commonwealth interests on the board, and there will also be one member to represent co-operative organizations which export mutton and lamb, as well as one representative of the pig industry, so Tasmanian producers are not without representation. the honourable member for Ballarat( Mr must be reasonable, and recognize that a Fisken) that the bill gives effect to the decision of the Canberra conference that the persons for the time being occupying the positions of managers of State abattoirs or meat works should be members of the board by virtue of their positions and because of the knowledge which they possess of the meat industry generally. The amendments which I have foreshadowed will enable successors to be nominated in the event of any one of the persons mentioned being removed from the board while still retaining his position under a State government. I would point out that the removal of such a person from the board would only follow some offence which would be of such a serious nature as to ensure his removal from his position under the State government, so the contingency mentioned by the honourable member for Dalley( Mr Rosevear) is extremely remote. Only in the event of any one of them being removed, would a successor be nominated by the Government of the State in which the personremoved was operating. more specific, by stating from among whom he should be nominated by the State? not more ber would endeavour to tie the hands of the Government. tion to be made from the original source. [4.46] ber is quite logical in the point that he raises; but it would be almost impossible to meet that point in an act of Parliament. He is really suggesting that the measure should provide that the deputy of the person removed, or some one else conUnder nected with the meat works, should be appointed iu his place. The honourable member must realize that that would be a dangerous condition to impose upon any That, State government. I am absolutely convinced that if it should so happen that the manager of any one of these works did anything to justify his removal from the federal board, such action would also bring about his removal from the State organization. conflict on the board. member could be removed only on the recommendation of the board, which would have to be accepted by the Minister, and referred by him to the Governor General in Council. It must be admitted that the offence would need to be very serious to justify the removal of any member; and if it were so serious, it would undoubtedly mean his removal from the State organization which he was representing. Under my proposal, in the event of the State government or the State authorities overlooking the reason for his removal from the federal board, and allowing him to continue in office within the State, the -State shall then have the right to nominate his successor.

So that every State would be in a similar position, I urge the committee to agree to the deletion of the amendment made last Friday in relation to South Australia, thus restoring the bill to its original form, the substitution there for of a provision for the nomination by the Government of South Australia of a successor to a person removed from the board, and the adoption of the amendments I have outlined to paragraphs a, b, c and d. State government nominated a man who had been removed from the board ? responsibility. In all probability, such a nomination would not be accepted, and the vacancy would continue until a person acceptable to the Governor General had been nominated. Such a vacancy would not affect the validity of any action taken by the board. So that the matter may be placed in proper form, I suggest that the Minister obtain leave to withdraw his motion "" That the Senate's amendment be agreed to "" and then move his amendment. Motion-b v leave-withdrawn . That the Senate's amendment be amended by adding at the end of paragraph (re) the following words:-""o r in the event of that person ceasing, in pursuance of this section, to hold office as a member of the board, such person as is appointed by the Governor General on the nomination of the Governor-in-Council of that State."" would seem that at last the position is being clarified. The point raised by the vear) relates to a (matter that obviously was in need of correction, and it is remarkable that it passed unnoticed both in this chamber and in the Senate. But for the amendments made by the Senate, the matter would not have come again before honourable members. It would appear on the surface that the action now being taken by the Minister will meet the position. I point out, however, that there is a great deal of verbiage, of the meaning of which it is obviously impossible for honourable members to have a correct appreciation. Therefore, in order to make sure that we shall not become more involved, I suggest that the Minister have typewritten copies of the amendments placed in the hands of honourable members, or at least present those amendments in such a way that we may properly understand them. I revert to a point that I raised hy way of interjection. The proposal of the Senate provides that each member appointed to represent publicly-owned abattoirs and freezing works dealing with meat for export shall hold office during the pleasure of the Governor General. That is similar to the provision which relates to the representative of the Commonwealth Government. But sub-clause 15 of clause 5 provides that members other than the government representative may be removed from office by the Governor General, on the recommendation of the board. It would seem to me that the provision that each member shall hold office during the pleasure of the Governor General could, with wisdom, be deleted, and that sub-clause 15 should be altered to read "" Members of the board other than the government representative,, may be removed from office by the Governor General on the recommendation of the iboard, or for any other reason."" The provision for the easy removal of publicly-appointed individuals, while other members can be removed only on the recommendation of the board, is inexplicable. As the board is being appointed for the benefit of the community as a whole, and not for the particular benefit of any institution, I suggest that ful l power he given for the removal of any member of it by the Govern or-Genera 1. attention to the position that is now being created. The suggestions of the vear) are more in keeping with the principles of -the bill.

79,Honourable Mem'ber For Dalley ( Mr Rose,"of sub-clause 10 should represent publiclyowned abattoirs and freezing works. If an amendment similar to that now before the committee is proposed in relation to South Australia, the Governor in Council of that State would be given the right to nominate a representative to the Governor General in Council. That State might adopt a collective policy of marketing, and because of conflict 'between the State and Commonwealth Governments, the Commonwealth authorities might see fit to remove the State representative from the 'board. Thus, instead of having true representatives of publicly-owned companies, who would watch the interests of the producers, the men appointed might I foresee the possibility of the meatexporting trade being controlled by big interests such as Vestey's or Swift's. If we make provision whereby the persons to be appointed to the board may be other than the nominees of the producers, there will be a danger that men representing the big exporting and exploiting companies will be appointed to the board. Minister) [6.6] -My amendment provides that, in the event of the person mentioned in the paragraph being removed from office, his successor shall be nominated by the Government of the State of New South Wales. It makes provision for a most unlikely happening and is almost identical with the proposal of the honourable member for Dalley( Mr Rosevear). As my amendment has been drafted by the parliamentary draftsman to conform to the provisions of the bill no finomaly should arise. I therefore urge honourable members to accept it. [5.8] -The amendment of the Assistant Minister( Mr Thorby), although overcoming one anomaly, alters the mode of selection in that it gives to each State Government the right to nominate two members to the board. I do not feel disposed to support it. I suggest that provision be made for each of the bodies referred to in the proposed new subclause (10) to nominate the successor to its representative should he be removed from office. In paragraph a I suggest that the words "" or a nominee of the commission"" be added, with a similar suitable addition to paragraphs b, c and d, so that in each case the person to be appointed shall be a nominee of the body mentioned therein. My suggestion would overcome the difficulty which has arisen ancl provide for continuity of control. Minister) [5.12] -The honourable member for Wide Bay( Mr Corser) seeks to retain the right of the various bodies mentioned in the proposed new sub-clause to direct representation on the board. The provision will come into operation only in the event of any of the persons mentioned in the represent the exporters. several paragraphs being removed from the federal board. The honourable member's suggestion that we should make the body whose representative has been removed from the federal hoard responsible for nominating his successor would increase, rather than decrease, the difficulty. Eor instance, should the chairman of the Queensland Meat Industry Board be removed from the federal board, but still retain his position on the State board, complications would arise if the State board were asked to appoint his successor. It might happen that, in that event, the Queensland Meat Industry Board would re-nominate the same person, and as his nomination would obviously not be acceptable to the Federal Government, further difiiculties would arise. Moreover, the State board might refuse to nominate a successor, thereby leaving a vacancy on the federal board. My amendment makes the Government of the State concerned responsible for nominating a successor. I repeat that it is most unlikely that any vacancy will occur in the manner suggested, but in that remote contingency surely we can depend on the State Government to nominate a person both capable of carrying out the duties and acceptable to the industry. I appeal to honourable members not to increase the already great difiiculties, but to accept my amendment. It would appear that the proposed new sub-clause was framed to provide that certain interests should be represented on the board. The amendment should be consistent with that intention.

A member of the board who is not carrying out tlie wishes of thqse whom he represents will not long remain their representative. It seems to me that whereas the original intention was that certain bodies should have direct representation on the board, the amendment destroys that intention. [5.19] -This is one of the most important provisions of the bill. Obviously, the intention of the Government is to provide against the control of the meatexport industry by big proprietary interests, and that is why it stipulates that direct representation are fully recognized, co-operative companies or State utilities should be represented on the board. Now we are being asked to give to a State government the right to nominate a person who may not be acceptable to the instrumentality he is to represent. We should not interfere with direct representation on this board of the exporting organizations that have been established in each State. That is one of the original principles of the bill. Why should we allow the Premier of South Australia, for instance, to nominate somebody to represent any co-operative body on this board? me the Minister said that the real object of this amendment is to overcome the point raised by the honourable member for Dalley( Mr Rosevear) that the bill, as it now stands, does not provide for the appointment of successors to members who may be removed from the hoard-; but sub-clause 13 provides that if a nomination is not forthcoming, the Governor General shall have power to make an appointment. associations and bodies. the honourable member for Dalley raised quoted a clause which he immediately admitted did not apply, but then said that all the necessary powers in this connection were embodied in subclause 13. The Minister now says that there is no provision in the bill to cover the position. I said at the time that it seemed very doubtful whether such power was embodied in the bill, and that an amendment should be brought forward to clarify the position. The amendment proposed now by the Minister seems to ignore a feature of the bill in that it will deprive public bodies concerned with the export of meat of the right of direct representation on this board. He can make sub-clause 13 broad enough to overcome the position that would arise if a board did not nominate a successor to its representative who had been displaced from the board, but first of all we should give all of the bodies concerned the right to make such a nomination direct. I am in favour of this measure provided the rights of the industry to The committee apparently is unanimously of the opinion that means should be provided to fill any vacancy which may occur. The present difference of opinion seems to be as to whether the Governor in Council in the State from which a displaced representative comes, or the particular body concerned should have the right of nomination. The Minister would have been better advised had he acfepted the amendment which I forecast to insert the following as paragraph (e) In reply to In the event of any of tlie foregoing representatives being removed from the board and still retaining his position in the publiclyowned abattoirs and freezing works the controlling authority of sucli abattoirs and freezing works shall have the right to nominate the succssor for the remainder of the term of office of such representative. I believe this would get over the present difficulty. It is not sufficient to say that the displacing of a representative is a remote possibility. The possibility exists, and we have to devise ways and means of replacing a representative who may be removed from the board. If we do not do so a whole State may be disfranchised so far as representation on the board is concerned. The suggestion his point the Minister made by the honourable member for Wide Bay( Mr Corser) seems to be the fairest way of arranging for the nomination and appointment of successors. It was that in the event of a representative of a certain body being removed from the board, that particular body, and not any outside authority, should have the right to nominate a successor. If the Minister",25,Orange Bounty Bill 1935 Third Beading

Honourable members will agree that harmony on the board would best be ensured if the body directly concerned, and not any outside body, is given the right to nominate successors to displaced representatives. The Minister has admitted that these particular interests should be represented on the board. If one of their representatives is removed, I cannot see any reason why his successor should not be nominated by the 'body which the displaced man had represented; I ask for your direction, Mr Chairman, as to whether I would be in order in moving, at this stage, the addition of the new paraall sections of the community, and graph which I have already mentioned. If the Minister proposes to move an amendment to each of these paragraphs, considerable repetition of discussion will be inevitable. Probably, much time would be saved if, instead of amending each paragraph separately, a comprehensive new paragraph were added, as I have suggested. petent for the honoraible member to 6ubmit his amendment Minister's prior amendments have 'been dealt with. Minister for Commerce) [5.30] I have endeavoured to explain the position which would arise if the suggestion outlined by the honourable member for Wide Bay( Mr Corser) were accepted. If the general manager of the meat-works at Wyndham were removed from the Australian Meat Board, what authority should appoint his successor ? The honourable member for Wide Bay suggests that the controlling authority at Wyndham should do so, but I point out that there is onjy a general manager in charge of those works. What other authority than the Government of Western Australia could nominate a successor to this particular representative? In New South Wales, a commissioner controls the abattoirs. In the event of his removal from the Australian Meat Board, what authority, other than the Government of New South Wales, would nominate his successor? industries board. commissioner is in charge of the abattoirs. If the meat industry of New South Wales is satisfied to trust the appointment of the commissioner to the State Government, surely the Commonwealth Government can rely on the same Government, whatever its political complexion, to nominate a fit and proper person as successor to the New South Wales representative on this board. If we cannot trust. State governments, irrespective of politics, to nominate the right person to this board, whom can we trust? The State governments act on behalf of representatives of all of them at the Meat Conference held in Canberra agreed to this basis of representation on the Australian Meat Board. To meet the point raised by the honourable member for Dalley( Mr Rosevear), I have had my amendment drafted by the Crown Law officers to provide that, in the event of one of these representatives being removed from the boarda very ireniote contingency-the Government of the State concerned shall nominate his successor. If when the he is removed from the State instrumentality, then his successor on that body will automatically take his place on the Australian Meat Board, but should a representative who is removed from the Australian Meat Board retain his State position, it will be competent for the' State government to nominate his successor.

W h e n the m o t i o n has been passed, I shall introduce a bill to give effect to it. It is customary for the discussion on this subject to occur when the motion is before the Committee of ""Ways and Means, and the subsequent passage of the Income Tax Bill is usually formal. It is proposed to reduce the special property tax from the present rate of 6 per cent, to !> per cent, for reasons which I set out in the hudget speech. The consequent reduction of revenue is estimated to be about £200,000 a year. This calculation is based on the 1934-35 income. DivisionA of the motion deals with the rate of tax on income derived from personal exertion. The formula set out in both division A and division B is that which has been in operation for several years. It was evolved originally hy Professor Giblin when he was Commonwealth Statistician. The rate of tax in respect of income from personal exertion is unaltered and begins at 85 per cent, of 3d. in the £1, and it increases in a straightline curvea term apparently contradictory but well understood by taxation experts-unti l the taxable income from personal exertion reaches £6,900 a year. When that point has been reached the rate of tax is 76.5 pence in the £1. Thereto5 per cent., but the Government after the rate of tax is uniform. DivisionB deals with the rate of tax on income derived from property and it starts at, roughly, 3d. in the £1 and increases in a straight-line curve until a taxable income of £3,700 is reached, at which point the rate of tax is 90 pence in the £1. stationary. The rate of tax is the same -is that which operated last year. DivisionC deals with the rate of tax in respect of taxable income derived partly from personal exertion and partly from property. It is designed to meet the case of a man with a composite income. Por example, if a man's total income were derived half from personal exertion and half from property, the average rate of tax over the whole would be midway between the rate applicable to personal exertion and that applicable to property. Divisions D, E and l are self-explanadelay the passage of this bill. 7 tory. DivisionG deals with the rate of tax tion dealing with the income tax rate payable by an individually-owned partwith the exception of the special tax nership, and has to do with cases in which mala fides have been established, as, for example, where a man has brought in some dummies as associates, and has attempted to establish that income which is actually his own personal income is income from a partnership. DivisionG enables the Commissioner of Taxation to deal with sham partnerships in such a way as to exact the total amount of taxation that would be payable if no sham partnership existed. DivisionH relates to the rate of tax payable by severally-owned partnerships, which are, in fact, sham partnerships. Paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 relate to the special property tax and the means of collecting it, and are designed to implement the procedure that has been adopted by the Commissioner ever since the special property tax has been in operation. Provision is made for a reduction of the rate of tax from 6 per cent, to 5 per cent. The special property tax is one of the most onerous of the special taxes imposed some years ago. Two years ago it was intended to reduce the rate of this tax from 10 per cent., at which it then stood, had need to obtain additional revenue for a special purpose, and it could not at that time reduce the rate below 6 per cent. This is a very small reduction in respect of tax which I think is universally agreed to ho particularly onerous. Thereafter the rate remains Paragraph 5 provides that the averaging provisions which apply to income tax generally shall not apply to the special property tax. Paragraph 7 is framed in order to cover income derived by persons such as artists visiting this country, whose stay extends over parts of two financial years. This paragraph is inserted to provide that tlie rate of tax paid by such persons shall be the rate applicable for the period of their residence in this country notwithstanding the fact that they arc here for portions of two financial years.

The rates of tax in operation in 1931-32, including the company rate of tax and the rate of the special tax on property income, were re-enacted for 1932-33. The Parliament felt that it could not afford to collect less from income tax than in the preceding year. In 1933-34, however, substantial reductions were made; the personal exertion rate was reduced by 15 per cent.; the company rate was reduced from Is. 4.8d. to ls. in the £, and the special tax on income from property was reduced from 10 per cent, to 6 per cent. now proposes to reduce the last named tax to 5 per cent. again operated for 1934-35 and, substantially, with the exception of the special tax on property, the same rates are to apply for the current year. of this resolution will be that less call will be made on the taxable capacity of Australia than by other taxation which this Parliament has imposed. mentioned in the discussion of other bills how the revenues of the Commonwealth are being increasingly derived from Mr Curtin. indireet taxation. Direct taxation has fallen from £2 17s. 7d. in 1930-31 to Otherwise £1 14s 5d. in the last financial year. That represents a per capita reduction of direct taxation by £1 3s. 2d. On the I would like to say, however, other hand indirect taxation has increased by about £2 2s. a head. I think it has been sufficiently established that direct taxation is levied entirely upon those who have the capacity to pay. Income tax Only with very great reluctance, there fore, should this Parliament contemplate In 1931-32 an increase of the revenue from indirect taxation at a time when it faces a. steadily declining revenue from direct taxation. Although the Furthermore, the fact must be borne in mind that the ordinary transactions of the Consolidated Revenue Fund for the first four months of this financial year showed an excess of receipts over expenditure of £1,990,000. Of Three years ago, when the this amount customs and excise provided an increase of nearly £1,1S0,000 over the budget estimate for that period. Thus, the per capita conAs a matter tribution by the citizens of Australia to this Parliament in the present financial has been a decline in year is well over £1,000,000 more than was estimated in the Treasurer's budget speech. The inequality in the incidence of taxation, direct and indirect, is a matter which this Parliament must face because, incontestahly, it is wrong for the Parliament to be refusing to restore, shall we say, invalid aud old-age pensions while, at the same time, making these remissions of direct taxation even to the limited degree involved in this resolution. It is true that the reduction is less than £250.000, and that that sum would not provide adequately for such other contingencies as certain honourable members have in mind, but nevertheless I direct The Government the Treasurer's attention to the remarkable increase of the proceeds of indirect The 1933-34 rates taxes during the present financial year. As I have said, it exceeds the estimate by more than £1,000,000. I know the honourable gentleman may say that The effect revenue received during the first four months is not necessarily an indication of the receipts for the complete year; but I can imagine that had there been a fall I have of £1,000,000 during that period the Treasurer would he so apprehensive of the trend that that indicated, that he would be asking Parliament now to take cognizance of it. Property tax remissions which have been made during recent years have been much more substantial than the £200,000 proposed by this resolution. In 1932-33 the value of the Hat rate exemption was £500,000. That concession continued in the succeeding years. In 1933-34 the reduction of the special property tax from 10 per cent, to 6* per cent, gave an additional relief of no income from any source and are £880,000. Those remissions were repeated in the next year, and will continue this year, plus a further remission of the special property tax to the amount of £220,000; thus making the total relief for four years £4,S60,000. Although one may urge that taxes upon capital are unwise, yet the incidence of taxes on the well-to-do is less severe than is that of the indirect burdens imposed on the poor. Professor Giblin has pointed out that taxation on capital does not apply to those who have no income from capital. The tax is applied not to capital, but to income from capital; it is not imposed upon house property but on the income derived from that property. While it can be urged that when introduced the property tax was onerous, the substantial reductions of it which have been made are in marked contrast to the treatment meted out by this Parliament to other sections of the community who, equally with those with incomes from property, were called upon to make special sacrifices during the period of financial emergency. I have no more to say other than to urge the committee before finally disposing of this matter not to entirely overlook what I regard as the fundamental unbalance of the sources of Commonwealth revenue. While, on the one hand we are continually burdening the 'community by the imposition of indirect taxation, regardless of the individual competence of the citizens to pay, on the other hand we have a continuation of the programme of remissions of direct taxation, which definitely is imposed only on those able to pay; if they have no taxable income they do not pay the tax. This Parliament has to consider that aspect of the matter. In any event I submit that before the Parliament further remissions of direct taxation it ought to consider its obligations to those who have acknowledged claims upon the Commonwealth-claim s which were subjected to special pruning some years ago because of the difficulties of the financial situation. Surely we ought not to reduce taxes ou those who have incomes from property and relatively can well afford to contribute to the public revenues until we have first assured that those who have dependent upon this Parliament-the aged and the invalid-hav e secured to them the rate of pensions that applied before the special emergency legislation was introduced. Under the Income Tax Assessment Act an exemption of £50 is allowed for each child under the age of sixteen years. In normal times this is fair enough, because usually by the time a child reaches the age of sixteen, or even before then, he has taken his place in industry. One effect of the depression, however, is that youths have found it exceedingly difficult to obtain employment with the result their parents have had to continue supporting them. This has placed a severe strain upon the resources of many families, especially as the earnings of the head of the family have, in too many cases, been reduced as a result of wage-cuts. In the circumstances, the exemption might well be extended to cover'children over the age of sixteen who are unemployed, and still residing with their parents. The unemployment of youths is a serious problem in Australia to-day, and the concession I have suggested would be some relief to parents. The existing tax on some property owners may be onerous, as the Treasurer has said, and I know something of that from discussions which I have had with those concerned; but in a large number of case3 property owners are among the more fortunate member* of the community, and the case in relation to them has been well put by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Curtin). We should remember that the reductions of social services which took place during the depression really represent a form of taxation. The aged and the afflicted contemplates have been called upon to pay a special tax, even now amounting to 2s. a week, which represents a very large proportion",30,Incometaxbill 1935
96,Mr Beasley (West Sydney) [6.5],"of their total income. Thus, the emergency tax levied upon them is relatively much higher even than that which property owners are called upon to pay. I trust that the Government will pay some heed to my suggestion, so that the weight of taxation may fall as equitably as possible on all sections of the community. be pleased if the Minister would explain how the rate of tax payable in the pound is worked out in clause 1 of the bill, as I same time, their incomes can support the find the matter somewhat obscure. endorse the remarks of the honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Beasley) regarding the desirability of extending the child exemption to include unemployed children over sixteen years of age who reside with their parents. It ha? been estimated that of the youths between the ages of 14 and 21 who are unemployed 90 per cent, are between fhe age? of 18 and 21. I am definitely opposed to the proposal to reduce the present special property tax. The Treasurer ( Mr Casey) said airily that it would mean a loss of only £200,000 to the revenue, and while that may be so for the present year, further similar reductions will no doubt result in further losses. In the opinion of the Minister, the property tax is most onerous; probably he considers it iniquitous, but to my mind it is nothing of the sort. Sitting suspended from 6.15 lo 8 p.m. [Quorum formed.] opposition to that part of the bill which seeks to relieve the more fortunate classes of the community of taxes amounting to £220,000 a year, I emphasize that, that proposal is indicative of government policy. Despite the promise made when the Financial Emergency Bill to implement the. Premiers plan was before the Parliament, fchat when conditions improved the most hard-pressed sections of the people wuuld be the first to be given relief, the Government has pursued an opposite course. Admittedly, as the Treasurer has pointed out, the super tax on income from property is onerous, but it is preferable to taxes which bear harshly on the less favoured classes. The super tax at least collects revenue from the people who have the capacity to pay; and as the Leader of the Opposition has pointed out, it is levied, not on capital, but on the income from capital. The person who derives a small income from property is not nearly so seriously affected as are persons with incomes ranging from £30,000 to £50,000 a year. Some of the latter class pay about 65 per cent, of their income in taxes, and I do not think that that isjustified, but at the I burden. For that reason remission of taxes to the wealthy is not justified. When asked to reduce sales tax and other indirect taxes the Treasurer said that the budgetary position would not permit of such concessions. Yet the sales tax has a much worse effect on industry than has the property tax, because by restricting consumption it retards recovery. It cannot be claimed that the property tax has that result, and it should, therefore, remain in operation until the incidence of the sales tax is lightened. The £200,000 which it is proposed to remit to the landed interests could well be diverted to the payers of sales tax. A survey of the policies of non-Labour governments throughout Australia-the State governments are following the same course as the Commonwealth Government -woul d show that the interests which support these governments are receiving bonuses, while the poorer interests, whose burdens are crushing, are being ignored. Before asking Parliament to remit a. huge sum to the property-owners, the Government should restore invalid and old-age pensions to their pre-depression level. I heartily support the plea of the Leader of the Opposition that the Government should do this overdue justice to the aged and indigent. I also support the contention of the honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Beasley) that the Income Tax Assessment Act should he amended by extending exemptions granted in respect of children. At present the exemption ceases when a child reaches the age of sixteen years, but in recent years many children have remained dependent on their parents long after passing that age. The £220,000 that is being remitted to wealthy property-owners could be better absorbed in either extending the exemption age or in increas-",32,Incometaxbill 1935

I join with the honourable member for West Sydney and the honourable member for Fawkner( Mr Holt), in appealing to the Treasurer, who is so liberal in handing out largesse to his wealthy friends, to consider this suggestion. The income tax is a hardship to people who receive low salaries, and who have to support unemployed children. I am definitely opposed to the proposed further remission of the special property tax, and I intend to vote against it. that the proposal to make further remissions to the payers of the special property tax has been made at the present juncture, fn view of the difficulties which the ordinary working man is encountering to-day, he at least deserves some consideration when tax remissions are being granted. I had hoped that the budget speech would include a reduction of the sales tax at least to 2^ per cent. I would have favoured a reduction to 1 per cent., or better still, its discontinuance. public to-day is .shouldering a very heavy burden of taxes, and the further we get away from the period of depression the more should the great mass of the people share in the remissions of taxes. In direct taxation, particularly the sales tax, of indirect taxation should be eased. Eor increases the cost of living, hampers the small business man in every direction, and brings no benefit. I think, to the master class. Order! The honourable member must connect his remarks with the hill. effect of indirect taxation on the community generally, and protesting against its continuance when the Government can afford to reduce the rate of the special property tax by 1 per cent. In view of the fact that many of the difficulties associated with the wheat industry appear to have been solved, I was hopeful that the budget would contain provision for the remission of £2,000,000 or £3,000,000 of taxes. I know that the sales tax was on a previous occasion reduced by 1 per cent., hut primary industries have received remissions of taxes in every direction. The remission of £220,000 to the payers of property tax gives to those who can afford to pay a present which might well have beet bestowed in another direction. The property tax does not inflict so much hardship as does the sales tax, which has to be paid on articles of food and clothing which the poorer sections have to purchase daily. I do not suggest now that the Treasurer should retrace his steps by amending the present budget, but, in considering the financing of the Commonwealth's operations next year, at least as great consideration should be given to the working class as has been given this year to the primary producers. Not only have the primary producers had a wide range of their purchases exempted from the sales tax, hut the primage also has been lifted from many of their requirements. They have received remissions of taxes in other directions. I feel justified, therefore, in making a plea on behalf of those who are contributing annually large sums to Consolidated Revenue by way of sales tax. Prosperity is returning, and with it many concesThe sions are being given to those who have money and I am of the opinion that larger concessions could be granted to the workers. The latter are entitled to a greater share of the benefits which accompany better times; therefore,, the burdens that reason, while I do not intend to oppose the bill, I counsel the Government, to pay more attention in future to the needs of the masses.

103,Mr Barnard (Bass) [8.13],"I( Mr Casey) is able to giant relief, it should be given to those people who are least able t.o bear the burdens. To-day people who find difficulty in meeting the ordinary commitments of life are compelled to pay indirect taxes on everything they buy. I recently suggested to the Treasurer that, before the end of the financial year, he would discover that taxes to any section that is not entitled the revenue would be considerably in excess of that for which he had budgeted. That prophecy has already been fulfilled, yet we are now asked to pass a bill for a reduction of the taxes of a section of the community which can well afford to pay them. I urge upon the Government the necessity for further reduction of the super tax stuffs and other necessaries of life on property income. A few weeks ago, reference was made in the budget speech to the improved condition of the export industries, which is largely the cause of the improved budgetary position. This tax is one of the heaviest burdens imposed backed up by his vote in this chamber. on industry, and particularly export industries. The best way to effect a reduction of interest rates would be to reduce the rate of tax on property inoome, which is one of the chief costs of many of our major industries. Consideration should be given to the abolition of the super tax. I join in the protest made by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Curtin), and other honourable members,, against the Government's proposal to reduce the taxes of that section of the community which is well able to meet the imposts levied upon it . Property-owners in industrial areas have recently increased their earnings by raising rentals. I cannot agree with the honourable member for Wimimposed on income derived from property has the effect, under present conditions, of limiting industrial expansion. Listening to his reasoning, one might imagine that industry was languishing because of lack of capital, rather than because of the difficulty experienced in obtaining markets. A few days ago we were discussing the need for adequate markets for surplus production. The troubles of industry to-day are due, not to a need for the stimulation of production, but to inability to sell the surplus goods produced. The tax on property income, like every other impost, whether direct or indirect, is eventually paid out of industry, and the workers are, therefore, naturally interested in any proposal to remit taxes, or to give relief from to such assistance. The Treasurer ( Mr Casey) has spoken lightly of the proposed remisison of the amount of £200,000; but, in my opinion, this relief could well have been given to a more deserving section. For instance, the honourable member for Cook( Mr Garden) recently submitted certain amendments when we were considering the sales tax imposed on foodwhich are largely purchased by the workers. I was amazed to hear the remarks of the honourable member for Barton( Mr Lane), who habitually makes pious protests that are never His speeches are attempts to delude his electors into believing that he is fighting on their behalf. of the expression that I am deluding my electors. offensive to the honourable member for Barton, I ask that it be withdrawn. committee, I shall withdraw it, although all that I said was that the honourable member was attempting to delude his electors. I am sure that they are too intelligent to be caught so easily. It may be contended that injustice will be done to small property-owners by refusing to sanction the proposed reduction of the tax on property income. As a matter of fact, this section will not be materially benefited by this legislation. The honourable member for Werriwa( Mr Lazzarini) was correct in saying that those who will be most assisted are those who have incomes running into many thousands of pounds a year, and who depend entirely on the income derived from this source. I refer to those who have lived on the hacks of the community",34,Incometaxbill 1935

Debate resumed from tbe 31st October (vide page 1205) on motion by Mr would pay interest on two amounts-on e That the bill be now read a second time. 1 Insofar as this measure gives some relief to the widows and widowed mothers of Australian soldiers, as defined in section 4 of the War Service Homes Act, it has the support of the Opposition. I hope, however, that the Minister will include a provision to give the bill a retrospective will actually be decreased. If a widow effect. homes, and the Minister should see that every one is re-instated. The principal purpose of this bill is to ensure that widows and widowed mothers are enabled to remain in their homes for the rest of their lives, and a feature of the measure is that the Minister will administer its provisions. Consequently, responsible to Parliament, will be enabled to take a humanitarian view of the various cases which are brought under his notice. The bill provides that where a widow or widowed mother is unable to continue payments in connection with the home, the total amount of the instalments may be paid out of the trust fund to liquidate her obligation to the War Service Homes Commission. stated in his second-reading speech thatSuch payments, of course, reduce the liability on the home and increase the owner's equity. the commission. It becomes a first charge on the trust fund. speech the Minister said that the debt of the widow is not being increased. In respect of a widow who is unable to pay anything off her mortgage to the War Service Homes Commission, the Minister's contention will be found to be incorrect. Let us assume that the widow owes £600 to the commission on a war service home. According to the Minister, the average rate of repayment is £1 a week, including interest and principal. To meet her payments to the commission, therefore, she would in effect, be obliged to borrow £52 a year from the trust fund, carrying an interest rate of 4 per cent. Consequently she on the original loan from the commission, and the other on the money borrowed from the trust fund, at a rate of 4 per cent. I admit that this is an everyday business transaction. But assuming that at the end of ten years the widow dies or Avishe3 to dispose of the property, instead of her equity being increased, as the Minister stated in his second-reading speech, it Many widows have lost their owed £600 and was not in a position to pay anything, a sum of £52 a year would be taken from the trust fund to be paid to the commission. Of this amount, in the first year approximately £24 would be absorbed in interest, aud £28 would be paid off the principal. The interest would, presumably, be paid on the principal outstanding. At the end of ten years, the the Minister, who is principal would have 'been reduced by approximately £340, leaving an amount of £260 still owing to the War Service Homes Oominissdon. If the widow had, in effect, to borrow £52 a year for ten years from the trust fund to meet her commitments to the commission, she would be obliged to pay interest on that loan, and her liability in this respect at the end of the period mentioned would be £520 plus £114 interest, making a total of £634. The Minister Thus, after ten years, the widow would still owe the commission £260 on the original £600 that she borrowed, plus £520 from the trust fund on which £114' in interest had accumulateda total liability of £894. She would also have paid £185 in interest on the £600 originally borrowed from the War Service Homes Commission and she would owe £114 in interest on the £520 bonrowed from the trust .fund. These figures reveal that interest payments on the money borrowed from the War Service Homes Commission and from the trust fund, would absorb approximately £300. Eveni f the widowwere able to pay a few shillings a week, her equity would be practically nil, as the property would depreciate with the passing of the years and its value would not be comparable bo the sum originally paid for the home.",36,Incometaxbill 1935

As to what should be regarded as the income of a widow, the Minister should give a more explicit explanation. He referred to income as ""pensions, contributions from her family, or other sources"". In what way will the Minister differentiate, for example, between the wages that the children may receive and what he considers they should pay to their mother? In many cases, the widow may not have as much control over her children's wages ns the Minister might expect. Consequently, it would not be fair to assess an amount on, say, the earnings of a family irrespective of the amount received by the widow. use the home ? I think it would be fair to take into consideration 'some contribution that they should make. proposed. which the children will pay practically nothing. sympathetically the Minister administers this act. I propose now to refer to the case of a widow who is desitrous of relinquishing her property. After all expenses have been met, she may have a balance of £100 to her"" credit. In such an event, would the Minister pay the widow the full amount due to her, or would she have to wait until the new purchaser paid it off in weekly instalments? This bill will apply to .those widows of returned men who are purchasers of homes and not to those widows who are recognized as being only tenants, although they may he living in the identical home that themhusbands had contracted to buy. I shall cite a case in point. A soldier contracted to purchase the home and when he died his illness had so enfeebled his widow that she did not take out letters of administration. Consequently, the house reverted to the commission after a given period. At the time of the husband's death, no arrears wei*e owing on the dwelling. The man had deposited £15S in order to 'bonrow £700, and had spent another £30 on improvements not provided for in the plans. The widow arranged to rent the house as a tenant at 10s. a week. In September last, legal proceedings instituted against ber culminated in an eviction warrant being issued. The arrears of rent were less than £50. taken against a widow ? ber will furnish me with her name, I shall have inquiries made into the matter. has an equity of approximately £150, but because of her ignorance of legal, procedure, she lost the home and was evicted. The commission denied that she is or was a purchaser, and according to the letter which the Minister forwarded to her friends, any one in a similar position would not be entitled to relief under this measure. Many widows have surrendered their rights voluntarily to all that is become tenants on the commission's terms, and have economised in every way to retain a. home which is of some sentimental value to them. I should like the Minister to say whether the measure will It all depends on how be extended to widows whose husbands were purchasing war service homes regardless of whether the widow is or is not to-day recognized as the purchaser. However, as the bill gives some relief to the widows of returned soldiers and widowed mothers the Opposition intends to support it. are several phases of this measure to which I wish to direct the attention of honorahle members. The Minister has not explained why it is proposed to appoint the Commissioner for a term of seven years instead of three years as previously. I agree with what the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Forde) has said regarding the effect of this measure upon widows whose husbands were purchasing war service homes. If a widowed mother, with the assistance she may receive from members of her family, is able to pay the amount required, she will be able to retain the",37,Thorby

Apparently the small amount received from her family will be regarded in the same light as under the Permissible Income Relief Act of New South Wales, and it will, therefore, be taken into account. If the amount which the commission demands is not paid out of the home. evicted. That is one of the points which I wish to bring under the notice of the Minister. If the Government would adopt the provisions of the Queensland act relating to workmen's homes, the widows of returned soldiers would derive some benefit. Under that act the person who undertakes to purchase a home in 30 years takes out a life assurance policy on which he pays the premium. When the purchaser dies all further payments cease, and the home becomes the property of the widow. The average life of the purchaser, after effecting the purchase is in the bill there would be some security fifteen years, so that repayment of interest and principal extends on an average over a period of fifteen years instead of 30 years. Eveni f the purchaser dies at the end of, say, four or five years, the widow receives the property free of all debt. That is an infinitely better scheme than that embodied in the bill which provides that if the widow cannot continue to pay the amount demanded by the commission she has to vacate the property. If a widow is in possession of a property on which £600 is owing she will, in ten years, have paid £337 off the principal, but she will still be owing £263 to the commission. If she is unable to pay the weekly instalment of £1 and is assisted to that amount from the trust fund, she will in ten year3 have incurred a debt to the fund interest. to the commission; thus, her total liability will have increased to £897. In addition, she would also have paid rates and taxes and maintenance costs. some relief her indebtedness will have increased. The capital debt on the property will be increasing all the time. If the widow should die no other member of the family can assume responsibility for the indebtedness; but, if she should remarry, the husband may take over the liability if he so desires. If he should decline to do so she loses all that she has paid. In committee I propose to move that, after section 36A of the principal act the following new section be inserted:3fin. The purchaser shall effect and until the contract of sale is fully (performed keep in operation an insurance upon his life in an amount sufficient to pay to the Minister, in the event of the death of the purchaser, the full amount of the unpaid purchase money and other moneys secured hy the contract of sale and this act. Such policy of life assurance shall be assigned to and held by the Minister: Provided that the Minister in his discretion may accept in lieu of the policy of insurance aforesaid any existing policy of life assurance which is in the Minister's opinion a sufficient security. able member quoting? act. If that provision were embodied for the widow and the home would revert to her children, and not to the Government. The Government is always safeguarded, because whatever amount may be paid prior to the death of the purchaser, the Government can repossess the property if the widow cannot continue the payments. We speak sometimes of the action of unscrupulous landlords who "" take people down "" ; but the Government is putting over the same trick. member suggest that this bill is a trick. Government loses nothing, and may eventually obtain possession of a property which was being purchased by a returned soldier with his war gratuity and any other money he was able to raise. If the widow is unable to continue the payments of £520, plus £114"" for the equity of the purchaser is gone, and She will still owe £263 the Government does not lose a penny.

Under the Queensland act the occupants of homes and their widows are protected. Is the £5,000 to be expended the limit of the Government's liability? "" and such other moneys "". purchaser's equity in the home is to be safeguarded, as the indebtedness will increase. costing £600 may increase with trustfund payments, water and sewerage rates, and charges for painting and repairs, &c, at the rate of £100 a year, so that in ten years the property may cost over £1,500. The Minister also said that, following the death of the widow, the members of her family would he able to realize on the home and thus discharge the debt due to the commission; but, as I have shown, the value of the home will be far below the amount of the indebtedness. The Minister also said that under this scheme payments would be made from the trust fund to meet the instalments, and that the accrued debt, including interest on the amount advanced from the trust fund, would be a first charge against the home. It seems to me that it would not. matter much whether the debt was a first or a, last charge on the home, because, the debt would be constantly increasing, and at the end of ten years, on an original debt of £600, the liability would be at least £897. Then the Minister went on to explain that, if the widow remarried, the husband would accept the full responsibility for any payments made from the trust fund. I doubt that, in the circumstances mentioned, the husband could reasonably be expected to take a double risk-the widow and the indebtedness-on her home. His position would be analogous to that of the fly, invited by the spider to walk into her parlour. I hope that the Minister will give careof the House. ful consideration to the amendment which I have suggested, together with the reasons given for its acceptance, and that even at this late hour, he will incorporate in the bill liberalizing provisions of the nature indicated, so that the scheme may be of some real benefit to war widows -The original war service homes scheme was drawn up very hastily. The home endowment scheme established hy Arthur Rickard and Company Limited, of Sydney, is one which I commend to the Minister. Under that scheme the purchaser takes out a life insurance policy for the amount of the debt on the home, and should he die before the expiration of the term fixed for repayments, his widow is given a clean discharge of the debt. The weekly payments in respect The debt on a property of a home of a value equal to that of a war service home are, I think, only about 2s. a week in excess of the payments under the State Government scheme which are again far lower than the rate paid under the war service homes scheme. The homes of the soldiers have been over-capitalized. ber aware that the returned soldiers flatly refused to have anything to do with the insurance scheme which I put to them.? scheme the Minister suggested, but I feel sure that if it were on the lines of the Queensland proposal or the Rickarrl endowment . scheme, the returned soldiers would welcome it. It is apparent that, in order to disarm criticism and perhaps also to silence public outcry, following evictions of widows, the Government has brought forward this scheme. for all those who have vacated their homes during the last five years. that this Government alone was responsible for the eviction of returned soldiers from war service homes. along these lines taken before?

Ever since I have been a member of this House, I have consistently advocated relief along the lines of this bill. By invitation, I have attended many meetings to consider the difficulties of purchasers of war service homes, and on no occasion have I heard my political opponents advocate the adoption of a life insurance scheme. To-night, for the first time, we have had honourable members opposite urging that the Government should include such a provision in the bill so that, in the event of the death of the soldier purchaser, the widow would have her home free of all charges. Mi"". WAKD -That is not true. never heard such a proposal advocated at any of the meetings which I have attended. The bill contains provisions which will be of substantial benefit to the widows of returned soldiers, and it should command the support of every honourable member. scheme, should the husband die, the widow will be entitled to live in the home at a nominal rental, but if she is unable to meet this charge the house will not be taken from her. An honourable member referred to the ejectment of a widow because she was in arrears with her rent to an amount of £50. If that happened, all that I can say is that her representative in this Parliament did not look after her interests very well. I am acquainted with the case of a woman who has paid no rent for two years and is still in occupation of the premises. She has a child sis years of age, and out of her income of 32s. 6d. a week she will be asked, under this scheme, to pay a bom 8s. a week. vernment would be regarded by the honourable member as having any value. The which he supported destroyed the possibility of a poor man getting anything. He knows that this Government has made steady progress towards the rehabilitation of every class of the community. Under the provisions of this measure, any widow who cau show that she is not capable of earning anything will be allowed to remain in her home without payment until her death. Is that of no value? Will honourable members opposite vote against it? I have always urged returned soldiers to advocate what is practicable. I assure this House that at no meeting within the last three years-and I have attended almost every meeting called by the War Service Homes Purchasers Association, outside as well as inside my electorate-hav e I heard honourable members of the New South Wales State Labour party who sit opposite advocate an insurance scheme. If I cannot see how such a scheme could be adopted by the Government, they will charge me with having refused to support it. That is not I repeat that I have my attitude at all. But I do refuse to be led by them, for the simple reason that they have always landed the workers in all sorts of difficulties. That will be the experience of widows of returned soldiers if the beneficial provisions of this bill are not enacted. The Minister has said that if any widow has been evicted within the Under the Government's last five years she will be permitted to return to a suitable home. Honourable members opposite do not espouse the cause of these widows, but merely advise them tc let the Government put them out of their homes.

His latest remarks are purely an attack upon certain honourable members because of what they have done outside this House, and have no connection with the bill. If he will confine his remarks to the measure I shall ensure that he is not unduly interrupted. bers that they will do the right thing if they support the bill, which will prove a blessing to those unfortunate women who have lost their husbands. I have always maintained that the scheme of war service homes is of very little value to the returned soldier. A widow who takes over a property on which there is a liability of £600 or £800 has no chance of ever becoming the owner of it. That applies also to the returned soldier on the basic wage who assumed responsibility for the liability in more prosperous times when he was earning £5 or £6 a week, and has since had his wages reduced. I agree with the honourable member for Cook( Mr acute sense of responsibility towards exGarden) that the capital values of these homes are too high. A mau upon a very low wage will never own one of these homes although he is given 38 years to complete the payments on it. able member must realize that the matter he is now discussing is not dealt with in the bill. ing is that a widow with a small income cannot hope to discharge a liability amounting to £800. Even on an income of £3 a week it would take her about 30 years to complete the payments, and there is grave doubt as to whether she would ever possess the property. I covered my indebtedness with insurance as soon as I purchased a home 30 years ago, but I had only a liability of more than £400. No woman can expect to own a property on which the indebtedness is £800. The bill embodies one of the most humane provisions that for a long time this House has been asked to consider, and I give the Assistant Minister( Mr Thorby) the major portion of the credit for it. Almost immediately upon his appointment to the MinistryI had an interview with, the honourable gentleman. He then said "" If ever I have the opportunity, one of the first things that I shall do is to make provision for the widow of a returned soldier to have her home until she dies. If she is not able to make any payment, she will have it without charge; and any charge made will be in accordance with hev ability to pay."" I hope that honourable members opposite will do nothing that might destroy the effectiveness of this I assure honourable memmeasure. It is not a trick, as the honourable member for Cook has suggested. The Government is not seeking to injure the widows of returned soldiers, but is honestly and sincerely attempting to afford them relief. This is one of the best measures that this Parliament will ever be called upon to pass. bill may be described as one of the most generous measures ever brought before this Parliament. I , however, do not choose to regard its proposals as an example of generosity on the part of the Government. Rather do I think that they are indicative of a very soldiers and their widows. But I point out that the widows of another section of returned soldiers who have had consideration extended to them by this Parliament are not yet similarly covered. I refer to soldier settlers who it was intended should be just as Well treated as a reward for their war service. The predecessors of the present Government arranged with the different States to cater for these men. but on the basis adopted it was quite hopeless to expect successful results to accrue. It is well known that the soldier settlement undertaken by the States on behalf of the Commonwealth has been a complete failure, and has led to a chaotic state of affairs arising. able member will not be in order in discussing soldier settlement. soldiers who took up land have been left without a home over their heads. The Government proposes to cater for the widows of those ex-soldiers who took advantage of the War Service Homes Act, but its work will not be completed until it. has also given equal protection to the widows of ex-soldier settlers.

The honourable member's proposal is, however, worthy of consideration in the case of homes for other than ex-soldiers. scheme of insurance must stand actuarial investigation; but although the honourable member for Cook has not suggested any actuarial investigation of his scheme, it is not on that ground that I differ from him in regard to it. member suggests that the responsibility for caring for the widows of ex-soldiers should be borne by the purchasers of war serviee homes who are still living. ber did not realize the implication of his proposed amendment. with the Government in its assumption of responsibility for providing homes for the widows ofex-soldiers for the remainder of their lives. compliment the Minister( Mr Thorby) cn having introduced a measure which will receive the approbation of all The bill is organizations of ex-soldiers, as well as of other organizations in the community which are concerned with the welfare of the dependants of ex-service men.

The object of this legislation is to give security of tenure to war widows whose This legislation places on husbands, if they had lived, would have been able to support them and place them in more affluent circumstances than those in which they find themselves to-day. The provisions for the payment of rates and taxes, and for the repair of the home in certain circumstances, will be of great assistance to them. I doubt whether any association of returned soldiers would consent to a compulsory The honourable member's scheme of insurance. Possibly the Minister can enlighten us regarding the views of the soldiers' organizations, with whom he has, no doubt, discussed the questiou. The bill, which should be received with general approval, contains no contentious clauses, and I hope that it will have a speedy passage through the House. It legislates to help the women whose men paid the great sacrifice for Australia.' Seeing that the Minister( Mr Thorby) Any sound has assured us that the bill is acceptable to the purchasers of war service homes, and that they have refused a scheme of compulsory insurance, the Opposition will not oppose it.

My remarks concern the town of Murray Bridge in my electorate, -where subsequent to the war a large number of war service homes was built, not only by the War Serviee Homes Commission, hut also by t-he State bank, acting in eo-operation with the commission. At that time Murray Bridge was an important railway centre. However, following the importation of an American, who was appointed Railways Commissioner in South Australia, these men were transferred to Tailem Bend, some fifteen miles away. At this place the Railways Commissioner built houses and the men were compelled to rent them, whether they required them or not. The result was that these men, all of whom were wage earners, were placed in occupation of bouses for which they had to pay rent at Tailem Bend whilst they were under a liability in respect of houses at Murray Bridge. honourable member to show the relevancy of his remarks to the bill. dealing with war service homes. deal with every phase of war service homes. stand, Mr Speaker, that when a bill is introduced to amend the War Service Homes Aet the only limitation to a second-reading debate on the measure is the scope of the act which it is sought to amend.

This man had paid his instalments over a number of years, right up to the time of his illness; but nevertheless the Campsie court was asked to issue an ejectment order against this widow. The circumstances of this lady were pitiable in the extreme. She was absolutely penniless, and was in grave danger of finding herself and her young children without a roof over their heads.

[10.12] -The mere fact that we are dealing with the hopeless case of soldiers' widows to-day proves that it would have been wise when the Avar service homes legislation was first introduced to provide a scheme of insurance such as is now suggested by the honourable member for Cook( Mr Garden). However, I can see difficulties in doing it at the present stage, in view of the general health of the soldiers and the high premiums that would be charged. of the soldiers. fact that such a scheme of insurance would not affect those who are already widows. I agree with the honourable member for Barker( Mr Archie Cameron) that there aTe other phases of the purchasers' difficulties, but as Mr Speaker will not permit them to be discussed in this bill I must refrain from doing so. The Minister( Mr Thorby) has made some very good promises which, if carried out-and I have no doubt they will be, and that the provisions of this bill will be sympathetically administered by the department-wil l result in great benefit to the soldiers' widows. However, this measure does not touch upon the greatest difficulty under -which the war service homes purchasers labour. the legislation was introduced was that is not my intention to oppose the passage every soldier should be able to purchase a of this bill, because I realize that at home which he could leave to his widow and children. Nothing in this measure gets us any closer to that objective. As a matter of fact, it definitely ends any possibility of the widow getting possession . of her home. But inasmuch as it ensures her at least a roof over her head as long as she lives it will do some good. If however her income-onl y on paper-is to be taken into consideration without having regard to the circumstances of the home and family, justice will not he done to the widow. into consideration the health of the widow and her children. much the better for the widow, but I agree with the honourable member for Lang( Mr Mulcahy) that justice will not be done if it is intended to consider the amount of money that comes into the home regardless of the particular circumstances of the family. to embody a schedule in this bill. an insurance scheme could be successfully embraced in the bill at this stage; it would not be fair to impose it on the soldier except on a voluntary basis, and, in any case, it would not affect the widows age which this bill is designed to assist. I cannot help expressing my disappointment that the bill does nothing to help us in the efforts which we on this side have made for many years to try to retain for the soldier's widow the home which the soldier endeavoured to pay off. As I have said, I can see in this measure a vanishing of the last possible hope of reaching that objective. The mere fact that the Minister has to resort to the methods which he has outlined in order to maintain a roof over the widow's head removes the last possible chance the widow has of paying off her home. Al l that is proposed in order to help her stay in the home will merely increase the liability to the commission. But as I cannot suggest any way of overcoming that particular difficulty I intend to support the bill as a means of assisting the The ideal aimed, at when soldiers' widows.",47,Thorby

239,Original War Service Homes Mr Bosevear (Dalley) [10.15],"I tleast some one somewhere will gain advantage from it, hut the vast majority of widows will not. The proposal we have before us is merely a tinkering with one of the big problems which the Government has to face. The Government has provided 36,895 war service homes, which means that there are practically an equal number of families depending upon it to do something to extricate them from the difficulties in which they find themselves to-day. Out of the total number of homes provided only S,565 have heen paid off up to the present time, and according to the War Service Homes Commissioner's report, 2,602 have reverted to the commission, a very large proportion because those who were endeavouring to pay tliem off have been evicted by this Government and its predecessors orable member must discuss the bill before the House. does not go far enough, and that there should be incorporated in it a measure of assistance not only to widows, but also to the many soldier purchasers who find themselves in impossible circumstances, and who, like the 2,602 purchasers already evicted from their homes, are waiting for eviction to come their way. Unless we get right to the root of this problem it will be difficult to appreciate how we can best help the widows, those who have been evicted, and those who, in the near future, are faced with the prospect of eviction. The commissioner's report discloses that, out of a total of £1S,000,000 due in instalments up to, the 30th June this year, the arrears amount to over £1,000,000. able member knows that I have already ruled that every phase of the administration of the War Service Homes Commission cannot be discussed on this bill. bers are to be limited to that degree, I would like to point out that when the Minister was introducing the bill he went into a good deal of detail, and I am introducing this aspect of the matter in order to reply to his statements. the honourable member has not yet indicated that he is replying to anything tha: the Minister said. made many promises, and has claimed that widows will benefit as the result of this legislation. I feel that I am entitled to examine tbe value of his promises by referring to some of his performances. During the last twelve months, more war service homes purchasers have been brought before the courts for the purpose of eviction than during the regime of any previous Minister in charge of War Service Homes. ber is defying my ruling. order. may be raised on my ruling.

That remark was irrelevant to the subject-matter of the bill. The honourable member then referred to the number of evictions from war service homes, although I had already ruled that that phase of the subject might not be discussed, except so far as it related to the occupants of war service homes affected by the bill, which deals with certain phases only of war service administration, and contains specific amendments to certain sections of the act. to approach the matter from another angle.

They are under the control of the Commissioner. runs true to form, he will be more concerned with getting rent from those who now occupy the homes than with making them available for widows. statement. thinks it unfair, let me point out to him that more purchasers have been evicted from their home3 while he has been in office than during the regime of a previous Minister. He has authorized more prosecutions for the purpose of securing eviction than has any previous Minister who occupied his position. Erom the 1st August, 1932, to the 31st July, 1933, 08 applications were made in the courts of New South Wales for ejectment orders against war serviee homes purchasers. During the succeeding twelve months the number was 127. while from the 1st August, 1934, to the 30th September, 1935, during which time the present Minister has been in control, there were 121 applications for ejectment orders. ber has not been able to mention one case in which the proceedings were not justified. were going off to fight, they were not told that the courts Avould examine their affairs upon their return to determine whether or not they should be evicted from their homes. I presume that the Minister cannot guarantee that widows will be placed back in the homes they left. That being so, the question arises who had who is to determine the suitability of the homes placed at their disposal. Is the matter to be determinsd by the department or by the widow Iierself? I assume that the widow will have to sign a new contract for the purchase of the home, and, if that be so, she should be entitled to choose the home she is to buy. The Minister suggested ;hat, through 1,454 rethe creation of a trust fund, war widows would be relieved of some of their obligations. He cited as an example the case of a widow who owed the commission £S00, and said that the monthly instalam not concerned ment on that amount would normally be about £4. If , however, the widow was able to pay only £1 a month, the other £3 would be paid out of the trust fund. I point out to honourable members that, in such a case, the widow would owe the trust fund, at the end of twelve months, £36 for instalments, and £1 10s. for interest, a total of £37 10s. The trust fund is an unfair would have paid £36 on behalf of the widow, but £32 of that would represent interest, and only £4 would be paid off the capital cost of tbe building. At the end of twelve months the widow would still owe £796 principal, and, in addition, she would owe the trust fund £37 10s., making a total of £833 10s. That is, assuming that she was able to pay her rates and taxes, but if she were not, and they were paid out of the trust fund, at the end of twelve months she would probably be indebted to the trust fund, and in respect of capital indebtedness, to tht amount of £850. It docs not matter to the widow whether her debt to the War Service Homes Commission is charged to tbe original capital indebtedness or to the trust fund; the debt would accumulate at the rate of £50 a year, if she were not able to pay the rates and taxes and they were met from the trust fund. The next question to be settled is the income of the widow. The view taken by the Minister is that everything that comes into her home is to be regarded as her income, but an every-day view of the situation should be taken. Everybody, I think, will appreciate the fallacy of the argument that, if three or four children of a widow are each earning a couple of pounds a week, their earnings should",49,Thorby

263,Mr Rosevear,"When the soldiersbe classed as part of her income. Apparently, the same formula will be applied by this Government as is being applied by the Government of New South Wales, which, in assessing the income of a relief worker, takes into consideration the earnings of every member of his family, from <the youngest to the oldest child, irrespective of whether or not the parents receive the full benefit of those earnings. sions and every other source of income are also considered. Does the Minister who is the final arbiter in this matter really consider that the war widow or any other widow, for that matter, can be deemed to be in possession of the whole of the earnings of. her family? An every-day view of the facts will lead us to believe that when the children reach ages between 18 years and 24 years, the parents are very lucky if they receive board money. From the remarks of the Minister, however, it is not a question of board, but of the whole of the earnings. He might possibly have used the wrong words, but the implication to he taken from his interjection iin reply to the cahy) is that he is going to assess a widow's earnings on a scale which will involve consideration of the earnings of her family. I ask him to state whether he believes that a war widow, whether she receives it or not, should he credited with in payments. The equity is there and the bhe whole of the earnings of her children. I am glad that the question of equity has been raised. When the honourable member for Reid( Mr Gander) made representations to the War Service Homes Commission on this point, it was decided that a person for whom he was acting who was a'bout to abandon a war service home contract had £80 worth of equity in the home. But, when he made application to have that amount paid over to the retiring occupant, he was informed that it would not he available until the person who signed the new contract had paid the whole of the money due to the commission. member for Reid, I think, will bear out what I say. When he wanted the £80 equity after the contract Government in considering the formulahad been hauded by one party to another, it was declared by the commission that the £80 would not be paid over until the new contractor had met his commitments. A continuance of that policy will place widow occupants of war service homes in a difficult position. If a widow finds herself not in a position to continue her contract, or is forced by some other circumstances to abandon her Invalid and old-age penhome when she has £50 or £60 worth of equity in it, she should be entitled to the -money immediately after vacating the premises. She might abandon the home in order to get the money to start in some small business or to enter some new sphere of life. If the commission decides to continue its policy that, until the new contractor pays the whole or portion of the money, the widow is not entitled to it, she should be warned beforehand. When a widow abandons her home in the circumstances I have mentioned, it is natural to assume that she desires the use of the equity at once. The Minister should give a definite indication of what the policy is to be, especially as he made so much of the matter of equity in his speech. He should give an assurance that any widow who abandons her home and has an equity in it will be paid that equity immediately. She should be told that the commission is prepared to take the risk of the new tenant defaulting widow who leaves the premises should not be burdened with the risk that the new occupant will not meet the instalments. It is unlikely, however, that many of the widowed occupants of war service homes will have a great deal of equity in the homes, because the average accupant has great difficulty in maintaining payments. Many widows are saddled with arrears at the time of their husband's death. Although when alive, the husband was able to keep up the payments, very often the widow, when she takes over the lease, gets in arrears to the commission. It is most difficult to see how an equity can exist for long in the case of a widow who owes £800 to the commission if the indebtedness is to be increased by £33 a year, which will mean that any equity which might exist will rapidly disappear. I appreciate the difficulty facing the",50,Thorby

266,Mr Rosevear,"The honorahletion of any equitable form of insurance to meet the desire of the honourable member for Cook( Mr Garden) to devise some scheme -whereby people who have contracted to purchase war service homes might get additional protection, but I realize the enormous risk which would be involved in any insurance company insuring the returned soldier occupants of those premises, the youngest of whom would to-day be middle-aged. The risk of insurance is accentuated hy the fact that it has been reliably stated that the reasonable expectation of life of returned soldiers has been greatly shortened by their war service. Accordingly, even if an insurance scheme were promulgated, the premiums would be so high that they would be beyond the means of the average purchaser of the homes. But there is a scheme under which the homes are insured, and I understand that the Minister is already giving some consideration to the question of insurance. and other risks. be not so much to protect the purchaser as to give to the commission a better control of the insurance money. The assurance given to-night to the honourable member for Kennedy( Mr Riordan) may relieve the situation, because I understood the Minister to give an undertaking that, if an ex-soldier's widow ex-soldiers. It is along right lines, and had a young son or daughter, he would be prepared to allow the commission to arrange insurance on his or her life instead of that of the father or mother.

No widow the major problem to be faced is the or widowed mother has any legally revaluation of all war service homes. measure is the outcome of a good deal Melbourne Ports( Mr Holloway) and of agitation on the part of honourable members, and I am pleased that it has been introduced. It represents a forward step, although it does not give all the assistance that could be desired. One would imagine from the remarks of certain honourable members that the Government desired to evict the ex-soldiers' widows who are in occupation of war service homes; but, after perusing the mass of correspondence on my own files, I cannot find one case in which eviction has occurred. I quite realize that a Minister devoid of humane instincts could, if he chose, evict in certain circumstances, yet the bill before us gives more protection to the occupants than they have enjoyed in the past. I may remark parenthetically that I am not altogether satisfied with the past administration of war service homes generally. In South Australia some of the returned soldier occupants have suffered hardship owing to lack of employment, with consequent arrears of rent, and unfortunately a few have suffered eviction. This bill does not approach the general question of war service homes, but deals with war widows. We have heard to-night many assertions that evictions of war widows have taken place, but I believe that the Minister will be able to inform the House that in no instance has this been the case. This bill is designed to help both the widows and the widowed mothers of has my support. and as I have no doubt that many of them will look to the reports of the parsanguine and exaggerated estimates of enforceable claim to anything under this -This measure.

The Minister, in the first place, will decide whether the benefits of this legislation will be given to this or to that woman. He can refuse them to one, and grant them to the other. tion arises as to what are the benefits to be conferred under the hill. It does not release the occupant of any obligation to pay purchase money or interest,nor does it release her from her obligation to repay any advance by way of insurance money, or rates and taxes that may have been paid on her behalf by the commission, or advanced out of the trust account. She remains liable to pay these amounts, and the bill makes provision for this at the outset. Sub-section 2 of the proposed new section 29AA providesNo reduction under this section in the njnoimt of any instalment shall relieve any widow or widowed mother from liability to pay the f u l l amount of the purchase money or repay tlie f u l l amount of tlie advance, as member for Melbourne Ports( Mr the case may be, together with interest thereon. Under section 34, "" advance"" includes insurance, rates, and taxes, &c, that may have been paid on behalf of the occupant. All she gets, if she receives the Minister's consideration, is the privilege for the time being of making smaller payments than she would otherwise be called upon to meet. Nevertheless, there remains the power of the Minister, under section 36 of the act, to cancel a widow's contract at any time upon default for the prescribed period. that the Minister would arbitrarily use that power, but it is vested in him. Another point is that the widow, or widowed mother does not receive the title of the house until she has completed the payments on it. If she falls into arrears, no provision in this bill exempts her from the exercise by the Minister of the powers conferred upon him, under the act. I welcome the measure as it allows the Minister a certain degree of discretion which he appears not to possess at present in dealing with such cases. But it goes no further than that. It merely states that the Minister may, whenever, in his opinion, the demanding of instalments ilr. Blackburn. from a widow or widowed mother would be a hardship, reduce the amount of such instalments. But that does not reduce the amount of her debt. She continues to be liable to pay the whole of the debt, and if she falls into arrears for the period of three months prescribed by section 36, legal proceedings to enforce payment may still be taken, and the cancellation The quesof the contract follow. It is a great mistake and a great oity to exaggerate the benefit which this bill confers on widows and widowed mothers. It does not give them, as a right, any security, and it does not provide for their remaining in their houses -without anxiety during the remainder of their lives. At least, one honourable member, apparently, considers that the bill does provide for the widows and widowed mothers to remain in their houses during their lifetime without fear of eviction if they fail to keep up their payments, and that no payments will be required until after their death. Holloway) for one, stated that the widowwould be absolutely secure during her lifetime. The bill makes no provision in that regard, and I welcome the Minister's admission of it. While not doubting the Minister's good-will and sympathy, I am merely endeavouring to correct false impressions of the bill in the minds of honourable members. The unfortunate part of it is that such, false impressions may be communicated by the press and the parliamentary debates to the widows and widowed mothers who may be led to beI do not suggest lieve that the measure confers rights upon them, which it does not. Possibly the bill goes as far as is practicable, and probably it is necessary for the Minister to possess this discretionary power, which he may or may not exercise, to reduce the instalments payable by a widow or widowed mother. If this bill represents the ultimate concessions that the Government can give to widows and widowed mothers, I feel justified in saying that the mountain has laboured and brought forth a mouse.

The Government has gone out of its way in an honest endeavour to provide a fund from which to pay any amount by which the widow's contribution is short of her liability to the Commissioner. The honourable member for Werriwa( Mr Lazzarini) said that tlie returned soldier has to die -before his anything with such a small amount. widow can receive any consideration; but that is entirely wrong. I have already circulated amendments, following upon suggestions made by the honourable member for Hume( Mr Collins), who directed attention to a particular case which I have used as a basis. The case cited by tlie honourable member was that of an unfortunate woman whose husband is in a mental hospital, and who is in an infinitely worse position than the widow of any returned soldier. I have always believed that the wife of an insane man is in a worse position than any widow. definitely provide that the wife of a returned soldier who has become insane will be treated as if she were the widow of the purchaser. I should also like to reply to some comments made by some honourable members, whose sincerity I very much doubt. Eor instance, the honourable member for Cook( Mr Garden) said that this bill is a trick, similar to that played ciate the criticism of the honourable on returned soldiers before. There is no suggestion of trickery. The bill is a plain piece of machinery to provide a trust fund to make up the deficiency that may be assessed from time to time in connection with the liabilities of any widow, and to pay to State governments or municipal authorities arrears of taxes or rates, fire insurance on properties, and the cost of repairs. member for East Sydney( Mr Ward) said that the measure does not confer any benefit upon widows. member made that statement by interjection. MrG ARDEN -It gives them something. member for Cook said that it is a trick. Some honourable members opposite misconstrued even my remarks in moving the second reading of the bill. Some said that this measure is not likely to confer any benefit whatever upon those unfortunate persons who are unable to meet their commitments. The honourable members for Dalley( Mr Rosevear) and Cook( Mr Garden) ridiculed the amount of £5,000 mentioned in the bill, and said that it would be impossible to do They know that the bill definitely provides for allocating to a trust fund that amount, and "" such other moneys as are from time to time aj>propriated by the Parliament for the purposes of relief to widows and widowed mothers of Australian soldiers."" seek parliamentary approval before a further appropriation can be made. the speeches I have heard to-day, Parliament will not refuse to make the necesThe amendments circulated sary funds available. I cannot imagine Parliament refusing to grant to the Minister in charge of war service homes the funds necessary to cany out the provisions of this bill. It is impossible for anyone to say how much money will be required in the trust fund to meet the obligations of widows who are not in a position to make repayments. I appremember for Bourke( Mr Blackburn). He was essentially fair in all that he said. I agree with the honourable member that the bill confers no rights upon widows, in that it does not give them the right to demand relief. As I explained in ray second-reading speech, it is almost impossible to lay down a schedule of payments because the finanThe. honourable cial position of war widows must necessarily vary.

In every case it will he necessary to take into consideration the income of the widow, whether it is in the form of war or ordinary pension, from the letting of part of the home, from boarders, or from board paid by members of her family. Furthermore, consideration will be given to the number of dependent children, and the 'condition of their health. case that has come under my notice the widow is suffering from a malignant disease, and has an invalid son 45 years of age. No honourable member will say that payments should be required of her. These facts will, impress upon honourable members the need for the most sympathetic administration of the act. I have deliberately refrained from thrusting this responsibility upon the commission, because, in what must prove to be a distasteful matter, I have no desire to shelter behind the commissioner or his deputies. This legislation will, I hope, he on the statute books for many years and successive Ministers will be charged with the responsibility of its administration. ' I regret that any honourable member opposite should have attempted to misconstrue any of the provisions of the bill, or endeavoured to make political capital out of it, by suggesting that it was brought forward as a result of the pressure of public opinion. I say definitely that it is the fulfilment of a promise made to members of the War Service Homes Association and members of the Returned Soldiers League that legislation to liberalize the War Service Homes Act would be introduced as soon as possible. appointed as Minister in charge of War Service Homes, I discussed this subject with a deputation which waited upon me, and gave an undertaking then that the representations which they had made would receive the early consideration of the Government. As honourable members are aware, I was absent from Australia for six months on important public business, and therefore was unable to bring down this hill as early as otherwise would have been possible; but I assure honourable members that no widows have suffered from the unavoidable delay. Arrangements have been made for them to receive the benefits which this bill will confer upon them immediately it is passed by Parliament. I resent the unfair criticism by the honourable member for Werriwa( Mr Lazzarini), the honourable member for Cook( Mr Garden), and the honourable member for Dalley( Mr Rosevear), who suggested that the Government is endeavouring to mislead the people, and that it will refrain from In one honoring its pledges. The honourable member for Cook went so far as to say that the introduction of this bill was merely another trick. the bill. expect from the honourable member for East Sydney, who, by his interjections while other honourable members were speaking sought to cast ridicule upon the Government's' proposals and my administration of the act. The point I wish to make clear is that whilst no widow will be relieved of her obligations, she will have the right under this bill to make application for relief, and her application will receive sympathetic consideration. If her position warrants it, payments on her behalf will be made from trust fund, and although the money so advanced will be a first charge against the home, she will not be exposed, to any risk of the amount being called up so long as she honours the small obligation which may he imposed upon her. Every case will come before the Minister for review from time to time because the financial position.of a widow might alter. For example, the number of dependent children will, in the course of Shortly after I was time, be reduced, and it is hoped that members of her family will be able to contribute to the income of the home.

I am informed that in its consideration of applications for relief, the board has regard both to the present ability to pay and to the ability to pay at the time when the tax was actually due and payable. In the past, many cases in which the board has granted relief would have been refused if the board had taken into consideration only the ability to pay at the time of assessment and had ignored subsequent losses which had seriously affected the financial position of the taxpayer at the time when the application was actually dealt with by the board. It is undesirable that, and would be productive of anomalies if , the board should be compelled to ignore any relevant factor in its consideration of the question as to whether relief should or should uot be granted in any particular case. It is pointed out that the relief granted by the board, as shown in its annual reports, during the year ended the 31st December, 1934, amounted to £155,497, as compared with £57,558, during the year ended the 31st December, 1933, and £48,772 during the year ended the 31st December, 1932. the Interior, upon noticeHas he come tb a decision regarding an amendment of the Defamation Ordinance of 1928 to cover proceedings of the Federal Capital Territory Advisory Council? matter has not yet been arrived at.

What effect will the refusal of one or more States to pass the necessary legislation have on the application of the Commonwealth's proposal regarding the home-consumption price for wheat to the wheat-growers in the States specified? 2. Will the proposals contemplated by the Commonwealth Government in regard to wheat be practicable if one or more States do not pass the relevant legislation? 3. If so, is another method of assisting wheat-growers being formulated? honourable member's questions are as follows:1. The Commonwealth Government's policy was stated by the Right Honourable the Prime Minister on Thursday, the 14th instant, to be thatThe Commonwealth Government in agreement with the governments of the States, has agreed to joint action in order to secure a home price for wheat. The Commonwealth Government has introduced its legislation for this purpose. It is essential, in order to provide some guarantee for the wheat-growers for the coming harvest, that the main wheat-growing States shall at once introduce their legislation. So far New South Wales and Queensland are the only States that have done so. Victoria, I understand, will introduce its legislation next week. Until the other wheat growing States have taken action as agreed UK>n, the 'Commonwealth Government is not prepared to announce any policy for the forthcoming harvest. The Commonwealth Government feels that the governments of the States should shoulder asked the Minister for their obligation, and desires to point out that if no provision is made for the wheat-growers for the coming harvest the responsibility for that position will lie upon the States which do not take the action agreed upon. 2 and 3.
