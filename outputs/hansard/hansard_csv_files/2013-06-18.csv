A charitable today suggests that it is relatively purpose is commonly characterised to fall inconsequential.

But served us very well. this bill is actually immensely important and My key critique of this bill is that there deserves considerable scrutiny, because it has been no rationale as to where the will impact hundreds of organisations, it will problems with the current definition lie. My potentially have a significant impact on view is that if something is not broke we taxpayers and it will overturn 400 years of should not try to fix it. It is incumbent upon history. those who are putting forward a change to For those three reasons, it is an immensely prove where the problem lies and to important bill that does deserve considerable articulate how that proposal will fix that scrutiny and I believe it deserves to be problem. This government have done no rejected. I am encouraged that so many such thing. They have not come in here and people-at least in the coalition-are taking outlined where the problems currently lie in this bill very seriously and are debating it, relation to that 400-year-old definition of analysing it and working out what it means charity. They have not then gone and said, for the Australian community. I must say 'Due to those problems, we are going to that I am disappointed that the government introduce these measures which will fix has put this through without much debate or those problems.' Far from it-they have consultation, and that there is so little interest introduced this relatively out-of-the-blue. amongst the Labor members on the other They have had almost no speakers articulate side of the chamber to even speak on this bill the case for it and they will no doubt or to put forward its particular case. guillotine this bill through the parliament, as they have guillotined all the other bills over the last couple of weeks in the dying days of promoting or protecting human rights and this parliament. advancing the security or safety of Australia Why does this matter? The definition or the Australian people. It includes matters because if an organisation is advancing the natural environments and the characterised as a charity they get great catch-all category of promoting or opposing privileges. Those privileges are largely a change to any matter established by law, financial ones. It means they do not have to policy or practice in the Commonwealth, a pay income tax. It means they typically will state, a territory or another country and not have to pay GST. Usually it leads to furtherance for protection of one or more of them having charitable status from the point the above purposes. We have gone from of view of being able to receive donations having a relatively narrow defined definition and those donations being tax deductible. So of charity which we can all accept to one it confers enormous financial privileges to be outlined here which is enormously broad. deemed a charity. At its essence, we as a My concern with this very broad parliament representing the people need to definition is not necessarily the financial take great care in determining what actually aspect of it to the Commonwealth but rather should be the definition of organisations that because I think it will lead to the breaching should have those benefits conferred upon of one of those core principles over which them so they will be getting, in essence, we have had bipartisan agreement for a long financial assistance to do their work. time and which there has been no outcry to As I said, that 400-year-old definition change.

So the system works at the will seek charitable status under this new moment and I believe there is no reason to definition, should this bill pass this change it. parliament. I believe that many of those My second concern in relation to this bill green groups do not act in the interests of our is that it changes the definition from four nation; therefore, I do not believe that the categories into almost eight to 10 categories Australian people would think that it is right of charitable purpose.

It might be the operation of a demonstrates once again is the profound gulf church. All of these things are done around between the attitude of the Labor Party and our country by voluntary organisations, of the coalition towards charities and charitable organisations. towards people who are seeking, through We on our side of the House congratulate their own voluntary efforts, to make our all involved and we ask ourselves the society a better place. question: why is it that the default attitude of In the time that I have available to me, I the Rudd-Gillard Labor government is that want to make three fundamental points: first, people who are engaging on a voluntary that this bill is yet another example of this basis in raising money for charitable government's deep suspicion of the purposes and people who are engaging on charitable sector and its deep hostility to the voluntary basis in providing charitable notion of people within our community services be treated with suspicion? Why is it making an effort themselves to improve our that this government has set up an Australian community, to improve our nation; second, Charities and Not-for-profits Commission that the specific merits of the definition that that will dramatically increase the regulatory is proposed in this legislation raise serious burden on charities, one that falls particularly questions; and, third, that on this side of the upon charities that are run by volunteers, as House we take a genuinely small 'c' opposed to paid employees? Why is it that conservative position. If the case has not this government has done that when been made out for change, then do not purportedly it was going to achieve a single change.

We congratulate to abolish the Australian Charities and Notall of those who serve on the boards of for-profits Commission. charities, all of those who organise raffles, The point I make to the House this all of those who organise fundraising balls afternoon is that the Charities Bill 2013 and dinners and all of those who organise before the House is redolent of the very same suspicion of the volunteers running charities point that the meaning of 'charitable purpose' around Australia which we saw in the earlier has not previously been comprehensively legislation establishing the Australian legislated. We have previously relied upon Charities and Not-for-profits Commission. the common law, that golden thread based So the point I make to the House is that the upon many hundreds of years of British and philosophical hostility of the Labor Party to subsequently Australian jurisprudence. self-help efforts, to community based efforts Under the common law, there are the famed and to people doing things for themselves four heads of charity, which I well remember rather than looking to Canberra is deeply being drummed into the heads of students of embedded in the legislation we see before us trust law at the University of Sydney in the this afternoon. Inherent in it is the notion that late eighties, including me.

I the Rudd-Gillard government, it would be remind the House that this is a question irresponsible not to bear in mind a range of which was considered by the previous factors. The first factor that we need to bear Howard government. At that time, after an in mind, as I have already alluded to, is the extensive investigation into the issues and clear and demonstrated hostility of this after an extensive investigation into the government to the voluntary ethos on which question of whether there was in fact a need so much of today's charitable endeavour to vary the existing, well-established depends. This is a government which is common law definition of a charity and the hostile to the notion of people in the definition of charitable purposes, a view was community doing things for themselves. It is taken that it made sense to extend the hostile to the notion of community definitions in a small number of defined organisations conducting their activities in an categories.

Because line that the, apparently, world's greatest they were in such a tremendous rush to push Treasurer has presided over by saying to the the legislation through and because the Australian people: 'We've got a brilliant Labor Party was so focused on doing public policy initiative.'

So, with a brilliant account that someone was using against their piece of financial engineering by the member mortgage-sitting there without transactions for Lilley, Wayne Swan, they said, 'We're on it as an offset account, that money would going to reduce it from seven years down to be claimed by the Commonwealth and three years without there being any effectively go into consolidated revenue. transactions on an account,' not because it Because there was a difference between the assessment date and the date the funds were The simple inescapable reality though is referred to the Commonwealth, you actually this: there would be absolutely no need for had occasions arise when money that this amendment or indeed the original qualified as being 'unclaimed' as of the legislation had the government managed assessment date would then subsequently Australia's economy a little better. There have transactions on the account prior to the would be no need for the Commonwealth, in date the money was referred to the my view, to inappropriately take funds after Commonwealth.

One WhatI want to come to now is exactly can only say that the culture that is across the why there is another bill before the House in aisle here-and we have heard of members order to make further amendments to the of unions using funds for their own original unclaimed moneys bill. This bill has purposes-has infected this parliament and been brought forward because the that the Labor Party thinks it is within its government in its haste to get its hands on rights to be able to utilise the money of people's money pushed the bill through the ordinary Australian taxpayers-and it is parliament in a record amount of time with wrong. (Time expired) with errors. Some of the amendments that we have just heard from the member for are being made here in this bill today include Higgins, as well as from the member for the fact that there is now no minimum Moncrieff and the member for Casey, it is amount that can be transferred out as part of becoming an unfortunate habit for people on the unclaimed moneys bill.

The purpose of this bill is the status has been determined as at the to make certain amendments to the Banking assessment date even if, as I say, after that Act 1959. The reason that this bill is date the account holder transacts on the necessary is an earlier, extremely ill-judged, account. That is clearly a nonsensical and badly designed and sloppily implemented set illogical result and it reflects poor drafting of measures introduced by the Rudd-Gillard and poor implementation by a chaotically government.

Secondly, Commonwealth, under the law as presently the poor drafting of that act has given rise to drafted, does not, in the circumstances I have an unnecessary burden and extraordinary described, have the legal power to return the difficulties for ADIs. Thirdly, I make the money which has been paid to the ADI. That point that it is unacceptable that, yet again, is so, because the way the legislation has this parliament is spending valuable time been drafted does not contemplate the fixing mistakes in legislation which should scenario I have just described in which the not have been made and which were made as ADI makes payment to the Commonwealth; a consequence of this government's rushed it assumes the payment always comes chaotic approach to introducing and passing directly out of the account holder's account. legislation. That is the backdrop against which the I turn to the proposition that the House is considering the bill which is before underlying issue this bill addresses arises as us this evening. The bill contains provisions a result of the government's desperate and which would, firstly, allow ADIs to exclude unseemly grab for cash. Legislation was accounts from being treated as containing introduced following a measure included in unclaimed moneys in circumstances where, the 2012-13 Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal as at the assessment date, they met the test. Outlook. The effect of that legislation, There has been no activity in this account for which, as I have indicated, has been passed 12 months, and now the government has into law for sometime now, is that the time absconded with their funds and we are faced with periods before which a bank account can be what will undoubtedly be an administrative nightmare just to get our own money returned to treated as unclaimed moneys has been us. This is a hassle we do not need and bitterly shortened from seven years to three years. resent. There have also been changes regarding life It is bad enough paying thousands in taxes insurance and superannuation accounts. This every year without the government stealing was a desperate grab for cash which will net money from our bank accounts. We understand the government nearly $900 million over the the principles behind remitting funds in inactive four-year period to 2015-16, but the ethics of accounts to a government agency and have no this approach are highly questionable. It calls argument with the basic objectives, but the new to mind the image of a desperate parent who 12-month rule is just a nightmare and an has so mismanaged the household finances extremely inconvenient government intrusion into that he or she is reduced to breaking open our personal affairs for no useful purpose. their child's bank account to scrabble for We feel we have been mugged and our money some coins to try to deal with the chaotic stolen. It is an absolute disgrace. situation of the family budget. I think my two constituents, who I have As other speakers from the coalition have quoted, have put this matter very well. articulately pointed out this evening, there The second point I put this evening is that has been a storm of community protest about authorised deposit-taking institutions have these extraordinary provisions. I quote from been put into a very difficult position in a constituent: needing to comply with this legislation. ForI am writing to inform you that today I went to example, the Australian Bankers' Association my bank account to complete a transaction where had this to say: I was informed my account had been closed and The ABA believes there is no benefit for my money had been sent to the government. consumers from the changes.

Another comment I have received from a Isn't that just the constant chorus from every constituent in West Pymble states: stakeholder dealing with this government: I am just writing to say that I am appalled at 'without sufficient time' and 'without the Labor Party's grab on inactive accounts after adequate rules to support the 12 months. My four children have a small super implementation'? fund and a savings account in that super fund which holds a small balance under $1,000. In the brief time remaining I want to turn to my third point, which is that the whole reason this bill is necessary tonight is to correct grave and gaping errors in the act that Mr Neumann interjectingwas passed into law only quite recently. This sorry: the parliamentary secretary at the table occurred because the government rushed it is saying something I cannot hear, but I will through. When the bill was before the House allow his interjection. What was that? we urged the government to slow down and Mr Neumann interjectingwe urged it to take time to address the issues in a disorderly and chaotic way. Of course, you know it is theft! The member at the table yet again, the hopelessly chaotic, knows that it is theft. The member for Blair disorganised and unprofessional Ruddprobably has examples in his own electorate: Gillard government failed to accept that people who have had their bank accounts advice. As a result, they have created an raided by this Labor government. He has extraordinary mess and it has now been some explaining to do when they ring his necessary to pass this additional piece of office and say: ' Mr Neumann, why are my legislation to correct the mess.

The government, however, moneys previously treated as unclaimed, brought in its own amendments. They sought from seven years to three years. to amend the commencement date of the Superannuation accounts with balances of schedules in order to provide for more time less than $2,000 and accounts of for authorised deposit-taking institutions, unidentifiable members that had been first homeowner savings account providers, inactive for 12 months were required to be life insurers and superannuation funds to transferred to the Commissioner of Taxation. implement the changes with no financial It was reducing from five years to 12 impact as a result of the change in months-12 months!-the period of commencement.

That is $300 billion and $12 was simply not there. The government has billion a year in interest repayments. Yet, at given way and brought in this bill to enable the time they took office from us, we left two things to occur: that where the account them with no debt, we had a surplus and we has been reactivated, they are not obliged to had money in the bank. And you had an in fact transfer the money; and that where the increase in revenue of between $70 billion ADIs have in fact sent the money they can and $80 billion, but your expenditure has actually repay it. been $120 billion. This has meant, quite What an extraordinary tale of woe it is in frankly, that at every turn you have dealing with individuals' property. But, overspent the amount of money that is again, why should we be surprised? Because coming in by recklessly choosing to base it the Labor government, as a collectivist on projections for incoming revenuegovernment, always believes that it can projections which have been so out of kilter spend individuals' money more wisely than with reality that we now have this huge the individuals can themselves.

The debate over the NBN, of course, has been contentious, but the rollout has been proceeding for long enough now for there to be some objective facts on the ground and, indeed, in the ground. The first point that the coalition have made is that the fibre rollout is well behind schedule. The original NBN Co. corporate plan published at the end of 2010 forecast that fibre would be available and connected to 950,000 brownfield and 319,000 greenfield premises by June 2013. As at the end of May the fibre network had passed 71,000 brownfield and 32,000 greenfield premises. That is a catastrophic shortfall. It is not just a question of falling short of the 2010 forecasts. By brownfield, of course, honourable members understand I am talking about the already built-up areas as opposed to new developments. I mentioned that the first forecast was 950,000 to be passed by end June 2013. In August last year their new corporate plan slashed that down to 286,000, then in March 2013, just a few months ago, that target was again reduced to between 155,000 and 175,000, and as of mid-May the fibre network had passed only 71,000 brownfield premises. This is one shortfall after another. There have been cascading forecasts, the target is dropping down, and it says something about the management of this business and their capacity to forecast. They set a new target in August last year, they then had to dramatically reduce it in March this year, and now it appears they are going to fall short of a target that was set 90 days prior to the target date. There are no forecasts in the corporate plan that one can take seriously. This slowness of the rollout is a very significant issue. Honourable members will understand that one of the arguments in favour of the National Broadband Network has always been that having everyone in Australia connected to very fast broadband will deliver economy-wide benefits, big spillover effects, externalities. We do not doubt that those benefits are there to have ubiquitous connection to very fast broadband. The big question is: what is the incremental benefit, if any, between having people connected to very fast broadband at the speeds it can be achieved under the approach we favour-in most built-up areas, fibre-to-the-node-and having fibre-to-the-premises? The one thing that is clear-and there is no argument in any of the literature or in experience-is that having everyone connected to very fast broadband, even at speeds much slower than the peak speeds available on fibre, is a real benefit. The problem that we face, therefore, with the NBN's slow rollout is that we are not getting the benefits of ubiquitous connectivity any time soon, and perhaps we",160,Notices

182,Mr Turnbull (Wentworth) (12:16,"I want to draw honourable members' attention tomight not be getting them for 20 years or so. At the current rate of progress the completion of this network will take many decades. In our re-examination of the NBN's financial model, in our alternative policy, we assumed that it would take another four years to complete. That is a very optimistic assumption. At the moment the NBN is passing less than a quarter of the number of premises it should be passing, even according to its revised corporate plan. For a project that is passing around 350 premises a day, as it is at the moment, to seriously imagine that in 18 months or so it is going to be passing well over 6,000 a day is just incredible. The reality is that this project is going to be long delayed. That means that the benefits of universal or ubiquitous connectivity will also be long delayed. It is cold comfort to say to somebody-and there are at least two million premises in Australia in this category that have, effectively, no broadband at all since they do not have broadband at a speed that would enable them to watch a YouTube video-'Don't worry, you are going to get the Rolls Royce option, the fibre-to-the-premises option, in 10 years or 20 years time.' That may well be beyond the lifetimes of some of the occupants of these premises, and it is certainly beyond the time their children will be at school. The issue really boils down to a fundamental one of management. There is an argument about technology, but even if you accept Labor's argument about technology the fact is that the project is just not getting there. One of the problems that we are seeing is that the civil contractors who have been employed-Silcar, Transfield, Syntheo and Visionstream-have not been delivering the premises that they have been contracted to deliver. It is common knowledge in the industry that they are all losing a huge amount of money. The word on the street, as it were, is that these contractors will need to have contract prices increased by something in the order of 30 per cent of the current contracted rates if they are able to make any money or any margin at all. That being the case, what does that tell us about the reliability of the NBN Co.'s cost forecasts? It has a corporate plan that its management tells us is based on the current contracted costs, yet we know that the contractors are going backwards financially. This has had some pretty dramatic results: the Silcar CEO Peter Lamell left the company in May; the Service Stream managing director, Graeme Sumner, left the company in April; and the Syntheo joint venture appears to be about to be dissolved. The failure to have satisfactory commercial relationships with the civil contractors is a profound failure of the NBN Co., because it does not have a huge civil workforce of its own and is not proposing to have a huge workforce of its own, although it has sought to take over the management of the construction in the Northern Territory. But it needs to have a satisfactory relationship with its civil contractors and it needs to have contracts with them that enable them to pay their subbies a fair price and make a margin for themselves. If they cannot do that, it simply will not continue. We have set them out in some detail in this dissenting report. I spoke earlier about the asbestos issue. I will not go over all of that ground again. But the coalition are very concerned that the Commonwealth will be liable for asbestos risk, notwithstanding that it is in Telstra pits that are being remediated by contractors working for Telstra. As you know, the Work Health and Safety Act imposes on NBN Co. a duty to workers, including workers employed by-for example-Telstra or contractors to Telstra if their work is influenced or directed by NBN Co. It is very arguable, it seems to us, that NBN Co. is in that position of influence and therefore could have liability for this asbestos risk. We are particularly concerned that the issue of asbestos has been well-known for a long time and this does not reflect well on either Telstra or NBN Co. There has clearly been a failure of supervision on the part of both companies. I simply note and draw the attention of honourable members to the comments that we have made there. I want to now turn to the question of the fixed wireless rollout, which has not had enough public debate or discussion because the fibre-to-the-premise rollout is so much bigger. Fixed wireless is the technology solution for about four per cent of the country. Under the plan, 93 per cent gets fibre-to-the-premise, four per cent gets fixed wireless and three per cent gets satellite. I might say that under the approach that we would sake many of those premises or households in the fixed wireless footprint at present will get wire line, fixed line, very fast broadband. They are in towns that have less than 1,000 premises, which will not get fibre-to the-premise under Labor's approach but which will be eminently suitable for a vectored VDSL fibre-to-the-node solution of the kind that we are proposing. There are many smaller communities in rural and regional Australia that will get much faster and much more convenient broadband services under our approach than they will under Labor's approach. Looking at the way the NBN Co. is tracking at the moment, it has been reported that even on their best case scenario their fixed wireless network will cover only 31,291 premises by the end of June, which is only 45 per cent of the 70,000 target. The explanations for this shortfall given by the NBN Co. management frankly beggar belief. Their explanation is-and this has been given by the minister as well-that there has been an unanticipated level of tall trees in rural and regional Australia. I will quote the evidence from the NBN chief technology officer, Gary McLaren, in estimates of 30 May in which he talked about these trees. He said: We have always expected there will be some areas, mainly due to vegetation-trees and the likethat will cause those installations to not be able to pass through that qualification step …We are seeing those being slightly higher than we would have originally expected. Being ambushed-bushwhacked-by the presence of tall trees in regional Australia is a fairly pathetic excuse. But it does underline the poor planning and the poor management of this project. Finally, I want to touch on the very, very troubling issues about management. We have at the moment a new chairman, Siobhan McKenna. She has been on the NBN board from the outset but she became chairman on 21 March, replacing Harrison Young. She has said publicly that she is taking a much tougher approach to management. She has said that she does not want Senator Conroy, the minister, being able to communicate directly with NBN Co. Chief Executive Mike Quigley, although Senator Conroy seems to have said that he will not play along with that. More troublingly, it is being widely reported-and has not been anywhere denied-that Siobhan McKenna has, on behalf of the board, sought the dismissal of the Chief Executive, Mr Quigley, and that she has no confidence in him. If this were a publicly listed company, belonging to a bunch of superannuation funds and private investors, and there was published in the newspaper a report saying that the chairman had no confidence in the chief executive and wanted the chief executive sacked, that matter would have to be resolved within hours. And, yet, we have at the moment with this company, the biggest infrastructure project in our history, a situation where the management is tearing itself to pieces, the board is opposed to the chief executive-it sounds like the Labor Party caucus, frankly-and there is no denial, clarification or confirmation. When Mr Quigley was sought to be questioned about this in estimates, as we have set out in this dissenting report, Senator Conroy prevented him from answering any questions. This project, sadly, is in utter chaos. This dissenting report, which I commend to honourable members, sets out in some detail the sorry tale of mismanagement that the NBN project is today. (Time expired) report-the fifth and final report of the joint committee. It is a project that has had a great degree of oversight in the rollout and in the management of the project itself. In fact, I have from time to time been concerned that we have overlaid too much oversight. I am certainly one for, obviously, the parliamentary ability to probe and test the way in which government business enterprises like this operate. But, when you consider all of the ways in which this project has people looking at it, you would not have a similar level of investigation imposed on an organisation external to government. Having said that, NBN Co. has always sought-from my impression, and I am sure it would be the impression of others, particularly on the government side-to cooperate with questions and to be available to answer inquiries from members of parliament. Be it in estimates, the joint committee or the public hearings, they have tried to do the right thing, to talk about a project that is going to transform this nation. There is no doubt that this will economically transform the way that we operate, and it will put us at an advantage compared to other countries that have not been able to do this to the same breadth and the same level of detail that has been undertaken in this project. It is an investment of just over $30 billion in a technology that is already, through the internet-if you take on board the Deloitte study-contributing about $50 billion in economic value to this country currently, and will contribute $70 billion into the future. It has already been indicated that that investment will have a return of seven per cent, but, to be honest, I see that the actual return itself will come when you look at the way that it will change the manner in which the economy operates, the way in which firms operate, the way in which communities connect and interrelate, the way that education is delivered in this country, and the way that health care is delivered in this country. On top of these things, the fact that there are applications and there are ways in which technology that is not currently known will do the same thing, is something to note. I had the opportunity recently to speak to a venture tech firm, BlueChilli, that operate out of Sydney. They bring together capital and people who want to transform the way in which things are done at the moment through their own ideas, their own innovative energy, and completely alter the way in which people operate and conduct their business. These types of firms, from what I have seen-and this firm is based in the Sydney CBD-are doing remarkable things in terms of changing the way the business operates. And they certainly always encourage the innovators within their organisations to continue to think differently about what can be done, what we do now and how we can do it differently, and how we can add value to the economy. These are the types of firms that get unleashed when they have access to a technology that has been using, as a platform, what we are doing through the National Broadband Network.",162,Committees
183,Mr Husic (Chifley) (12:31,"It is a great pleasure of mine to be able to speak to thisThrough this process we have tackled a massive capacity constraint. It is well known that the former government was told by bodies such as the Reserve Bank that capacity constraints would limit the ability of the economy to grow and that failing to do so would hurt the economy into the longer term. Those opposite tried, as has been reflected upon here, 19 times to address the fact that people could not get access to broadband. I represent people who had previously been stuck in a dial-up world-or a broadband wasteland, as I have described itand faced very little chance that they would actually get access to modern telecommunications infrastructure. As a result of what we have been doing, we have been able, through a combination of the work being done by Telstra and the rollout being done by NBN Co., to free these people from being stuck with dial-up, which in this day and age is the technological equivalent of a dinosaur. We have freed suburbs such as Woodcroft and Doonside from that. Last week my colleague the member for Greenway and I were proud to turn the NBN on in Blacktown with the minister for communications, Stephen Conroy. This has already seen 1,300 homes having access to the NBN at the outset. What has also been great is that RSPs like Telstra and Optus are out there now actively seeking customers and getting a tremendous response from customers who are wanting to sign up. In actual fact, if you look at the fifth report itself-and this is important-on page 19 it indicates that the revenue that NBN is receiving as a result of the RSPs going out and connecting customers and having this then flow back to NBN Co was $5.3 million and has risen by nearly $2 million since June of last year. So, in a short space of time it is already increasing the amount of money that it is generating as a result of customers coming onboard. And, as has been anecdotally indicated to me, once the customers get onboard with the NBN their usage changes. They use more and they want to be able to-and are certainly happy to-change their plans, because they are getting value for money per gigabyte that they are using as a household. And households like small businesses-for example, accounting firms that operate from home and design firms that operate from home-are now able to access a network. The more these home based businesses operate and the more people can change the way in which they work through telework, the more we will see other benefits. For example, in Western Sydney we are plagued very much by this issue of congestion in terms of traffic and the like. Being able to have economic development in local areas rather than having people feel that they have to travel long distances to conduct work will have huge economic benefit. I mentioned earlier that there are other countries that have tried to do what we are doing. If you look at the US in particular, Verizon, through its fibre optic service, had gone to five states but has slowed down in its delivery because it does not have a dedicated investment program, unlike what is happening here. And Google is now rolling out fibre in Kansas and Utah and is expecting that these networks will operate profitably. Others are catching up and recognise that the use of this fibre instead of copper-fibre that delivers light at 300,000 kilometres per second and delivers a signal that has much more capacity and benefit and ability than anything that can be delivered on fibre-is a serious way in which to construct a future network. That is why, when the opposition were in government, they had committees looking at this, and the member for Sturt even indicated in reports that he authored that, hands down, fibre is the best form of technology to deliver a modern broadband network. Certainly that has been evident, and there is very little to suggest otherwise. There is a suggestion that there will be a better form of technology-for example, a reliance on vectoring. Yes, vectoring does have its benefits, but most people will tell you that it is nowhere near as good as having fibre to the premises. Those opposite have had to come up with a policy for the sake of a policy but, having spent the best part of this parliamentary term determined to kill off this project, they have been unable to, due to two things. Firstly, they have an idea that nothing is wrong with the current broadband network in this country-and that does not stack up. Secondly, they have realised that businesses and the community expect a modern, robust form of infrastructure that will ensure that the country can progress in the years ahead and not stumble along in the way that they had been overseeing it when they were in office. The opposition are continually focussed on the claim-and we continue to get this; we heard it from the member for Wentworth, and others, not necessarily those currently in the chamber, will probably bleat on today in reference to it-that NBN Co has failed to meet its forecast. In fact, the member for Wentworth today used the term 'catastrophic failure'. An honourable member interjectingphysical or financial sense. Financial ruin would occur as a result of the failure, in their words, to meet the targets. It is an absurd claim. They well know that the 2011-13 corporate plan was produced well before any definitive agreements had been signed up, before one of the biggest corporate agreements was signed with Telstra and before the Optus deal was even finalised, to ensure the handover of their network and their agreement in terms of the way in which NBN Co rolls out the network. They know that no-one in this country could have predicted that the ACCC would have brought down a points-of-interconnect decision that would see the points of interconnection increase by a multitude, from 14 to 121. Those opposite had never predicted it. It suits their political argument to say that it does not meet the target, while neglecting to mention the things that have happened in between. Any company will have to, from time to time, confront roadblocks and work out how they structure their corporate plans accordingly. Those opposite are unable to have the decency to tell the Australian public why these figures had changed. There is no doubt that this project, as it picks up speed, will roll out further and further, and will not necessarily be held up by the type of scare campaigns that have been put by those opposite. We had the member for Wentworth, for example, picking up on this issue of asbestos. No-one doubts for one moment that the issue is one that is critical and needs to be managed properly. Asbestos has sat in the Telstra system for decades, and then the member for Wentworth says in an offhand remark that this has been known for some time by NBN and Telstra. Yes, it has been known by Telstra. I would be interested to go back to the initial prospectus that was put out as it was being privatised to see whether or not it was denoted as a risk. What did those opposite do, when they were in government for 13 years, about the issue of asbestos? In any due diligence process you would know that it is an issue and you would have to deal with it. I would be interested to know now what the opposition, in government, did to mitigate risk. The fact of the matter is that there are very smart people in Telstra, who, while they will not be able to pinpoint right now where these things are on a network map, will be able to determine this, based on likely roll-out. They will be able to deal with it where the roll-outs",165,Committees
184,Mr Husic,"He is using a word that denotes something extremely harmful either in aoccur, at any point in time, and they do. For example, in Kiama, where Silcar was used on the project, they had trained up all their staff and ensured that all the equipment was present and did not have one problem with the issue of asbestos. Asbestos is being used as a Trojan Horse by those opposite. I am not having them now confect a concern about asbestos when I, like many other people, heard the dismissive words expressed by the Leader of the Opposition to Bernie Banton. It was one of the most disgraceful episodes I have witnessed and it is beneath the Leader of the Opposition. If he has found a concern about asbestos I welcome it, but he should remember that his previous words haunt him in this regard. The other thing I want to mention is workforce planning. There has been a great deal of reference made in the report to workforce planning and subcontractor planning. It has been one issue that I have been particularly interested in from the get-go. Before my life here as a member of parliament, it was something that I represented as the national president of a union that covers workers in this area. We have enormous talent that exists out there that we need to employ and deploy on this project. One of the concerns that I have is that Telstra should be used more and more in the rollout of this project, because they do have people within Telstra, in the lines and in the field workforce, who can be used. One of the regrets I have is that NBN Co. has been stuck in a model that has been used and employed for many years in the sector, which is a contract-subcontract model. I doubt very much those opposite will move away from it. My issue with it is that NBN Co. does not have an internal workforce, and that internal workforce could easily be supplied by Telstra. You will not necessarily need an asset manager into the future with fibre. Fibre obviously costs a lot to deploy but costs very little to maintain into the future. There are people within Telstra and we should be forming a relationship with Telstra so they can be used more and more on the rollout of this project. This will ensure that the skills that are there within the sector can be employed to their best possible ability. It will also ensure that Telstra can aid NBN Co. in what is critical for them: network mapping, being able to determine the structure of the network and having robust systems into the future. I welcome this committee and all the work that it has done. It has done a great job for this parliament. In particular I note the contribution of the chairperson. (Time expired) concerning report. I noted that the member for Chifley said that the project confronted a few roadblocks, or a roadblock. I think the real concern here is that we are not confronting a roadblock, we are confronting a train wreck. We are confronting a train wreck because we have got a project that has not met a single target that has been set. That is of concern. They have had the opportunity to set the targets. They have not met one. By now we are supposed to be passing some 1.3 million houses. So how many houses or premises are we going to pass? We are not going to pass 1.3, we are not going to pass a million, we are not going to pass 500,000 houses. As we sit in wonder, the real question is: are we going to meet the revised, revised, revised target of 190,000 houses passed? Are we going to make it? I would suggest not. Let us look at connections. Around about now, 511,000 houses were to be connected, in just a couple weeks. How many are we going to connect? If we are lucky, 20,000 to 25,000. This is a project that needs to connect 6,000 houses a day to meet the targets that it set for itself. This is not a target set by the opposition. This is the target set by NBN Co -6,000",167,Committees
185,Mr Hartsuyker (Cowper) (12:46,"I welcome the opportunity to speak on this ratherhouses a day. I think you would have to believe in Santa Claus and the Easter bunny to believe they are going to achieve that. If it were possible for things to become worse, well, they certainly have. NBN Co. is now further behind schedule that it was at the last report. The budget has blown out more than it was as at the last report. The rollout has slowed to a crawl. We have had the problems that have been mentioned by the member for Wentworth. We have the asbestos problem which that master of illusion, Mr Quigley, said was no real problem at all; 'no real problem at all', he said back in the April hearings. 'Don't you worry about that by golly, just a little bit of asbestos, not a problem at all.' Yet somehow he expects us to believe that, despite a range of sites being on hold, we are going to somehow meet the targets that he set for himself. History will show clearly that those targets will be missed. We have an interim satellite solution that is running out of capacity. We have NBN Co. staff rushing for the exits. We have an NBN Co. board that is trying to have the CEO removed from his post. It is a project in crisis. It is a project that is heading for disaster. If a publicly listed company was in this position it would probably be in a trading halt-although I do not know that anyone would buy shares in NBN Co., given its past history, so a trading halt would probably be a mere technicality. A publicly listed company would be being required to make certain disclosures to the Australian stock exchange to get to the real situation with regard to the company. But, unlike a publicly listed company, NBN Co. is a black box. Every piece of information concerning this project must be prised out. We have this Orwellian regime of misinformation perpetrated by the CEO, Mr Quigley. He makes sure that absolutely no information that is useful is divulged to the parliamentary committee that has responsibility for oversight of this project. We have tens of billions of taxpayer dollars at stake, and the Australian taxpayer is not being given clear and concise information as to the true status of this project. Every time the committee asked for information about the latest disaster we were told the information was commercial in confidence or that we somehow did not need to know this information. The only risk posed by releasing much of this information to the Joint Committee on the NBN is embarrassment to the government. And it is an embarrassment. The chair of the committee, Mr Oakeshott, the member for Lyne, seems to be saying that everything is going okay. He said just yesterday that 'the NBN remains on track to deliver a rate of return to the taxpayer of over 7 per cent per annum'. Well, we will see. The member for Lyne is in fact complicit in the regime of deceit and dishonesty that this committee has had to endure. They are actually running a protection racketMr Mitchell: Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The member is making some very serious inferences at the member for Lyne.

Instead of talking about terms and allowing the light to shine in, the true status of this project remains a mystery. Let's look at the wireless rollout. What is the status of the wireless rollout?

Of course not. According to recent media reports, it is going to be 31,000 premises. The government will tell us it is right on target, right on track. We are not even halfway to the target that has been set by NBN Co. for itself-just another example. And they had the audacity to say that they underestimated the number of trees in regional Australia. It was a major technical hitch when they found there were big trees in regional Australia. It is a real concern. Mr Mitchell: What was your last plan? They have entered into a whole range of agreements that have been problematic. When this project was conceived, the iPhone was released. Two years later the iPad was released. This project has not taken into account the huge shift in the amount of people using mobile networks. One of the other concerns with this is that there has been a neglect of mobile services. There has been a total disregard for the situation with regard to mobile services in regional areas. In fact, Senator Conroy has said we are going to wait until the wireless network is rolled out in 2015 before we address the issue highlighted in the Regional Telecommunications Review-that of poor mobile services. I think the Australian people would be concerned as to whether the wireless rollout will be completed by 2015. We are not even up to half the scheduled rollout rate so far. I think you would have to, once again, believe in Santa Claus or the Easter bunny to believe that this government will bring it in by 2015. Another interesting factor was in relation to the interim satellite service cap. It was revealed at the last round of the committee hearings that the interim satellite service cap of 48,000 customers would be reached by 2014, and the government has no intention of increasing the cap. So some people in remote Australia and in many areas of regional Australia will be left with no internet service for more than two years, until the long-term satellite solution is brought online. People who rely on the satellite internet will have no other option. The interim satellite solution is the only link for a range of customers. The government said that it would be too expensive to increase the cap beyond 48,000. The minister said that it would cost $86 million to increase the cap by 7,000 customers from 48,000 to 55,000. I have to say that every person I have consulted in the satellite industry has said that those numbers are rubbish. It is widely accepted that there is sufficient capacity in the market to increase the cap to around 75,000 customers-an additional 27,000. The published cost for the interim satellite service is $300 million for 48,000 customers and, when you do the maths, that works out to be around $6,250 per customer. But, based on the minister's figures, to add 7,000 to the cap was going to cost an additional $12,285 a customer. How does that work? If you have been able to set up your overheads and all the costs of setting up the interim satellite solution at a total cost of $6,250 per customer, why does it cost you around double that to purchase additional capacity when it is available in the market? That is a mystery that remains unsolved. If the cap is not increased the teams of installers currently working on the interim satellite solution will be disbanded and there will be a whole installation system and labour force that will need to be rebuilt from the ground up, which will mean it will take even longer for the",169,Committees
188,Mr Hartsuyker,"They underestimated the number of trees, Member for McEwen.NBN to roll out its long-term satellite solution. In reality the government has simply abandoned regional Australia by its failure to address this very important shortfall in the project with the need to continue the interim satellite solution past the cap. This is the government's track record, or NBN Co.'s track record, of being late with regard to everything. This is a project that is of concern to taxpayers. It is a project that has not passed the test of accountability. It is a project that revolves around concealment and deceit rather than true transparency. I believe that, if the coalition were elected on 14 September, it will be the first opportunity to view the true status of this project and the true situation with regard to progress and costs, which have been concealed from the parliament to this point in time. So, I certainly raise very real concerns about the future of the project and I raise very real concerns about the accountability to this parliament. Ms ROWLAND (Greenway) (12:57): I am very pleased to speak in support of the fifth report of the Joint Committee on the National Broadband Network. We come into this place to talk about the biggest infrastructure project in Australia's history and to have those opposite come forward and rubbish it, I think, says everything about their debate on the NBN that has gone on in this 43rd Parliament. Much to the coalition's despair, and unfortunately for them, the NBN keeps getting more and more popular as a policy. I am disappointed because, for the last speech that the member for Wentworth is going to make in the 43rd Parliament on the NBN, I really wanted him to give a blow-by-blow account of the 'fraudband' launch. How awkward was it? It was awks to the max! The Leader of the Opposition was moving into the shadows and saying, 'Come into the dark, Malcolm. Come to the dark side.' I thought he was going to start speaking like Darth Vader. It was absolutely embarrassing to watch, but amusing at the same time. I was hoping that the member for Wentworth was going to talk about that, but alas, no. Their comments are despite the fact that people like Vint Cerf, the father of the internet, has given his blessing to this project on many, many occasions. This is despite the fact that we had the CeBIT conference in Australia only a couple of weeks ago where, again, we were lauded as a government for our forward-thinking policy on this matter. As well, the ITU holds up Australia as an example of best practice in national broadband rollout. One of the biggest complaints I still get from people is not that the NBN is happening but is, 'When am I going to get it?' People have waited for so long in backwaters of not only regional Australia but outer metropolitan cities as well. I was disappointed he has left the chamber, because the member for Cowper talked about the government abandoning regional Australia. He is the bloke who sold out on regional Australia. I will give you some facts and I will give you some evidence to support that in just a moment. Just to go back a bit, firstly, I feel sorry for the member for Cowper having to come in here and push the member for Wentworth's lines on this matter. But let's not forget that when Telstra was fully privatised, when those opposite were in government, the Nats were absolutely sold down the river. They took all the elements that should have been about regional accessibility and affordability, moved them into a separate piece of legislation and told everyone that that would be okay. The member for Chifley mentioned it but I will talk a bit more about the sell-off process that not only led to issues with the Telstra pits that we see today but also made Australia, and confirmed Australia's position as, an absolute broadband backwater-behind countries like Estonia and many countries of Eastern Europe. I will not have the member for Cowper coming in here and saying these things. He talked about mobile and fixed. I feel like I have been giving this same lecture, the same lessons, to some people opposite over and over again. The inability to understand the difference between mobile, wireless and fixed wireless is simply beyond me. It is a debate that was settled many, many years ago-that mobile and fixed are complementary, not substitutable, and that fixed wireless services require a backbone. In this case you look to the best backbone that you can build to maximise capacity, and that is a fibre backbone. It is no wonder that mobile operators are enthusiastically embracing the NBN for the opportunity to fibre up their base stations. The member for Cowper talked about the lack of mobile access. In the early 2000s we had an attempt to introduce USO contestability in Australia. We had a pilot project for the Pacific Highway, running through the member for Cowper's own electorate, for which bidding was done, and which resulted in absolutely no measurable improvement. So the only thing that was done on this matter by those opposite when they were in government on this matter was an absolute, abject failure. I will take up a few issues to do with regional Australia, which is one of the things I really want to talk about in relation to this particular report. There is the issue of a universal wholesale price under Labor's NBN versus there being no equivalent under the broadband plan of those opposite. I will quote from the Hansard of the public hearing on Friday 19 April. I specifically asked the question of Ms Teresa Corbin of ACCAN: I presume you are also aware that the government has imposed a universal wholesale price for the NBN and, in light of your comments about affordability, how important is it not to discriminate against people who live in outer metropolitan areas and regional areas? She answered: This is very important to our members. I went on to ask: What feedback do you get already from consumers living in regional areas in particular about things like the digital divide? She went on to explain how it is very important for people living in regional Australia to have the same opportunities for affordability and accessibility as those living in the city. Yet again, I am disappointed he did not stick around. I ask: what did the member for Cowper do to improve broadband in his electorate when he was part of a government? How many failed plans did we have from those opposite that produced no measurable improvements in broadband across Australia? I would like to turn to something the member for Wentworth took some time mentioningchapter 4 of the dissenting report, and specifically item 4.1. To be quite frank, I find it rather tawdry that those opposite want to come in here and start talking about-it is like a gossip chapter-the new chair of NBN Co. and the CEO of NBN Co., quoting various articles from News Limited, from The Australian and the Australian Financial Review. They have a recommendation in which they cannot even spell Ms McKenna's name properly, but I digress. It is absolutely ridiculous for the member for Wentworth and those opposite to have spent so much time and energy on a chapter called 'Unstable governance and question over board's confidence in CEO.' Something that I learnt very early on-and I would have thought the member for Wentworth, as someone who is always coming in here talking about all the big deals that he has done with Rupert and friends, would have lectured me on this-is that the people who you are sitting opposite to and doing a deal with may one day very well be the people on your team. You do not want to go off making bizarre accusations and relying on hearsay and gossip. You want to rely on the facts. I find it absolutely ridiculous for the member for Wentworth to choose to spend so much time on this particular issue. He does himself great discredit. It is merely an attempt to again try and smear Mr Quigley. Whatever reasons he has for doing that, they are his own and I will leave him to it. We again had those opposite come in here and start talking about the rollout targets. But the reality is that at the end of May NBN Co. was on track to beat its revised June rollout targets and to pass between 171,836 homes and 185,808 premises with fibre by the end of June-far exceeding its set target. It must be very disappointing for those opposite to have seen support for Labor's existing policy increase after those opposite released their policy. Prior to the release of 'fraudband', 73 per cent of people surveyed supported Labor's NBN. After 'fraudband' was released, that went up to 78 per cent. That must be striking a very raw nerve. I have called out MPs before who say one thing in their electorates about how much they support increasing broadband opposite but who do something else when they come to Canberra. I am going to call out a few more. You will like this one, member for Moreton. This is a special one from the member for Moncrieff. On5 June he sent a letter out to his electorate. I do not know what is the most disturbing thing about this. The opening line reads: 'Access to fast broadband is no longer a want; it is rapidly becoming a need for Gold Coast households and businesses.' It is not already a need? 'It is rapidly becoming a need'? Then there is a typo, but I digress. There are then some claims made. I quote: 'When Labor first announced the NBN in 2007, they said it would cost around $4.7 billion and be completed by 2013. Since then, Labor changed the forecast and said it would cost taxpayers $37 billion. Now we know it's actually going to cost taxpayers around $94 billion.' Where does this come from? I specifically asked the NBN Co. about this when it appeared before the committee. And remember that these committee proceedings had the same rules as the parliament. I said: Mr Quigley, I want to go back to your briefing at the start, just to be crystal clear. The NBN costs $37.4 billion. What veracity should then be given to assertions that the NBN cost could in fact be around $90 billion? Mr Quigley said: I can only repeat that we are confident of the $37.4 billion figure. ThenI asked: Do you know how that $90 billion figure was derived? Mr Quigley said: No. How on earth can these people get away with making continuous false claims? I will quote some comments from Delimiter about this particular letter: … other elements of Ciobo's letter are demonstrably inaccurate, delivered without context, or could be considered highly contestable, in that they do not represent mainstream thinking in the telecommunications industry from the consensus of expert opinion. There is a lot more that I could say about that one. But in the time available I will instead move on to the member for Calare. The member for Calare claimed a couple of weeks ago that the coalition's national broadband policy would guarantee speeds of at least 25 gigabytes to all Australians by 2016, with Labor's policy to deliver a mere 100 kilobits. Now, 25 gigabytes is a pretty quick download speed. He also claimed that the coalition has guaranteed at least 25 gigs for everybody by 2016. It gets better. We have the Leader of the Nationals on Insiders with Barrie Cassidy a couple of weeks ago. This is pretty special; it was quite embarrassing to watch; the guy had no idea. He was asked by Barrie Cassidy: In your speech to the National Council meeting yesterdaywhich I presume was the Nats' meetingyou raised the NBN … you said under the Coalition every country household will have access to high speed broad band with a minimum speed 25 megabits per second, but how much will it cost householders to have access to that? Mr Truss could not answer. He said: Well it will be significantly cheaper than the NBN. Mr Cassidy asked: The NBN, under the existing arrangements, the access will be free? Mr Truss answered: … there will be still charges for … signing up. Mr Cassidy said: Yes but we're talking about connection fees to the house. Mr Truss said: Our connection fees will be lower. He was absolutely incapable of answering the question. The member for Chifley addressed some very important issues concerning asbestos. I too would be very keen to see what was in the documents when Telstra was fully privatised and what due diligence was done. There was the material risk in that everyone knew that many of those pits were built before World War II and would have asbestos lining in them. I do not remember any of the Liberals or the Nationals getting up in parliament at the time-and I followed the debate very closely-and saying, 'In the future, someone is probably going to open those pits and do some work in them. We'd better cover off this risk.' This has been uncontested: a direct result of the sell-off was the number of permanent staff that were made contractors. What was said in those public offer documents, in the sale documents, about the potential risk of having staff who become contractors rather than being directly employed by Telstra? I would be very interested to know these things. I will end by saying that this continues to be a very popular policy with the Australian people. I know it is popular in my electorate. Firms have moved to my area just to take up the benefit of the NBN, including the Good Egg Studio at Riverstone. The member for Wentworth came to Blacktown and admitted that Blacktown would become a city divided: people who have access to the NBN and those who do not. That is not what we want from the National Broadband Network. of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on the National Broadband Network. When you look at this report, the thing that is most striking is the contrast between a view of the world as some would wish it to be-including, I note particularly, the chair of the committee, the member for Lyne-and the view of reality. There is quite a disparity between the two. The member for Lyne is an unashamed true believer in the marvels of the National Broadband Network in the present form in which it is being implemented by the Labor government, which he helped bring to power. In his chair's foreword, he said about the National Broadband Network: It will make a big difference in many lives. It will strengthen our economy. It will promote our cultural identity in a flattening global culture … it will create opportunity and deliver equity for all Australians. He repeats the claim that it will 'promote Australian culture to the world', 'show respect to sectors like education as our second biggest export market'. The powers of the NBN appear to be almost limitless in the faith of the member for Lyne. He says it will 'play to our strengths by unlocking entrepreneurship as a nation'. He says: What an opportunity to promote Australia and expand our export economy by getting this build right. The chair of this committee, the member for Lyne, is a true believer in the capacity of the National Broadband Network to do all of these things. But I have to say, when I hear these overblown claims about what the NBN will do, my response is: no it won't. At the very highest, you could put the argument as follows. You could argue that the NBN is a necessary but not sufficient condition to achieve these marvellous outcomes-to promote Australia's cultural identity to the world, to unleash entrepreneurship. But to claim that building the NBN will 'deliver equity for all Australians' or will 'unlock entrepreneurship as a nation' is, I would suggest, an example of the kind of dangerously woolly thinking that is causing us to splash away so much money without being careful in our analysis of what we are getting for the money. It may be possible to argue-and it is a contentious proposition-that if you build and deliver an effective national broadband network it will encourage economic activity, it will encourage entrepreneurship. But there is that distinction that was hammered home in first-year philosophy: it may be a necessary but it is certainly not a sufficient condition. It is not enough to argue, as we repeatedly hear from the member for Lyne and other advocates for the NBN in its present form, that the mere construction of this network will lead 1,000 flowers to bloom. That is not true. There is much more that needs to happen. It may be that the NBN will assist in a range of outcomes, but it will not do it by itself. And to suggest, as the rhetoric in the chair's forward suggests, that it is sufficient to achieve these objectives, is misleading and is an indicator of the kind of fuzzy and woolly thinking that sadly has bedevilled far too much political commentary about NBN Co. So, if the first objection that I have to the particular philosophy that is articulated in those introductory comments is to say that, even if you believe all of these claims, at best the NBN can be a condition towards achieving the outcomes and much more needs to happen, then the second-and even more substantial-objection I have is this: before any of these wonderful claimed outcomes can be expected, you need to get the thing built, and you need to get it done quickly, cost-effectively and efficiently. And if there is one thing that is clear, as we look at",170,Committees
189,Mr Fletcher (Bradfield) (13:12,"I am very pleased to rise to speak on the fifth reportthe state of progress with the National Broadband Network, when you turn your eye away from the lofty claims about the marvels that this network is going to deliver, and get on to the more prosaic level of what is actually happening now-how much money has been spent, what we are getting for it, whether the rollout is on time and whether the network been well designed-the answer to all those things is: this is a mess. So the coalition makes no apologies for turning our eyes away from the wafting vision of the sunlit uplands, which the member for Lyne has once again been all too eager to lay before us. We make no apology for turning away and looking at the detail-and the detail is a very, very troubling picture. The proper role of this committee-on behalf of the Parliament of Australia and in turn on behalf of taxpayers who are compulsorily investors in this badly designed and ill conceived project-is to ask: how is it going? How much money is being spent? What is happening with the rollout? What confidence can we have that the project as presently conceived is going to be completed? All of that must necessarily and logically come before turning our minds to the marvels that the credulous member for Lyne appears to believe are just over the horizon. I am a very strong believer in broadband. I am a very strong believer in the economic and social benefits of broadband. I have worked in the telecommunications sector, both in government and in the private sector, for many, many years. In fact, I am so interested in broadband that I wrote a book about it-and what a festival of pointy headedness that was, if I may say! But I would make the point that it is simply not good enough to have these wafting generalities in the report that we have before us. We need to get into the detail on behalf of the parliament and on behalf of the Australian people to ask the detailed question, how is the rollout going? And when we turn to that question, the answer is unambiguous. The rollout is going very, very badly. Let us start by looking at some of the numbers. By 30 June 2013, according to NBN Co.'s first corporate plan released in December 2010, this network was supposed to pass 1.3 million premises. In fact, on the most recent numbers, as at May this year-so there is only a month to go-it had passed around 103,000 premises. We also see that the estimates of usage of the network are well behind what is forecast and we also see, extremely troublingly, that the build of the fixed wireless network is running into difficulty and is behind schedule and at the same time we see that NBN Co. continues to burn through cash and spend lavishly on headcount. Let me make this particular comment, coming as I do from a background in the telecommunications sector for many years. It is an open and notorious joke within the telecommunications sector that people are leaving existing telcos, particularly Telstra and Optus, and have been doing so for several years to go to roles at NBN Co. where they are paid very substantially in excess of what they were previously paid by their previous private sector employer. There is no question that NBN Co. is spending in a profligate fashion and is spending on staff and on other things in a way that no private sector telco would do. At the same time, the rollout is scandalously behind schedule and the performance which has been delivered is absolutely hopeless if you compare it to any benchmarks of what has been done. I cite, for example, the rollout within one year of the 3G network, the NextG network, under Sol Trujillo at Telstra. I have been critical of Sol Trujillo on many occasions, but Telstra's delivery of the NextG network within a very short period of time was an impressive engineering achievement. Or you could look at the rate at which both Telstra and Optus rolled out their HFC networks, their hybrid fibre-coaxial networks, across many cities of Australia during the mid-90s. If you look at the rate at which those networks were rolled out and you compare it to what has been achieved by NBN Co., it is chalk and cheese. Or you could look across the Tasman and you could have a look at what is being done in New Zealand. By December 2012, the Kiwis, with their fibre rollout, had passed 134,000 homes. Bear in mind that at that time NBN Co. in Australia had passed 72,400. The two rollouts began at roughly the same time. Australia is a country five times as large. If we had matched the performance of New Zealand, we would have been at several hundred thousand by December last year. Wherever you go, if you look at the private sector and its history of rollouts, both fixed and mobile in Australia, and if you look across the Tasman at an analogous rollout of a fibre broadband network, you see that NBN Co. is doing a very poor job against those benchmarks. Indeed, if you are looking for tangible evidence that the rollout is well behind where it was expected to be, you could look at the fact that funding in the budget in 2014 was reduced by $3.5 billion compared to what had originally been proposed as recently as the October Midyear Economic and Fiscal Outlook. Why is that? It was not a conscious cost reduction strategy or fiscal discipline by the Treasurer, because that is not the kind of Treasurer that we have. It is because the rollout is running well behind time. Those budget cuts are a consequence of a delay in the rollout. So when we look at the very basis, the very centre of what this committee should be focused on, on behalf of the taxpayers of Australia, in having oversight of this rollout and determining whether taxpayers' money is being spent well, whether the project is being managed efficiently and cost effectively, there is no conclusion which can be reached other than that there are very serious red flashing lights here. This rollout is in a mess and it is in a mess, unsurprisingly, because we have a government which is absolutely atrocious at implementation. We have seen that with school halls, we have seen that with the home insulation program and we are seeing it as well with the National Broadband Network. I mentioned the fact that the fixed wireless rollout is a long way behind schedule. According to the Australian Financial Review, even in the best case scenario by the end of June the wireless network will cover just 31,291 premises, which is only 45 per cent of the target of 70,000 that the fixed wireless network was supposed to reach. I come now to a question I have touched on already and will deal with in a bit more detail: the question of the NBN's management of human resources. There is no more important task in running a company than in managing your human resources efficiently. That means getting the right people in to do the job. It means paying them what you need to attract them, but no more-I have already talked about the extent to which NBN Co. has paid well in excess of market levels. It also means maintaining a capable team in place rather than churning through executives, senior management and directors on a regular basis. Unfortunately, from NBN Co. we have seen a very substantial amount of churn amongst senior management and indeed amongst directors. We are also seeing a very rapidly growing head count for NBN Co. As at the end of February there were 2,477 employees. That is an increase of nearly 50 per cent on staff numbers in June 2012. So this company is continuing to grow without restraint. It is continuing to add people even though the rollout, the core job it is there to do, is running very badly behind plan. This is a very significant contributor to the overall cost of this project, a cost that taxpayers are funding. It is another indicator of the way in which basic financial disciplines that you would see in a similar private sector investment project have been troublingly absent. On the question of churn of employees, since October 2009 some 14 senior executives and 55 executive level employees have left the company. There does appear to be significant evidence of unusually high levels of churn amongst the senior management team and amongst directors. I will close by referring to one other point that is touched on in this report, which is the meandering discussion about whether more private equity should be sought for NBN Co. This is something of an interest of the chair. It is a ridiculous interest that makes no sense, because the legislation says that you cannot have private sector equity until the build is finished, and five years later. The chair voted for that legislation, so he should know that. Debate adjourned. Marriage Amendment (Celebrant Administration and Fees) Bill 2013 Marriage (Celebrant Registration Charge) Bill 2013 Second Reading Cognate debate. Debate resumed on the motion: That this bill be now read a second time. implement a range of new fees in relation to registered and prospective Commonwealth registered celebrants under the Marriage Celebrants Program. Previously, Commonwealth registered marriage celebrants were not required to pay a fee to be authorised under the Marriage Celebrants Program. The bills also makes some minor amendments that relate to the administration of that program. The bills seek to implement an annual celebrant registration fee to existing Commonwealth registered celebrants and also registration fees for prospective celebrants who are seeking registration. The bills will also allow for the imposition of an application processing fee for those seeking an exemption from any of the above mentioned fees. Amendments in relation to the administration of the program seek to allow an Australian passport to be used as evidence to determine the date and place of birth of marrying parties. The requirement for the Registrar of Marriage Celebrants to conduct performance reviews on all marriage celebrants every five years will be removed. According to the Attorney-General's Department there are currently 10,500 Commonwealth registered marriage celebrants administered by the program in Australia, with an additional 500 being registered each year. Civil ceremonies now account for 71 per cent of all marriage ceremonies conducted in Australia-a substantial increase from two per cent when the program was first established in the early 1970s.",175,Committees
190,Mr Keenan (Stirling) (13:28,"These bills seek to amend the Marriage Act 1961 toI believe it is worth noting that the industry has considerable concerns about these bills as they are proposed by the government. The Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee, which is inquiring into these bills, received 113 submissions-largely from marriage celebrants themselves-and it is fair to say that marriage celebrants are not in favour of most of the recommendations within this bill, particularly the additional impost of fees. The government contends that it is necessary to implement the new fees to recover the costs of administering the large number of celebrants under the program. The other amendments relating to the administration of the program are considered to be noncontroversial. On 21 March 2013, the Senate jointly referred both of these bills for inquiry and report. However, the Senate report is not due until 5.00 pm today. The coalition is very keen to see what recommendations the Senate committee might make in relation to these bills. Of course, depending on what the committee recommends, we reserve our right to have a look at amending this bill in the Senate, although we do not oppose its passage through the House today. Sitting suspended from 13:31 to 13:35 Administration Charge Bill 2013 and the Marriage Amendment (Celebrant Administration and Fees) Bill 2013. These bills seeks to amend the Marriage Act 1961 to implement a range of new fees in relation to registered and prospective Commonwealth registered marriage celebrants under the marriage celebrants program, which is managed through the Attorney General's Department. The bills will also allow for the imposition of an application registration fee for those seeking an exemption from any of the above mentioned fees. There are also amendments in relation to the administration of the program that seek to allow an Australian passport to be used as evidence to determine the date and place of birth of marrying parties. Furthermore, the requirement for the Registrar of Marriage Celebrants to conduct performance reviews on all marriage celebrants every five years will be removed. Currently, there are three categories of people under the Marriage Act who are authorised to solemnise marriages in Australia. The first category includes ministers of a religion of a recognised denomination under section 26 of the act. These minister are nominated by their denomination-for example, by the Catholic or Anglican churches-and are registered and regulated by state and territory registrars of births, deaths and marriages. In total, there are approximately 24,500 people in this category. The second category includes officers in states and territories authorised to perform marriages as a part of their functions in registering marriages, of which there are approximately 730 in Australia. Again, they are regulated by state or territory registrars of births, deaths and marriages. The third category, which this bill addresses, are Commonwealth registered marriage celebrants registered by the Registrar of Marriage Celebrants in the Commonwealth Attorney-General's Department. This includes approximately 10,500 people who are civil celebrants or who are ministers of a religion whose denomination is not proclaimed under section 26 of the act. Currently, Commonwealth registered marriage celebrants are not required to pay a fee to be authorised under the marriage celebrants program. Under these changes, the fee will be set at",178,Bills
191,Mrs Prentice (Ryan) (13:35,"I rise to speak on the Marriage Celebranta maximum of $600 in 2013-14, with an application processing fee of $30 for those seeking an exemption from the annual celebrant registration charge, the registration application fee or the annual ongoing professional development obligations. The impetus to commence charging registration and administration fees is recognition of the changing nature of marriage ceremonies and therefore which category of marriage celebrant solemnises marriages. When the program was established in the early 1970s, approximately two per cent of marriage ceremonies were civil ceremonies. Today, that figure stands at approximately 71 per cent for all marriage ceremonies. Significant attempts at reforms have been made since 2001 to, according to the Attorney-General's Department, improve the transparency of the appointment process and improve the overall quality of the services provided to the public. Ultimately, from 2003 to 2012, the number of Commonwealth registered marriage celebrants grew from 3,632 at the end of 2003 to 10,467 at the end of 2012. The government announced in 2011 that it would introduce cost recovery for this program and would implement this from 1 July 2013. I find it curious that the government has waited this long to introduce the bill and that we are debating it today, considering that, although the Senate Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs is due to report on this bill today, 18 June, at this specific point in time the report has not been released. One of my constituents has reiterated to me her concerns about the imposition of a fee on marriage celebrants. Broadly speaking, it is important to consider the nature of the work that marriage celebrants do and the effort that goes into conducting it. As my constituent has noted, celebrants have a lot of expenses to get work. They need to advertise to the general community via the Yellow Pages, websites, social media, bridal magazines and other publications. Some attend wedding expos and other promotional events. There is a lot of expense in advertising each year, as well as insurance, peak body subscription fees to keep up to date and travel and publishing expenses. There is a fairly expensive course to become a celebrant, and then, often, some years waiting to be registered. Therefore, it is extremely important to consider that a celebrant needs to perform quite a lot of weddings each year just to break even. Given these upfront costs, the feedback that I have been receiving is in favour of the department implementing a fee per wedding. I understand that civil celebrants see the costs in terms of keeping up with new legislation and professional development as reasonable, but civil celebrants feel it is a step too far to then impose further fees on someone who may not be using the services of the department. To quote from my constituents specifically: 'Why would a celebrant doing, for example, 50 weddings a year pay the same annual fee as a celebrant starting out or working part-time doing just a couple of weddings a year?' 'I am happy to pay to attend an annual all-day professional development session, so I am already getting that information at my cost.' Civil celebrants are already paying to maintain their professional standards and therefore want to know exactly what they will be paying the federal department for with a proposed new annual fee. To their credit the government implemented a consultation process in 2011 on those proposed measures. I have noted some of the concerns of one such constituent who was closely involved in these deliberations. The Attorney-General's Department organised a consultation meeting in Brisbane in November 2011 which I understand was well attended by marriage celebrants. Many issues were raised regarding the imposition of an administration fee on those who act as marriage celebrants on a part-time basis. Those people were very much against the idea. Of course, it must be noted that well-established and full-time marriage celebrants would receive an advantage if there is, in fact, a decrease in the supply of marriage celebrants with perhaps hundreds or thousands dropping out of the program. The most recent anecdotal evidence I have heard is that imposing a fee may make it prohibitively expensive to continue to be involved and many may drop out of the marriage celebrant program. As I mentioned, to be a Commonwealth registered marriage celebrant one must first complete compulsory training courses, specifically a Certificate IV level qualification, which can be quite costly. A registration fee will be yet another cost to becoming a marriage celebrant. It is worthy to note, however, that for many who are working part-time or are considering starting out the imposition of a fee means that their participation in the marriage celebrant program will simply not be feasible. WhatI want to see and what the Senate committee should address is that the department needs to fully account for the costs involved in administering the program and, therefore, as part of the formal cost-recovery policy, it should be honest and upfront about how the fees will be used to cover those costs. I do note that the Attorney-General's Department have said in their submission that these fees will enable the department to improve the services delivered to marriage celebrants while also effectively regulating the celebrants. This does beg the question, of course, of whether the department considers the services they currently deliver to be adequate for the program. The department should identify how they will improve services and, indeed, which services they consider need improving. They also need to consider that if Commonwealth marriage celebrants do, in fact, drop out of the program, what affect will this have on the cost of administering the program. If costs are reduced, is it likely that the department will consider reducing the fees and charges? I do not hear of many examples where a government department actually genuinely cuts the fees it charges even if the associated costs are reduced. There do remain genuine concerns and questions which still need to be addressed. I will therefore wait to see the report of the Senate committee due on 18 June, today, and the recommendations therein. Sitting suspended from 13:44 to 16:00 Ms GAMBARO (Brisbane) (16:05): I rise to speak on the Marriage Amendment (Celebrant Administration and Fees) Bill 2013 and the Marriage (Celebrant Registration Charge) Bill 2013. These bills seek to amend the Marriage Act 1961 to implement a range of new fees in relation to registered and prospective Commonwealth registered marriage celebrants under the Marriage Celebrants Program. Previously, Commonwealth registered marriage celebrants were not required to pay a fee to be authorised under the Marriage Celebrants Program. The bills also make minor amendments relating to the administration of the program and seek to implement an annual celebrant registration fee to the existing Commonwealth registered celebrants and a registration fee for prospective celebrants seeking registration. The bills will also allow for the imposition of an application processing fee for those seeking an exemption from any of the above mentioned fees. The amendments in relation to the administration of the program seek to allow an Australian passport to be used as evidence to determine the date and place of birth of marrying parties. The requirement for the Registrar of Marriage Celebrants to conduct performance reviews on all marriage celebrants every five years will be removed. According to the Attorney-General's Department there are currently 10,500 Commonwealth registered marriage celebrants administered by the program in Australia and an additional 500 are registered each year. Civil ceremonies now account for 71 per cent of all marriage ceremonies conducted in Australia, a substantial increase from the two per cent when the program was first established, in 1970. It is worth noting industry concerns about these bills that are being proposed by the government. The Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee received 113 submissions, largely from marriage celebrants, on their inquiry into the bills. In their submission to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee, Marriage Celebrants Australia Inc. said: In our common commitment to professional and high quality marriage celebrants, both civil and independent religious celebrants, we urge consideration be given to the following points. 1. As 70% of the Australian public are now choosing a civil marriage ceremony, they are being made to pay extra to cover the cost of the planned registration fee. The other 30%, using religious celebrants, will not have this fee imposed upon them. This Government has supported anti-discrimination in law, and yet is supporting this blatant discrimination. That is, discrimination against marriage celebrants. They continue: 2. McA (Inc) supports a substantial fee to new applicants for registration as marriage celebrants. The Attorney General's Department (Marriage Law and Celebrant Section) has told us repeatedly that the processing of applicants is extremely time consuming. Why should established celebrants have to pay for this? It is of no advantage to have more appointments made when the current average of seven weddings per year per celebrant, providing an average gross income of $3,500 per year, is already stretching our budgets. Indeed, in some regional areas marriage celebrants probably perform fewer than that. They probably perform an average of about two marriages a year. Quite often when I attend ceremonies many of these marriage celebrants also sometimes take the role of religious celebrants in conducting religious services. So it is absolutely crazy that the government now contends that it is necessary to implement the new fees to cover the cost of administering the large number of celebrants under the program. The other amendments relating to the administration of the program are considered noncontroversial. On 21 March 2013 the Senate jointly referred the Marriage Amendment (Celebrant Administration and Fees) Bill 2013 and the Marriage (Celebrant Registration Charge) Bill 2013 for inquiry and remote. I believe the Senate committee is due to report very soon-I believe it is today. The coalition is very keen to see the recommendations made by this committee and reserves the right to potentially move amendments in the Senate pending the committee's report. On that basis, the coalition does not oppose the passage of these bills through the House. Parliamentary Secretary to the Attorney-General) (16:10): I thank members for their contribution to the debate. I want all those listening to the deliberations or reading the Hansard transcript o note that the coalition is supporting this legislation-despite the words of the member for Brisbane, she will be voting for this legislation. I would like to thank the",179,Bills
192,Mr Neumann (Blair,"Parliamentary Secretary for Health and Ageing andSenate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs for its ongoing work to consider these bills, on which it is scheduled to report later today. The government will, of course, consider any recommendation arising from the committee report. The bills implement a 2011 budget decision to introduce cost recovery for Commonwealth registered marriage celebrants in Australia. The introduction of cost recovery will allow the Attorney-General's Department to improve the level and range of services to Commonwealth registered marriage celebrants. These changes will provide celebrants with access to support and guidance in carrying out their duties, which will in turn improve services to marrying couples. The amendments will allow the Attorney-General's Department to provide stronger regulatory and information services to existing and aspiring Commonwealth registered marriage celebrants. Subject to the passage of this legislation, from 1 July 2013 there will be a $600 registration application fee for a prospective celebrant seeking registration, a $240 annual celebrant registration charge imposed on all Commonwealth registered celebrants and a $30 application processing fee for seeking an exemption from the annual celebrant registration charge, the registration application fee or annual ongoing professional development obligations. The celebrant administration and fees bill makes some minor administrative amendments to enhance the operation of the program. This includes the introduction of an Australian passport as an additional identity document that a celebrant may use to establish a marrying party's place and date of birth. This has received significant report from the celebrant community. I acknowledge there are a range of views on these reforms within the celebrant profession, a point I noted in my own electorate of Blair when I met with local celebrants. A dramatic expansion in the number of celebrants has taken place since 2003. This is the result of the former Howard coalition government relaxing the cap on celebrant numbers and, thereby, putting financial pressure on many excellent celebrants practising today. The member for Ryan raised the issue of ensuring transparency in the development of cost recovery. The Attorney-General's Department has provided a cost recovery impact statement as part of its submission to the Senate inquiry into the bills. This sets out in detail the costs that are to be recovered and the department's activities in administering the program. In accordance with the long standing cost recovery principles, the government will review regularly the operation of these fees to demonstrate they are recovering only the cost of administering the Marriage Celebrants Program. I note that the amount set for the fees and charges will be subject to parliamentary scrutiny and disallowance. The member for Ryan noted the extensive consultation the government undertook in the lead-up to the introduction of these bills. These consultations have provided useful input into what services and support celebrants wanted from the department. In response to this consultation, the government will strengthen the application process for prospective celebrants as well as developing new ways of engaging with celebrants online and by telephone and undertaking more targeted monitoring of performance. While no-one wants to pay a new fee, celebrants can take heart in the knowledge that this change will bring immediate and longer term benefits to the profession. It is relevant that this is not something that has come about without warning; there has been extensive consultation around the country since the measure was announced in 2011. Ultimately this package of reforms will ensure that marrying couples are legally and validly married through a professional and caring service, as they should rightly expect on their wedding day. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Ordered that this bill be reported to the House without amendment. Marriage (Celebrant Registration Charge) Bill 2013 Second Reading Debate resumed on the motion: That this bill be now read a second time. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Ordered that this bill be reported to the House without amendment. Therapeutic Goods Amendment (2013 Measures No. 1) Bill 2013 Second Reading Debate resumed on the motion: That this bill be now read a second time. Dr SOUTHCOTT (Boothby) (16:15): I rise to speak on the Therapeutic Goods Amendment (2013 Measures No. 1) Bill 2013. The Therapeutic Goods Administration is the regime responsible for regulating Australia's medicines, medical devices, blood and blood products. Under the act, all products which make a therapeutic claim must be listed on the Register of Therapeutic Goods before they can be suppled in Australia. It is a high bar to get over. It is very important for consumer safety that we do have the TGA and we do have the Register of Therapeutic Goods, though there is one amendment relating to products which seem to inadvertently be covered on the register. The bill also makes a number of minor technical amendments to ensure the consistent regulatory treatment of different types of therapeutic goods. These minor changes would also streamline the operation of a number of provisions under the act. Many of these amendments address anomalies that have arisen from previous amendments made to the act. But there is one amendment I would like to cover in more detail. The main amendment contained within this bill would give the minister, via legislative instrument, the power to exclude goods from the scope of the regulatory scheme under the TGA. These legislative instruments are required to be tabled in parliament and would be disallowable should the parliament decide that any decision made by the minister is not appropriate. Currently, any product that falls within the regulatory scheme because a therapeutic claim is made may be subject to burdensome regulation under the act, even if no public health risk is likely. This new power would be allowed only in the cases where it is clear that the goods in question have little to do with managing public health and safety, but, due to a therapeutic claim made by the manufacturer, fall within the very broad definition of 'therapeutic goods' within the act. Increasingly, more and more health and well-being claims are being made in relation to products where public health considerations are not likely to be an issue. Some examples of these types of products include 'power bands'-holographic wristbands that are claimed to improve balance, strength and flexibility-and mattresses which contain bacteria designed to reduce the effects of dust mites. While these products would be excluded from the TGA regulatory regime, they will still be regulated under consumer protection laws. In speaking to this amendment, I note the response from the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills regarding this change, in that the legislation sets out no requirements that the minister would consider in making a determination to exclude something from the definition of 'therapeutic goods'. The Scrutiny of Bills Committee in their digest stated: The committee therefore seeks the Minister's advice as to whether consideration has been given as to specifying the purposes for which this power may be exercised or to other ways to confine this power … The opposition would echo the calls of the Scrutiny of Bills Committee and ask the minister to explain whether this-that is, specifying the purposes for which the power may be exercised-has been considered and why it has not been included. The second major change would provide a specific power to the Secretary of the Department of Health and Ageing to remove goods that are not therapeutic goods from the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods. There are occasions when products are on the register when they should not be. Either they were a therapeutic good but are no longer a therapeutic good or they never were a therapeutic good. And there is currently no mechanism to remove these products from the Register of Therapeutic Goods. This power can be used only after the product sponsor has been notified, and any decision made by the secretary will be reviewable internally and externally by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. The coalition will not be opposing this bill, but I do seek a response from the parliamentary secretary as to the circumstances and purposes for which the power may be exercised in deciding to not have a product listed on the Register of Therapeutic Goods. Parliamentary Secretary to the Attorney-General) (16:20): I would like to thank the member for Boothby for his contribution and also thank my predecessor, the member for Ballarat, in her former capacity as Parliamentary Secretary for Health and Ageing. As the member for Boothby correctly stated, the measures contained in the Therapeutic Goods Amendment (2013 Measures No. 1) Bill 2013 will streamline and improve the regulatory scheme for therapeutic goods. A number of regulatory requirements currently in the Therapeutic Goods Act are being standardised, replicated or clarified so that, where appropriate, common regulatory rules and processes under the act will apply to all classes of therapeutic goods, including medicines, biologicals and medical devices. These changes will benefit the sponsors of therapeutic goods by providing greater clarity about their obligations under the act and provide the Therapeutic Goods Administration with improved mechanisms for its monitoring and compliance functions that are so essential to an effective therapeutic goods regulatory scheme. Additionally, the amendments will reinforce the main focus of the act, which is directed at the regulation of those goods for diagnosing, treating or alleviating disease, injuries or disabilities or that are used to replace or modify parts of the anatomy. It is a fact of modern life that health and therapeutic claims are increasingly being made on a range of goods, including food, jewellery and even some forms",182,Bills
193,Mr Neumann (Blair,"Parliamentary Secretary for Health and Ageing andof household appliances-and, in fact, furniture, such as mattresses, as the member for Boothby correctly pointed out. Because the definition of therapeutic goods under the act is so wide, goods that were perhaps not in contemplation when the legislation was enacted more than 20 years ago may now inadvertently be caught by the regulatory scheme. By enabling the minister, by disallowable instrument, to exclude these products from the operation of the act we can achieve greater certainty for those who wish to supply such products in Australia. I say to the member for Boothby-through you, Mr Deputy Speaker-that I wrote to the Scrutiny of Bills Committee in respect of its query in relation to that, and I am very pleased to provide the member for Boothby with a copy of my correspondence to the committee to satisfy the concerns he raised in relation to this issue. I also refer him to the second reading speech of the former Parliamentary Secretary for Health and Ageing in relation to some of the criteria and the basis on which the decision will be made. I would like to reiterate that any products moved from the therapeutic goods regulatory regime would still be subject to consumer protection provisions in the Commonwealth Competition and Consumer Act 2010. In summary, the amendments in this bill will create greater regulatory harmonisation between the different classes of therapeutic goods and thus provide a more efficient regulatory scheme that will benefit consumers as well as the therapeutic goods industry. second time. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Ordered that this bill be reported to the House without amendment. Health and Ageing Committee Report Debate resumed on the motion: That the House take note of the report. to rise this afternoon and comment on the report Bridging the dental gap: report on the inquiry into adult dental services. There is a list of recommendations and information in this report that I do not need to go into. But I would like to comment on some of the things that came out of this report upon the investigation of the committee; in a nutshell, it would probably be the need for cooperation between the federal government and the state governments and private providers to make sure that we have a network of dental services as far across the nation as we can and that we also get the services to where they are needed. I was very pleased that the committee came to my electorate. Actually, the only hearing that this inquiry held outside Canberra was in Dubbo. What was interesting about our day in Dubbo was that we actually saw some of the issues whereby people are suffering from lack of dental services. We heard great evidence from the Aboriginal Medical Service at Walgett. We heard from the prosthodontist Peter Muller. Peter is very passionate about serving the people of New South Wales. He spoke about the changes since the cessation of the chronic disease",185,Bills

195,Mr Coulton (Parkes,"The Nationals Chief Whip) (16:24): It gives me great pleasurescheme and how that has impacted on his clients. He also spoke of his frustration in terms of being able to service those clients as well as he might, and the difficulties that these clients have in funding the treatments. Many of the people he deals with are in a bad way with their general health because of their lack of suitable dentures with which to eat. The other thing that was of interest to the committee when it came to Dubbo was the work of the Flying Doctor. Their plane, which is affectionately known in the west as the 'tooth fairy', is now delivering dental services right across western New South Wales. It has been a major step forward for the people of the west to have those services delivered, and there is a need for ongoing funding for that service. But probably the highlight of the day was seeing the work Charles Sturt University is doing in its School of Dentistry and Health Services at the Dubbo campus. We were able to see students and dentists working side by side delivering services to members of the community while these students were actually undertaking their training. It is a magnificent facility. It was funded in the last days of the Howard government and constructed in the early days of the Rudd government. Those young dentists are trained in the bush and have a good experience there. They probably have a superior training opportunity because of the ratios of staff to students and the fact that they will probably stay in that area. There is also a private clinic operating from the same facility. SoI do endorse this report. There is a lot of information in there about the relationship between the state and the federal government. This report also touches on the need to elevate the status and responsibility of dental hygienists and raises the possibility of a trial for Medicare provider numbers for hygienists. Certainly I would not like to see, as a stopgap measure, hygienists and dental nurses replacing dentists in country areas. I think that people in the country are entitled to the same level of service as everyone else, but I think that there is an argument to be had for some funding for hygienists to work throughout the school network in a preventative way. There is certainly a lot of scope to improve that. I thoroughly recommend this report, and I acknowledge the work of the secretariat. This was possibly one of the fastest reports that I think the health and ageing committee has ever undertaken and printed, and hopefully the minister and subsequent ministers in following governments can use this and look at implementing a program that will fill in the gaps and ensure that people right across the country do get the adequate services that they need. Ms HALL (Shortland) (16:30): by leave, I wish to address the chamber. Thank you to my colleagues. It is great to see that there are four colleagues from the health and ageing committee here in the chamber tonight. I would like to express my thanks to them for the constructive contributions that they made to this report. This is a report that is probably more difficult than a lot of reports that we have dealt with in the health and ageing committee, but we managed to reach a position where we had a unanimous report that we could table in parliament. I think that was a credit to the secretariat, who always do a wonderful job on the health and ageing committee, and to the members, because of the mindset that they had towards delivering a report that is unanimous and is one that we can all get behind and argue from different perspectives in relation to it. The day in Dubbo when we took evidence was really special. It is very important that members get out into rural and regional areas. I come from a regional area, but it is a regional metropolitan area. In that area, yes, there are challenges in relation to dental. There are real challenges, but they are nowhere near the challenges faced by the people in Dubbo, and they are nowhere near the challenges faced by people who live even further out in rural and remote areas. The needs that they face and their inability to access services when they need them are very great. The committee recognised the fact that in an area like mine there is a shortage of dentists, but with the introduction of the national partnership agreement on dental I have found that there has been a massive reduction in the number of people who are waiting to access dental treatment. But in the member for Parkes' electorate you do not have that same turnaround because he does not have the dentists or the dental professionals to deal with the problems that people experience with their teeth. That remoteness and the rural and regional aspect of it really does impact on a person's ability to utilise services. In Dubbo, I found it really refreshing to see the approach of all the people who gave evidence to the committee. They had one mindset. You could see that they were a team and you could see that they worked together on issues. We had the Flying Doctor, we had the Aboriginal Medical Service, we had the hygienists and the dental prosthesis and Charles Sturt University-a fantastic facility. What it has delivered to the community is a credit to the Howard government and to the current government. A thing that is really special about it is that you have Charles Sturt University working alongside the Western New South Wales Local Health District. You have dentists who are funded one way, through the university, working on one side, and dentists who are funded through the health system working on the other side of the facility. But they are sharing their expertise. They all go out to those rural and remote areas, and they are prepared to give their support to their communities, so there is a real sense of community. It is not the same level of services that are available in a city, but they certainly have a total commitment to the people that they are servicing. The Royal Flying Doctor Service shared with us their perspective of how they will go out and help people and, once again, gave that other aspect of what it is like to live in a rural and remote area. The member for Parkes said that, for him, the thing that came across, the thing he got the strongest message about, was the need for state, Commonwealth and private dental services to work together. It is always a problem with the states and the Commonwealth. There is always that tension that exists between the levels of government, and there are always issues around the interface between government and the private sector. I think that is a very important issue, but for me the most important issue is the lack of consistency. In 1996, there was the Commonwealth Dental Health Program. The Howard government did not continue it. Then there was the Chronic Disease Dental Scheme, and this government did not continue that. Now there is the national partnership agreement which, as I mentioned, has already made a big dint in the waiting lists in my area. It is important that people in Australia have certainty that there is going to be a continuation of dental services, that it is not going to constantly change and that, if they are eligible for assistance under a particular scheme, that that eligibility will continue. From my perspective, I felt that the chronic dental health disease program was poorly targeted, but members on the other side of the parliament did not agree with that. Even given that, we were able to work around it and come out with the recommendations that we have here before us today. It is fair to say-isn't it, Member for Hasluck?-that we all felt that there was a lack of consistency in the way dental services had been delivered over the years. We all acknowledge that the Commonwealth does have a responsibility for it. I feel that our underlying feeling was that we would love to see a health system in which dental care was covered by a similar scheme to Medicare, where, if you had problems in your mouth and you were really ill, you could go and have that treated, without it being treated as a secondary, non-important type of illness. It is oral disease. Anyone who has had an abscess or a really chronic dental problem will know that there is nothing more painful or more debilitating than having a problem in in your mouth. In fact, I had a constituent come to see me who ended up in intensive care in the public hospital system because he had had an abscess on his tooth. That abscess had infected his whole system. That was a massive cost to our health system, because he was fighting for his life for a couple of weeks. It was only through the fantastic medical care that you can get in this country that he was able to get over that illness. There are a lot of new programs that are starting up. There is the Grow Up Smiling campaign that will be good for young children. When I was younger-and I suspect you will remember, Deputy Speaker, and member for Hasluck, and maybe all of us in this roomthere was a Commonwealth dental scheme where the dentists came around to the school and looked at our teeth. An honourable member: All of those pink tablets. Ms HALL: Pink tablets. I lived in the country where they did not even give us pink tablets. We did not have fluoride. We did not have any of those scientifically advanced procedures. That program in place, and then it was removed, and we have had various other programs, such as the Teen Dental Health program which I do not think has had the take-up that other programs have had. Overall, we need to have a continuous approach to dental care. We need to recognise that dental care is important, and we need to recognise how important it is to access dental care. Also, the national partnership agreement is an excellent scheme for people that have health care cards. They are the people that really need to access dental health through the public system. They are the people that are on the dental health waiting list. They are the people that will be assisted by the national partnership agreement. There is an interim agreement in place now, and the full agreement starts in 2014. There is a group of people that are on incomes just above the health care card level, where it is very hard for them to afford the dental treatment that they need. This is a very complex issue, and it is an issue that, as a nation, I do not think we have dealt with well. I think it is time for governments of all persuasions to recognise that our dental health is important and that our dental health influences our overall health. It will not be the current government that responds to this report. It will be the next government, whatever political persuasion it is, that gets to respond to it. I hope that they take into account very seriously the need for consistency and recognise that dental health is very important. We did not have reticulated water; I remember we had tank water. Amongst the people in my neighbourhood there were lots of false teeth and teeth that were not too good. An honourable member interjectinginteresting thing is that we do have, on the whole, much better teeth now than we used to have. I know that our society is better, we are a healthy people, and we actually live longer.",186,Committees

197,Mr Lyons,"Yes, my front ones are gone, but they were knocked out playing footy. ThePart of the reason is that we have much better teeth as a result of fluoride. I notice that the Queensland government have dropped the requirement to have fluoride in reticulated water, which is to the detriment of the people of Queensland, and I hope they rectify that. I rise to add my remarks to the report, Bridging the dental gap, of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Health and Ageing. In this inquiry the committee considered: demand for dental services across Australia and issues associated with waiting lists; the mix and coverage of dental services supported by state and territory governments, and the Australian Government; availability and affordability of dental services for people with special dental health needs; availability and affordability of dental services for people living in metropolitan, regional, rural and remote locations; the coordination of dental services between the two tiers of government and with privately funded dental services; and workforce issues relevant to the provision of dental services. Improving dental health will help relieve the pressure on hospitals. I know this from my personal experience through being in the health system in Tasmania for 20-odd years. A number of cases came along that had to get taken into theatre for what were, in fact, dental problems. It does show that we are not on top of this issue. As I said, improving dental health will help relieve the pressure on hospitals and broader health systems, which is why this inquiry is so important. We know that one in five of our lowest income earners have not been to the dentist for over five years, if ever. This is a serious concern. Poor dental health has wide-ranging impacts on speech, sleep and eating. The committee heard from a number of parties who stated that there are many groups of people in Australia who are struggling to receive adequate dental care. This can lead to a range of poor dental health outcomes which often result in patients requiring more extensive medical treatment. This includes low-income earners, the elderly, people living with a disability, those living in regional and rural areas of Australia, and homeless and Indigenous Australians. Because low-income earners are less likely to receive preventative care they are more likely to have extensive treatment, for example, tooth extraction rather than fillings. The reasons for the increased risk of oral disease in these populations are complex, but are generally associated with poor visiting patterns to dental and oral health services. For some, this may be indicative of poor availability of dental services outside metropolitan centres thus making access difficult. For others, a significant barrier may be the cost of accessing services. The committee heard evidence that public dental waiting lists also represent a barrier to care, with eligible patients often unable to afford access to local services and unable to access services elsewhere. Treatments through the public health system usually focus on providing emergency treatments rather than preventative or restorative services. Even so, the demand for limited public dental services is such that there are significant waiting lists in all states and territories with the average waiting time of 27 months. For adults who are not eligible for access to public dental services, treatment is only available through the private system. The Australian government understands the importance of timely access to affordable, high-quality, oral health care for all Australians, and in particular for low-income earners and disadvantaged people. The government knows that many Australians on low incomes miss out on access to dental care, and a number of those missing out are children. On 29 August 2012, the government announced the landmark $4.1 billion dental reform package. This package will build a fairer dental system. The package includes $2.7 billion for Grow Up Smiling, a children's dental scheme that will start on 1 January 2014; $1.3 billion to states and territories from 1 July 2014 to expand services for adults in the public system; and a $225 million flexible grants program beginning from 2014 to provide dental infrastructure, both capital and workforce, in outer metropolitan, rural and regional areas. The government allocated $5.5 million to Tasmania in 2013-14 to cut the public dental waiting lists, which will make a real difference for Tasmanians and people with dental concerns. The committee heard that a highly skilled health workforce is critical to the backbone of the health system. Projects such as the construction of a new purpose-built clinical training facility in Launceston with six additional dental chairs is fantastic for Northern Tasmania. Work is currently underway on the $4 million extension to the public dental services in Kelham Street, Launceston, to allow for dental student work placements in our region. This will be a state-of-the-art facility which is vital for Northern Tasmania. The importance of good dental and oral health to general health and well-being is well recognised. There are well established associations between poor dental and oral health and acute or chronic health conditions such as heart disease and diabetes. Furthermore, the pain associated with poor dental and oral health, coupled with social anxieties about appearance and the avoidance of certain foods, can impact significantly on the quality of life. This inquiry has certainly been worthwhile. I encourage MPs and senators to read the report and the recommendations from this committee. I was particularly impressed by the service provided in the Dubbo area. There was a fantastic service training new doctors and also providing a private clinic, which I think is fantastic. It was my first trip to Dubbo and I was very impressed by the service provided in that area. In closing, I wish to thank all those who took the time to put in submissions and appear before the committee. I also thank my fellow committee members and, in particular, the secretariat for the valuable work they provided. Debate adjourned.

The importance of this report is that it outlines what the future might bring for Australia's biodiversity from continuing climate change. It attempts to put forward to government suggestions of the vital base metrics that we need to ensure that we have. It looks at ways in which we can cooperate with the states and many of the boards and mechanisms that they have. And, like a lot of reports across the parliament, it suggests that we should make sure that this level of government, the Australian government, takes responsibility for the coordination of these things. I am going to be slightly indulgent in talking about this report because for me it is the end of 20-plus years on a committee of the ilk of the climate change, environment and the arts",189,Committees
198,Mr Jenkins (Scullin) (16:52,"It is my pleasure to rise in support of the House ofcommittee. I was lucky enough to be made a member of the then House of Representatives Environment Committee after the 1987 election. This report I have in my hand-on the use of ionising radiation-was from one of the first inquiries I was involved in. The committee looked at the uses of irradiation, which, in the main, continue to be medical uses such as sterilisation. But back in 1988 it was suggested that it ought to be used on foodstuffs to increase their shelf life. Of course, this was very controversial at the time because of the way in which we viewed the use of anything nuclear. This was a very interesting report because it very much epitomised the work of the committee by bringing parliament to the people and also bringing people closer to the parliament so that they could have interaction. From 1988 up until the 2007 election, I was a member of the committee in all its guises. The importance of the environment committee is that it is probably the longest running portfolio committee of the House of Representatives. Under different titles, there has always been, from the early seventies, a standing committee on the environment and conservation. This is not totally relevant, but I am happy to say I did not avoid making history, following in my father's footsteps and in the footsteps of my predecessor as the member for Scullin. This was one of his passions. He was very lucky to be on the House environment committee back in those years, and it was something that he thoroughly enjoyed. When we revised the committee system in the late eighties to create about eight portfolio committees-and everybody got the opportunity to be involved in portfolio committees that were their great interest-I was lucky enough to continue on the environment committee. There have been many, many inquiries, like the current one on the effect on biodiversity of climate change that we are just concluding here, that I think have made a great impact. An early enquiry was into land degradation. Being from Victoria, where Landcare committees were up and running even at that time, it was great to be able to harness the knowledge that we got from observing what had happened with community based Landcare committees in Victoria, and expanding the Landcare movement right throughout Australia. I think, Deputy Speaker, you would understand the importance and the great work that the many, many community Landcare committees have done, and the way in which that has blossomed into catchment management committees and other guises, which have involved local communities in delivering things that a national government see as important. I am one that is always urging that we have a national outlook, a national policy. But I also understand that that cannot be delivered nationally-that it has to be that we know the mechanisms that are on the ground that will achieve it. We went from looking at land degradation to looking at coastal management-much the same. It was to be able to sit down with local communities to look at what they thought was the best way to tackle the types of coastal systems that they were dealing with. Again, I think we learnt a lot from our Landcare movement and looking at coastal care organisations. Along the way, we took a holistic approach to the work of the environment committee. I remember, in the coastal management committee, looking at ways in which we could get training and employment opportunities because of the work of the local communities. The local communities are dependent upon their volunteer input but are also a good source for very good experience-especially for young Australians, to learn skills that they can then take into future employment. It is very good to see the member for Hasluck here. On land degradation and coastal management, one of the things that was absolutely clear was that we had an untapped resource in Indigenous Australians and their approach to these issues, in being able to understand the environment and to use that knowledge of the environment to put in place management systems. That might be one aspect of the work that we highlighted that has been slower in the uptake. But I am really, really pleased that on a lot of issues-for instance, those that surround our approach to tackling climate change, especially in remote communities-we are using the local communities, which in those areas are Indigenous. We have got really great value from those communities because they actually understand what it is to be at one with the environment and to steward that in a very positive way. They understand the differences that are created. If you look through the three volumes of work of the biodiversity inquiry and climate change, that is something that has come through in our investigations throughout that. To give a hint to the member for Kooyong, I will finally mention one more report. In my time on the environment committee, this was the inquiry that had the most direct impact on the electorate of Scullin, which I have been fortunate enough to represent in this place for such a long time. The Sustainable cities inquiry report was tabled back in August 2005. That was when the committee had returned to being just the Standing Committee on Environment and Heritage-it had previously been the Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts-so we had returned to our core business. I emphasise the narrowcast nature of the name of the committee, environment and heritage; we did not have the arts or anything else involved. This inquiry really adopted a holistic approach to the way in which we should develop our cities sustainably. It could have been that a committee on the environment and heritage would simply look at the ecological footprint of cities, but we decided that it should operate in a more holistic manner. That was made easier because, as I said earlier in this contribution, through the parliamentary committee system we were taking the parliament to the people and the people had an easier avenue to approach us. The very first witnesses we heard from on this inquiry were from the Western Sydney Area Health Service. They talked about the health aspects of the way we are developing our cities and the dangers of not tackling social isolation, especially on the urban fringes of our major cities. It was about more than just the problems of the environment and ecology and the danger of not sustainably using resources. So this was very much a report in which we took into account the environmental and ecological aspects, the economic consequences and the social consequences. We had these three pillars underpinning our examination of the problem-but, by the end of the inquiry, there was a fourth pillar: governance. It was about how we can engage local communities that find themselves within the major cities of Australia in the discussion about what they need to reach their aspirations. So, whilst all these reports in front of me represent the 20 years of work on the environment committee, I am only illustrating the Sustainable cities inquiry because it had the most direct reference to Scullin, traditionally an outer northern suburbs electorate of Melbourne, sharing the urban fringe with that great electorate of McEwan-oh, the member for McEwan has left the chamber. But we have the great 'Zap', the member for Makin, as the chair of this committee. I have enjoyed his chairmanship. He rates among the many fine chairs that we have had of the environment committee. He is very fortunate that we have as the deputy chair Dr Mal, the member for Moore, who will leave this place at the end of this parliament. He has been a really terrific champion of the environment committee. I think the member for Makin would say that his relationship with the deputy chair is very solid, as I think Dr Washer would say of his relationship with the former member for Throsby. This has been the tradition of our committee. There is one exception-and I have probably buried the report of that one exception. I see the member for Bennelong here. He is a great Australian sportsman-still, I believe, but he may have been greater early on. At one stage the House environment committee had the environment, recreation, the arts and sport under its auspices. Wasn't that committee lucky that the Auditor-General did a report on a famous sports grants program! I have to say that there is a lesson for all oppositions in what happened when that Auditor-General's report came out. Luckily for the success of the committee system that we created-and I apologise to the member for Kooyong; I have gone longer than I thought I would-we had the opportunity to have Auditor-General's reports referred to the portfolio committees. I wish that we had never had this one referred to the environment committee, because it become a very interesting report. The opposition thought that they were on a good thing. It had been referred to the House environment committee and we had numerous public hearings where we dragged the auditor in and the officers of whatever department sports was under. Finally, we dragged the minister in, because she was a member of the House. We got to Christmas and everything seemed tranquil and quiet. But politics is all about timing. We returned in February of the next year and the government had been too good-they had been on good behaviour. There were no other issues around and so the opposition went back to the sports program. This time, they put in FOI requests. They embarrassed the government to allow them to go over to the department and go through the files. There was a very forensic opposition membership of our committee who went through the files. Then we had the final famous night when we had the minister before us and suddenly she made the fateful statement. The question was, 'How did you assess these in your office?' She replied: 'Oh, well, we've got a whiteboard out the back in the backroom. We did all the work on that.' There was a shadow minister on this committee who is now a senator from Victoria-I will not mention his name. But the point he made, after he had done some quick back-of-the-postage-stamp calculation, was this: 'If all the applications were on this whiteboard, they would be about one square centimetre.' At this stage, we thought, 'That's the end of this.' There was a negative report and a scalp for an opposition that arose out of just bad luck in the management of a program and from the fact that it became something that a committee of this place used the accountability mechanisms open to it to examine. In conclusion, I proudly endorse the work of the present House Standing Committee on Climate Change, Environment and the Arts and endorse this, the third volume report on climate change and biodiversity. (Time expired) Debate adjourned. Gambling Reform Committee Report Debate resumed on the motion: That the House take note of the report. Committee on Gambling Reform, I rise to speak on the fifth report, The advertising and promotion of gambling services in sport: Broadcasting Services Amendment (Advertising for Sports Betting) Bill 2013. As someone who during the life of this 43rd parliament sat through a number of public committee hearings dealing with the issue of gambling, I must say that I am concerned by the pervasiveness of the gambling industry and the negative impact that gambling is having on the lives of many Australians. As a committee, one of the first issues that we dealt with related to pokies. There are 600,000 Australians currently playing pokies on a weekly basis. That is a large number. Of that number, 90,000 or 15 per cent, are deemed to be problem gamblers. While I firmly believe that the mandatory commitment proposal initially put forward by the government was not the answer, certainly more can be done in the area of counselling and support services for those who have a gambling problem. As for the member for Denison, Andrew Wilkie, the chair of this committee and the person who had a personal signed commitment from the Prime Minister to introduce mandatory commitment, he has every right to feel aggrieved, as the Prime Minister dudded him, breaking her solemn promise because of political expediency. The issue of gambling advertising in sport is somewhat different to pokies. Not confined to the pubs and the clubs, it has taken over our footy fields and is having a detrimental effect on our young. Sport-loving children today talk about their teams in terms of odds and margins, sometimes motivated more by the law of a bet than their loyalty to the game. In fact, the committee heard, and has reported on page 9, that young people are at risk and are particularly susceptible to gambling advertising. We quoted the 2010 Productivity Commission report, which looked at Canadian research that found that 42 per cent of youth reported that gambling advertisements made them want to try gambling, and that 11 per cent of males and three per cent of females sometimes or often gambled after seeing an advertisement. The Victorian Responsible Gaming Foundation agreed that these levels of gambling advertising had had a negative impact on children, saying that their research shows that children under 11 have difficulty distinguishing differences between advertising and program content. In particular, children under 10 have difficulty understanding the persuasive intent in advertising. Certainly, the use of sports personalities and media personalities to promote gambling means that young children have a difficulty in distinguishing between what is marketing material and what is neutral content. Those details are found in our report and highlight some of the issues that we face. Today, no football ground or scoreboard, no team jumper or jersey, no television or radio broadcast, is immune from the pervasiveness of gambling advertising in sport. In fact, the line has, in some instances, become blurred between sports betting, advertising and sports commentary itself. Gambling in sport is no longer just about a friendly punt, which we would all, in this place, happily endorse. It has become a multi-million-dollar, and in some cases billion-dollar, industry. Personally, I find it frustrating to turn on the television on a Friday",191,Committees
199,Mr Frydenberg (Kooyong) (17:08,"As a member of the Parliamentary Joint Selectnight to watch a game, or when it comes around to Brownlow night to watch the vote, to find myself bombarded with gambling advertising. It detracts from the game, or Brownlow night, as a form of entertainment, let alone the greater harm that it has the potential to cause. What is more, gambling in sport has the real potential to threaten the integrity of the game itself. My colleague and friend, the member for Bennelong, a great champion tennis player, is in the House with me right now and he would know all too well that international experience has shown that the integrity of sports of all kinds can be threatened by too much gambling, and in Australia we do not want to go down this path. Therefore, we, as legislators from both sides of the House, have a responsibility to rectify the situation and to do it as soon as possible. The community expects us and, indeed, I have many constituents who have raised this issue-young and old alike. More importantly, we should expect it of ourselves. That is why there is a recommendation in this report that we review the self-regulatory action being taken by the industry, for if they do not make the appropriate changes with regard to gambling advertising in sport, then legislative action should follow. This was the position first taken by the Leader of the Opposition, Tony Abbott, which has been followed by the Prime Minister and her government-a bit of catch-up politics. Tony Abbott said: 'We are natural deregulators, not regulators. But when you've got a significant social nuisance, I think it's important for government to at least be prepared to step in. It is just wrong that kids be learning about gambling before they are learning about the game. The game should be about performances, not about whether you might quickly make 10 bucks by guessing who scores the first goal or whether a team gets a particular score by half time.' Therefore, I strongly welcome the decision by the broadcast networks in Australia to ban live odds during play. But the coalition has sent a clear message. If the industry itself does not act before the September election then the coalition has indicated its readiness to legislate a ban. I see this change as being important, but also a first step. I believe that in time the community will demand of our parliament that we take further steps. In conclusion, this is an important report which I believe has helped inform the debate, and I take this opportunity to thank the secretariat, including committee secretary Lyn Beverley, principal research officer Natasha Rusjakovski, and administrative officers Ruth Edwards and Lauren Carnevale for their hard work and professionalism during the life of this 43rd Parliament. I also thank the other members of the committee, including the chair, the member for Denison, his deputy, the member for Canberra, and my coalition colleague and friend on the committee the member for Moncrieff. I am sure I speak for many on the committee when I say that having been a member of this committee has provided me with the opportunity to learn much. I see that the issue of gambling in sport as a topic vitally important to our community. Today, as in the future, these topics around gambling and gambling in sport more specifically will require the vigilance of this parliament and subsequent parliaments, and the best judgement of its members.
