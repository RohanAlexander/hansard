The Following Paper Was Presented:","Strategic Railway from Brisbane to Port Augusta vid Hay-Report on, by Mr Combes. Ordered to be printed. speech delivered in this House last night by the honourable the Postmaster-General, referring to matters of administration of the Department of Home Affairs, the Government propose to arrange for the appointment of a Royal Commission. If possible the Commission will consist of a Judge, and the Acting Prime Minister w ill arrange for same. The Commission will be asked to take the Hansard reports of the speech above referred to, and the speeches delivered since the reassembling of Parliament by MrW . O. Archibald, M . P . , dealing with administrative matters in the Home Affairs Department, and also statements and answers to questions dealing with the same matters made by the Minister of Home Affairsi n the House of Representatives, as the basis for such inquiry. Sir WILLIAMIRVINE Government prepared to give the House an opportunity of discussing the.advisabilit y of appointing a Royal Commission to investigate ordinary matters of departmental and administrative work? No charges of corruption have been made, and this proposed inquiry, by an outside authority, introduces a new principle which may be carried very far. stood that it was practically the unanimous desire of the House that the statements made by the Postmaster-General should be inquired into immediately. The Government promptly took the matter into consideration, and they were of opinion that an independent inquiry 18 May, 1916. would give the greatest satisfaction to the House and to the public. Leader of the House say whether the statement, appearing in both morning papers, is correct, that the Postmaster General was instructed by Cabinet to discuss this question, and to express the other views to which he gave utterance last night ? It is stated in both newspapers that the Minister's speech was the result of Cabinet consideration. newspapers is not correct. presenting the Minister of Defencei n form the House why a number of Bulgarians were released from internment, and sent to BrokenH ill under military escort ? ber was good enough to advise the M in ister of Defence of his intention to ask this question, and the Minister has supplied the following answer: On the 2nd March, 1916, the Secretary of State for the Colonies cabled to the Commonwealth Government intimating that an arrangement had been made with the Bulgarian Government, on the basis of reciprocity, not to detain in the United Kingdom or the British Empire, or in His Majesty's Overseas Dominions, Bulgarian subjects who were under seventeen or over fifty-five years of age on the date of the declaration of war between Great Britain and Bulgaria, nor to intern Bulgarian subjects of any age so long as they are able to provide for themselves, unless there are special reasons of a military character which would render internment desirable. The 'Secretary of State expressed the hope that the Commonwealth Government would A r e the concur in this policy. The Minister for Defence issued instructions to the Commandant of each Military District in accordance with this notification from the Secretary of State, and instructed each Commandant to go through the lists of Bulgarians interned from his district"", to ascertain which on these lists conformed with the notification of the Secretary of State, and to communicate with the Commandant, Concentration Camp (where the Bulgarians were interned), who had been instructed to liberate those recommended hy the Commandants. Commandants were also informed that in considering future cases of internment they should be guided by the above arrangements. In the 4th Military District (South Australia) forty-seven Bulgarians were affected by the arrangements set out, and the Commandant,",4,Setup

He was further instructed to provide railway warrants for their return to Adelaide. If a large batch of them desired io travel together, the Commandant was informed that it would be wise to defer their release until he had an escort going to the State in question. No instructions were issued from HeadQuarters that any of these Bulgarians were to be sent to Broken Hill, or for any military guard to be sent to Broken Hill in connection therewith, and up to the present the Department has no information as to how it came about that they were sent there. Inquiries are, however, being made. the Minister representing the PrimeM in ister been called to the exposure by a French newspaper, the L'CEuvre, of advertisements recently inserted in German newspapers within Germany by Nestle and the Anglo-Swiss Condensed M i l k Company, in whicli the company, according to the translation furnished to me, boast of their German sympathies and connexions during the war. Seeing that the company have connexions within Australia, will the Minister have the matter investigated ? that I have never before heard of the newspaper, but if the honourable member will hand the copy to me I shall have the matter investigated. this morning I am reported as having said yesterdayAnother hindrance to recruiting among Good Templars was the administration of the War Precautions Act, particularly in regard to the limitation of freedom of speech and restrictions on the freedom of the press. As that paragraph may cause some in convenience amongst a reputable sectionof the community, I desire to point out that the sentence is wrong and misleading in two particulars. I did not refer to recruiting amongst Good Templars, and I made no reference to Good Templars having any connection with the administration of the War Precautions Act . I do not complain of the misleading criticism by the Argusi n its leading article, but it .might, at least, keep lies out of the reports. drew the attention of the representativeof the Minister of Defence to some cases in which members of the Public Servicehad been allowed to enlist, and afterwards called upon to return to their positions in the Service. I also stated that these public servants were not being allowed the difference between their earnings in tlie Service and tlieir earnings in the ranks, nor were they being repaid any of the expense to which they had been put. The Minister promised to answer the questions I then asked. the honourable member, but I have not yet received an answer to the request for information that I sent to the Department. As soon as I get the answer I shall inform the House.

16,Mr Speaker,"I have received anpublic importance, v i z . : "" T be embargo placed upon the export of coal to foreign ports."" Five honourable members having risen in their places, Question proposed. I take this course reluctantly, because I realize the great difficulties tliat the Government have to contend with at the present juncture in view of the European situation. If the embargo complained of were in any way assisting the Allies' cause I should be the last man in the world to raise my voice against it . It is only because the embargo is serving no useful purpose so f a r as the export of wheat is concerned, and, at the same time, is doing considerable in ju ry to the coal trade, that I desire to ventilate the matter. It will be admitted at once that, whilst we must do everything possible to achieve success in the war, we, at the same time, must not unnecessarily do anything that may be detrimental to one of the greatest industries in Australia. I shall endeavour to show that the action of the Government is detrimental to the coal interests, and is in no way helping in the European situation. In order that honourable members may have a clear grasp of the subject, it may be as well for me to briefly review the position. A f t e r the war broke out, when enemy boats were in the Pacific, the Admiralty, or the Government at the request of the A d miralty, decided to put an embargo on the export of coal to certain ports in the Pacific. The result was to interfere considerably with the coal trade, but of those engaged in that trade not one complained. They were quite prepared to accept the position, realizing that it was absolutely necessary at that period in the interests of the Allies' cause. When the Pacific had been cleared of enemy ships, the position became somewhat different, and we agitated for a modification of the embargo. A f t e r representations had been made by the Government the Admiralty agreed to modify the embargo so as to permit of coal being exported to the south Philippine Islands, Java, and elsewhere, and thus enabled the collieries to be kept fairly constantly employed. Of course, we are not now exporting the quantity of coal that we exported prior to the war. 2,000 and 3,000 members of the Coal Miners Federation have enlisted, it becomes at once apparent that the output must have considerably declined. I recognise just as much as does anybody the vital necessity which exists for securing the transference of our wheat crop to the markets of the world. I know that it is imperative that we should supply the Allied nations with the wheat which they require. But after the recent harvest was gathered Ave increased the severity of the embargo which previously obtained by declining to permit any vessel to take coal from Australia to a foreign port without a special permit. This action has not resulted in any assistance being rendered to the wheat trade, but rather the reverse, because if we refuse to permit any vessel in Australian waters to load coal, or any other cargo, ship-owners in other parts of the world w ill at once determine that their vessels shall not visit Australia. In the case of ships belonging to neutral countries, the Commonwealth cannot compel them to carry wheat. We havo also to recollect that most of these vessels make the round trip. They bring a load of cargo to Australia, and then load coal, or whatever other cargo is offering at the different ports. If we stipulate that they shall not carry coal from our ports, it is obvious that their owners w ill not send them here. The result of this embargo has been that at least half-a-dozen vessels have lef t our shores in ballast. It is reported in the press that three or four more are about to do the same thing, because they cannot obtain permission from the Government to carry coal. The consequence is that our coal trade w i th foreign ports is being destroyed. In that trade we have to compete with countries like Japan and America, and if we once allow our coal to be diverted from its accustomed markets we shall inflict in j u r y upon an important industry without in any way assisting the wheat industry. When the war is over we shall have thousands of men in search of employment, and if we have crippled our coal trade, how shall we provide them coast of America, the with that employment? As a matter of fact, notwithstanding that so many men have enlisted for service at the front , there are in Newcastle to-day, consequent upon the operation of this embargo, perhaps 2,000 men unemployed. Eor the When we reflect that between quarter ended March of the present year",5,Adjournment Formal Embargo On Coal Exportation
17,Mr Charlton (Hunter) [2.47],"we exported only 777,359 tons of coal, as -against 1,013,000 tons for the corresponding quarter of last year. Both these quarters f a l l within the period covered by the war, and it w ill he noticed that there has heen a drop of 236,642 tons in the brief space of three months. The figures are positively startling. B y pursuing this policy we are deriving no benefit, and why, therefore, should we continue it? Yesterday I asked the Minister of Trade and CustomsWhether it is a fact, as reported in the press, that three or four ships are about to leave Australia in ballast, because the owners have been unable to obtain from his Department permits to load coal? If it is a fact, will thc Minister give further consideration to the matter, in order to preserve the coal industry? The Minister, in reply, saidI have not had the opportunity of verifying the accuracy of the statement in the press. Our difficulty lies in the fact that if we compel British or Allied vessels to carry wheat, and allow neutral vessels to carry coal, which is a much more profitable cargo, we are penalizing our owu people. If we allow ship-owners to carry coal, it will be good-bye to our export of wheat. to carry wheat. vessel to take any cargo, except what its owners choose to carry. The owners of neutral vessels probably find greater profit in leaving Australia in ballast, and picking up nitrates at a Soutli American port, or timber at Pugct Sound, than in carrying wlieat from Australia. venting them from carrying coal? we shall not get any boats to carry our wheat. If the Minister's statements were correct, I would not complain, but the position is exactly the opposite. The very fact that we refuse to allow vessels to load coal when they come here is the means of preventing ship-owners from sending their vessels to Australia. Should the war continue for another couple of years, and this embargo be persisted in , we shall have the next wheat crop on top of us before the last crop has been sent abroad; we shall have entirely dislocated the coal trade, and we shall have prevented vessels from bringing necessary merchandise to our shores. In other words, we shall find ourselves short of other commodities. present policy. The freight from New York is £ 1 0 per ton. takes up the position that because vessels wil l not load wheat they must not carry coal, we shall get no neutral tonnage at all. being guided by expert advice? Buti f ships come here from neutral countries and decline to load coal, ought they to be allowed to go away with empty bottoms ? sult? I know, too, that very considerable delay occurs in dealing with applications from vessels desirous of loading coal, because in some cases the Government have granted the necessary permission. As a matter of fact, vessels have been tied upin Newcastle for weeks awaiting the Ministerial decision as to whether they will be permitted to carry coal from Australia. The result has been that four or five collieries have closed down, and many men have been thrown out of employment. ister cannot control the destination of neutral ships? plained that, immediately the Pacific was clear of enemy vessels, the Admiralty took certain precautions. As a result, the Consuls of various neutral countries guaranteed that the coal exported from Australia would not find its way into the hands of the enemy. The Government are amply safeguarded in that respect. cannot guarantee the destination of the coal. They can merely express an opinion in the light of their knowledge. have made an arrangement by which vessels can be traced to their destinations, and the Admiralty is perfectly satisfied with that arrangement. The only point we haye to consider is whether we shall expedite the removal of our wheat overseas by preventing vessels about to leave our shores from loading coal. I say that we shall not, but that by so acting we shall cripple a very important industry. freights, we could get all our wheat away. the British Government requested the people of Australia to put a greater area If the Minister under cultivation.

33,Mr Charlton,"I understand thatyears. I understand, further, that the allied countries have bought some of our wheat and that our difficulty is to get the wheat carried to them. In my opinion, at this time of national crisis, when it is necessary to get wheat for the troops of the Allies and the people of the allied nations, the responsibility of taking action in order to see that the wheat reaches them, rests with the British Government and the allied nations. If we have not the boats, the allied naticns should take concerted action in order to provide them. matter for the purpose of giving the Minister an opportunity of explaining the position. If he can show that this embargo on the export of coal is absolutely necessary, I shall be satisfied, but if I find that it is not assisting the cause of the Allies, while at the same time it is detrimental to the coal industry of Australia, then I think we should consider very deeply whether the Government are justified in preventing boats from taking coal when they are not in a position to compel those boats to carry any other class of cargo. and Customs) [3.2] -On e of the many difficult questions confronting the Government has been the provision of ships to take away the commodities which we have to send from Australia. The hardships suffered by the coal miners have been great owing to the difficulties of obtaining freight, and they have been very considerate and forbearing. have told the honourable member for Hunter this repeatedly, and I have also said it in Teply to deputations. ""We all know that shipping is very scarce all over the world, owing to the fact that many vessels are hung up in neutral ports while others are being sent to the bottom. The Government have been anxious to have wheat exported, not only from a financial point of view, because wheat is worth about £ 1 0 or more per ton free on board at Melbourne, as compared with coal, which is worth only 12s. per ton free on board at Newcastle, but also because it is a commodity which is produced year after year, whereas coal is on an entirely different footing. But while the Government have been anxious to get the wheat away, they have been equally anxious to do it at the best possible advantage. If we accepted the suggestion of the honourable member for Henty, and paid tlie normal freight, we could certainly get our wheat away, but it would be good-bye to the advance of 3s. to the farmers. Honourable members know the position. Freights have risen enormously all over the world. For instance, the pre-war freight from Argentine to Europe was less than 12s. a ton for wheat. That rate even existed in the early stages of the war. It is now £ 7 10s. per ton. We pay £ 4 15s. per ton for about double the distance, aud whereas on our coastal trade the increase in freight has been I have ventilated this but a small percentage, in other parts of the world the increase has been as much as 1,200 per cent.; in the case of Argentine it has been 1,000 per cent. Let me deal with the freight on kerosene, a subject which I investigated about six weeks ago. Prior to the war, and even since tlie war began, the rate of freight from New York to Australia on kerosene was 6d. per case by sailer, and ls. per case by steamer. Six weeks ago the freight was 5s. 8d. per case by sailer, and 8s. 4d. per case by steamer. I suppose the rates are even higher now. Senator Russell is the representative of the Government on the Wheat Board. It has done its best to get away as much wheat as possible, but it is not correct to say that the Government have secured all the vessels available for wheat. I have a list of those which have l e f t Australia from the 1st January last unti l tbe present time. I need not put that list in Hansard; but I can say that the Government have approved of I the shipment of 120,000 tons of coal from Australia, and this quantity does not include bunker coal to the extent of 45,000 tons for mail steamers and other vessels trading regularly to the South Sea Islands. The refusals amount to 48,000 tons. effect of establishing a parity between"" coal and wheat? receive up to £ 4 15s. a ton for conveying wheat from Australia to Great Britain, out of which, I presume, they must pay the war risk, they can obtain £ 3 5s. per ton to take wheat from here to South America, half the distance, and through waters which are not dangerous. By putting the wheat and coal freights on a parity, we should probably have to pay £ 6 or £ 7 a ton for carrying wheat. trip ?",7,Adjournment Formal Embargo On Coal Exportation

As a matter of fact, shipowners declare that they can get £ 2 0 or more per ton for the round trip from London to London, whereas two or three years ago their ret u r n would be below £ 2 or £ 3 per ton. what would be the effect of establishing that parity? would pay to grow wheat in Australia if we had to pay the enormous freights r u l ing in other parts of the world to-day. A very generous interpretation has been placed on the question of the suitability of vessels for carrying wheat, and those that have been classed as unsuitable for tliat purpose have been permitted to carry coal. Tonnage to the extent of 48,000 has been refused. Quoting from the list of vessels which have been refused coal, and what ultimately became of them, I find that one vessel took wheat, another left in ballast, a third was requisitioned by the Wheat Board. A fourth vessel has noted against it the fact that the proposed consignee was on the black list. member who asked whether we can guarantee where the coal will go.

I assure the honourable member that I have placed the position of the coal-miners before the Wheat Board in as favorable a light as possible. The members of the Board realize their responsibility to do their best to get wheat away from Australia. We must see that our industries are kept going. We have no right to say that the coal trade shall suffer for the benefit of the wheat trade, but it must be remembered that we had 4,000,000 tons of wheat to ship to the other side of the world at the end of last season, and it is f a r better that vessels should be requisitioned to carry overseas wheat which is required by our Allies. It is also better from a Commonwealth point of view, for wheat is a commodity which can be reproduced in Australia. much reproduced unless better freights are offered. done nothing to prevent freights coming COOK I merely asked here. On the contrary, we have sent cable after cable to Londoni n the endeavour to get freights. We have represented I doubt whether it to the British Government that if Britain and her Allies require wheat, we have it in Australia, and we have asked that special efforts be made by them to get it shifted to Europe. that should be made locally in order to get bottoms to carry wheat away. have done that purposely, but commodities have been imported in vessels which it is proposed shall take wheat away. I have quoted statistics regarding the vessels that have been taking coal, the quant it y sent away in bunkers, and the quant it y refused. There are under consideration applications of six vessels, totalling 18,000 tons, and I have asked that the This will answer the honourable matter shall be dealt with promptly. In trade one cannot afford to hang up business.

I suppose that the out, but if we are to judge from the cable messages the British Government have their hands fairly f u l l with their own troubles. There is another aspect of the wheat question. Particulars are published from time to time regarding the advances to farmers. I am not sure as to the relations between the Commonwealth and the Statesi n this regard, b u t I know that £11,237,000 has been advanced to farmers, and I believe the Commonwealth is one of the joint guarantors.

A t uiie same time, I assure the House that the coal-miners will not be overlooked. I will bring the representations of the honourable member for Hunter under the notice of the Wheat Board as quickly as possible in order to see if arrangements cannot be made for either more tonnage or a fairer apportionment of that which we can get. had various communications with the Minister of Trade and Customs regarding the shortage of freight and other difficulties which have arisen in connection with the transport of wheat. I look at the position from the stand-point of the ordinary business man. The Government exriect neutral vessels which come to Australia to carry wheat at freights below tlie market rate. The honourable member for In d i , who knows nothing about the subject, patriotism. What patriotism can we expect from neutral powers? Their only object is to get as much money as possible for the services they perform. ing about that. member does not know what he is talking about, because that is what the House was discussing. The Minister of Customs says ships can get freight fro m Australia to South America for £ 3 5s., and that it pays them a good deal better to do that than to make the longer voyage from Australia to the United Kingdom through waters that are dangerous for £ 4 15s. If that be so, how can we expect vessels, particularly those of neutral powers, to come to Australia and carry our wheat away ? They are not interested in Australian wheat. They are interested only in getting the best freights to make their vessels pay. Britisli ships are as f u l l y occupied as they can be, and I see little or no hope of in creasing our tonnage from British sources for the removal of Australian wheat. Goods imported from the United States of America, particularly from New York, are costing in freight about £ 1 0 per ton. That freight has been rapidly mounting up, and one reason is that we do not allow the vessels to get back loading. Many would take coal from Newcastle to the west coast of America, and then go round to New York, via the Panama Canal, but if they are sent back in ballast they have lost so much earning power. The consequence is that if they come back to Australia at all they w ill take fine care that they get as much freight on the voyage to Australia as will pay them for the time in which they are returning to America empty. In other words, the loading from New York to Melbourne or Sydney has to pay, not only the cost of coming here, but also the cost of the ship's retur n voyage. That is why freight is £ 1 0 a ton to-day. The honourable member for Hunter suggests tliat those ships w ill not voyage to Australia if they are not allowed back loading. It is safe to say that they will continue to come to Australia only if they can get sufficient freight for the single voyage to pay them for the return voyage. If they can get regular freight back to America, they are more likely to return, and we shall have a chance of a reduction in the interjects something about freights from New-York. Having some knowledge of the coal trade, I know the difficulty which the Newcastle people experience in retaining their overseas trade owing to the competition of the Philippines and Japan. If we are to shut out I was not talkthe foreign coal trade completely it may happen that when our men return after tlie honourable the war and seek employment, the coal trade will be in the hands of the Japanese, and we shall have great difficulty in recovering it . I would suggest that where it is evident to the Minister that a ship will not take wheat to Europei t is clearly his duty to allow the vessel to load coal, so long as its destination is such that the coal is not likely to find its way into enemy hands. There may be enemy ""ships interned on the west coast of North and South America, but I presume that British Consuls at the different ports would know whether those ships were receiving Australian coal. If they were, they would be getting it only for the purpose of escaping and becoming commerce raiders. But I take it that it would be the duty of Consuls to ascertain whether interned enemy ships are armed or not. If theire is no danger of our coal finding its way into the hands of the enemy, there is always a good market for it in San Francisco, because American coal to reach that city has to be carried across the Rocky Mountains. That is why Australia has the benefit of the trade with San Francisco. No better illustration of the effect of Government interference",9,Adjournment Formal Embargo On Coal Exportation

While the Government are trying to do what appears best for tlie farming community by getting our wheat shifted at the lowest cost, we are in reality merely shifting the burden on to other shoulders.

Further, a large number of British ships went over to Norway, Sweden, Denmark, or America, and were there chartered, and are now enjoying the ruling high profits. This departure of 600,000 tons meant the possibility of making twelve trips across the Atlantic, or four trips to Australia; and it is evident that the carrying capacity is not to be measured by 600,000 tons, but by the number of voyages that can be made. In this way, the ability of the British Government to carry men and munitions of war is lessened to the extent of millions of tons in shipping; and this by men to whom the matter is not one of ''patriotism,"" but one of ""pure business."" scuttled to Dutch Batavia, Manila, Argentine, Callao and other ports in South America, and entered into charter contracts, to escape the operation of the British law. say that there are hundreds of British ships, flying the British flag, under nominal charters, who never go near British ports, although they are enjoying the protection of the British flag. The Financial Beview of Reviews has published a statement of what is going on in South America. There enormous contracts have been entered into with German firms; and of 500,000 tons of maize that left San Nicholas, nine-tenths went to Germany through Scandinavian ports. that port had wheat in the lower holds for the German Government, and horses up above for the British Government; and, after the horses had been landed in Scotland, the wheat was taken to Gothenburg, and there discharged directly into a ship for Lubeck, in Germany. The same sort of thing is going on in other cases. Talk of patriotism!

I agree that, so far as neutral shipping is concerned, it would be better to give the vessels coal and let them go away with a f u l l cargo, rather than tie up a great industry in Australia. As to what the honourable member for Henty said in regard to kerosene, I do not see that we should get that commodity cheaper if we sent coal back, because the l i m it of the freight charges is the l i m it to what can be extracted; this business is not measured by any spirit of generosity. It is true that if vessels cannot carry coal back they must make the single voyage pay them; and if they do get coal that means so much more profit. In order to get our internal products away, we ought to give these neutral ships all and every facility for loading from our ports. It is far better to have men employed than to have them idle; and we cannot cope with the wheat difficulty by simply tying up neutral shipping. last, then. two or three times. trebled the price we are w ill i ng to pay for acted upon that advice, and as a result transport to British ports, I venture to say that those neutral ships would not take our wheat. Againi t is a question of business; and the reason is that it is f a r better to bring products to Australia and remain in neutral waters, irrespective of the price. It is far better to make these high profits voyage after voyage than to take a f u l l cargo from here to Great Britain and run the risk of being torpedoed or commandeered. nightly lievienv has given a list of the shipping sold, and all the prices paid; and the Age has shown how vessels have made as much on one voyage as paid for their purchase. Of course, to a ship-owner this is a pure matter of business. The ship-owner says to himself: "" It may be true that the British Empire is in need of wheat, and is desirous of If that is so, why did the transporting troops.

The arrangement of the Commonwealth Government to export only wheat, or as much wlieat as possible, has had the effect of disrupting every other branch of industry. Instead of seizing only 50 per cent, of the war profits made by ship-owners, the Imperial Governmenb should have commandeered the whole of those profits. Surely British politicians are capable of devising a scheme which would effectually prevent ship-owners from transferring their vessels to neutral flags, and thus continuing to make abnormal profits. Of course, there are a lot of things that we cannot talk about now, but we do know that a sufficient quantity of wheat is not being exported to materially ease tlie situation. it? British Government, by their action, have thrown our industries into disorder. It is not a fair thing that the interests of the Australian mining industry should be entirely subordinated to the wheat industry. Our Government should immediately communicate with the British Government, requesting them to supply the necessary ships to carry out their share of the compact into which they entered. If they say that it cannot be done, they should be given a gentle hint that the way to secure cheaper bottoms is to prevent ship-owners from making enormous profits during this time of stress and struggle by commandeering the whole of their profits.

How can our own people be hurt if the outsiders get better freights? It does not affect our own people. Do they get better freights by reason of the fact that these other ships go away empty?

I sympathize with that honourable member. I know his difficulties, and those of the men whom he represents in this Chamber so intelligently and well, and I shall do all I can to help him. The only practical solution of which I can think is that the Minister should lose no time in inducing the Wheat Board to let these ships carry coal when and so long as they are unable to carry wheat. Minister has said that permission to carry coal has been refused to about six steamers. l e f t in ballast, as against about 100 which have taken wheat. that left in ballast came here, no doubt, for the specific purpose of obtaining cargoes of coal. When some months ago the ""Government placed an embargo on the first tramp steamer that came here witli an inward cargo with the intention of picking up an outward cargo of coal, the news became world-wide, and as soon as it became known that an embargo was placed on the export of coal from Australia, dozens of other vessels that would have come here would not make the voyage. If , as a result of the representations made here to-day, the Government decide to remove that embargo, many other vesthe White sels will be put into the Australian coal trade, and the hardship at present suffered by the Newcastle miners w ill be considerably reduced. The Minister should I look at their protake into most serious consideration the matter of announcing the intention of the Government to remove the embargo.

I am quite satisfied that the Minister will look very carefully into all the necessary safeguards. I believe, with the honourable member who preceded me, that when the shipping companies learn that there is coal to take away from Australia, other ships may be induced to come here, and any increase in the number of ships coming to Australia may possibly release a greater number of vessels for the conveyance of wheat., If serious trouble arises in regard to the removal of not only the wheat now in stacks along the railway lines throughout Australia, but also that which will be yielded at the forthcoming harvest, there will be very little inducement But those six vessels to farmers to put in a wheat crop in the following season; because if we had a superabundance of wheat on our hands, wheat-growing would be an absolutely unprofitable occupation, and farmers would not get anything like a living wage for their toil and trouble.

I am only sorry that the Government have not seen fit to ""exercise a greater control over freights in regard to shipping during this war. While I believe that we can have too much Government interference in regard to commerce, and production, and utilities in peace times, I think that during a period of war the Government should take control of all means of transport in order to help forward the production of the nation which is necessary for carrying on the war, and also for the very purpose of conducting the war as it should be carried on. of the biggest matters any Government could undertake. Great Britain owns about half the shipping of the world. When war was declared the British Government were bold enough to take over the railways, and utilize them in every way that they thought necessary for the proper prosecution of the war, and for the regulation of all traffic upon them, but it was a great misfortune that a similar action was not taken by that Government, in conjunction w i th the Dominion Governments, in regard to the whole of our shipping. It is variously estimated that from 40 per cent, to 50 per cent, of our available shipping, including interned vessels, was requisitioned by the British Government and the Dominion Governments, but no real control has been exercised over the balance. As far as I can ascertain, the Government has allowed freights on these particular vessels to be regulated by private individuals, and companies are earning from 65 per cent, to 100 per cent, profit, and in many instances many hundreds per cent, on the cargoes they are taking. The shipping should be utilized by the Government to carry the primary products, whether coal or wheat, to the greatest advantage of the nation. It is not a question of putting one industry against another. The production of coal or wheat or any other staple commodity is absolutely essential if we are to do our duty in this war, and the Government as the only supreme authority should regulate the shipping of it , its disposal, and all freightage, and it should exercise a restraining influence as to the price to be paid for transport by all consignees. I do not know how far the Government have dealt with this question-whethe r they have dealt with it comprehensively, or have undertaken to deal with it only in piecemeal fashion-bu t it is not yet too late for the Government to tackle it with a view to exercising control over all vessels and regulating the cargoes to be carried in their bottoms. I hope this discussion will have the effect of causing the Government to look into the matter, with the view, not of exercising a certain haphazard control over the vessels which they have in hand, and allowing freights to be fixed by companies which are making colossal profits, but, if necessary, of entering into negotiations with the Imperial Government, or stimulating the present negoThe control of shipping is one tiations by the Prime Ministeri n England. Just as it is necessary that the Government should have complete control over transport within our borders, so is it necessary that the control of shipping should be in the hands of the governmental authorities in the various self governing Dominions in association with the Imperial Government. The honourable member for Hunter is to be commended for bringing the matter forward, and I hope that before the House adjourns we shall be afforded a further opportunity of expressing our opinion, unless the Government are prepared, in the meantime, to assure the House that arrangements for the carrying of Australia's primary products have been 1 placed on a more business-like footing, and that they will exercise a greater control over both freights and cargoes. believe this discussion has enabled honourable members to get a better knowledge of the exact position in regard to the shipment of wheat and coal.

I assure the House that there are no more loyal men in the Empire than the coal-miners of Newcastle and Maitland. suffer, if that be necessary, in the interests of the Empire, but if the Empire is not benefiting by their suffering they expect to be givena fair deal. The Leader of the Opposition and other honourable members asked why neutral ships, which cannot be compelled to carry wheat, should be forced to depart in ballast. That is the crux of the question. If they will not take wheat, and they cannot be commandeered, it will be better to allow them to carry something, and so give employment to our coal miners, and keep our coal trade connection alive unti l the war is over. The Minister stated that only seven boats had departed in ballast, and that applications relating to six others were under consideration at the present time. Fawkner pointed out, the point is not so much in the number of vessels which have gone away in ballast .as it is in the effect upon owners in other parts of the world of their ships being obliged to depart from Australian shores empty. owners would naturally, as business men, refuse to enter into arrangements to send ehips to Australia for coal cargoes, because they would be afraid that the Government would not allow them to load, If the Minister wil l be good enough to place both the points I have mentioned before the Wheat Board and the Government, I believe that something can be done to relieve the coal trade without detriment to the cause of the Allies.

It is particularly unfortunate, however, that this should have been permitted by the Government in the year of our record expenditure, and I would remind the Treasurer that a very vital principle is at stake in connection with this matter. That principle was alluded to in passing by the Leader of the Opposition, and it is the control by the people's representatives ' of taxation disbursements of public revenues. am aware that the Treasurer has stated that the excuse for his belated production of tlie Budget was his late assumption of office. But he only needs to be reminded that the Estimates w i th which we are now asked to deal were produced in d r a f t by his predecessor many months ago. So far as one is able to judge from a perusal of them, they have not been altered at a l l ; therefore, within a week or two of the present Treasurer's acceptance of office he could have produced his Budget, the whole figures for which were apparently in the Treasury, and had been produced in d r a f t for the consideration of the Committee before we adjourned at Christmas. We ought to remember that, although in this bewildering period many of our preconceived ideas have to be put aside, and many established practices and time-honoured traditions have to be abrogated by the tacit consent of both parties, parliamentary control of the finances is not one of them.

Whether we are at war or not, the figures should be produced for members to scan, so that they may truth f u l l y and intelligently perform their duty to their constituents.

142,On Motion By Mr Higgs,,19,Budget 1915 16
143,Mr Watt (Balaclava) [4.18],"I nand I hope to continue that attitude until the end of the war. In former years I have tried to fight as vigorously as my enthusiasm for the cause I represent has permitted, but, like many other honourable members on both sides of the House, I have laid aside all such fighting during this period of chaos and turmoil. I hope we shall continue to do so. It is in tliat spirit that I desire to discuss the all important question of Australia's part in the war. Comparisons have been made in this debate, and in recent statements by the Government in this chamber, of the relative strength of the contributions by Australia and other Dominions, and I am bound to confess that, so f a r as I am able . to judge by the in formation in the press, Australia stands very well in the comparison. I am in complete agreement w i th honourable gentlemen If we are to judge ourselves only by the number of men that have pro ratd departed from the shores of New Zealand or Canada, or have been called upon in or outside SouthA f r i c a , under the colours of that country, Australia has no reason to arises how far we are to allow this kind of comparison to determine our efforts. I am sure that honourable members opposite would nob suggest that, even if the other Dominions had been neglectful of their responsibility, this should form an argument for Australia not extending herself to the fullest. No logical extension of that argument should deter us from doing what we believe to be our bounden duty to the Empire, our Allies, and our own people in Australia. I remind honourable members also that in any comparison we make with Canada, there are two factors to which, I think, enough publicity has not been given. We are happily free from the threat of foreign molestation or invasion because of the fact that the British Navy still commands the waters of the world; and Canada, on her eastern and western coast lines, is similarly protected. But Canada has a mighty frontier to the south, beyond which reside 13,000,000 Germans under the Stars and Stripes. Prom the figures available, we see that in Canada there is a large number of enlisted men who have not yet departed for the front , but who are regarded as an army for home defence. This is, I think, a safeguard that the Canadian authorities do well to provide. [288] in the total Canadian figures. one comparison. My point is that if we go by embarkations we are judging unfairly. The conditions of the countries are not quite similar. We have no occasion to keep any substantial army, whereas Canada must, because there are opportunities for bands of men to cross the southern frontier and inflict great damage on the people of the Dominion. If honourable members analyze the recent Canadian Budget they will see bhere a much wider ambition sketched than we have in Australia. Apart altogether from the enrolled men who have embarked and fought, Canada this year has made financial provision for 500,000 men; and that means by March, for I fancy thab the financial year of Canada, as in Britain, ends on the last opposite in that view. day of that month. If that be so, it will be seen that the Canadian objective vastly outstrips anything we have done; and, by voluntary or conscriptive enlistment, the Dominion contribution will eventually exceed that of the . Australian Commonwealth. both political parties in Canada that this force is to be raised by the voluntary system. nouncement. I have, however, read that there is a movement towards conscription in Canada; but we in public life know how easily rumours are manufactured, and that rumour I do not credit. Certaini t is that in Canada during the present financial year provision is made for 500,000 men. I agree with honourable members opposite who complain somewhat of the criticism in certain quarters against the voluntary system. I ts friends say that that system has done wonderfully well; and so it has. Speaking as a voluntaryist u n t i l about eight months ago, I say that the voluntary system exceeded the expectations of its most ardent advocates in Australia. It does not follow, because some of us feel that that system has not the strength it formerly had, that we should decry it , in view of the vast response during the early and critical period of the war. One might as well say, when a great racehorse has broken down, that it had never been able to run at a l l ; and that is not the view I take of the voluntary system. I think that throughout tlie Empire the response",19,Budget 1915 16

147,Mr Watt,"I have not seen that, anhas been marvellous. Particularly may this be said of SouthA f r i c a , although comparative figures might not disclose the fact. South Africa appeared to be honeycombed with small sectional disaffections that amounted to revolt, and eventually broke into open rebellion. It was much more dimcult for the South African Union to deal with its local troubles than it was for Australia to organize and send men to the front . ""We ought, therefore, to give credit to the Dominions generally for a unanimity in spirit, if not in actual numbers, with ourselves. But I cannot help thinking that all present signs indicate that our praise of the voluntary system cannot be indefinitely continued. Looking backward, we must give it all the encomiums it deserves, but, looking forward from our present stand-point, it causes a great deal of misgiving to those who believe that the efforts in this war must be maintained and extended on a greater scale than ever. The Australian Grovernment made an offer, in November, I think, of fresh brigades and reinforcements to the Imperial authorities. Later, there arose a cry in some quarters that the Australian Government had not fulfilled its pledge in regard to the number. I do not take the view that the Government have broken their pledge in spirit or letter, and I have openly said so. I do not believe that when we made the offer it was intended, either by the Cabinet or by the War Committee, to definitely pledge ourselves to supply 300,COO men within the time stipulated. What was thought was that, so long as the losses continued on the then scale at Gallipoli, that number would be necessary, and it was unfortunately stated that, as a result of our offer, our contribution would amount to 300,000. That was never intended to be part of the offer, but, unfortunately, the Dominions and the British people generally began to say that Australia would have 300,000 men in the field by the 30th June. Thus Australia, inferentially, became committed to that number. ister himself definitely say that that was the number? judge by the scrappy cable reports, afterwards repeated that figure in ""England. sioner raised it to about 350,000. has a habit of doing that sort of t h in g ; in actual effect than was anticipated. but he is now an official out of politics, and he has his "" boss "" in England looking after h i m . land is that the contribution will be 300,000 or 350,000. pression that the figure is 300,000, and it is for the Government to say whether, unwittingly and unintentionally or not, Australia's fame and name have been pledged to such an offer. I , for one, would not insist upon it , because, if we furnish the brigades we promised, and the number of men which the BritishW a r authorities considered necessary as reinforcements, we shall keep our definite compact with the Empire. the Minister of Defence says. with the view, although many of the supporters of my party in the press and in the country take a totally different view.

However, based on that offer, we started a new system-no t the old system of meetings to encourage enlistment only, although that was part of the campaign which was started at the beginning of the year, and which all honourable members.who have addressed such meetings will agree have proved comparative failures.

We had, in addition, the new card and recruiting sergeant system, elaborated with great care by expert organizers within the Departments of the Commonwealth and State. The system has cost a lot of moneyI do not know how much-bu t we have not got anything like the result that was expected. MrJ . H . CATTS -The cost represents about £150,000. ing, classifying, and circulating the cards, and so forth , the expense means something like £200,000 or £300,000 for the brief period of some seven months.

Why? take part feel the f u t i l it y of continuing, although aided by all the forces placed at their disposal. They realize how much harder it is to comb the nation a second time. tively easy, and as soon as the message had been understood the response was magnificent, and worthy of the Australian people. was extremely hard, although the machinery was of double strength. withstanding all this assistance, the result now-as possibly the honourable member for Cook, speaking with greater authority, will agree-is that the whole mechanism is tumbling to pieces. If that is so, we must take the view, either that Australia has reached her* maximum contribution, or that, whether we like it or not, another system must be adopted. As to the contribution of Australia, I should like to remind honourable members where we stand with regard to the commitments in brigades that were sent, or are being sent, and how our camps will be situated at the end of three months' time, unless we [288]-2 « secure something more effective than the present voluntary enlistment. The figures I have, which are up to the second or third month in the year, show that there were then 60,000 men in camp in Australia. This means that the book strength was 60,000, but assuming a 10 per cent, leakage-which , from former experience, Although we have not is not too large, and probably about right -the effective embarkation strength was 54,000. There is to leave some time in May this 3rd Division, which consists, all told, of 23,500 troops, plus the general reinforcements of 9,500, which are to go during the same month. This will take from the 54,000 troops in camp at the beginning of the present month some 33,000 men, leaving only 21,000 in camp. The enlistments up to the end of A p r i l were, broadly speaking, at the rate of 6,000 per month. That rate is falling rapidly. Assuming that it gets down to 5,000, and I think it will f a l l vastly below that number unless the movement receives a great stimulus in some way, it is obvious that W it h the cost of printour reinforcements will last only another three or four months. This calculation, however, is based on the assumption that our troops suffer losses only on the level of those sustained on the western front. Should their losses exceed that level, our reinforcements will need to be correspondingly strengthened. As far as we Because those who can tell, our boys are not having too rosy a time just now. If it be true that 300 wounded Australians landed in England last week, and that this week another 500 have been The first combing was comparainvalided to hospitals there, we shall find that our reinforcements will have to be rapidly re-gauged and correspondingly in creased. Consequently, the Eorcesi n camp The second combing, however, will probably suffice to meet requirements, not for three months, but only for two Notmonths. This is a position which no man can gainsay, and I think that it throws on the shoulders of thoughtful in dividuals on both sides of the movement the responsibility of saying how we are to meet that difficulty. I am not one of those who think that Australia has put forth her maximum effort even under the voluntary system; but I am certain that she has not given her fullest strength to the Empire when she is maintaining only about 130,000 men in the fighting line, which is all we shall have on the western front .

183,Mr Watt,"I am coming to that parthonorable member for Brisbane. dealt very strongly with the question of conscription from his point of view. He said that there were many, things which honourable members would give up at the present time for the sake of national safety and security, but he could' not give up his feelings on conscription, because it was a principle with him. He took his stand upon that, and against him, apparently, the gates of hell could not prevail. sharply from this side of the chamber. He was asked whether he was in favour of conscription for home defence, and I do not think that he answered the question. If it is a question of principle, conscription is equally obnoxious whether it is applied to the men who fight here or to the men who fight in Samoa. In the early stages of this now somewhat historic session, the honourable member for Bourke alluded to tlie Defence Act. ' ' If you cut a few words out of this Defence Act conscription is operative."" 1 There is nothing in tlie Constitution to prevent conscription, but there is something in the Defence Act which prevents a man from being taken by any system of conscription and forced to fight outside the territorial limits of Australia. If we cut out those words from the Defence Act, then, in the language of the Constitution, if the Ministry determine that they have power to make laws for the defence of Australia, and if they determine that the defence of Australia is being conducted in France or Salonika, they have a perfect right to send men away. The honourable member for Brisbane did not answer the question as to whether he believed in the compulsory provisions relating to home defence. But where is the difference between taking a class of men from their homes to dig in beside their picket fences and fight for the protection of their homes, or, if the strategic conditions of war compel it , taking them outside the territorial limits to some island to fightthere for the safety of Australia ? Surely there is no difference in principle? We can send men to one portion of New Guinea and not to the other. If conscription had been in force at the beginning of the war, our troops could not legally have crossed the border between Papua and German New Guinea. Surely that is an absurdity? that the old doctrine of home defence He must give place to that of defence overseas, to the Nelsonic doctrine that advocates entering the enemy's waters, or, in the language of Lord Jack Fisher, the doctrine that the frontiers of England are the coasts of the enemy? When we conceive what modern warfare implies, we have to rip out of our minds the fallacious distinction between home defence and defence overseas, calling home defence so because it is conducted on our The answer came swiftly and shore line, when it is equally home defence when the fight is fought in any other part of the world. The men who fought in the Levant and east of the Suez Canal, and who are now fighting in the north-west of France, risk their lives for the protection of Australia that they have lef t behind them. We should be military lunatics if , defying the high traditions of modern military science, we stayed in Australia and waited for the enemy to He said, come to us; yet that is what is suggested by tbe creation of a false distinction between home defence and defence overseas. Another objection to compulsion is that it creates a military class and leads to military domination. I do not charge any honourable member of this Committee with having espoused that view; but daily and weekly I read of certain resolutions having been passed, and I say that many industrialists who fear conscription hold that view and attempt to persuade the Australian people that we are in danger of having the Australian system Prussianized. This belief on their part is not unnatural, but they do not understand the position. those who advocate conscription have in the past been their bitter enemies. people belonging to the < honourable member's party, men who have been in it all their lives, advocate conscription; and, although I am not qualified to decide, I venture to say that if they were individually free to express their opinions still more of them would do so. However, I cannot hide from myself the fact that there has been in the organizations with which the honourable member is identified a movement by which they have built up what looks like a spiked wall against conscription, but which, I think, will be found to be buil t of gelatine when Do we not realize now the heat of national anger that w ill arise from their ranks plays on it .",25,William Irvine I T Is Not Con The Grecian Authorities Have Permitted

There are men who ask, as the interjection of the honourable member for In d i suggests, "" Do you advocate only the conscription of manhood?"" I have incurred misunderstanding and, I think, political opposition, by saying plainly some months ago on the platform t h a t I was in favour of the conscription of wealth. I said it at Collingwood, where the mistaken members of that Yarra constituency were giving the Acting Leader of the House such a bad time when he talked about volunteerism. I told them a few home truths, and got home alive. I told them. I did not admire their manners or their treatment of their own member who had risen to such eminence ih the party and in the councils of the State, when he told them the true story of the war. What do we mean by conscription of wealth? Unfortunately, we have never got down to a straight talk about it in a deliberative assembly like this. It has been the subject of resolutions galore, and of inflammatory, flamboyant speeches ad infinitum, but we have reached no understanding about it . There are b ut two ways in which conscription of wealth can be made operative. One is to say, "" The whole of the accumulated wealth or capital of a country is leviable, and the Government or Parliament of the time will take it as it needs it . "" In a time of stress like that, if the nation got right up against the proposition of needing the money, it would be justified in doing anything, and its action should not be called confiscation. If you can benefit your country by saying to the man who has £100,000, "" Give us £ 5 0 , 0 0 0; we must have it for the purposes of the war, "" take it , for the safety of the public is the supreme law. But the trouble about propositions of that kind is that you cannot very well operate them in that way without injurin g the country you are endeavouring to advance. If you said, "" Every man with £10,000 worth of land values must give half of it to the State,"" how would they do it? Only by selling or getting loans on their property. If you advance such an order to a community, and compel men to put large quantities of land on the market, you are preventing the sale of land, glutting the market, reducing values, and destroying titles. Incidentally, whether you like it or not, you are dealing a trenA military chant blow at the stability of the foundations of society. I do not urge this, because by so doing you are expropriating. Expropriation would be completely justified if the nation in its hour of trial demanded it , but the probable effects of any movement must always be studied. If you took such a course with regard to land values the effect generally would be to destroy securities for moneys already lent. You would get down to a value where there was no margin. All the owners of capital lent on real estate would say, "" I made a contract, and the margin on the property was so much. As soon as my mortgage is up I shall not renew the loan, but will call the money in . Otherwise my security will be gone, and my assets have vanished."" So they would begin to call m their money. Tbe honourable member for Bourke will agree that tliat is quite probable, although he would undoubtedly lash with his barb-wired tongue the men responsible for those operations. If you say, "" We dare not do that with land, because we should be destroying land values, on which so many other margins are based, but will do it with Government stock,"" you will simply follow the same process in another way. If you tell men with a certain quantity of stock, "" We want some of that money; it is only a paper document, and you must lend it to the Government,"" the only way in which the Government can make it a medium of exchange for their war requirements is to raise money on it . They must, therefore, compel the holder to sell or raise an advance on it , and, just as with land, the forced sale of securities will glut the market w i th public bonds, and reduce values almost to zero. You will^not get, as the result of all these operations, any money worth talking about, but in practice you will lower the whole of the realizable assets of the country by hurling them in a panic on the market, for the man who has a little spare cash to buy. It is the same with stock-in-trade, and with plants and i m plements, as I am sure the eminent economists on the other side w ill realize. plying securities.",27,William Irvine I T Is Not Con The Grecian Authorities Have Permitted
188,Mr Kingo ' Malley,"Y o u are multito the wealth of tlie country or increasing the revenues of the Government during the war. That is why Parliaments have, on all occasions, except in the hour of their nation's deepest distress, asked themselves, "" How shall we get money for a w a r ? "" and have decided, as the present Government have done, to levy their taxation where they thought f it on the incomes of the people. And that is quite a wise course. If you adopt it you can take all the income, except a bare living wage, if the nation needs it . That will not destroy values or promote high prices for goods, or throw out of employment large numbers of men, or render the occupations of others precarious. The Government are pursuing the only wise course in saying that the produce of wealth of this year must he at their disposal. "" This year we take 50 per cent.."" but next year they may say, "" We must take all above £300 per annum."" If they do, while many men will squeal, I for one shall not oppose any levy that will not break down the foundations of employment and security.

204,Mr Anstey,"Hear, hear! No Toryprobrium that is offensive to me. I think we can very easily arrive at an agreement in regard to the conscription of wealth, Viewing tlie matter as I have stated it , and I do not think tliere is any honourable gentleman opposite who would object to a f u l l exercise of the kind of conscription I have referred to. Neither would he advocate the other kind, because it would be destructive of the highest national in terests which we are in duty bound to preserve. Therefore, I say to the Government, ' ' If we are to have the conscription of manhood, exercise as you tliink wise the conscription of incomes."" Take the other view, which is held largely by men who work at craft occupations. There is undoubtedly amongst them a fear that conscription, for military service particularly, will mean also industrial conscription. Again, I say that industrial conscription would be justified in the hour of the nation's direst peril. The Government might say to certain men, "" Y o u are earning £ 4 a week; you can live on £ 3 , and you will have to work for that wage because wo want all the profit there is in the industry in order to enable us to carry on our military preparations."" If we got to that position, new conditions to by established by the Government in connection with all industrial occupations would be justified, but I do not think we have reached, nor are likely to reach, anywhere near that position in this war. I am viewing the question of conscription as if it were not necessary to alter by one jot the industrial conditions under which organized labour works and lives. I do not see why it should be necessary so long as the work of the community goes on to the satisfaction of the Government. The Government are entitled, however, to say with respect to a certain class of work that men have no right to strike during war. Supposei t were determined by the Government that the production of metals from BrokenH ill was absolutely essential to the success of the Allied Forces. In such circumstances they might well say to the men, "" Y o u must work. If you have grievances, bring them before the A r b i tration Court or some other tribunal we shall provide, but you must not strike, because the production of those metals must go on continuously."" But in all other occupations it would be ridiculous for the Government to intervene during a period of conscription to upset conditions which have been erected slowly from decade to decade by the Parliaments of Australia. There is, perhaps, a more serious objection in the minds of some men who do not necessarily belong to craft unions. It is the historic objection to compulsion, the desire to have their freedom uninterrupted and unimpaired. That was a sound view when men were conscripted by the press gangs of Englandf o r naval and military work to forward the aims of wars involving dynastic advantages or territorial acquisition. When the making of wars was decided by monarchs it was right for men to say, "" I do not believe in this war, and to force me to take part in it takes away my most cherished r i g h t . "" But to-day the conditions are different. Every man who fights anywhere, certainly every man who fights on the side of the Allies, fights for what he considers his individual possession, as well as the collective liberties of the nation to which he belongs, and in that way a man is not doing anything derogatory to Democracy by fighting, but is giving expression to the highest form of democratic duty, because we are all of opinion that we are in this war righteously, and we have to see it through or our liberties are not secure. And those liberties are just as much to the man earning £ 2 a week as to the man with £10,000 a year. In that sense, all men and all classes have mingled in the Armies of Australia, and every man feels, as he would feel whether he was fighting compulsorily or voluntarily, that he is fighting for what he considers to be his dearest possessions, not for the selfish aims of ambitious princes or unscrupulous diplomats, but for what he has been brought up to regard as the priceless heritage of himself and his children. There are some honourable members who believe that those who argue for conscription do so only because thoy desire a few more men to be sent to the front. There are lots of different objects for which conscription could be advocated. The need for more men is one of them. If we want more men I do not think we shall get them unless in the near f u t u r e we adopt some for m of conscription, but, even if we do not want more men, we should have for the raising of our reinforcements a more orderly gathering of the men of the country to fight for the rights of the country.

Is Australia to ho the obstinate juryman? Surely not. neither is Russia, nor Italy, nor Belgium, nor Servia, nor Montenegro. all these nations, lined up with us, are wrong, and that we only are right. Is England wrong? No. England, apparently after the most careful thought and gradual fermentation in party beliefs, has adopted, by the almost unanimous consent of Parliament in both Houses, the policy of compulsion. In a House of Commons of over 600 members, fewer than fifty were found to vote against conscription in the final stages of the measure. What does that mean? Does it mean.that, even if we wish/we can any longer argue this question purely on its .local political merits? We cannot do so. Are Englishmen to be compelled to step into the ranks and Australians to be free? Is the mau who lives in Liverpool, in Glasgow, or in Sheffield to be under military order, and the man who lives in Sydney or Melbourne, in this most bountiful country in the world, to be free? Do we not realize that we lived here for seventy or eighty years, and had not to spend a penny on the protection of our interests? Why was this? Because those very men in Liverpool or Glasgow, or their fathers, built the British Navy at their own cost. We had no need to make any levies, because the workmen of Great Britain paid heavy taxes during at least two generations, thus giving us our start in development. alloAv those workmen to carry the butt end of the log? I do not think so. I do not think there is any man, with the heart of a true Britisher which, I believe, we all have if we are sounded deep enough, who would say, '* Let the Englishman, the Welshman, the Scotchman, and the Irishman be called upon to obey orders, while the men of Australia are free."" It seems to me that we have done so well-hav e been so endowed by British statecraft, and by our own forbears, who began the development of Australia-that we dare not play such an ungrateful part during this war. must recognise, now the Mother Country Every nation worth has decided to conscript all her available manhood, that the Dominions of the Empire, whether they like it or not, will have to folloAv her great example. Is there one argument against that? With great respect I say that Ave must not take too France is not wrong, much comfort from the war-and here I repeat some of the language of the honourable member for Flinders, to whose Surely we cannot say that speech I listened Avith the deepest interest. The Avar is not over, and it probably will not be over before next winter, according to those critics Avhose opinions Ave are privileged to learn in scraps. It does appear to me that much of the crucial work that will predetermine the final issue of the Avar must be done before the close of October or NoAember.r Germany is shut in, and, judging by her apparent lack of desire to force the situation, she is content to sit behind the barbed-Avire fence formed by the bayonets of the Allied Forces. But'that will not win the war. When the Avar started, it was the German game to ""play and win,"" as iu a che3s problem. The onus of victory ivas on her; but, once Ave stopped her, and dug in, and re-formed the Hues after the great turning process of early 1915, the onus of victory gradually began to shift from the shoulders of the Germans to the shoulders of the Allies. In other Avords, if we cannot definitely and positively win, we have lost. This is no story told xor children in a kindergarten, but is the consensus of opinion of the competent critics of the world, neutral and belligerent. How are we to do this? Surely by adding all the weight and influence we can to the settlement of this question in Great Britain and the Dominions. France has put all her energy Are Ave still going to and devotion into this war, and what her men. and women have done will Jive to the end of time. It is said that there is not a man working with an implement in the fields of France, or a man driving a vehicle, or doing any other kind of work which a woman can manage, and which was formerly exclusively done by men. The women of France have stepued from their homes, where, outside Paris, they still lived sheltered lives, and havo taken, their share of great obligations. Every nation engaged in the war would appear to be extended to its fullest capacity. In Kussia, the problem is not, perWe haps, so much one of men as one of mobility, armaments, and ammunition; and it is probable that 2,000,000 or 3,000,000 more soldiers could be got from that country if transport and equipment were available. has not done her best is Britain, but she has started, and I hope that she wil l go on to the end, and that Australia w ill do the same and keep undimmed the lustre of the name gained for her by the boys who went so cheerfully with the colours and fought those historic fights at the Dardanelles. hardly know how to give adequate expression to my views, after listening to the speech of the Treasurer. orable gentleman, in the course of his remarks in reference to loans without interest, saidAn appreciation of these simple facts will us that the man who invests £100 in a prevent much confusion of thought and the spreading of foolish notions. When I hear that forced loans without interest mean confiscation, I cannot help realizing that the nostrums of yesterday are, interest from the country when another in many cases, the actualities of to-day, that many reforms advocated in the past, and since adopted, were originally spoken of in similar language. sort of language, which formerly came from our enemies, is coming from our most intimate friends. We have heard of beautiful as to tame wild beasts; and it is equally remarkable how tame to-day are the wild beasts of the past. This party has no argument against conscription. It cannot have' any. It was the first party to make it a party battlecry to have conscription of men for the defence of our country. with the honourable member for Balaclava when he says that once we admit the fact and aecept the principle of conscription, it is a matter of indifference where the men shall be called upon to fight. It may be a policy of discretion that, rather than have the fight around our own doors, we should carry it as f a r as possible away from our doors. I am not going to trouble very much about that. The honourable gentleman drew harrowing pictures of one family giving all its sons to the cause of the Empire, and another f a m i l y giving fourteen years for cornering a product none at all. It is very harrowing, very wrong, and very improper. B ut the honourable gentleman does not describe the only inequalities in this war. There is the spectacle of one man who sacrifices a job worth £500 a year for the defence of his country and his flag. He gives up an excellent position, carrying with it The only nation that security for his wife and family, for a miserable 6s. a day, and against his sacrifice we have the picture of another man who stops at home to reap profits and make money out of the war. That particular spectacle has not so f a r been presented to the country. If it be true that the nation is fighting for its life, and we should organize all the resources and energies of .the country for its defence, why stop short at the conscription of men ? W h y not organize all the necessary The honresources and energies of the country? Why permit one class .to make enormous profits out of the war and another to make only sacrifices ? The Treasurer told war loan is surely as much erifitled to his interest as another individual who invests the same sum in industries. Of course he is. But has he as much right to draw that man is giving his blood and his job for the country? This is the comparison which should be instituted: One man But now this gives up all he has and lays down his life for the country, and the other stops at home and invests his miserable £100. I shall not occupy your time for long, Orpheus, whose music was so but I wish to make a quotation from an article appearing under the title "" Your Money or your L if e , "" in The Nation, a newspaper published in England.

We find that two years before the Napoleonic wars closed, if a man dared to increase the price of goods, if he cornered a product to enhance the price to the individuals of the nation struggling, he was given long years of imprisonment. In the year 1812, one merchant in the city of London got and enhancing the price to his customers.

And yet in this ing must stop, or be greatly modified. That is their proposal. that. The article continuesWhy should the country in its need and poverty pay so much for what it has the power and the right to take without payment? There is no source of wealth in this country available for voluntary loans that is not likewise available for thc war levy here proposed, provided that rigorous means of financial compulsion are devised. I ask honourable members to listen to that. The unreality of these war loans we have frequently exposed. Two hundred millions of last summer loan, and a larger proportion of the first war loan, consisted of bankers' money, that did not represent real saving, but was in effect inflation of credit, which, when extended by the Government, raised prices, and cast a burden of the sacrifice upon the poorer classes of the eominunity, who suffer most from the rise of prices. Asi t is in England, so it is here. Conscription of wealth, somewhat along the lines we have suggested, must sooner or later be applied. If it is not applied soon it may be too late. Representatives of the Australian Natives Association and other men in this country talk of its need, but they know quite well that the problem is not to arm a quarter or half-a^rnillion men. The real question is, can we transport them overseas? That is the problem. If we cannot transport them, and if we go on adding too the numbers of men in camp, we shall simply be piling up expenditure without being able to get the men into the fighting area, where their services could be utilized. Now, we are carrying on this campaign by raising sums of money, and the honourable member for Balaclava says that he is favorable to the conscription of wealth. Others say it also-that there must be conscription of money, of material, and conscription of W h o wrote that article? men. But all this talk about the conscription of money and material is merely so much piffle, so much public dope. They do not mean it . All they want is the actual conscription of men. Taxation is not conscription of wealth, any more than taxing a man represents the W h a t is the date of it? conscription of that man. You are not conscripting a man if ' you put a charge on him of, say, £ 1 , £ 2 , £ 1 0 , or £ 2 0 . To conscript a man means to take h im, to put a brand of national ownership on him, order him to fight and, if need be, to die for his country. When conscripted, an instrument of the nation; he has lost country there are men who tell us that We do not say wealth is being conscripted. The other night Mr Frank Clarke got on the platform, and said the wealthy classes have contributed generously to this war; they have, so he told us, contributed £35,000,000 to the war loans. But have they lost that wealth ? No ; of course they have not, for it will come back to them after many days, well gilded by the blood of sacrifice, loaded with 4 | per cent, interest against the nation that is struggling for its existence. Their share ' of the war burden will be 4J per cent, and freedom from Federal and State taxation. We have raised loans, I understand, to the extent of £37,000,000 , also £25,000,000 from the British Government, and £30,000,000 or £40,000,000 on the credit of the note issue. If this war goes on much longer we shall be loaded to the extent of £200,000,000. to you is nothing just now. thing when men are losing their lives. The wealth of Australia is about £1,000,000,000, and as the result of this war we are going to have a load of debt of about £200,000,000, representing an in terest burden of £9,000,000 a year. There is no conscription of wealth here. To conscript wealth means to take it . is a fair amount; do you not think so?",34,Elliot Johnson An Y Man That Is The Condition I N Other Countries

I am glad that the immediate contents of the Budget have been overlooked in this debate, and subordinated to the discussion of an infinitely more important national subject, namely, that of conscription. We, on this side, urge the adoption of conscription in order to enable Australia to put forward her utmost efforts at the present juncture. The War Committee has already indicated that we are not sufficiently represented at the front . Our obligation as an outlying Dominion of the Empire is to put forward our maximum effort, and to do that we must adopt the experience of the nations of the world. We are fighting a conscript nation; our Allies are also conscript nations. resort to conscription merely for the purpose of satisfying some fad, but because it means organized effort, gives greater justice to the people, and is more effective than the voluntary system, w i th which, hitherto, we have been satisfied. Are we justified in ignoring the experience of the world in this respect? In fairness to our Allies, who have adopted Eveni f the owners of wealth conscription because it is the most effective system, are Avei n Australia justified in standing by and saying that we do not propose to give them the benefit of our best efforts in the prosecution of the war? Because that is what it means; and that is what we have to realize. I have been pleased to note the breadth of view of some honourable members in discussing this question. I emphasize, with a number of honourable members who have preceded me, what a calamity it would be if we permitted this matter to be debated from a party stand-point.

I regret the speeches made in this debate by the honourable member for Batman and the honorablo member for Brisbane. Those two gentlemen seemed to be completely out of touch w it h the strength of the fervour of which I have spoken. They seemed also to ignore the fact that we were now in the presence of a supreme crisis-practicall y at death grips with a vile and unscrupulous enemy, and that the world stands aghast at the hideous atrocities which have formed part and parcel of the methods of warfare of our barbarian foe.

Imperial Government. What the Mother Country has done in finance, also, is something ever to be remembered. Not only is she prepared to finance herself in order to fight the war to a successful issue, but to the extent of a large number of millions of pounds is giving assistance to the Allies. These facts fill us with pride and joy that we should belong to such an Empire, and they should stimulate us to put forth our best efforts. mittee has' already informed us, after f u l l investigation, that Australia has not yet put forth her best effort. only too patent to all of us. under an obligation to supply by the end of next month 300,000 men. I am aware that, after a process of calculation, the Minister of Defence stated that our honourable obligation does not exceed 209,000 men. bably so, and I do not dispute that fact, but I urge that Australia thought she had promised 300,000 men; the Mother Country thought that she had been promised 300,000 men, and, most important of all, the war demands that we shall supply upwards of that number. It is fairly obvious now that our anticipations are not to be realized, and, therefore, we have to resort to such a method as will bring about better and more effective results in Ausbralia. I have nothing to say against the operation of voluntaryism in the past. Voluntaryism I look upon as the purest patriotism, and we are proud of the early response that was made when the men of this community so willingly off e r e d .thoir services. The answer reflected the greatest credit upon the Commonwealth, and was the subject of much congratulation; but whilst I appreciate the earlier efforts of voluntaryism, I am not in f u l l accord with the latest methods. This system of flaring advertisements, of resort to the publicity artists, of attempting by abuse to dragoon men into enlisting, does not meet with my approval. That campaign, however, has demonstrated conclusively that the voluntary effort has completely failed, and has indicated with W it h the exception, perequal conclusiveness that conscription should have taken its place at an earlier period. There is hardly a man who can doubt that voluntaryism has had a fair trial, and no one can completely refute Turning to the the suggestion that it has failed. When we are searching for a more effective system, we look for guidance and aid to other parts of the world. The whole teaching of nations which have been at war, and of those now fighting, is that the maximum effort can be secured only by a system of conscription. We cannot avoid that object lesson. That being so, and having regard to the example of the Mother Country itself, there is an obligation on this community to resort to conscription with the least possible delay. The obstacles to conscription in the Mother Country apThe War Compeared to be almost insuperable; and, compared with them, our difficulties in Australia are of a most trifling character. That fact is In the House of Commons, the Prime We are Minister declared, upon the introduction of the Compulsory Service Bill,"" that its operation was to be general and immediate. It was to be immediate because of the exigencies of the war and the demand that a greater effort should be put forStrictly and technically this is proward at once. It is essential that its operation in Australia should be immediate, because, as has been emphasized by many speakers, conscription cannot be brought into force in a day. It has to be prepared for, and worked up to, and it is necessary that we should at once engage in the necessary preparations in order to gain the best results a few months hence. The Minister of Defence a littl e time ago strongly urged that voluntaryism was unfair and ineffective. The fact of its being unfair is demonstrated to each one of us every day; and it is the experience of every public man that there is a vast section of this community prepared to go to the front, but the unfairness of the operation of voluntaryism has been brought home to them, and they refuse to go until conscription is enacted. We cannot ignore those people, and they look to the Government for light and leading. It is well known that there are something like 120,000 f it single men who should be called upon. Those men, for the most part, would do us justice equally with those adventurous spirits who have already gone to the front; but they cannot ignore the fact that there are shirkers in our midst, and that they must be made to realize their responsibility. understand that large section saying that they will not come forward under such an unfair system, but will readily yield as soon as conscription introduced. Bourke mental the manhood of the community apply to the men of wealth as well as to the poorer classes. It might be claimed by men of wealth, although I am not prepared to sympathize with the view, that they are liable to the double burden of immediate service and conscription of wealth. It cannot be fairly urged that conscription of manhood must be deferred we are prepared to bring about conscription of wealth; also, I claim each branch has its undoubted obligations, and each must be enforced as the welfare of the nation demands. already been imposed, which is, in itself, a conscription looking around for object-lessons, and there very strongly. of the outbreak Civil War, the Southern States, sought to break away from the Union, had inaugurated a system of conscription.

Further, I am f u l l y persuaded that the is one that appeals to me members of the Government themselves Within twelve months realize the necessity, and in ordinary of the American circumstances their desire to wait u n t i l which the return of the Prime Minister would be reasonable. But the enemy w ill not wait until the Prime Minister returns, and if it is felt by the community that it is our duty to put for th a greater effort than hitherto-in view of the fact that Lincoln, the War Council has decided that Australia ought to be more adequately represented at the front-the Government In the ought to take immediate steps, and in troduce a conscription measure.

It indicates that this community is wanting in that wholehearted war that has characterized some of our Allies and, lately, the Mother Country. We are proud of what has already been done by Australia, but we cannot rest on our laurels. It is the duty of each of us to consider what more we can do, and there ought to be the maximum effort with the utmost expedition in order to secure the best results. not intend to detain the Committee for long. I wish, first, to congratulate the honourable member for Balaclava on the splendid oration he favoured the Committee with this afternoon. If he -came into contact with tbe section in Australia opposed to conscription, his method of speech and line of reasoning would go f u r ther to convince them that something in the direction of compulsion should be done than the utterances of any other speakers on the subject to whom I have listened. The masterly way in which he described our responsibilities, the fair manner in which he tried to approach the question, and the assurance he gave the Committee, which, I feel sure, was quite sincere, that he is prepared to p ut all into the scale if need be in the struggle which we are maintaining for our existence, in my opinion stand infinitely to the honourable member's credit. pliment the honourable member for Bourke on the attitude he adopted in the debate. In my opinion, honourable members on this side have not so far attempted to demonstrate what is the feeling on this question of those behind the movement that p u t them here. orable member agrees with me, because I feel that that has not been done, and the only man whose speech made any approach to it is the honourable member for Bourke. The cry for conscription and the pressure into military service of all the available manhood of Australia comes incessantly from a particular section of the community. I have no wish to deal with the question of our responsibilities in any party spirit, though it may be that my utterances will be taken in that manner. I want to say that in the war in which the Empire is engaged there is something repugnant to the spirit which has animated the labour movement from its very inception. The honourable member for Balaclava said he tried to take his determination to w in the opponent's view of the circumstances we have to consider, but it is impossible for any one to get the view of members of the Labour party until he puts human beings before wealth. We were never organized to destroy, but the elements responsible for the war were organized for that purpose. If they are not themselves destroyed as a result of the war, they w ill continue to destroy in the future. L e t there be no mistake about that. L e t the autocracy of Germany go through this war unscathed, or with the power that it has had heretofore, and in years to come we shall again be faced with the conditions against which we are struggling to-day. Let the autocracy of Great Britain have the same sway in the future that it has had heretofore, and the same state of muddle will then be found as exists to-day in Great Britain. We are accused of not standing up to the responsibilities of the war with the same zest as do other sections of the community. But what promise have we from those other sections that things will be any different after the war from what they were before war was declared ? What is the reason for the war? Who is responsible for it , and on whom should be laid the blame for ""it? Honourable members can never lay the blame for the war on the shoulders of the I wish, also, to comworking class of Great Britain.

Yet there is not one individual on tlie other side, or in Australia, to-day who would not hail K a r l Liebknecht, the German advocate of free speech, and the man who desires to bring the war to a termination if he possibly can. He is suffering imprisonment and persecution for telling the authorities what they are doing to the proletariat of Germanyi n this war. Every time the Socialists of Germany gain power, and vote in their National Parliament against war credits, we have cross-head lines in all the Liberal newspapers in Australia, and the Socialists of Germany are hailed for the time being as the saviours of the world. But so soon as we get back into the old r u t again, we can go on fighting to secure some kind of justice through Wages Boards and the like, in the same manner as we have at all times had to do. we have been conscripting men into the labour unions.

The first seventeen years of my life were spent in a factory where I received a wage which commenced at 18sand terminated at 39s. per week. wage than that. honourable member's ability was not so great as mine. As the honourable member for Indi reminds me, whoever engaged the honourable member evidently knew his value, and paid him accordingly. have heen told that in this war we are fighting for the liberties of Australia. I am quite prepared to admit that Australia is in great danger, and that the time may come when we shall have to engage in a greater fight than is being waged on the battlefields of Flanders. But when we are ""up against it,"" as the honourable member for Balaclava described it, will be the time when we should put everything into the melting pot, and when the sacrifices made should be of an equitable character. So far as conscription is concerned, I am absolutely opposed to it. I am not prepared to support it, notwithstanding that I believe in a thorough organization of this country for defence purposes. A t times I have had to submit to hostile demonstrations in connection with our Defence Act, but I am nevertheless prewere issued to business men, and one came to pared to stand by the principle of universal service for the defence of this country. I wish now to take exception to the items in the Budget relating to loans from the Imperial Government. We are to be asked to ratify a loan of £25,000,000 on behalf of the' States, and to authorize the flotation of another loan of £50,000,000 for war purposes. That is a total of £75,000,000 in addition to the amount which has been already raised. I wish to know from our high financiers where this money is to come from? In the last issue of the Worker there is an article contributed by a banker of Great Britain, who tells us how that country has financed the war, and it appears to me that the Commonwealth is about to follow in its footsteps. For a long time the Worker has advocated the conscription of wealth, and has belted the Government in respect of its borrowing policy. If. the Treasurer would only realize the spirit of the movement to which honourable members upon this side of the chamber are wedded he would cudgel his brains with a view to discovering a more equitable method of financing the war. The a r t i c le in t h e W o r k e r readsMany a time has the Worker drawn the attention of its readers to the huge profits made annually by the various banking institutions of Australia, and shown at the same time how all those profits might, by the judicious and more general use of the Commonwealth Bank, be made to return to the people fro m whose pockets they come. The jugglers of finance rob the workers mercilessly from sunrise to sunset. Nowhere, perhaps, is this amazing swindlu We more palpably exposed than in a recent article in Forward (Scotland), from thc pen of Frederick Temple, himself a banker. The facts he gives are damning, and must make the worker feel very foolish indeed. Listen to this bank manager:"" In August, when the war broke out, the Bank of England-whic h is the banker of all the other British banks, had only a reserve of £9,000,000 sterling, yet two months later we find the British Government applying to this bank for a loan of £350,000,000 (three hundred and fifty millions). Never in the history of Britain has there been such a sum of money in the country."" The Bank of England had not the money, yet the Government got the loan. How did the money-jugglers do it? Mr Temple tells the tale: "" The bank had not the money, so they made an issue to the public, knowing that the public had not got it either. A few subscriptions dribbled in, but not enough, so the bank was compelled to adopt a new expedient. Circulars me. I was asked to fill in form of application, enclosed, for a portion of the war loan; the bank would lend me the money (knowing it had not got it 1). "" H a d I applied for, say, £20,000 of war loan stock, I should have had to put up no money, no margin, no securities, nothing' but a penny stamp for the covering envelope. I would have been charged 3 per eent. for the accommodation; I should have received in return 4 per cent, from the Government, a profit of 1 per cent., or £200 for nothing. The taxpayer w ill pay this 4 per cent., this being the only real part in the transaction. "" Bookkeeping did the trick. On the debit side I owed the bank £20,000, on the other side I was credited wit h war stock to the same amount. Then the Treasury would draw cheques against the value of the war stock supplied (in above manner) to the bank. These cheques paid munition makers, contractors, and others, and in due course reach the clearing house."" This clearing house is an effective device for carrying on banking without money. In the total of the banking transaction of to-day money is employed to the extent of ahout 2 per cent. "" In 1913 cheques were cleared, i.e., exchanges effected, without the employment of any money, to the extent of no less than £16,436,000,000.""",45,Elliot Johnson Why Wealth Should Conscript One Tenth Of That

"" The only credit employed was the credit of the taxpayer. Soi t follows that the taxpayer pays tlio bookkeepers £14,000,000 in inlast general election the honourable memterest for the u»e of his own credit."" Mr Temple's article is one of the highest educational value at the present time. I do not say that the statements of Mr. Temple are correct, hut 1 am satisfied, from the fact that they have been printed by such a paper as the Worker, that there was sufficient verification as to his ability, and I commend the article to the Treasurer, and ask him how he will get his money in Australia. man who can borrow £20,000 from a bank should write such an article for a Labour paper. who are foolish enough to give the show away, but I ask the Treasurer whether he can controvert the scheme that is being played on tlie British public. member believe that it is done? the statement is true, b u t I hardly tliink that a man such as Mr Temple would write in this way if it were not true. able member for Richmond supply me with the information that the Treasurer does not feel inclined to give? Can he tell me where we are to raise this £50,000,000 in Australia? It is all a matter of interchange of credit, and the Treasurer knows that by the platform of the Labour party all honourable members on this side are pledged to nationalize the systems of banking and insurance. When the bank rates were raised in South Australia, an Adelaide banker who was interviewed by the Adelaide Register, stated that the banks were supplying the £13,000,000 required to finance the wheat pool, and the £45,000,000 required for the war, clearly proving that the whole of the Commonwealth is in the hands of the banks. knows.

During the ber for Flinders said that finance was government and government was finance. If that be so, the whole of the government of Australia is in the hands of the banks. I ask the Treasurer to devise some means by which the banks of Australia may become the property of the nation. L e t it be called confiscation, absorption, or conscription, I 'do not care; so long as the people own the banks, then we shall very speedily arrive at an equitable distribuI am surprised that a tion of the wealth of the community. 1 do not say tliat I am going to evolve a scheme whereby it can be done, b u t the Labour party are in power, and the Treasurer knows that he is instructed by the platform of that party to give the matter serious consideration. Instead of doing so we have set up a bank in competition with the other banks. Honourable members opposite fought its establishment for all they were worth. They know ite I do not say that potentialities' if it is given the opportunity to expand that it should be given, and, when we have in office men brave enough to institute means whereby the Can the honorbanks and insurance companies of the Commonwealth may become the property of the nation, so soon shall we break down the capitalistic system which is throttling the community. And then we can say to the working community, "" Y o u have something to fight for ; you have an in terest in Australia."" My friends opposite know this better than I do, but they dare not say that what I have p u t forward is impracticable. It may be that it cannot be brought into operation at the present time, b u t our friends opposite know that the present financial system is merely a matter of juggling with credits, as Mr. Temple has pointed out. We are using our own money, and the working man provides it by his taxes year in and year out, taxes with which he w ill be saddled How they do it heaven only for all time. MrW .

All the different sections of the movement I represent have met throughout tlie Commonwealth, and all are dissatisfied with what has been done. The Government have realized that something must be done, and have intimated their intention to extend the scope of the Old age Pensions and Wa r Pensions Acts, but that w ill not be sufficient for the people of this country, when they come to realize what a splendid thing they are going to get out of this war. the point emphasized by the Treasurer in his Budget speech in regard to the evasion of land taxation by land-holders, who, according to the honourable member for Calare, are paying their taxes. A r e they? dodge them. The Treasurer showed in his Budget speech how the big landholder gets away from the burden of taxation if he possibly can. He said"" The number of taxpayers does not reduce."" You cannot make them less. The big land-holder still squats on Australia whether the country is at war or peace, and he is going to squat on it even if the freedom of Australia be won by the efforts of our conscripts on the plains of Flanders. Even after the war is over people w ill still cry out w i th land hunger, and we shall still go on arguing that immigration is necessary. Notwithstanding all our efforts to break up land monopoly, and it stands to the everlasting credit of the Labour party that they i m posed the land tax in spite of the ridicule of honourable members opposite, the Treasurer was forced to make this admissionThc number of taxpayers docs not reduce-in tion scheme represents the assistance to be fact, there is, on the contrary, a tendency to given to the worker's wife whose husincrease.

In addition to sales of land by one person to another, arrangements have been made uuder * which parents have transferred parts of their estates to their children or other relatives. The workman has no chance of doing The honourable that.

He canHow are we meeting not transfer even the fowls in the back yard. But these patriots know how to get out of their just responsibilities to the Commonwealth. The sting of the Treasurer's indictment lies in these wordsIn some cases these transfers are nominal, and deliberately made to avoid taxation. Yet the honourable member for Calare is proud in the knowledge that the landholders w ill have to meet the expenses of the war by taxation! The Treasurer's That brings me to words show that the landholder w ill pay if he cannot dodge the tax by transferring it to the other fellow The Treasurer suggests that "" an amendment of the law should provide for complete and unencumbered transfer."" The time is rapidly They pay them if they cannot coming when we shall have to tax the land as the good old Single-taxers wanted us to tax it . We shall have to get back to first principles, as they call them, and, without any exemption, make the land bear the burden of those who live on it in proportion to what they hold. This brings me to the next move of the Government w i th regard to shouldering the responsibilities of the country. We are going to give the soldiers or their dependants a pension, but we all realize that it is a mere pittance. If a man forced to go to the war unfortunately never returns, his dependants are going to live in poverty and penury for the rest of their lives. The alternative is a scheme of repatriation, in connection with which tlie people are asked by the State Premiers and the Prime Minister to voluntarily bear, according to their generosity, the responsibility of the nation. That is the manner in which wealth is being put in the balance as against life. The repatriaband has been maimed or killed at the connection with this war may be, the na-",48,Elliot Johnson Why Wealth Should Conscript One Tenth Of That

311,Mr Yates,"could bear tbem if the Treasurer would only handle the financial situation in a bold manner. We talk about the conscription of wealth, b u t how is that to be brought about? L e t the Treasurer take charge of the banks, pay interest on the assets in excess of liabilities at a certain rate, b u t for the remainder of the war let the banking institutions belong to the Commonwealth. Dare the Government t r y that? Jn the movement to which I belong there is a strong feeling that the widow of a man killed at the war should be assured of as good a life as she would have had if her husband had lived. L e t the Government give an undertaking in writin g that that w ill be done, and the voluntary system will be a success. Give the men some assurance that their dependants will not be dependent on charity. This repatriation scheme is to be managed by six members of the War Committee and a number of other gentlemen, who, in turn, will appoint some of their number an executive. These men will not do the work for which they are appointed, because they are interested in other things. The honourable member for Angas and the honourable member for Flinders have been appointed to that body, b u t neither has the time to attend to its work. the throughout the Committee comprises only twelve members. They cannot do the work in that when a soldier's wife is l e f t dependent she will be required to go before some unsympathetic body and tell them her case. She may say, ""One child had the croup last week, another has the whooping cough,"" and she will be told to bring a doctor's certificate. An y assistance she may get will be doled out to her as charity. In Adelaide, women have been in the streets dressed in their best clothes, asking the people to buy a button because another ambulance is needed to save the soldiers' lives. A nice thing for the Commonwealth ! We have a coterie of women doing this work in the streets as they do slumming in peace times. I do not say they are all like that-indeed , what the women have done stands to their everlasting credit-bu t the nation's work is not being done as it should be done. If more ambulances are necessary to save the lives of our soldiers, let the Treasurer addness himself to that £1,000.000,000 which he says is the private wealth of Australia. Need we send women about the streets bedecked with colours to beg for money with which to buy ambulances ? MrW . ELLIOTJOHNSON It is unmanly for you to asperse the women in that way. perse them. My remarks may not be true of all the women, but the system is repugnant to me whenever I come in contact with it . MrW . ELLIOT JOHNSON I have nothing but admiration for them. miration for the Government if they said that more ambulances were required, and then asked Parliament to vote the money. MrW . ELLIOT JOHNSON -The ladies are doing what the Government have neglected to do. vernment should have prevented.

If the honourable member thinks I have done the lady folk generally an injustice, I apologize to them. It is the principle I am attacking. I am objecting to the policy of allowing ladies to be everlastingly going, cap in hand, to the people, and asking them to subscribe spasmodically. That state -of affairs reveals an absence of proper management in the government of the community. Another paragraph in the Treasurer's Bpeech reads, "" The Federal and State Governments have recognised the nation's debt."" If it is the nation's debt, why does not the nation pay it ? W h y ask people to voluntarily subscribe to a repatriation scheme? The Government propose to introduce a B ill for the inauguration of this fund.

To-day we see due in a great measure to the manner in Australia's Prime Minister abroad; and which the finances of the country have he, who was in this country the arch adbeen handled during the war. I have no intention of traversing the contentions of the honourable member for Adelaide, because I candidly admit that I could not follow them. If his speech was intended to represent the spirit of a nation engaged in the conduct of a war, and if it were read in the trenches by our Australian boys, I guarantee that the unionists amongst them would say, "" God save us from our friends in Australia."" The honourable member has advanced no argument that will help to l if t the nation out of its difficulties or assist us in winning the war. The debates which have taken place on the Budget statement have convinced the House and the country that there is one great outstanding issue which obscures every other. The mind of Australia is focussed on the one great issue how to victoriously terminate the war and bring our men safely back. I look on the world as a huge contending system-natio n against nation, individual against individual, race against race, and, too often, creed against creed; and my friends opposite have shown .us to-night that our own house is divided. Under such conditions, in face of the greatest upheaval the world has ever seen, our only duty is to make up our minds how we can best save the nation. It has never been possible to win a war except by fighting; and we must be prepared to take out a sufficiently large policy to insure the lives and homes of the people, and the safety of all that our forefathers have won for us on the battlefield. Very tardily did my mind move from the old traditions of the racethe voluntary spirit-unde r which we have "" w o n o u t "" in the past; but today, as the result of nine to twelve Changesi n thought have taken vocate of the open door policy and the freedom of the world idea, is to-day the apostle of another doctrine. And why ? Because he recognises .that we far too long have been unreasonably magnanimous, even to finding a seat at our table for our vilest enemies. We have asked or allowed them to send their surplus goods and population into the Mother Country, and, as if that were not enough, to send them to Australia, where free institutions are enjoyed by all-allowe d them to tap the very bowels of the earth in search of means to bring about the extinction of the Empire. Times like these are bound io bring about a change of thought: and there has been a most commendable change in the Leader of the present Government. He stands recognised in the councils of the Empire as one of the foremost statesmen of the world ; and yet many of his followers here in the political organization behind hi m are most antagonistic towards the principles he advocates. It is to be hoped that he w ill be able to infuse sufficient statesmanship into them when he returns, that the scales may be removed from their eyes. I do not propose to advance all the arguments and reasons that have induced me to adopt the principle of conscription as the best war measure. I cannot even follow the minds of those who do not believe in conscription but, at the same time, do believe in national service in war time only. I have no intention of traversing all the arguments advanced, and commendably so, by the honourable member for Gippsland. I have not a bouquet large enough to throw at that honourable member; but I recognised his as the speech of a practical man, who sees the danger of the country, and is quite prepared to brush",50,Elliot Johnson Why Wealth Should Conscript One Tenth Of That
316,Mr Rodgers (Wannon) [9.14],"aside all tliose shibboleths which others, iu a closely adjacent House, are adopting. than that to catch the honourable member for Gippsland. ber for Brisbane forgets that he himself, when the honourable member for Gippsland rose, and the honourable member for Perth, on a point of order, objected that he was speaking out of t u r n, claimed that the honourable member for Gippsland belonged to both sides. There is one Australian reason, if I may so put it , that makes me have no hesitation in saying that conscription is the right policy for this country. As the honourable member for Gippsland pointed out, we have established a system of compulsory training, introduced, not by the present Government, but, at any rate, by a Government which represented the Labour party. The natural corollary to compulsory training is compulsory service. Are we for years to train men for service, and when they are efficient tell them that they may go as tbey please ? Such a policy is not only not sensible, but wasteful. There are some honourable members who have not done themselves or their country credit in dealing with the question of the war. I refer in particular to the honourable member for Batman, at whom, personally, I am not at all anxious to have a t i l t . That honourable member decried the voluntary system, and the methods adopted under it . He showed a keen hatred of, and opposition to, conscription, but he left us absolutely at a dead-end as to his own idea of what ought to be done. The only obvious conclusion is that he would hoist the white flag; but I think that we in this country have not yet reached the stage at whicli we are prepared to do a scuttle. Then tliere is the other aspect of conscription raised by the honourable member for Bourke to-night, namely, the conscription of wealth. I recognise that whatever and however wealth is thrown into the scales -whethe r by means of taxation or voluntarily by loans-ther e can be no comnarison between a sacrifice of wealth and a sacrifice of life or limb. I am not one to assist a man of wealth to escape his proper responsibilities. Whatever the nation has, and whatever is required, if the Government are to be responsible for the success of the war, must be placed at their disposal. As to the means to be adopted to this end. I cannot go as far as does the honourable member for Bourke. [289] unable to advocate the policy of the conscription of wealth, for I have never yet It will take more heard it outlined. So far, however, the honourable member for Bourke has brought us closer to the point than any one else; and I take it that he would "" collar,"" as he said, the wealth. orable member did not say "" collar,"" but ""grab."" the honourable member said he would compulsorily take the wealth of the country and "" f l o a t it out,"" for the purposes of the war. Of course, we cannot discriminate between forms of wealth; and if we Conscribe wealth we must conscribe every form of it . But as soon as we do that we are faced with the problem referred to by the Treasurer when he introduced his Budget. The Treasurer, with the Cabinet and their financial advisers, recognises the fact that for the immediate requirements of acountry there is only available the year's earnings, plus such proportion of the nation's surplus working capital as is not actively engaged in the carrying on of industry. Thatf o r the time being is the only available money that can be employed for waging the war and for carrying on the services of the country. The Government of the day imposed, first of all, an income tax. Then, recognising that there was a certain amount of ready cash available, they appealed to those who had it to put it into a war loan, and fixed the rate of interest at 4-J per cent. I would not have gone as f a r as the Government did in granting those who had £35,000,000 available in ready cash that rate of interest free from taxation. Let me put this view of the matter to.the Treasurer. Just prior to the making of these financial arrangements, the nation suffered an internal loss of at least £100.000,000, not of its income, but of its actual capital, as the result of a period of drought. During all that time there stood on a vantage ground the people who had liquid cash, and who, during the period of the drought, were earning income. When the necessity arose to find money for carrying on the war, the Treasurer said to these fortunate persons who were in possession of liquid cash, that if they loaned it to the Government they would get a good rate of interest, and in addition, immunity from taxation on the I am income they derived from the lending of",51,Elliot Johnson Why Wealth Should Conscript One Tenth Of That

320,Mr Rodgers,"Let us take it thatthat money. On the other hand, those who, during the period of drought, had to suffer the exhaustion of their capital, and were without any income at a l l, were called upon to pay increased taxation because of the war, and also a tax in addition to meet the interest on the £35,000,000 borrowed from the men who had put that money into the war loans. I did not approve of that policy; I do not thinlc that a majority of the members of the Committee approve of it , and I do not think that the country needed the adoption of such a policy in order to find money with which to wage the war. Let us look at the question of the conscription of wealth f a i r l y . Let us make a reasonable attempt to apply the principle of conscription to wealth. If it can be f a i r l y and equitably applied, I am one prepared to assist the Government in applying it . I am, however, unable to see how it is to be applied. I followed as carefully as I could the speech made by the honourable member for Bourke. All he said was, ""Takei t and float it off."" One is not likely to be seduced into approval of a proposition of that kind. It is probable, however, that the honourable member did not mean that we should take the whole of the capital of the country, which has recently been assessed at £1,000,000,000, but that it would be possible to charge a proportion of the wealth of the country w i th the cost of the conduct of the war. member not referring to incomes rather it is not too much to say that 50 per cent, than to wealth? interjection, because, when the honourable The imposition of the land tax brings member for Bourke was speaking, I asked down t.he value of the big man's laud, him whether he did not think 25 per cent, and at the same time down goes the value of income was a f a i r conscription of of the land held by the smaller men on wealth, and his answer was, "" I am not the otlier side of the road. touching income; I want the wealth of the country.""

I was very sorry to notice in to-day's press a reference by the Acting Prime Minister to the returned soldiers' repatriation scheme which we have launched in the electorates of Wannon and Corangamite.

The control of the fund was in the hands of a board of trustees, and it was proposed to utilize the State War Councils and I do not care their affiliated organizations, such as recruiting committees, both as to collections and disbursements. The work was not done through a Government Department. If ' the nation's income is not Just as the nation has voluntarily raised its Army, the Government are determined to raise the money necessary to repatriate those men and their dependants by a voluntary appeal to the people. I shall I am here to say that I am prebe grievously disappointed if that appeal is made in vain, but I feel that the very spirit of this nation is fighting the war, just as the Prench nation to-day is at the Let me now deal with zenith of its power, because the whole spirit of that nation is fighting. The Government have set aside only £250,000 towards the repatriation of Australian soldiers who have taken up arms and I deal now with tliose who are gone 10,000 miles across the world to win the freedom of their country. The very first day on as the final sum, do you ? regarded as a start, the Treasurer could have announced the fact. Personally, I would vote up to £2,000,000 in this House for the repatriation of our soldiers. I have paid some attention to this question, and have looked into its various aspects. Our objective is 300,000 men in khaki. A t least 150,000 of those wil l require to have something done for them when they return. It should be done now. The scheme, if it is going to be a voluntary one and successful, must be The Governput in hand at once and worked vigorously. The Government, I say, have been asleep on this question of repatriation. A drab, cold appeal was made through the daily papers, backed up at the time by very little effort. That is not the way to do it . If the repatriation scheme is going to have practical results for the soldiers, there must be a strong co-operation and an effective organization. We have attempted to do something in the two electorates I have referred to. There we have 2,000 men working in connection with the scheme, giving their services free.

On the 11th February, 1916, I interviewed Senator Pearce, and, having obtained his approval and permission to launch the scheme, I wrote him as follows the next day: I now hand you a copy of my proposed scheme for the repatriation of returned soldiers, which I have launched within the electorates of Wannon and Corangamite, for both of which, in Mr Manifold's absence, I am at present acting.

Can any honourable member point to a parallel case in the world's history, in which a young nation like Australia, witli a small and scattered population, has responded as nobly, and done as much, as we are doing in the prosecution of this war ? To-day we hear a good deal of talk about conscription. Now, the ideals of Democracy are very dear to me. I believe that Democracy and civilization are worth fighting for. I have no desire to make party capital out of this question. But will honourable members opposite say that, even if conscription of our manhood were adopted to-morrow-in the face of what they were told at the secret session the other evening-w e could put one more man at the fron t than we are doing today? ber answer the question himself. so. Wheni t is urged that Australia should be sending more men to the war, I maintain that the Government should make known some of the facts that were disclosed to honourable members under the bond of secrecy the other night. A f t e r the statements which have been made by honourable members opposite, the Government ought at least to put the facts of the case before the country. If it be necessary to call up the whole of our manhood of eligible military aee, the position, indeed, must be a desperate one for the Empire. And , if the position be so desperate, surely we are not going to. stop at the conscription of our manhood. There are two things essential to win any warmen and money.

Why is he afraid to put the whole of the resources of the country into the fight? I w ill certainly not agree to the conscription of our workers while we continue to pay the capitalist 4£ per cent, interest for the money which he subscribes to our war loans. A f t e r ail, this talk of conscription seems to me to be something in the nature of a reflection upon Australia, especially when we consider that this country, with its small population, is doing better than Canada, with double its population.

There has been some talk about patriots. The other day I asked the Treasurer a question about the amount of money subscribed to the war loan by the Australian Mutual Provident Society. I asked him what amount the company had subscribed directly to the Treasury, and what amount had been subscribed through the intervention of brokers; and the answer was that the amount subscribed directly to the Treasury was £700,000, while the amount suplied through the intervention of brokers was £550,000.

To me the greatest thing in the world is seeing that the conditions of the units in the community are made good, for that policy means the building up of a good nation. Bad conditions for the units means a bad nation-on e that must decay and fade away. How can we hope to have a nation that w ill stand the test of war if its units are reared in poverty and in slum conditions ? What physical strength is possessed by a man who has lived under bad sweating conditions, and has been housed in a slum ?

A good deal of praise has been given to them for their glorious deeds, and they deserve every word that has been said of them; but if it is true that civilization is in the melting pot, that we are fighting for our standard of living, and for our place in the sun as a nation, the very best we can do for those boys when they come back will not be too good for them. If we allow them to come back to the old conditions, which sapped the vitalit y of men, women, and children, then the blood spilled on the hills of Gallipoli will have been spilled in vain. If we are going to achieve a victory, let it be a victory, not only in Gallipoli and Flanders, but also in Australia.

Let us see that every man in our community is given the opportunty to earn a fair and honest living for himself. Let us see that when the boys come back we have no more of the old conditions, under which men and women had to live in slum areas and eke out an existence under sweating conditions. conditions such that when these boys grow into the men of the future they will be able to look back and say with pride that, while they did their b it in Gallipoli or Flanders, those who had to stay behind also achieved a victory by making Australian conditions such as to promote liealth and strength and build up a nation fittest to survive.

The honourable member for Dalley, in making a comparison with Canada, was, however, hardly as f r a n k as he might have been, because up to the present the recruits have answered the call in that country in such numbers that it has not been found necessary to have a single recruiting meeeting there.

To unload wealth in overwhelming volume on the community would be merely to depreciate its value, and so defeat the object in view. I do not discuss this matter in any controversial spirit, and I say at once that I am prepared to grant to the Government all the powers they require for the successful prosecution of the war. If they come to the conclusion that they must conscript wealth I shall not oppose it if it is shown that we should be "" a l l in , "" and their proposals are reasonable. do point out, however, that the first and main factor to win the war is not money, hut men. If we are to f u l f i l our obligations to the Imperial authorities we shall be obliged by some means to enlist some 20,000 men per month in Australia in order by reinforcements to keep up the number we are pledged by our contract with the Imperial authorities to send forward. I have been met with many arguments against enlistment, which have not been touched upon here, from young fellows whom I have asked to say why they did not respond to the call of the colours. There are quite a number of single men who have serious obligations and responsibilities which preclude them from coming forward voluntarily to undertake what in their hearts they would be only too pleased to undertake, that is, their share in the defence of their eountry. Some single men have greater responsibilities than have some married men, and there should be reasonable consideration for their special circumstances. J have been met by young men in whom .the patriotic sentiment is not as f u l l y desettle down."" veloped as in men of riper years, with the argument that -they are out for material advantage, and that the inducements in that direction lead them to reo the war. I am not going to admit that the voluntary system has entirely broken down until it has been given a fair opportunity to prove its value. It has never had a fair and square deal in Australia. I am referring to Australia because it is our home and the country which I hope we are prepared, not merely to praise, but to shed our blood for. able member explain in what respect the voluntary system has not been given a fair chance? Mr Patten. advantage in Australia at the present time is secured by those who remain here. Opportunities are afforded in the Commonwealth for young men to earn from 9s. to 12s. per day, whilst the young man willing to' go to the front, is offered 6s. per day. We must take that into consideration before we condemn the results of the voluntary system. Honourable members may ask what we are to do in the matter. I reply that the only thing we can do is to standardize the wage. I do not mind on what basis it is standardized. I That is a matter for financiers; but I do say that we should standardize the wage, and so afford an opportunity for the voluntary system to be tested on its merits. If there is to be any preference in the matter of material advantage in cold cash, it should certainly be given the men who are going to the f r o n t and dying for us rather than to those who are staying here and loafing. the honourable member do for the man who has sacrificed £ 1 0 per week to go to the war? ' spiring knowledge that they are patriots of a very high order. I am speaking of the ordinary young man who has turned to me and asked why he should undergo all these difficulties for a paltry 6s. per day, when he might stay here in peace and comfort and earn 12s. per day. He says, ' ' My troubles about sentiment. I am here to do the best I can for myself.

I do not know what would bring it home to them unless it be an enemy shell dropped into the middle of the city in which they live.

The sooner we realize that that is the position the better. There is only one termination of this war that is possible for us, and that is that we should win. A f t e r giving tlie matter some consideration, I say that the more men we can get to the front, the more speedily will the war be brought to an end. I have mentioned my experiences.

I desire now to express my appreciation of the courtesy of tlie Minister of External Affairsi n giving me an open letter of introduction to the authorities in New Zealand. That letter, which was quite unsolicited from the Minister, made my way very easy indeed, and I obtained very material assistance from Mr Massey, the Prime Minister of New Zealand. It enabled me to get information that was very valuable, completely confirming me in my altered opinion that, sooner or later, we shall have to follow the lead of the British Government by bringing in some measure whereby recruiting w ill be placed on a more stimulating basis than at present. We shall have to see to it that those who remain here without any reasonable cause have some spur put into them to make them realize that all must shoulder some responsibility in this war. Whatever the conditions may be with regard to returned soldiers, the. initiative will have to come from the Government, and, probably, this Government will have to take a hand in the matter. We know perfectly well that when the war is over a large number of Imperial soldiers will not [290]2 be satisfied with the old conditions, so that the over-seas Dominions will enter into competition wibh one another to secure the cream of those men. Australia has the reputation of being the working man's paradise, and I hope, therefore, that some proposal will emanate from this These are the men who Government which will act as an inducement for the cream of those soldiers to come to Australia, for we must not be satisfied with the "" skimmed m i l k .

Every such soldier will get a f a r m in fee simple, and in addition to that the Union Government propose to keep him for five years, u n t i l he gets on his feet. That is a statesman-like and liberal offer, and if we want to come inbo competition I have a with that part of the Empire, we shall have to make a better offer, or, ab least, I want to see w i th one equal toi t , or be satisfied with the "" skimmed m i l k "" of the returned soldiers. admitted that SouthA f r i ca is in a better position to make such an. offer, because the conquered territory is in the same Continent. nevertheless, General Botha has set a very high example to all the other over-seas Dominions. The country offering the best inducement w ill , undoubtedly,, get the best class of returned soldier, and the sooner we realize that the sooner shall we be prepared to offer some greater inducement. Above all, I do hope that the conditions after the war w ill be such that we shall be able to uphold the name that our boys have made for us at ANZAC and the Gallipoli Peninsula, and the name which I feel sure they w ill earn for us on tlie western f r o n t in the European arena. ThoughI am loath to say so, I fear that in the fighting which will probably soon take place there, our casualty list will be a heavy cne.
