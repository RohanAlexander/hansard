All the matters which have contributed Queensland, including the mining, sugar, beef and to it--the drought, unemployment, international dairying industries. They are all facing serious incompetition and the international economic ternational competition in a market in which they situation-have worsened since the Budget. I cannot adjust their prices. would like to pick up a few comments from the Opposition. By its own admission its Budget stratment's Budget involved a deficit of some $4 dustry. It must be realised that we can put our billion. Other estimates have put its deficit at $5 economy on a proper footing only by being combillion or $6 billion based on the situation at that petitive in an international market in which we time. I ask the Opposition what its strategy would must trade to survive. No government has done be. The answer can be seen from the response to more in regard to international competition than the Budget by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr this one. At the recent General Agreement on Hayden) when he implied that the Labor Party Tariff and Trade conference the Commonwealth would spend its way out of the problem; in other of Australia pressed the point that we cannot words, it would print more money and have no trade in the open market if heavily subsidised concern for the inflationary impact of that. European Economic Community products are to compete with us. This affects our main exports, Another thing that worries me is that the Oppoparticularly our grain and sugar and many of our sition now says that it is not all that frightened by other primary products. An inability to trade a large Budget deficit. This is where I feel it is very against fair competition will have of course an important to draw a distinction between Labor effect on the blowing out of the Budget figures. politics and our politics. It is very important that the deficit should be strictly controlled because if Another aspect of the change in Budget philosit expands beyond reasonable limits all we are ophy is the unemployment situation. I have said doing is spending in our generation what future for many years that there is only one problem generations will have to pay back. That is a very with Australians: We are living at a standard that critical point. I would hate to see any members the country cannot afford. At long last, with the opposite involved in company management and impact and the influence of the drought, this is trying to run a business at a profit because they being realised and appreciated.

Another revealing factor in the have retired from the chamber without staying to quarter's figures was that gross non-farm product listen to the real facts and figures. increased by 0.1 per cent. That is really no growth at all.
