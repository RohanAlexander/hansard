Beginning Of This Ses","sion, that an opportunity would be afforded, before its close, to consider the question of the Federal Capital site, does not seem possible of fulfilment before the Christmas adjournment, might I ask .the Prime Ministeri f , in arranging the course of business to be clone on the re-assembling of the House after that adjournment, the question will be given an early place in the list of matters which we will be asked to consider? would be premature to attempt to indicate the precise date when we shall be able to deal with this question. But the first opportunity affording any guarantee that Parliament is able to come to a decision upon the question will be seized. certainly be no avoidable delay-. The honourable member will realise, as we do, that the whole of the difficulty in the settlement of the question arises from the fact that all except the supporters of the particular site most in favour, unite to prevent progress, in order that other sites which they prefer may have a chance of consideration. If we can overcome that obstacle, the Government may be relied upon to afford every facility for an early settlement of the question. Minister, whose Department is concerned in the matter in reference to the report of Mr De Burgh, on the water, supply of Canberra, which has been circulated, and which refers to certain maps, whether the maps will be made available to honourable members ? the Home Affairs Department, which, I assume, will be in possession of maps that can be placed on the Library table.

I wish to ask what really is the position which Captain Collins occupies in London. Defence stores, or a political agent generally ? Does the Prime Minister think it right that Australian public servants in London should take it upon themselves to represent his views on Australian policy at political gatherings? tain Collins occupies is that of an officer charged with certain definite duties in regard to purchases for the Defence Department, the conduct of other ordinary business, and also special duties which he is, from time to time, authorized to underA t the present time it take. I have, noticed the semi-political remarks made by Captain Collins on one or two public occasions, but they have been such as I think no exception could be taken to, because in each case he has simply repeated, generally in the same There will words, statements which have been made on behalf of the Government, and chiefly by myself, either here or in England. I have not noticed that he has ever done more than repeat statements of that kind, or has made any statements of his own opinions. Captain Collins the mouth-piece of the honourable gentleman's political views? Prime Minister does not disapprove of a permanent public servant, in the person I wish to ask the of Captain Collins, expressing political opinions at public meetings, on the ground that that gentleman has previously made statements which are an echo or repetition of the views of the Government or of ihe Prime Minister himself. Does the Prime Minister not see that such a course of action will mean that in the event of an I will inquire from undesired change of Ministry Captain Collins' usefulness will at once be terminated ? lins could do the same for another Minis-",14,Setup

21,Sir John Forrest,"Before askingthe Northern Territory transfer Bill, which contains a provision authorizing the survey and construction of the railway through South Australia, from Port Augusta to Kalgoorlie, there is no necessity for its assent to the survey to which I have referred. I point out to the Prime Minister, however, that if that view were taken much undesirable delay would result, as some months may elapse before the Northern Territory Transfer Bill comes before the Federal Parliament. I think it only requires the question to be brought prominently under the notice of the South Australian Parliament, that the assent of the Parliament of that State is necessary before the Commonwealth Government can spend any funds on the survey, to insure immediate attention to the matter. It is most probable that the South Australian Government will attend to the matter with-, out any special request; but still I should be glad if the Prime Minister will make a representation on the subject, as the matter is urgent. in doing so.

There can be no objection to inquiring into the statements made. responsibility of this Government for the introduction of those men is, as the honourable member is aware, indirect We gave permission that, provided suitable labour could not be obtained from the Mother Country, it might be obtained from Europe. Certain Spaniards some weeks ago occasioned trouble in the neighbourhood of Geraldton. I had inquiry made into that circumstance, and found that apparently not one of those who could be tested had been found to be familiar with country employment.

These serious accusations against the charI believe that appliacter of the exploring party are virtually contradicted in another part of the same paper, although it is apparently assumed in the leading article that Blake's statement is absolutely true. In another column that statement is challenged by the members of the exploring party, as appears from the followingIn the Assembly, Mr Troy called attention tb statements made by Mr E. J. Blake, cook of the Canning stock route exploring party, with regard to the treatment of natives, as published in the press. The Premier replied that Mr Canning's attention had been called to Mr Blake's statements, which were absolutely at variance with Mr Canning's own statements. Full particulars would be given to Parliament when Mr Canning had had an opportunity to reply. Mr Canning this evening gave the press a detailed denial of the allegation of ill-treatment. Can the Prime Minister see his way to send a cablegram to the representative of the Commonwealth in London for publication, to the effect that Blake's statement has been challenged and denied absolutely by the members of the exploring party ? gested would be judicious, and shall certainly take it , although it may be desirable to wait until we see the denial in f u l l .

In this manner the . press of the greater part of the English-speaking world will have its attention directed to the Commonwealth in the most effective way. POST OFFICE. the honourable member for Cook asked me 1. Why are not telegraphists appointed, considering the alleged inadequate and overworked staff of the G.P.O., Sydney, and the numerous complaints by the public appearing in the columns of the daily press in New South Wales? asked the Postmaster-General, vision who qualified for positions of telegraphists over eighteen months ago are still kept at noticetheir present grade and salaries, notwithstanding the fact that they are, and have been, performing telegraphists' work. If so, why are these officers not appointed, and their rightfu l increases allowed them ? I have now been furnished with the following replies1. Positions for telegraphists have been provided to the f u l l extent of the provision made on the Estimates for 1907-8. 2. Thirty-five officers passed the examination referred to, and of this number eighteen have been promoted as telegraphists or to the Professional Division. The remaining successful candidates will receive promotion as vacancies occur for telegraphists. the honourable member for Calare asked the followingquestions1.

Have representations been made by representatives of the staff as to the disabilities thus entailed, and what steps, if any, is it proposed to take to redress these overtime grievances? The Acting Deputy Postmaster-General, wood) agreed to. Sydney, has now supplied me with the following information1. Telegraphists employed in the G.P.O., Sydney, on the afternoon staffare frequently called upon to perform extra hours at night when business is much congested in consequence of interruptions or bad working of the circuits. through adverse weather conditions during the day. No case has, however, ever been brought under the notice of the Manager where any of the Telegraphists' total hours of duty during any one fortnight have been in excess of eightyfour hours, which would entitle him to a claim for overtime. As, with the exception of a few stations which are open till 10 p.m., offices throughout the country are closed by 8 p.m., when conditions are normal, the majority of the afternoon staff Telegraphists, who commence duty at 3 p.m., are released at 8.15 p.m., or very shortly afterwards. They are required to take it in turn to clear all business for the 10 o'clock stations. 2. It is not a fact that a large proportion of tinction is made between the duty proposed! the extra work performed by the staff originates after they have been on duty six hours. Telegraphists while on duty are called upon to assist in any emergency which may arise after their regular hours. 3. It is not. a fact that officers commencing duty at 10.30 a.m. are frequently detained until 8 p.m. During the month ended igth November they were kept on on eight different dates after 6 p.m., and of these on five dates till 8 p.m, or later, the latest hour being 8.30 p.m., on the 12th of that month. 4.

He had already given instructions to the Assistant Manager that arrangements must be made to prevent the intermediate staff being kept on so late.

It is a unique circumstance that the two sections of the Tariff Commission have recommended the imposition of a duty of 20 per cent, on these articles. not see why this amendment should be made. Yesterday we had a long discussion about the qualities of Australian woods. Surely there is in Australia wood suitable for the making of tool handles, and certainly there are persons who can do the work. This item deals with the tools of trade of workers in the country districts. covers, for instance, fork handles. free. Take for instance axe handles. We have an axe, because we have not suitable wood. not suitable timber for making them. being made at Cairns. of a sort can be made at.

We have no wood similar to that wood. This item covers innumerable handles of tools of trade. The old (Parramatta) duty of 15 per cent, was quite high enough, and the honourable member for Herbert has informed us that with that protection handles are made here. No doubt they are making some handles and making them. I cannot do that. profitably too with that protection. Therefore his argument is really in favour of restoring the old duty. I m o v e satisfied if we can reduce the duty to 15 per cent. the duty to less than that which the free trade section of the Tariff Commission has recommended ? honourable member does not believe that the free-trade section of the Tariff Commission was right in making a particular recommendation. I ask him to be consistent on this occasion, and say that it was wrong in recommending a duty of 20 per cent. He must know that throughout his electorate a large number of tool handles are used. Surely he is aware that the greater number of tool handles used in mining and agriculture are imported handles. I ""shall support the amendment, because I think that a duty of 15 per cent, is a perfectly fair one to impose. It hope that the Committee .will not reduce the duty. If we can compete with the world in making anything, it is in making the handle for any tool of trade; just as well as any other handle.",21,Tariff

The announcement is as followsThe"" A "" certificate makes the manufacturer or supplier of goods in Great Britain certify that all the goods set out in a given invoice are "" bond fide the produce or manufacture of the United Kingdom, and that a substantial portion of the .labour of that country has entered into the production of every manufactured article included in the said invoice to the extent in each article of not less than one-fourth of the value of every such article in its present condition ready for export to the Commonwealth quired is to see that goods are the legitiof Australia."" If I were debating the matter, I should point to the enormous difficulty which must be created by such a regulation. We here decided that certain articles from Great Britain should receive preference, whatever proportion of labour might be involved; but the Department or the Minister now requires that the labour must be equal to 25 per cent. Our decision had no reference to the labour employed, but merely required that the article should be produced or manufactured in Great Britain. goods sent from Great Britain to Australia are manufactured in other countries. point out that although sugar does not grow in the United Kingdom, a preference is given in the case of British confectionery. Is that preference to be withheld in every instance in which 25 per cent, of British labour has not been employed? If this regulation be enforced, there will be not only enormous difficulty caused to the exporter and to the Department, but also an absolute departure from the decision at which we arrived, knowing that in the case of many articles 25 per cent, of British or any labour was not employed. In fact, the labour in some articles might not be 5 per cent, of their value.

So that there are difficulties even in getting the timbers from America, and that in itself would be sufficient to induce the manufacturers to use colonial timbers wherever it was possible to do so. If honourable members will refer to the Tariff of Canada, they will see that an exception is made in favour of hickory and the other timbers which are required for the manufacture of coaches and buggies, and which, are being imported to Australia. The same thing obtains in New Zealand; in fact, in every protectionist country in which those special timbers are not grown. In such countries these timbers are regarded as the raw materials of the coachbuilders and wheelwrights, and because they cannot be locally produced they are placed on the free list. We are asked by the Coachbuilders' and Wheelwrights' Association to follow the examples of those countries. specific duties generally be eliminated, and replaced with ad valorem duties. They hold that a specific duty falls as heavily on the lighter and less expensive vehicle as on the heavier and more expensive vehicle. . The less expensive vehicles are used by the poorer classes, and if these duties are retained the burden of this taxation will f a l l upon them in a measure out of proportion to their more wealthy countrymen. As regards their raw material, this association have expressed their readiness to accept the old duties. They recommend that the more complete the manufactured article is the higher ad valorem duty it should bear, until the completed article is reached, when, of course, they are prepared to accept any duty which the Committee may impose, so f a r as lis maximum is 'concerned. Tbe;y ask that in the interests of their industry their representations may receive the favorable consideration of the Committee. Whether they -be free-traders or protectionists, they are unanimously of the opinion that this schedule, if it is passed, will do a very grave injury to their industry; ancl that a humter of tbe articles which are heavily taxed in the interest of Australian timbers must be imported because they cannot be produced here. I am prepared to support the amendment of the honourable member for Dalley, because under the old Tariff this industry was able to so completely capture the consumption in the Commonwealth that less than £ 1 0 , 0 0 0 covered the amendment. importations. Mr Thomas Brown. There, is evidently some mistake with regard to this item, because the Treasurer has just stated that the duty is equal to only 10 per cent. He must have taken the price to refer to a dozen instead of a gross. that had been reported to me. orable gentleman will acknowledge that there is something wrong about the item. I find that the duty is equal to over 100 per cent. From the most reliable people in Melbourne, Messrs. Ewing and Company, I have just learned by telephone that they can easily. land hickory shafts at 3s. per pair, and hickory poles at 5s. each. I ask the Minister to reconsider the item, or to procure further information. Sir WILLIAM LYNE I am waiting for They ask that the some information which I expect to receive in a few minutes. all the items from 313 to 320 are affected. If the Minister's information. is wrong in one case, it is wrong in all the others. I would suggest that the words, ""including poles, swingle-bars and shaft bars made of hickory in the rough-free, "" be added to the item. If the Minister will not consent to that, it appears to me that we shall have to take the whole of these items separately. Sir WILLIAM LYNE (Hume-Trea' surer) [4.36] -There seems to have been a mistake in this instance. The calculation has been made per' dozen instead ofper gross.

Casks, barrels, and vats, n.e.i. (intended to contain liquids), empty or containing goods not subject to ad val. duty, ad val. (General Tariff), 35 per cent.; (United Kingdom), 30 per cent.,"" be added. The reasons for this amendment are that experience of the new item has shown that in practically every instance in which casks containing dry goods or goods other than fluids are imported, the casks are to all intents and purposes of no value when emptied of their imported contents. Such casks as those containing pickled cabbage, olives, sheep dip, &c, have been brought under the notice of the Department as being casks which are valueless after being emptied of their imported contents. Hitherto, the practice of the Department has been to deal with each case on its merits, and allow the casks to be"" entered as of no value for duty in those cases in which they were of no value as casks when emptied. Whilst a strict reading of the present wording of this item would require that the value of the casks containing goods subject to ad valorem duty should be included in the value of those goods for' duty, and, in addition, that the special duty placed on casks under this item should be charged, the practice of the Department is to charge only the. special duty under this item, ancl to exclude the value of the casks from the value of their ad valorem contents for duty. The proposed amend'ment: will give legislative effect to this Department and tG the public without injuring the local coopering trade. The substance of the explanation which I have given is that when casks are imported containing such goods as printers' ink or olives they are of no further use. Therefore, it is not considered fair to charge duty on them. But when wine casks or whisky casks, which can be used again, are brought in, duty is charged on them. It is most unfair to charge, duty on casks which simply have to be broken up for firewood. ney) [4-50] -The Minister under this item is proposing to charge a special duty on packages which ' are necessary to the safe conveyance of goods to their place of destination, although.we have already decided that when iron tanks are used for this purnearer their cost than are any other pack(Hume-Trea ages--the y shall be admitted 'duty free. category from tanks.' think so. The casks in which goods are brought here cannot be made in the country, and if a duty of 35 per cent, is charged on them, it will in many cases greatly increase the gross duty on their contents, which may be dutiable nominally at much lower rates. Sometimes, casks have to be used for the importation of comparatively cheap goods, or of goods upon which the duty is very small. Although the proposal has been put forward with a view to assisting the coopering industry, it may really have the effect of taking some work from the coopers. Most of the tallow casks and many other casks used in Australia are made from local timbers, but there are casks for which only imported timbers can be used, and if they are not remade from imported casks the timber for them will have to be imported in staves, or in the rough, ready to be cut up into staves. By keeping out the casks we shall take from the coopers a good deal of the business in re-making which now goes on. No one would import casks if he could get here casks made of suitable material; but for some purposes special timber is requisite. It may be necessary to use an absolutely tasteless timber, or a non-porous timber, or a timber possessing some other special quality which can be obtained only in imported wood.",33,Chapman Eden Question Of Preference

As the honourable member for Kalgoorlie pointed out, those casks are practically a by-product, and .are sold for whatever they will bring in the open market When empty, they only bring 5s. each at Home. I imported a large number of casks from Sydney last year because I was shipping a fair quantity at the time. I got them put on board at ios., while similar casks, if made here, would have cost me £ 1 apiece. That is a consideration to me, because I can charge nothing for the casks in selling my produce. fair and right, in the interest of the primary producer, that f u l l casks should be admitted free, as they were under the old Tariff.

Which side of that argument are we to accept? A t one time, we are told that a protective duty will lower the cost of the commodity to the consumer; but now-the honourable and learned member for Bendigo tells us that the imposition of a duty will increase the price. I said it would increase the price of the second-hand casks, not of the locally-made cask. able and learned member will argue that to impose a higher duty on an article will lower the cost. cases. contentions cannot be right. A duty cannot lower the price in one case and raise it in another. The difliculty I am in about this item is that, if the duty on f u l l casks is increased, the importer will simplv put the increased cost on to the price of the liquid, and get his profit out of that. He will still sell the casks as he does now at the highest price he can get.

An ad valorem duty in the case of shooks will be altogether ineffective-the y are the greatest curse of the coopering trade. If fhe Treasurer desires to give any assistance to coopers, there ought to be a fixed duty imposed on shooks. These are imported in bundles from Calcutta and other places in India, the staves having been separated and numbered in order that they may be put together on their arrival in Australia. Packed in this way, they take up small space, and are carried at low rates. A hogshead, originally worth 25s. in Calcutta,-is broken up into a shook and sold at 6s. This is the last appeal I shall make on behalf of the coopers, and I urge strongly that an ad valorem duty will be entirely ineffective. in the Tariff. that the Treasurer proposes to strike out the word "" each "" wherever it occurs, with a view to imposing ad valorem duties. . Sir WILLIA M LYNE (Hume-Trea surer) [5.39] I have not yet submitted any amendment, though my intention was as stated. However, considering the great experience and knowledge .possessed by the honourable member for Bendigo, I am prepared to allowthe fixed duties to remain. On behalf of the coopers, I feel even more interested in the duty on shooks than I am in the duty on barrels. I should not object to the duty on the complete barrel being reduced, but, as I have already indicated, the importation of these shooks are really destroying the coopers' trade, which, as such, is dying out. So long as this importation goes on, it is found impossible to train apprentices to the coopering trade, because all they are required to do is to fit the staves together. The coopers will be greatly disappointed unless there are fixed duties or a substantial equivalent. the Minister will agree to a fixed duty on shooks. As the honourable member for Bendigo has explained, shooks are imported principally from India, put together here under the circumstances he described, and sold at about one-fourth of their value in India or London. They are sent here because there is a better chance of getting cheap loading from India to Australia than from India to England, and they have been sold f.o.b. in Calcutta and Bombay as low as 6s. 6d. f.o.b., whereas the actual value in London is about 30s. about 100 per cent. cent, on theactual value of the article.

The great difficulty presented in all the evidence of the Tariff Commission is that it is grossly one-sided; none of it is corroborated, and, although sworn to, is ex parte right through. that these duties be omitted, and that a uniform ad valorem rate be substituted for them. Sir WILLIAM LYNE (Hume-Trea surer) [5.52] I propose to adhere to the specific duties, with the exception of the rate levied upon second-hand hogsheads worse article included in this item, in so far as it comes into competition with the locally-made article. to agree to a duty of 5s. upon second-hand hogsheads. Sir WILLIAM LYNE to ascertain the value of these hogsheads. The honourable member for Grampians has stated that second-elass hogsheads are worth about 14s. each. were worth about 6s. or 7s. each, and that the cost of a new hogshead, unmade, was 14s. or 15s. The making would cost an additional 5s. or 6s. Sir WILLIAM LYNE is equivalent to more than 100 per cent. As a rule, these shooks are cut up and used by the small manufacturers in large centres. A second-hand shook does not find its way to the farmer, because he requires good casks. Sir JOHN QUICK (Bendigo) [5.54]-Upon page 603 of volume 5 of the Minutes of Evidence of the Tariff Commission will be found a letter written by Messrs. Robertson, Morrison, and Company, for the purpose of showing the value of second-hand shooks. It readsRe empty beer hogsheads.

The Treasurer has inserted the duty recommended by that portion of the Commission in the I am quite prepared preference column, and has increased the rate against the . outside world by 10 per cent.

Treasurer has explained that it is owing to the recommendation of the protectionist section of the Tariff Commission that a duty of 35 per cent, has been levied upon buckets and tubs imported from the United Kingdom. But the Chairman of the Commission has stated that in recommending such high rates of duty, the A section of that body had in mind the maximum amount of duty. He conveyed the impression to my mind that its members did not intend that the rates which they recommended should prevail against Great Britain, and that a still higher rate should be charged against the outside world. honourable member for Bendigo about the matter, and I understood him to mean that his idea was that the duties recommended by the protectionist section of the Commission were to be the maximum rates against the outside world.

That the word "" toys,"" line 6, be left out. There seems to be a good deal of sentiment about this subject, and I-am surprised that honourable members should introduce sentiment into the consideration of a Tariff. One would think that toys were of such a scientific and complicated construction, and so affected by patents, that it was impossible to manufacture them in Australia. I do not see why the toys used by our children should not be made here. Furthermore, I think we are justified in endeavouring to find avenues of employment for women. Toy-making is really women's work. A reasonable duty would not penalize the children by any means. On the cheaper lines a duty would make very little difference. upon the dearer kinds of toys, but those who could afford to buy expensive toys are well able to pay the extra duty. There is every reason why we should encourage the manufacture of dolls and toys in Australia instead of importing them from Germany. that the Treasurer will agree to strike out the word "" toys "" in the item with a view to making them duty free. It is bad enough to tax children's clothes and food, without imposing a duty on ' their playthings. Our little ones will hot be children very long.

A the Treasurer is a bit at sea in regard to 9-carat jewellery. He must remember that when he was Minister of Trade and Customs -fie instituted a prosecution against a Melbourne firm for importing rings which were stamped 9-carat, but which were wrongly described, and were neither more nor less than a fraud.

I ask the; Treasurer to consent to make the duties upon this item uniform with those which have been levied upon the previous item. It seems to me that it would be very absurd to impose a duty of 35 per cent, upon imitation precious stones, the invoiced value of which would be very small indeed. In this country we produce rubies in such quantity that we have been obliged to call them garnets to prevent the price of rubies being reduced to a non-pavable level. Yet it is now proposed to admit coloured glass at . 30 and 25 per cent. We should either prohibit its importation' entirely, or levy a specific duty upon this class of jewellery of so much per carat. The Treasurer knows perfectly well that the Commonwealth produces a large variety of precious stones, man may embark without the possession of either capital or skill. Opals, rubies, and garnets can be obtained here by the veriest new chum, who ought to be protected just as much as anybody else. The Tariff Commission is in no way responsible for the inclusion of imitationprecious stones in this item. As a matter I am inclined to of fact, this group of items was intended to cover Only bond fide jewellery. For that reason, rolled gold jewellery and I suggest, jewellery under 9 carat were taken out of it, and the Commission recommended that they should be made dutiable at 35 per cent. My own idea is that imitation stones should be removed from this item and charged a special rate. hope that the Treasurer will agree to eliminate imitation precious stones from this item. I am rather disappointed that the Tariff schedule makes no attempt to protect Australian diamonds. In. my own elec-",50,Irvine Grampians Conference Of Delegates Of The Victorian

The only way in which we can attain our object is by the imposition of a heavy duty per carat upon .precious stones. The industry is one in which tens of thousands of pounds have been invested, and there are miles and miles of country now awaiting development. Under these circumstances, I think that the industry ought to be protected. .previous item, we have taxed rolled gold jewellery at 40 per cent, under the General Tariff and at 35 per cent, under the Tariff for the United Kingdom. ;1s now proposed to make jewellery ancl 'imitation jewellery n.e.i. dutiable at only ; 30 per cent, under the General Tariff and -at 25 per cent, under that for Great Britain. her for Oxley that the duties upon the two .'items should be made uniform.

It has solely to do with those who produce rubies, garnets, sapphires, & c , from our mines. It is not a question of the Australian diamond having to compete with the foreign diamond, but of the Australian precious stone having to compete with glass and imitation jewellery. We must recollect that whilst it would pay a man to smuggle diamonds, it would not pay him to bring in a load of glass worth only about 4^d. per oz. If the Treasurer will agree to the imposition of a specific duty upon this item, that will be sufficient.

I consider that if a definite attempt were made to bring into use our cheaper precious stones it might induce a cutter to set up an establishment in Australia. One of the greatest troubles to the miner who has precious stones is that there is no local buyer. They have all to be sent to the London or German market to be cut, and then they are returned to Australia.

In the first place, they require female machinists, the market, as not only the shoe trade but all that class of labour can be obtained.

Manufacturers have prospered under the old rates, the importations of boots and shoes being exceedingly small in comparison with the total number used in the Commonwealth. The boot making industry is not a new one. It is now settled on a firm basis. Therefore the proposal to reimpose the old rates will, I suppose, have the",56,Irvine Grampians Conference Of Delegates Of The Victorian

Children who go barefooted to school are looked down on by their fellows. when going to school would not wear boots. of the Opposition, but the members of the Labour Party as well, should, in the interests of the workers whom they profess to represent, oppose any increase of duty on boots and shoes. Not long ago, when the New South Wales elections were on, the members of the Labour Party said that they would vote against any increase of duties on the necessaries of life, and surely in a country like this, boots and shoes are among the necessaries of life. The proposed increase should be voted against by all honourable members, no matter what their fiscal opinions. Mr Chairman, having lived for many vears in Western Queensland,. are aware that there are more children troop to school barefooted than wear boots. The children of rich and poor alike will not wear boots to school if they can avoid doing so. I could always afford to supply my. youngsters with boots, but they used to plant them in the bush on their way to school, and then some one would come along and shake them.

T h a t does not affect tropical districts. The honourable member knows nothing about any place outside the Hunter electorate.

At Mungundi, on the New South Wales border, a No t only the members few hundred miles north of Maitland, 1 have seen children going to school barefooted. The stock in Western Queensland are not degenerating, even though the youngsters do not wear boots when going to school. They are equal to sample. I have lived there thirty years, and am not, I think, a bad sample. The honourable member for Moreton is another good type of Queenslander, and I think he would corroborate my statement that youngsters go to school in that State barefooted, and are not looked down upon on that account. . In the circumstances, the honourable member for Hunter, in pleading for the voungsters who have to go to school barefooted, is barking up the wrong tree. honourable member for Parramatta has made a statement which I wish to correct.

The statement was made that there are four factories. that no increase in the number was likely. Let me tell honourable members opposite that, since the present duty was imposed, the number of hands in one factory alone in this State has been increased by 25 per cent. were working there before? crease in the number of hands in another factory has been over 100 pei) cent. More than that, they have reduced the price of children's boots. The honourable member ibr Hunter spoke of children having to go to school without boots. The price of sizes 4 to 6 of boots such as these I have here were sold under the old Tariff at is. 8d. per pair, and we have reduced the price to is. 6d. per pair. . These boots are made of Australian leather, under Australian conditions, and are competing successfully against the products of sweated labour in other countries, where the employees have to work every day in the week, in some cases, including Sundays. pay in this industry 25s. a week to a girl who would get only 8s. or 9s. a week in the Old Country. Yet we have reduced the price under the present protective Tariff to the extent of 2d. per pair in these small sizes. Why, then, should the duty be taken off? examined, they will probably be found to be made mostly of brown paper. member to examine the boots I have here. If he compares them with imported boots, he will find them superior. When the honourable member talks about brown paper, let me tell him that only a short time ago a gentleman waited on the Minister of Trade and Customs to ask him to allow infants' boots to come in at a low rate because the insoles were made of cardboard. I was approached in connection with the matter, and refused to have anything to do with it. The Australian-made boots I have here are made entirely of leather. The duty should be maintained, girls will receive employment. There is no justification for a reduction of the duty, and the honourable member for Parramatta has not given a single reason why it should be reduced, whilst I have shown that under the present protection the prices of these boots have been reduced. In every line the prices of these sizes have been reduced in some cases by id. per pair and in others by 2d. per pair. The price charged for one line of these boots is 17s. per dozen, whilst the imported price for the same article is 18s. per dozen. The price for another line is i is . per dozen, and the imported price 12s,, and in connection with another line I have here the price, as I have already said, has been reduced from is. 8d. to is. 6d. per pair. The honourable member for Parramatta comes from a State where those engaged in this industry have asked for the highest -protection. They have asked for a duty of as high as 50 per cent. If I did not advocate the claim of New South Wales manufacturers when they ask for an increased duty, I should be told that as it was not a Victorian industry, I would not stand up for it. That is one of the reasons why I have stood up for it tonight. [10.21] -The honourable member for BatWe man is like a travelling pedlar. First of all he brings a china cup into the chamber and flourishes it before the eyes of honourable members. Now he is hawking babies' boots about. I wonder where the -honourable member picks these things up. He seems to be a veritable depository of all the nicks and nacks. to be found in Australia. I am sure he must feel the responsibility of his position very keenly. He feels, no doubt, that he is the embodiment of the protectionist sentiment of Australia, and that he is performing a very solemn and sacred duty. give some reason against the duty. so, and I shall not give my own reasons. I prefer to give the.reasons of a man who is the chairman of a great association in New South Wales, and who has been in this business all his life.

This class of work it would be impossible to make in this country, the material not being available nor the labour. Another point I wish to put before you. In taxing these lines of infants' shoes and slippers you are taxing the little children and the working classes, as the goods that are imported are for labouring people in nearly all cases, and adding the duty on the imported price simply means adding considerably to the price of the article for the working man. To sum up, the extra duties do not apparently benefit the Australian manufacturers, and, without doubt, they do seriously affect the Australian consumer of limited means -bu t will simply make boots dearer to the It is signed "" Joseph Vickery, Chairman.""
