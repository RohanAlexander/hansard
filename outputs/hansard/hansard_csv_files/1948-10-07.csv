It was not mentioned in the daily press of Mel-bourne or, as far as 1 know, of any of the other capital cities. It is just as important to know what ha? happened on such occasions as it is when planes operated by any other company have to return. Supervision is exercised over not only Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited, but also all 1 otherairline companies. The Department of Civil Aviation has to approve the layout and mechanical equipment of the 1 workshops of Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited as well as those of other airlines.

Eor that reason I am unable records that were destroyed in the reto give a definite answer to the honorgrettable fire that occurred in the able member's question.

If that could be established it would prove that there is collaboration between the forces of the extreme right and the extreme left. The physical fact that if one goes far enough to the left he will eventually come to the right may apply also to political philosophies. I shall certainly draw the attention of the investigating officers to the consideration whether the services of the individual mentioned in thi9 chamber recently were not enlisted by the honourable member for a photostat copy of some document which ie alleged to have been stolen. personal explanation. honourable member claim that he has been misrepresented ? The Minister for Defence has referred to a photostat copy of a certain document which, in the course of a recent speech, I said that I had. was present when I made that speech, and had he been listening to what I said he would have realized that I was not referring to any of the documents which were recently mentioned in the chamber. Viewing the Minister's remarks in the best possible light, it is apparent that he is under a complete misapprehension as to what I said, which was that on a previous occasion I had obtained and read a photostat copy of a document which had been produced by one Winkler, out of which incident a royal commission had been appointed. That had nothing whatever to do with the recent incident in which the Leader of the Australian Country party ( Mr Eadden) was involved. Although the Minister probably understood what I intended to convey, I shall remove any misunderstanding that may still remain in his mind hy repeating that the photostat copy to which I referred, which may be examined by the Minister, was a photostat copy of a document produced publicly before a royal commission. WAR WIDOW'S PENSION. brought to the notice of the Minister for Repatriation the case of the widow of Padre Leonard Kentish, who was beheaded by the Japanese, and asked that a full pension be granted to Mrs. Kentish and her children. I understand that the Minister for Repatriation referred the request to the Minister for the Navy. I now ask the Minister for the Navy whether a decision has yet been reached in the matter, and, if not, when it will be reached ? time ago the honourable member requested .that a pension be granted to the widow of Padre Leonard Kentish. The late reverend gentleman was not enlisted in the Navy or in the Australian Imperial Force. He was on board H.M.A. S. Patricia Gam, which was sunk by the enemy. He subsequently fell into the hands of the Japanese and was executed. As the provisions of the Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Act did not apply to his widow and children, the Minister for Social Services authorized the payment to Mrs. Kentish of a pension based on the War Injuries CompenThe Minister sation Regulations. Subsequently, representations were made to me by honourable members, but as the matter did not come within the province of the Department of the NavyI submitted the case to the Prime Minister for decision. No decision has yet been made. When one has been made. I shall communicate it to the honourable member. THE PARLIAMENT. to the Prime Minister relating to the conduct of the business of the House.

There may be circumstances at any time that may warrant the application of the closure to any debate, but the honourable member may rest assured that so long as he does not want to stay here until breakfast time he will have no cause for concern. of the question I am about to direct to the Minister for Information I draw the Minister's attention to an article which appeared in the Canberra Times of to-day permissible for the honourable member to read from a newspaper? honourable gentleman is not entitled to read from a newspaper.

I still have a good left. I have given a somewhat abbreviated rendering of the newspaper report, because I was prevented from reading the whole of it. Does not the Minister consider that the press report is an unjustifiable and exaggerated account of the incident, and a grave reflection on his high standard of parliamentary conduct?

He hurled an offensive epithet at me, and I told him that he was mad. I think I let him down lightly. I remonstrated with him, but I had not the slightest intention of engaging in fisticuffs. I desire to maintain that high standard of parliamentary conduct to which I am used and I agree with the contentions of the honourable member for Martin( Mr Daly).

Why did the department grant this extension, in view of the agreement which the Minister has said he had entered into with the United States authorities before the girls left Australia, and why did not the Minister, when he granted the extension, with permission for the girls to go to America, then renew the agreement which he has claimed he entered into with the United States authorities but which, he has said, he cannot find? The Minister has defended his action on the ground that he is acting in the best interests of these girls. Does that mean that in future, when making decisions on applications for passports or permission to go abroad, the honourable gentleman will set himself up as a judge of the best interests and morals of the applicants and act on that principle, or can this be regarded as an -isolated example of the adoption of that principle ? slightest desire, to set myself up as a judge of the morals of people either going abroad or staying at home.

Last night, on the motion for the adjournment of the House, I was "" gagged "" when I endeavoured to refer to a fire which had occurred in the laboratories of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research at the University of Melbourne. Professor Martin has stated that the laboratories were engaged in defence research, and had accumulated, in a period of more than two years, certain defence information on atomic energy. The professor said also that the documents relating to those researches were in the building which was destroyed by the fire. Last night, a government spokesman stated that atomic research conducted by the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research was not related in any way to defence. One of the prime aims of Soviet Russia at present is to secure information about atomic energy and secrets about the atomic bomb. The spy trials in Canada have revealed that Russia makes the utmost efforts to secure information on uranium. CertainI withdraw the reCanadian scientists were sentenced to long terms of imprisonment for having betrayed defence secrets. I desire to show that there is a connection between the Communist organization in Australia and the destruction of a defence laboratory in Melbourne. The atomic bomb is now the first line of defence of the western democracies. In one night the only real research station in Australia used for this work went up in smoke. But did the records which it contained go up in smoke? Were they purloined and was the fire then deliberately started in order to destroy evidence of the theft, as has been done in many cases of burglary? Is there any proof that the records were in the building when it was destroyed? They dealt with the atomic researches of two years or more, and we have grounds for believing that they may have been stolen. I am suspicious because of other strange events that have occurred in Australia recently. I have before me I rise to order. The now a newspaper report of an incident in Queensland some months ago which led to the discovery of certain espionage and sabotage activities of the Communist party. This discovery was not the result of inquiries by the Commonwealth In vestigation Service. It was made by accident.

94,Mr Anthony,"The Governmentfind out from where they obtained the documents with which they disproved the Minister's statement. There is consternation in the ranks of honourable members opposite because it has been proved that the Prime Minister( Mr Chifley) and the Minister for Defence misled the Parliament and the country in relation to this very important subject. The Minister for Defence continues to mislead the Parliament. glosses over matters of the most vital and serious concern to this country, and attempts to allay anxiety and deaden suspicion. He tries in every possible way to do those things that will enable sabotage to occur in Australia, and indeed it has possibly already occurred in relation to the fire at the University of Melbourne. The time has arrived for a "" show down"", not only with the Government, but also with the forces that would attempt to destroy Australia if it were engaged in a war against Russia. It is to be hoped that such a war will not occur, but the British Minister for Foreign Affairs and other statesmen have warned us that we are moving in that direction. Our common sense confirms that warning, and we must, therefore, be prepared for war. have commented adversely upon the state of our preparedness on the eve of the outbreak of World War II., although we were, in fact, as fully prepared for war as the circumstances that then obtained and the actions of the Labour party, which was then in opposition, permitted. If we were to become involved in a war against the Soviet, the Russians would have the equivalent of a dozen divisions of troops in this country. closely, they would have read that Sir With the help of the Communist party, they would have on the wharfs, and in government departments, iron works, coal mines and transport undertakings, many agents who could disrupt our economic life and prevent us from giving effective aid to the Western Powers. All our efforts would be nullified if sabotage and fifth column activities prevented us from throwing our full weight into the struggle. A searching investigation should be made into the occurrence at the University the affairs of the Communist party Jfr. Anthony. in Australia. The Government hae instructed officers of the Commonwealth Investigation Service to interrogate the Leader of the Australian Country party and other persons who have attempted to ensure the security of Australia, but, as far as I know, it has not instructed any oflicers of that Service to inquire into the activities of members of the Communist party in this country, He some of whom have confessed that in the event of a war with Russia they would fight on the side of the Russians. The committee cannot allow the occurrence of the fire at the University of Melbourne to pass without considering whether the outbreak was caused by sabotage and what the consequences of it may be. If it was caused by sabotage, what action does the Government propose to take to deal with the situation?

I wish to is unnecessary to stress the importance future possibilities of atomic energy for industrial purposes. The tremendous effort being put into this work in the TJnited States of America, Canada and Great Britain makes it essential that we should have, in Australia, men trained in the various techniques involved so that when such techniques are required for use they may be used effectively. Most of the funds being sought under the heading of nuclear physics are therefore to be used to support the Nuclear Physics Laboratory, which is working under the direction of Professor L . H . Martin, in the Department of Physics at the University of Melbourne. I said last night, and I repeat now, that defence scientific projects come under the Department of Defence. If that department does not provide money for a particular scientific programme, it is not a defence scientific research programme. Funds have not been sought from the Department of Defence for the experiments now being carried out at the University of Melbourne and no funds have been provided by the Department of Defence for that work. No guidance has been sought from that department as to what experiments should be undertaken, and no information has been sought from any country, not even the United Kingdom or the United States of America, in relation to those experiments. That shows conclusively that the experiments, and the equipment for carrying them out, which has been destroyed by this unfortunate fire, have nothing to do with the defence requirements of Australia. convincing himself. honourable member for Wakefield ( Mr",25,Temporary Chairman I Ask The Honourable Member To Withdraw

106,Mr Dedman,"I realize that theMcBride) cannot be convinced about anything. I do not know whether he is utterly stupid, or whether he just does not want to be convinced ; but he cannot prove that the experiments now being carried out at the University of Melbourne have anything to do with the defence of Australia. The obligation to look after the buildings, plant and equipment rests solely with the authorities controlling the University. It is not a Commonwealth responsibility. The honourable member for Richmond has drawn a red herring across the trail. The Opposition is continually harping on communism, and is prepared to tell a great number of untruths in presenting its case to the public; but the people are becoming tired of those tactics, and when they realize that so many of the statements made by the Opposition about communism, and particularly about the security of this country, are completely false, the Opposition, will find itself eventually losing considerable public support. We-are dealing with the defence estimates, and I should like to say a word or two about them. The Department of Defence is responsible for the formulation of policy covering the whole defence field. It is responsible for the formulation and implementation of a unified defence policy relating to the defence forces and their requirements, including co-operation in British Commonwealth defence, the defence aspect of the charter of the United Nations, defence supplies, including the production programme and production capacity, scientific research, finance, and the allocation of available funds. The honourable member for Richmond has not said anything at all about any of those matters. The Government has given the utmost consideration to defence requirements. Our approach was to decide first what proportion of the national income of this country we could afford to expend upon defence. The sum which is being provided for expenditure over the whole field of defence in the current year represents a greater percentage of the national income than has ever been expended in this way in peace-time before. Government get for it? Mr Dedman. ever been obtained before. The honourable member for Eranklin( Mr Falkinder) served with distinction in the Royal Australian Air Force during the war, and 1 have no doubt that he believes thai we should expend a great deal more money on air defence than we are expending to-day; but just as he sponsors that argument I am sure that other honourable members opposite, including for instance, the honourable member for Henty( Mr Gullett), who served in the Army, will advocate a greater expenditure on the Army, whereas those who have served in the Royal Australian Navy, will advocate increased naval expenditure. Speaking of the over-all defence expenditure, I repeat that never before in our history has there been a greater proportion of the national income expended on defence in time of peace. there been so little return for so much money. ber for Wakefield does not know what he is talking about. He is living in the past. He is thinking of the days when it was of the utmost importance that we should have strong fighting services, but when there was no obligations upon the government of this country, and very little need, to expend money on defence scientific research. As long as the threat of war confronts us, it will be necessary to have armed forces; but world events to-day seem to indicate that should war unfortunately occur, the role of the armies will not be nearly so important as it has been in the past. Apparently, at a time when this country is suffering from severe shortages of many essential goods required for the civilian economy and when there is need to develop our industries, for it is upon our industrial development that our military strength finally rests, the honourable member for Wakefield wants to see a large number of young men called up for compulsory military service.

I therefore move That Division No. 191-Administrativ e (Miscellaneous Attorney-General's Department)-be reduced by £1, as an instruction to the Government to discontinue interrogations and surveillance designed to ensure that members of the of honourable menibers in respect of matters -lecturing in and arising from the discharge of their public duties in this National Parliament. I. so move because the privileges of honourable members of this Parliament are being seriously threatened. A threat to the privileges of members of Parliament constitutes a threat to the whole parliamentary institution that is the basis of our democracy. To-day we had the spectacle within the precincts of this House of a leader of a party who had exercised his right to free speech in the Parliament his right to make certain statements and support them by documentary evidence. He was interrogated by two security political police directed by no less a person than the Prime Minister of Australia himself. The right honourable inember was thereby threatened in relation to the discharge of his duties and that threat constituted a distinct breach of privilege. Honourable members on the other side of the chamber indulged in a series of catcalls and laughter during the proceedings. The TEMPOEAEY CHAIEMAN Order! I consider that the Acting Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Harrison) is out of order in referring to a matter covered by a notice of motion already given. can the Acting Leader of the Opposition be out of order when the matter to which the Temporary Chairman refers is not on the notice-paper? The chamber is in committee and_under those circumstances, I submit that the Acting Leader of the Opposition is not out of order. I ask you, Mr Temporary Chairman, under what authority you have given your ruling since, as I have stated, the matter is not on the notice-paper and the chamber is in committee? Temporary Chairman, that the motion I have moved. has no bearing on the matter upon which Mr Deputy Speaker( Mr Clark) gave a ruling from whicli I moved dissent. My amendment is x Parliament shall not be interrogated and shall not be subject to certain indignities. I am rather fearful that other honorahle members of this Parliament will be subject to such indignities and such abuse of privilege, and the only opportunity J have had cf moving in the matter corner under this division which deals exclusively with the relevant matter. The TEMPOEAEY CHAIRMAN. I think that the Acting Leader of the Opposition is anticipating debate on a motion to disagree with the ruling of Mr Deputy Speaker on a question cf privilege raised by the Leader of the Australian Country party after an alleged visit to him by Commonwealth investigation officers. to that matter. I merely want to refer to a case that might easily arise. The TEMPOEAEY CHAIRMAN. The honourable gentleman must speak to the proposed votes. privilege of which all honourable members are so jealous, the mention of which hah caused so much hilarity amongst supporters of the Government, may well be the death-knell of parliamentary practice as we know it, and may be the forerunner of the complete suppression of free speech in the Parliament. We know that certain tactics have been adopted by members and supporters of the Government in order to destroy the real value of Parliament, and members of the Opposition in this chamber are likely to experience the first repercussions of such a policy. Freedom of speech has been an accepted principle of British democracy since the sixteenth century. I need only to refer to May's Parliamentary Practice, which sets out the whole of the practices which regulate the function of free democratic parliaments of British-speaking peoples. At page 93 of that work, the following statement appears:Freedom of speech is a privilege essential to every free council or legislature.

147,Mr Harrison,"Denia l of thewas well stated by the Commons, at a conference on the U t h December, 1067: "" No man can doubt,"" they said, "" but whatever is once enacted is l a w f u l ; but nothing can come into an Act of Parliament but it must be first affirmed or propounded by somebody: so that if the Act can wrong nobody, no more can the first propounding. The members"" must be as free as the houses; an Act of Parliament cannot disturb the state; therefore tlie debate that tends to it cannot; for it must be propounded and debuted before it can be enacted."" The excerpt which I have just read deals with freedom of speech relative to the .enactment of legislation, and it proves that the ancicut right of members of Parliament to speak freely is based on a solid and logical May goes further, and at page 95 the following statement appears:In 1621, the Commons, in their protestation, defined tlieir privilege more consistently with its present limits. They affirmed "" that every member hath freedom from all impeachment, imprisonment, or molestation, other than by censure of the House itself, for or concerning any bill, speaking, reasoning, or declaring of any matter or matters touching the Parliament or Parliament business."" It is clear, therefore, that within the Parliament itself there is sufficient machinery to enable action to be taken against honourable members who offend. No outside body has the right to intimidate, to molest, to question or otherwise to interfere with a member of the Parliament who exercises his right of free speech within the bounds laid down by the Standing Orders. Another important statement at page 96 of the work from which I am quoting readsBy the 9th Article of the B ill of Rightsi t was declared, ' "" l h a t the freedom of speech, and debates or proceedings in Parliament, ouglit not to be impeached or questioned in any court or place out of Parliament."" In my view, the position in which honourable members have been placed by the action of the Government may be stated in this way: Actuated by a deep sense of national responsibility, an honourable member may make a statement which not merely contradicts a ministerial statement, but also proves that the Minister has wilfully misled or lied to the people on matters of extreme importance affecting the security of this country, Prime Minister( Mr Chifley), although well aware of his colleague's offence, may choose to condone it, and to assume and exercise powers that are quite beyond Mr Harrison. those conferred on him by the Parliament, the Constitution, and every parliamentary tradition-whic h should be the jealously guarded privilege of the Parliament-by having . an honourable member subjected to objectionable surveillance by police oflicers, whose duties are dictated by party political considerations. The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN. The Acting Leader of the Opposition must confine his remarks to discussion of the Estimates for guarding and protecting war and munitions establishments. because inadequate security precautions are being taken to guard vital defence secrets, any honourable member who has the courage to point out that important information is being withheld from this country is likely to find himself subjected to interference by the police. Sufficient safeguards against improper activity hy members of the Parliament, already exist in the parliamentary Standing Orders, and if a member of the Opposition, an independent member, OT even a supporter of the Government, transgresses the bounds of propriety he may be punished adequately by the Parliament withholding from him the privileges which he enjoys. The infliction of such an indignity upon a member of this chamber, though sufficient to punish him adequately for any transgression which he may have committed, does not deprive him of his right as a citizen of free speech. Attempts to deprive elected representatives of the people of their right of free speech are in accordance with the tenets of communism and have been made by dictators down the ages. It was to overcome that kind of thing that we fought two world wars. That is the. kind of doctrine which the Nazi, Fascist and Communist parties promulgate, and which the present socialistic Government is promulgating. There is no difference in the interpretation of democratic government by this Government and by those parties. Members of the Government are endealae vouring, by intimidation, to prevent honourable members from exercising the privileges extended to them before the sixteenth century. Those are",30,Temporary Chairman I Ask The Honourable Member To Withdraw

This afternoon the honourable member for Richmond( Mr Anthony) referred to what he described as an "" unfortunate "" fire all fires are unfortunate that occurred at the University of Melbourne yesterday. The honourable gentleman connected his remarks with the estimates of the Department of Defence by stating that some scientific papers relating to defence document matters had been destroyed by the fire, and he attempted to attribute the cause of that fire to sabotage.

192,Mr Chambers,"Honorabl e memmembers of tbe Opposition, realize how inadequate were the defences in Queensland? Honourable members representing Queensland electorates should know. Great haste was made to lay miles of barbed wire along the beaches, but within 24 hours after the first tide came in no barbed wire was visible; it was covered with 3 feet or 4 feet of sand, and six months later, on some of the north Queensland fences were covered with sand to a depth of 12 feet. When I was in Tasmania about that time. I saw tremendous concrete columns about 6 feet thick erected along the sides of certain roads. When I inquired what they were for I was told that that was part of the defence plan of that State. Iron hooks were built into the columns and the scheme was to suspend chains from those hooks across the roads, in order to arrest the progress of invading forces. The Opposition, when in office, spent hundreds of thousands of pounds building tetrahedras, 6 feet high, along the beaches, curred hy Russia in the war, and has but six months later they were covered with sand to a depth of 6 feet. In addition to the cost, many man-hours were wasted on those stupid defences. The first Australian forces that were sent to New Guinea in 1942 by the anti-Labour Government then in office, were untrained and unequipped. in 1942. arrived in New Guinea at the end of 1941 or the beginning of 1942, there was not one "" ack-ack"" gun in an emplacement anywhere in New Guinea. That was the legacy inherited by us from the preceding government. Neither at Moresby nor at Koitaki was there a single "" ack-ack"" gun. There were no bomber or fighter aircraft. From December, 1941, until May, 1942, the troops who were sent to New Guinea had to' live in their trenches, because there was no other accommodation. That was Australia's defence situation in 1939, when, for at least four years before, if members of the Government did not know that there was going to be a war, they were the only persons in Australia who did not know it. During those four years, practically every programme in every picture theatre included newsreels illustrating Germany's, military power. Why did the honourable member for Indi think Germany was building up its armaments? of the Minister for the Army, is Russia building up armaments to-day? member is back with Russia again. The difference between 1939 and the present time is this: At the conclusion of World WarI . , Germany had sustained practically no damage, apart from its losses in the field. Its industrial capacity was unimpaired. The same was true of Japan. On the other hand, at the end of World War IL , Russia had lost 12,000,000 of the most virile section of its population. Both the military and industrial power of Germany have been completely destroyed, and the same is true of Japan. Field Marshal Lord Montgomery, whom I respect, has drawn attention to the tremendous losses inpointed out that the industrial capacity of the country was largely destroyed. It is obvious, therefore, that circumstances are different now from those of 1939; but even so, the Government realizes that it is necessary to see to our defences. As the Minister for Defence pointed out recently, Australia is now spending on defence a larger percentage of its national income than at any other time when the country was not at war. Therefore, it ill becomes the members of the Opposition to criticize the defence measures of the Government. Rather should they co-operate with the Government in promoting the security of the country. curtailed time at our disposal, we are considering Estimates of expenditure for the year 1948-49. In his speech, the Minister for the Army( Mr Chambers) discussed defence matters relating to the years 1939, 1940, 1941 and 1942. I should have thought that he was out of order, but it was permitted. Therefore, as he was allowed to refer to defence matters relating to years other than the year covered by the Estimates under discussion, I assume that I shall also be",34,Temporary Chairman I Ask The Honourable Member To Withdraw

When the honourable member for Richmond( Mr Anthony) interjected to ask whether we should assume, from the behaviour of Russia, that a war was impending now, the Minister brushed the interjection aside, saying that circumstances were different now from those of 1939. Of course, they are different, bewith the details of military preparations. cause the Russians are Communists, and the Communist party is part of the Labour party. We understand all that. The Minister said that in 1939 everybody not so ludicrous. I was in England and knew that a war was impending. Therefore, I assume, he himself knew it, as did the leader of his party. We, who were members of the government at the time, did not know that war was impending, but we believed that it might ter for the Army. What, therefore, is be impending, and we took some elementary and substantial precautions. We prepared the war book on which the war was fought.

The members of the Government were not directly responsible for the erection of those structures. We did not direct such details, and I hope that the Minister for the Army is not to-day concerning himself We acted on the recommendation of our military advisers. In any case, the defensive measures which were taken were Scotland at the end of the war, and at every possible landing place along the coastline of those countries were to be found concrete structures of the kind which excited the derision of the Ministhe significance of the drivel which he has just been talking? that such structures were useless. that, at the beginning of the war, there It is true that our aircraft were not of the modern kind. defended so that our own defences could",35,Temporary Chairman I Ask The Honourable Member To Withdraw

203,Mr Mcewen,"There were twobe strengthened at a time when there was no war in the Pacific area. However, that is past history, and I refer to it only because the Minister dealt with past history. To-day, all our attention should be focussed on present events and what is likely to happen in the future. It is perfectly obvious that if we need to fear any country that country is Russia. It is not the United States of America, or England, or, as the Minister said, Japan. It is not Germany. If we have no possible conceivable fear of Russia, why is the Minister now presenting to the Parliament defence estimates involving the expenditure of hundreds of millions of pounds, and why is he stimulating recruiting? that there is no cause for fear of war from Russia. misrepresent the Minister, but I make the point which should be crystal clear that if the Minister is justified in bringing before the Parliament estimates involving the expenditure of millions of pounds on defence he must believe that a war is possible. By a process of elimination one must come to the conclusion that the only country that the Government of Australia can be fearing is Russia. The Russian Government has agents in every civilized country in the world. The burden of our contention is that it is immensely important to make adequate provision for our defence, but it is futile to have armed forces unless, at the same time, the Government makes provision against the insidious fifth column which the Government of Russia has established in every country of the world. That fifth column has been exposed in the United Kingdom where a Labour government has felt obliged, in its own words, to "" purge government departments"". The Government of the United States of America has been obliged to appoint a congressional committee to investigate subversive activities in that country in the interests of Soviet Russia. And the Government of Canada, through a royal commission of inquiry, has exposed the Russian fifth column in all its infamy. For reasons which we have explained a thousand times in the Parliament, we believe that a similar fifth column exists in this country, and we know that the Government knows of its existence. Therefore, we ask why the Government does not do something about it. It is sheer waste of time for us to produce more evidence on the point, because the existence of a Russian fifth column in this country is crystal clear. I have no doubt that honourable members, including supporters of the Government, receive letters from time to time similar to that which I now hold in my hand. This letter has been sent to me by a man who gives his name and says that I can use his name. I shall not do so because ho may, consequently, be victimized; but if the Government doubts the truth of the contents of the letter, I shall make it available provided that a responsible Minister gives me an assurance that the man who has supplied the information will not be victimized. This man says that he is a worker at the naval dockyard at Williamstown. Recently, at that dockyard, one of the largest destroyers yet constructed in this country was completed to the point where it is ready to be launched. I was invited to the launching, but, subsequently, I was informed that the ceremony would not take place because of the occurrence of a strike at the dockyard. We know that that strike was part of the Coinmunist plan to obstruct our defence activities in every possible way. This man writesI am forwarding you a paper printed in a suburb of Melbourne.

Investigation Service is not available, be the trade union movement by the Comcause the men concerned are members of the Communist-controlled iron workers union. Many of the residents of the waterfront electorate in which those men live are members of other Communist controlled unions such as the Waterside Workers Federation, the Seamen's Union, and the Stewards Union. I find that I am making ray appeal to Ministers whose pre-selection as Australian Labour party candidates depends on the support of members of such unions. is an. odd union which is not affiliated with the Australian Labour party. either. which I have mentioned are affiliated with the Australian Labour party, and because of that fact, they acquire the right through pre-selection ballots, to determine whether Ministers shall stand as official Labour candidates. That is why Ministers fear the Communists, and why they put their own little hides above the safety of their native land. ment, of which I was a member, instituted proceedings under the Crimes Act against the saboteurs, Ratliff and Thomas. They were convicted, after a public trial, on a charge of sabotage. After their sentences had expired, they declined an offer of freedom which was conditional on their giving an assurance not to continue their treasonable activities. They declared that if they were released, they would continue their treasonable activities. Immediately the Fadden Government went out of office, members of the Curtin Government, who owed their places in public life to the influence of Communist-controlled unions, set Ratliff and Thomas free. Fundamentally the outlook of the Australian Labour party has not changed in the interval. If this country is in jeopardy because of the infiltration of the Communist fifth-column, the explanation is to be found in the disintegration of the trade union movement and the political wing of the Labour party, and in the capture of a substantial portion of munist party. The Communist party does not confine its nefarious activities to this country. It sends young Australians home to Russia for special training. Repeatedly, Communists have been issued with passports to leave Australia. I could mention the name of a young man, twenty years of age, who was born and bred on a farm situated only a few miles from my property. He fell under the influence of the Communist party, and became an agitator and organizer for the Communist party. Although he had no money, his fare was paid to Russia. He has been in that country for months. He was being trained in Prague when the coup took place. I have in my office a copy of McLean's Magazine, a Canadian publication, in which appears an article by a native-born Canadian. As he gives his name, birthplace and present residence, there cannot be anything phoney about the article, which is entitled, "" I; was Taught Treason "". The writer explained that he was persuaded to accept the Communist doctrine, and he became a party member. As he was a successful agitator, his fare was paid to enable him to go to a training school in Russia. The Menzies GovernApproximately 3,000 Asiatics and 3,000 persons of European extraction were attending the classes. Professors and military men instructed him in the arts of communism, which he should practise in his native land on his return. He was taught how to establish a youth movement, like the Eureka youth movement in Australia; how to stir up trouble in an industrial plant; how to infiltrate a political party; how to make an improvised bomb; and how to stage a street riot. He and his fellow students were instructed in the conduct of mock guerrilla warfare with an official section of the Soviet army. Being a loyal Canadian at heart he was so disgusted, that upon his return to his native land, he exposed the Communists. He stated in the article that there were two Australians in his class. The Government knows all about that. In fact, I am convinced that members of the Labour party",38,Temporary Chairman I Ask The Honourable Member To Withdraw

I do not know-probabl y nobody knows with certainty-whether ' it was the result of accident or sabotage.

En my opinion the honourable member for Indi made some wilfully distorted statements about affiliations with the Labour party.

He referred to such organizations as the Victorian Iron workers Union and the Australian Railways Union and said that they were affiliated with the Labour party. That is not true.

He bas resorted to distortion in order to bolpose to discuss the matter any further. ster np his charges. That is all that he can rely upon. Frankly, I do not fear Communist influence in connection, with my pre-selection ballot. I have been opposed by the Communists before. The honourable member need not fear them, because they will support the policies which the Opposition advocates and will oppose the Labour party's policy. I do not intend to he mislead by the tactics of the honourable members opposite. The Acting Leader of the Opposition did not attempt to deal with any of the items which the committee is supposed to be considering. All he did was to submit an amendment as a subterfuge to enable his supporters to raise communism again and again. munism. I discussed the privilege of members of this Parliament. member referred to the fact that Communists were responsible thing at all about them. when the proofs of the honourable gentleman's speech arrive to-morrow he will find that he would need to make a lot of deletions in order to remove that impression. He did nothing but drag in red herrings in an effort to convince the listening public that the Labour party is associated with communism, although he knows that the Communists oppose the Labour party and help the Opposition parties. The fact is that men who have been associated with the Labour party for many years have never had any connection with communism, except in the course of their fight against it. The Opposition parties have never fought communism. They only use it now in order to get some cheap assistance.

Some honourable members opposite seem to have been misinformed. Ministers do not object to legitimate criticism of the Estimates, but such statements as those which were made by the honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr White) require correction. The honourable member expressed great concern about the fact that the proposed vote for the Department of Air for 1948-49 is £2,696,000 less than was actually expended, by the department in 194748. The honourable gentleman asked, as he is entitled to do, whether the Government was proud of the reduction. The explanation is simple. Honourable members will appreciate, of course, that the defence appropriations provided for in the Estimates refer to both war and postwar services. The fact that the proposed vote for the Department of Air for 194849 is approximately £2,700,000 les* than expenditure in 1947-48 is entirely attributable to two causes. The first is that the amount of expenditure on war services in 1947-48 will be reduced by approximately £7,000,000. The second is the increased provision of £4,400,000 for the second year of the five-year Royal",40,Temporary Chairman I Ask The Honourable Member To Withdraw

232,Mr Drakeford,"I guarantee thatAustralian Air Force developmental programme. The appropriation that is proposed for the Permanent Air Force in 1948-49 is £12,635,000, while the expenditure in 1947-48 was approximately £8,200,000. The reduction of war expenditure this year by £7,000,000 is due to the demobilization during the last financial year of members who were serving on war-time engagements. In that year those concerned received their deferred pay and other benefits which had accrued to them. Settlement was also made of other non-recurring war terminal costs in respect of items such as equipment, stores, building and works. The sum of approximately £4,400,000 in excess of the amount that was expended upon the peace-time programme last year is required for the further development of the Permanent Air Force that is planned for this year. The Government has every reason to be proud of those facts and of the expedition with which it has liquidated its war-time commitments. Last week the Minister for Defence( Mr Dedman) gave a comprehensive review of 'the Australian defence policy and of the progress that has been made in the implementation of the five-year programme for the services. I do not propose to repeat what was said on that occasion. Eecruiting was the subject of criticism by the honourable memher for Balaclava and other honourable members. The most recent statistics show that, while over-all recruiting for the Air Force in the first six months of 1948 approximated to the target figure, enlistthe three services. I direct the attention ments in July and August fell short of the much higher average monthly objective for the second half of 1948. Moreover, the wastage rate of airmen during those two months was, unfortunately, greater than was forecast. Action is being taken to obtain the number of recruits that is required each month by the Permanent Air Force and to make good the present deficiency. The figures relating to the Royal Australian Air Force personnel that were given by the honourable member for Franklin( Mr Falkinder) were as erroneous as was the honourable gentleman's statement of the aircraft situation. As I have already said in replying to the honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Spender) and the honourable member for Balaclava, I am extremely surprised at the statement of the honourable member for Franklin that there is much dissatisfaction in the Royal Australian A i r Force because of lack of opportunities for promotion. Doubtless the honourable gentleman believed that statement to be true, but I shall show that he has not kept himself up to date. the wing-commanders the other day? plus of wing-commanders in the Air Force at the present time. The honourable gentleman further said, referring to officers, that at the present time the membership of the Air Force consists almost entirely of flight-lieutenants, and that there seems to be no prospect of any promotion for them. Those statements were not founded upon facts. Although the basic substantive rank of many officers in the CitizenA ir Force-that is, the war-time Air Force-wa s that of flightlieutenant, those who filled appointments on establishments carrying higher ranks were granted the appropriate higher temporary or acting rank. Large numbers of officers were promoted to the ranks of squadron leader, wing-commander, group captain and even air commodore. Both acting and temporary rank, the latter corresponding with war substantive rank in the Australian Imperial Force, carried the full emoluments of those ranks. Acting rank only was withdrawn when a member ceased to hold a higher appointment. That principle was adopted by of the honourable member for Franklin to Commonwealth Gazette No. 136 of 1948, in which there is promulgated the latest appointments, promotions, ranks and seniority of all officers who have been granted permanent or short-service commissions in the Permanent Air Force. The honourable gentleman will note that while 632 officers hold the rank of flightlieutenant, 203 have been granted the substantive rank of squadron leader, 50 the rank of wing-commander, and eight the rank of group captain. The temporary promotions in the Permanent Air Force of 38 squadron leaders, 36 wingcommanders and eight group captains were also promulgated.

234,Mr Deakefoed,"There is a surmember for Eranklin will be tbe first to acknowledge that those facts provide an adequate answer to his comments with regard to ranks and promotions. The honourable gentleman criticized the Royal Australian Air Force Eeserve. Some months ago I announced in this chamber that I had approved of the creation of two lists within the reserve forces of the Royal Australian Air Force, one to be a reserve for Permanent A i r Force units and the other a reserve for Citizen Air Force ""units in the event of an emergency. According to the latest information, 3,900 men have applied to be enrolled for reserve service, of these 2,560 have been enrolled and the remainder are in the process of being enrolled. The number of officer, applicants for the reserve exceeds the number of airman applicants, and special steps are now being taken to enrol a number of ex-airmen in the reserves of the Permanent Air Force and Citizen Air Force. Plans for some training of the reservists are at present under consideration, and it is hoped that decisions will be taken soon. It will be appreciated that, owing to the general shortage of man-power in the early years of the Aiv Force development plan, the whole of the training effort adopted the attitude that the Governof the Royal Australian Air Force must now be concentrated upon training permanent personnel for the home defence and task force squadrons, as ""well as for all the ancillary units that are provided for under the plan. Later, when the -objectives regarding permanent personnel are nearer achievement, training facilities not required by the Permanent Air Force will be devoted to the training of reservists. I agree with the statement that was made by the honourable member for Franklin that there has been much comment with regard to the Government's defence policy. The adverse comment, however, has been of a general nature with a pronounced -political flavour. In the few instances in which a specific matter has been referred to and figures relating, for instance, to the numbers of aircraft and personnel have been put forward by honourable members in support of their views, those figures have had no actual relationship to the true Ur. Drakeford. position. FCT some reason best known to himself, the honourable member for Franklin did not avail himself of the opportunity of viewing thefiguresthat I offered to show him until after he spoke on the subject in this chamber. I had notified him approximately a week before then that I had obtained the information for which he asked. I do not know what happened, but he did not avail himself of the opportunity to see them. The figures that I was afterwards able to show to the honourable gentleman proved conclusively that his statements, as well as tliose which were made by the honourable member for Warringah and the honourable member i'or Balaclava were not correct. FCT security reasons I could not disclose the locations of units or the numbers of aircraft and personnel stationed in various places in answer tc his question on notice but the inf ormation that I was able to show to the honourable gentleman proved completely that he had incorrectly stated the number of aircraft that was available. WhatI am putting to the committee is that we have a programme of development which I think will satisfy most reasonable people. Everything cannot be accomplished at once. I have never ment's plans are perfect and beyond criticism; but we want helpful criticism on matters of this kind. The defence of this country is most important, not only to the Government, but also to the Opposition, and honourable members opposite should be prepared to give assistance instead of constantly offering destructive criticism. If they were prepared to do that they would not find any resentment on my part. suggest that I did not offer any constructive suggestions? to aircraft and personnel. It has been necessary for me to refute the statements that the honourable member has made. Had he accepted my offer and examined the figures, he would probably not have made those statements. However, I do not hold that against him. Minister.",42,Temporary Chairman I Ask The Honourable Member To Withdraw

All he can do is to keep up a running fire of drivel, no matter what Minister is on his feet. Mr ""WHITE I rise to order. I take exception to the offensive remarks of the Minister and I ask that they be withdrawn. The TEMPOEAEY CHAIEM AN ' Mr Watkins) -What were the offensive remarks?

The TEMPOEAEY CHAIEMAN Order! ' d r i v e l "" and ""snivel"". I shall deal aow with the criticism made by the honourable member for Warringah ( Mr capable of manufacturing the latest types -Spender). Eeferring to the aircraft position in the Air Force, the honourable member stated that, at the end of five years, under the proposed scheme, the total number of aircraft would be 144, consisting of 54 for home defence, with a total of 1,182 personnel, and a task force of 90 aircraft, with 2,061 personnel. Thus, of a total of 144 aircraft, he said that there would be only 86 combat aircraft. The honourable member went on to say that that number could be increased to 111 if air sea rescue squadrons and reconnaissance squadrons, which are included in [461 the figures given, were taken into account, but that, using the usual 75 per cent, serviceability rate, our maximum frontline strength would be S6 aircraft. Similar figures were quoted by the honourable member for Balaclava and the honourable member for Franklin in support of their criticisms of the equipment of the squadrons to be formed under the five year plan. I am not aware of the origin of those figures or of the basis on which they were computed, but I assure the committee that those statistics have no real relation to the true position. Comparing those figures with our actual holdings, it would, appear that honourable members opposite have assumed, quite erroneously, that the only service aircraft in existence in Australia are those in day-to-day use in the operational units. As honourable members will appreciate, aircraft comprising what is termed "" unit equipment"" are backed by very substantial numbers-man y times the total of the unit equipment-of the same types of aircraft in maintenance and wastage pools, in addition to strategic reserves to cover wastage in the early stages of a war, and for training purposes. I regret that, for security reasons, it is not possible to make public the actual numbers of those reserves, but, as I have already mentioned, they are substantial. Furthermore, honourable members will agree that force is not in numbers of aircraft alone, but also in the quality and performance of the aeroplanes available, in the skill and courage of the air crews, in the efficiency of the maintenance staffs and the personnel in ground staff musterings, and in the existence of an aircraft industry of aircraft and associated equipment in adequate quantities. Those requirements with the ability, to produce trained men in adequate numbers to expand the Air Force in an emergency, are the main elements of air strength and the Government's plans make provision for them. With regard to the personnel figures quoted by the honourable member for Warringah, and the honourable member for Franklin, 7 believe that it is necessary to point out that the establishment of tbe home defence and task force squadrons provided",43,Temporary Chairman I Ask The Honourable Member To Withdraw

243,Mr Deakefoed,"I withdraw bothiu tue five-year plan will be supported by approximately 5,000 personnel in the Permanent Air Force maintenance and training units. These men will be available for the establishment of additional operational units iu emergency, and their places in the maintenance and training organization, in such circumstances, will then be taken by mobilized reserves. They will be highly trained personnel, capable in every way of discharging their duties in operational units. In addition, the plan provides for the requisite numbers of trained personnel for research, developrapidly as possible to make good those ment, communications, and other technical duties essential to successful operaable member's reference to hundreds of tions. The further comparison made by the honourable member for Balaclava between the squadron strength of the Royal Australian Air Force and the strength of the aircraft industry in 1939, and now, was very superficial and unfortunately misleading. As honourable members may recall, at the outbreak of war, when the honourable member's party held the reins of government, the A ir Force squadrons which then existed were equipped with aircraft such as Wirraways and Hudson.* which were found to be unsuitable for their respective roles. Furthermore, reserves were totally inadequate and the maintenance and supply organization had many shortcomings. The position is vastly different to-day. The Royal Australian Air Force is now being organized as a balanced force of sixteen operational squadrons, supported by a training, maintenance and supply organization sufficient to support that force in war. The aircraft with which those squadrons arp equipped, and the substantial reserves held for those squadrons, are modern types still in use by the Royal Air Force and the American Air Force. Another important development during my Government's regime has been the establishment of an expensive aircraft industry to back up the Air Force organization. The local production of the Vampire jet fighter, fitted with the EollsPermanent Air Force Eeserve. I am Royee Nene engine, is well advanced and deliveries will commence early in 1949. Consideration is now being given to the production of another type of jet aircraft. The honourable member challenged me to deny that we had only one squadron in Australia ready to go into action. ifr. Drakeford. Apart from our Fighter Wing in Japan, which is constantly on a war footing, the Air Staff has confirmed that a number of squadrons in Australia are ready for operation at very short notice; furthermore, that we have all of the aircrafi and air crews -required for the manning of the .squadrons to be provided under the five year programme which are in process of being built up. The Air Force is, however, short of personnel for certain key trades in the ground staff musterings. bui men are being recruited to train as deficiencies. With regard to the honoraircraft rotting on various airfields throughout Australia, I should point oui that all of the service aircraft required for unit equipment and for the various categories of reserves, including training for the home defence and task force squadrons, provided under the five-year programme and all the training machinet required for training purposes, are hold under cover. Those to which the honourable member referred are the remaindei of war surpluses, and comprise mainh training types. The engines, instruments, and parts of value for post-war Royal Australian Air Force purposes have been removed, and, as the residual components are of no value, either for service or commercial use, they are being dismantled and disposed of as scrap. It is hoped that that work will be completed by thf end of the present year or early in 1949. It may be of interest to members to knov that, at the end of hostilities, 5,500 service and training aircraft were held by the Royal Australian A ir Force, and that the majority of those now lying in the open on aerodromes, are obsolete, and of no use whatever for either service oi training purposes. The honourable member for Balaclava a few days ago asked whether the Government had considered the formation of university squadron to be part of the CitizenA i r Force or now in a position to state that proposal of a similar nature have been fully considered by the Air Board. Its decision was that experience in the 193945 war showed that the formation of university squadrons could not be favourably regarded, mainly because university students fall into the reserved occupation categories and would thus not be available a9 air crew in the event of any emergency arising. As bonorable members are already aware, the plans approved by the Government for the post-war air force envisage an organization which would be the soundest to meet peace-time commitments and to allow of rapid expansion in the avent of any emergency arising at any time. The plans include the establishment of Citizen Air Force squadrons in the vicinity of the larger capital cities, and form an excellent medium for certain categories of university undergraduates to learn flying or to resume their Air Force training during the long vacations and at week-ends. The diversion of any of our present reserves to the establishment of purely university i ir squadrons would not be justified. Honourable members opposite have raised other matters with which I have not yet dealt, but with which I am prepared to deal at a later opportunity. I have no desire to take up the time of the committee at present, but I consider that if I had not risen to reply to some of the assertions made by honourable members opposite it might have been inferred that f was in fact unable to make any reply. ter to say about radar equipment for fhe Royal Australian Air Force? equipment and organization which existed in Australia during the war still -jxist. The Air Board has assured me that there is radar communication between every Air Force station in Australia at the present time. The honourable gentleman has previously suggested that rhe Government had dismantled some of rhat equipment since the war. Minister what radar the country has now. stated, the A i r Board has assured me rhat there is radar communication between all the places where Air Force squadrons operated during the war. These communications have been maintained. It must be realized, however, that the Government cannot, and should not, disclose all the information relating to such equipment, and if I am asked to disclose everything about it I shall refuse to do so, because such information might be useful to flie communistic friends of the Opposition. The only difficulty I can see in completing our Air Force programme within five years is the possible shortage of man-power for the more highly technical musterings. It is very difficult to attract recruits for such musterings because of the high wages now being paid in industry and because workers in industry may havith eir homes near their place of employment. The Royal Australian Air Force expects technical musterings to live near the places where their operational training is conducted and it is difficult to induce men to enter the service in those conditions. The Government hope that nothing will be said during this debate that will deter men from offering themselves for these musterings, and it anticipates receiving the assistance of honourable members opposite in its recruiting plans. I wish to advert to a matter which I would not have mentioned except for » statement which the honourable member for Indi made regarding the Labour party's attitude to A i r Force needs during the war. If the honourable member cares to study such ancient history closely he will find that there are many failings on his side of the chamber in regard to radar the Air Force. I remind honourable members that the late Mr Curtin, when Leader of the Opposition in 1937, advocated the establishment of a powerful air force, and was supported in that proposal by other honourable members, including myself. The establishment of a large air force was the only major defence effort of which Australia was at that time capable, because of the policy of previous governments which had pream asking the ferred to conscript people into unemployment by their failure to provide work to absorb them. At that time these governments had full power to do what they wished, as they had majorities in both Houses of this Parliament. I consider that the failure of these governments to provide work for the people and to expand the Air Force was a crime against the community that will never",44,Temporary Chairman I Ask The Honourable Member To Withdraw

247,Mr Drakeford,"As I havebe forgotten. Mr Cnrtin stressed that the only practicable thing for Australia to do was to develop a large air force, but the government of the day did nothing about it. ilfr. Spender interjecting, what the honourable member for Warringah did when he came into office as Minister for the Army, but at all events the Government of which he was a member was not prepared to meet its responsibilities at a time when it could easily have done so. At that time, four years before the entry of Japan into the war, it was in Australia's power to commence the programme put forward by Mr self voted against the defence estimates Curtin, but honourable members who are now in Opposition turned his proposal down time and time again. I therefore remind the honourable member for Indi that the attitude of the present Opposition to the things that at that time really mattered for the defence of Australia was to sneer at and ignore Mr Curtin's very sound proposal. Despite their attitude then, honourable members of the Opposition now criticize an A ir Force programme which is practical and which will make us ready to defend Australia should any threat arise. The honourable member quoted from a newspaper published in Williamstown. I could find any number of such references in Australian newspapers. As a matter of fact, I have seen the names of some honourable members opposite, as well as of government members, mentioned in the Bock. Honourable members can find such references in any newspaper in Australia to-day and they could not possibly be refuted. The honourable member has alleged that the Government is employing Communists, and he has implied that it employed people who belong to Communist organizations in preference to others who belong to legitimate unions. My own association with trade unionism covers a period of over 40 years, and I admit that there are a number of trade unionists who vigorously advocate the cause of communism. Such people do not know the real value of trade unionism. I consider that honourable members opposite continually make charges about the Government and' its attitude towards communism merely to drag red herring* across the trail and divert the attention of the Australian people from really vital issues. The Government ha? planned for a real defence programme, but the Opposition is more concerned with smearing Australia's name. -The Minister's speech about the Labour party's attitude towards the A ir Force prior to the war was too self-righteous for words. He stated that the former leader of the Labour party, Mr Curtin, had advocated a greater air force for Australia, when, in fact, both th<late Mr Curtin and the Minister him on every possible occasion. On the 3rd November, 1938, the present Minister foi Labour and National Service( Mr Holloway) saidThe Government is expanding much tot rapidly on defence. It is making plans for more than the adequate defence of Australia. I make no excuse for saying that. The honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward), who is now Minister foT Transport, statedIt is amusing to hear people say we wil. not give up New Guinea. To these people 1 would say that if it should become necessary to defend our mandated territories, thej should defend themselves. On the 1st December, 1939, three months after the war had begun, Senator Collings expressed himself in the following terms:I would not negotiate with that scoundrel Churchill. I regard Mr Churchill as a mad dog let loose for the purpose of spreading hatred where previously none existed. . This afternoon, the Minister for the Army( Mr Chambers) asserted that the Curtin Labour Government had bequeathed to it as one of its legacies a poor defence policy. I invite honorabl* members to contrast that assertion with the following statement made on the 12tl October, 1941, by the late Mr Curtin. when he was Prime Minister:I have to pay tribute to the Government which preceded my own for the constructive work they have done in defence and the foun dations they have laid. On the 18th October, 1941, he statedThe Navy was at its highest pitch of efficiency, as demonstrated by the notable ex ploits of its ships overseas. The home defence army was well trained and its equipment had been greatly improved.",46,Temporary Chairman I Ask The Honourable Member To Withdraw

(Ordered to be considered together.) Lea.der of the Australian Country party) [S.O] I propose to discuss some aspects ->f government policy and the general principles it has adopted in connection with loan raisings. As this is a very technical subject, in order to present my case, ii is obvious fhat I shall have to cite very many figures. At the 30th June last, the Note Issue Department of the Common-vealth Bank held more than £100,000,000 worth of Commonwealth public loans which, from the information available in the budget papers, appear to have been raised since 1941. The budget papers furnish a list of these securities, with the dates of maturity and the rates if interest. From this information, scanty as it is, several inferences may be lra.wn. For instance, the third and fourth Victory Loans mature on the 15th September, 1961, the rate of interest heing 3^ per cent. My research has disclosed no other loans carrying similar conditions as to maturity date and rate nf interest. The Note Issue Department of the Commonwealth Bank holds scrip bearing the same rate of interest, and having the same maturity date, of a value ""f £24,976,6S0. The sequence is mainrained throughout the other years. In other words, the subscriptions made by r-hfi Commonwealth Bank to the 1944 series of loans can be assessed by the same Chifley. J.

In 1943 subscriptions James, B. were at least £14,501,100, and in 1942, £15,577,476. We have been led to believe that Commonwealth loans have been so highly successful that they have benn oversubscribed by the public. How, then, can the £100,000,000 worth of war-time loan securities, now apparently held by the Note Issue Department, be explained ? The Treasurer, as the responsible officer of the Government and of the Commonwealth, must give us that explanation. There are two interpretations which might be applied to the details disclosed. If they are not in accordance with fact, the Treasurer, who has available to him facilities which are not available to me, should give us the explanation which the mere listing of such large security holdings renders necessary. First, the Commonwealth Bank could have bought the securities on the open market after the loans had closed; but that procedure would have been so highly inflationary that I dismiss it as fantastic. It would be incredible to assume that any bank would buy recent loan scrip from the general public and thereby increase the inflationary note issue by £1, let alone by £100,000,000. In June, 1943, the holdings of the Note Issue Department in the 1942 loan series alone apparently amounted to £1,125,000; in 1944 they increased to £3,559,570; in 1946 to £9,582,569; in 1947 to £10,5S2,569; and in 1948 to £15,577,476. If we examine the Commonwealth loans issued in 1943, we find that the Note.Issue Department of the Commonwealth Bank apparently held £S81,600 worth of the series in June, 1944, the same amount in 1945, £5,881,600 in 1946, £6,196,600 in 1947. and £14,501,100 worth in 1948. In respect of the 1944 loans, the Note Issue Department of the Commonwealth Bank apparently held scrip valued at £5.600,000 in June, 1945; £14,900.000 in 1946; £39,900,000 in 1947;' and £42,S£>3,157 in 1948. Finally, in the 1945 loans series the Note Issue Department of the Commonwealth Bank appears to have held scrip valued'at £18,997,000 t",49,Temporary Chairman I Ask The Honourable Member To Withdraw
266,Mr Fadden (Darling Downe,"at June, .1946; £17,977,000 at June, 1947; and £24,976,6S0 at June this year. These amounts are not the result of investment of profits of the Note Issue Department. After expenses have been met, such profits, which amounted to more than £4,500,000 last year, must be paid into the Commonwealth ipublic account and the Mortgage Bank Department. The securities I have mentioned have apparently been transferred from other divisions of the Commonwealth Bank to the Note Issue Department in exchange for notes in those years. That, no doubt, would partly explain the reason for the tremendous increase of the note issue, from £67,900,000 in June, 1941,. to £196,600,000 in June, 1948. It would also explain the reason why the heavy subscriptions do not. appear in the published figures of the Note Issue Department until about a year or so after they have been made by the Commonwealth Savings Bank or some other department of the Commonwealth Bank, which does not need to furnish to the Parliament details of its loan holdings. It isposwealth SavingsBank lists £369,600,00'' sible that by such a stratagem, the Grovernment hoped that its financial manipulations with depositors' moneys would not. be exposed. It is significant that, of the wealth Bank, in all its different divi£431,800,000 of depositors' accounts held by the Commonwealth Savings Bank, £369,600,000 is invested in' Australian Government securities, a proportion of which, I suspect, are of 1942 to 1948 vintage. I shall have something to say about the use of savings bank deposits in. the course of my remarks. The second alternative is that, the Gommonwealth securities by subscribing to each Commonwealth loan as it was floated. This alternative presupposes that Commonwealth loans have in fact been badly under-subscribed by the public by at least £100,000,000 in the aggregate, and the public has been asked to believe that the Australian investors' confidence has been properly reposed in the Government's financial transactions. It also presupposes a very serious inflationary .position, namely, that the Commonwealth Bank used its Note Issue Department to print inflationary notes to buy loan scrip, for the purpose of misleading the public into Mr Fadden. believing that loans were over-subscribed There is, of course, no limitation on the note issue under the 1945 banking legislation. The safeguards included in the legislation introduced by my colleague, the right honourable member for Cowper( Sir Earle Page), were removed by the 1945 banking legislation. If the Treasurer does not agree witL either of the propositions I have stated, which shows a highly inflationary policy, he should explain why the Note Issue Department now holds the following Commonwealth Government securities, as listed on page 176 of his own budget papers:-£15,577,476 , maturing 15th November, 1958; £14,501,100, maturing 15th September, 1959; £42,893,157. maturing 15th. October, 1960: £24,976,680, maturing 15th September. 1961. The Note IssueDepartment i> only one small department of the Commonwealth Bank. The General Division of the bank, including the Note Issue Department, holds £424,300,000 of Commonwealth securities, and the Commonof similar securities. At the 30th June, 1941, the Commonsions, held only £196,100,0,00 worth of Commonwealth securities: The total ha.* now grown to £793,900,000. How much of thishuge total is held in Commonwealth loans raised since 1941? By a simple deduction honourable members will see that the figure has increased by £600,000,000. The budget papers give us no inkling, except for the guide furnished by the Note Issue Department. Bank obtained the As far back as 1945, during the debate on the banking legislation, the Opposition foresaw this position. At that time we protested against the removal of thlimitation on the note issue. Now the Treasurer does not need to have a percentage reserve backing for the notes he issues. If he wanted to use the printingpress to help bolster up his flagging loan he could readily do so. I desire to know if he has done that, and, if so, to what extent. If there is any other explanation for the figures disclosed by me, the Australian investors and savings hank depositors are entitled to hear it. Let Uf review the savings bank position in Australia and see tbe extent to which tbe Government has carried out its socialist or collective policy in relation to the depositors' money. The deposits in the Oommonwealth Savings Bank, as at the 30th June, 1948, amounted to £431,832,715 and the Commonwealth Government securities held by the Comnion-vealth Savings Bank at that date, including Commonwealth treasury-bills, totalled £369,614,501. Therefore, speaking in round figures, out of the depositors' money totalling £431,000,000, nearly £370,000,000 has been applied for the purchase of Commonwealth securities. [ do not say that that is improper, but die application of such a large proportion is not wise, and when the ratio of securities to loan assets is considered, obviously the policy is not sound. In many instances the savings bank depositors did not know that their money was ;aken collectively and put into the Commonwealth loans. The people of Australia were deceived into the belief that r.he various loans were over-subscribed. I say that since this Government has been in office, not one loan raised has been genuinely subscribed, much less oversubscribed. The loans have been filled by the utilization of the depositors' funds ind with the assistance of the Note Issue Department. Let us review the position of the Commonwealth Savings Bank. Out of assets totalling approximately £450,000,000, there is only £42,684,453 in liquid form co meet deposits of £431,832,715. That is, less than 10 per cent, of the depositors' fantastic. There is no substance in them money is in liquid form. The Government has used the savings bank for no other purpose than to utilize its funds for subscriptions to Commonwealth loans. There has been no investment in any other direction except in the securities >f other governments and semi-governmental authorities. Turning now to the general business conducted by the Commonwealth Bank, what do we find? To what extent have '.he funds of that bank heen used to bolster up the loans and so deceive the public into believing that the policy of the Government is so sound that the loans have buen over-subscribed? We find that deposits in the special accounts of the trading banks as at the 30th June, 1948, amounted to £294,480,000, and Commonwealth Government securities, including Commonwealth treasury-bills, held by the bank totalled £23S,9S2,31S. The special deposits of the trading banks have been utilized to almost the fullest possible degree towards the loan raisings of this Government. The whole position requires thorough ventilation. There is very disastrous and grave evidence of inflation of the worse possible kind, by the utilization of the printing press to get notes. This is a matter that has to be satisfactorily explained to the members of the committee, ancl consequently to the people of Australia. The whole matter calls for the closest investigation. I trust that the Treasurer will not have to go to the same trouble as I did to get information. From the meagre information available to me, I say that he cannot possibly, in any circumstances, satisfactorily reply to this grave and important matter to-night, and whilst 1 make no allegations I repeat that the matter requires the closest possible investigation. I simply indicate, the implications and a satisfactory accounting for the whole matter is due from the Treasurer, particularly to the investing public and saving bank depositors of this fair country.

A report of that kind is not the sort of literature one likes to read during of the district of ensuring that the prothe week-end. If the Auditor-General makes any noteworthy comment in that report it is, perhaps, that the amounts allocated to reserves have been excessive. However, honourable members will have an opportunity to deal with that aspect of the bank's operations at a later stage. I wish to deal with item 12, under Division 213, ""Wool centres-Expenses "". I take this opportunity to protest against the decision of the Government recently announced to the Parliament that it does not intend to proceed with the establishment of a wool appraisement centre at Rockhampton. That decision is a complete evasion by the Government of its responsibility. [ have been negotiating with the Government on this matter ever since I was elected to the Parliament. So far my representations have taken the form of interviews and correspondence with the Ministers concerned, but it is now clear that other action must be taken if the Government is to be persuaded, or forced, to carry out the obligations it entered into in 1946. For the benefit of honorahle members. I shall briefly outline the history of the proposal to establish a wool-selling centre at Rockhampton. It arose from a move on the part of graziers and other interests in Central Queensland to establish a wool appraisement centre locally for the purpose of handling the very large wool clip in that area.. That move was supported, by Mr was determined on the 19th March, 1947 Forde,. who was then member for Capricornia and also Deputy Prime Minister. A committee was appointed, to investigate the suitability of various centres and finally it made a report. The contents of that report were not made public, but we do know that: as the result of the committee's recommendations^, a promise was made to establish, a wool-selling centre at Rockhampton. That promise was used freely in the electorate during the election campaign in 1946, and the then member for Capricornia, Mr Forde, definitely assured the district thai the centre would be erected. At that stage, I came upon the scene and assumed the responsibility on behalf mise would be honoured. At first; ! found that none of the Ministers concerned attempted to evade the obligatioi or deny the promise. 1 was informed that the Government intended to proceed vvith the building as soon as possiblt Tenders were called, and the contrac was let. After a little time, the tender was cancelled as the result of a hitch concerning some of the clauses in it. A* that juncture, the possibility of woolappraisement broking interests not supporting the proposal, and not intending to use the wool selling centre, also arose. I make tha point here, because it is important ii> view of the latest decision of the Government. Following the report, 1 in terviewed the Minister for Commercand Agriculture ( Mr Pollard) early ii> 1947 for the purpose of ascertaining thi Government's intentions. The honourable gentleman informed me that he had already discussed with wool-broking interests their attitude towards these centres when established; and that afte* some initial opposition, they had promised their co-operation. On the 30th July, 1947, the Minister wrote to me. as follows:Consideration to the building of the Wool selling Centre, Rockhampton, has been de ferred for six months owing to the foUowins reasons:1. The contract entered into between the Department of Works and Housing and John J. Booker and Sons,. 162 Camp bell-street, Rockhampton, for the eration of a three-story concrete frame and brick wool store building at Rockhampton 2.

283,Mr Pollard (Ballarat,"Minister for the decision was made, the estimated cost of the centre was £95,000. Acting on that estimate, the Government called for tenders, and on the 6th August, 1946, Cabinet approved the acceptance of thc lowest tender, approximately £131,000. Subsequently, an amount of £4,494 was allocated for additional expenses, making a total of about £136,000 instead of £95,000 as originally estimated. A contract was let on the ISth September, 1946. It was terminated on rhe 19th March, 1947, chiefly because of the refusal of the Queensland Timberi 'ontroller to allocate timber for the work. Some months later, on the 7th August, the Deputy Director-General of Works advised the Government that an extra appropriation of £20,000 would be needed to carry out the job effectively. That would have involved a total expenditure of £156,000. The estimate was so high that the Government decided, in view of its experience with wool centres built during the war at other places, that honourable members opposite appears to it would not be justified in letting another tender and proceeding with the work imless the organizations of woolbrokers and wool buyers gave a satisfactory assurance that they would use both the Townsville and the Rockhampton centres. It is strange to hear the criticism of honourable members opposite, because they are actively opposed, as they frequently declare, to any extension of socialism. The stores, which would have been built for the convenience of brokers, buyers, and, more important still, the wool-growers, would have been government-owned. The Government's decision not to proceed with the work was greatly influenced by its exwhere they were erected. However, in perience with the appraisal centres at Moree and Dubbo. After hundreds of thousands of pounds of the taxpayers' money had been expended on those buildings, neither the wool-brokers nor the wool-buyers were prepared to use them. Furthermore, some growers were not prepared to guarantee that they would deliver their wool to the centres.

Centres like those established at Dubbo and Moree, and those which were proposed for TownsMr PoUard. ville and Rockhampton, could be made to operate successfully only if the Government compelled wool-growers in those districts to send their wool to them for appraisal and sale and forced the buyers and the brokers to rent the buildings and use them.

Furthermore, the new centres would be of great value to residents of the districts the absence of co-operation by wool brokers and buyers, successful implementation of the scheme would be extremely difficult, if not impossible. I point out to the honourable member for Capricornia .that the failure of the brokers and the buyers to use the centres at Moree and Dubbo put the last nail in the lid of the coffin of this project. Some time ago I met representatives of the Woolbuyers Association of Australia in conference in Sydney.

However, this Government deeided, in the light of its experience and particuHamilton, L . W. larly in view of the vastly inflated costs of building and the urgent demand for timber and other materials for houses, not to continue with the plan to build centres at Eockhampton and Townsville. No political issues were involved in that decision. Eor instance, the honourable member for Herbert( Mr Edmonds) who supports the Government, represents Townsville, which would be benefited greatly by the construction of a woolselling centre.

290,Mr Pollaed,"I assume that theleeently brought to my notice that there is great dissatisfaction among junior postal officers because their rates of pay are much lower than those of young persons of similar ages who are employed by other undertakings in Australia. This dissatisfaction affects the whole of the Postmaster-General's Department. There is a shortage of junior postal officers because young people ave attracted by the high wages that are offered to them by private firms and are unwilling to accept employment in the Postmaster-General's Department at lower rate3 of pay. The department is not at f u ll strength and extra work is thrown upon the members of the staff. As a result, some of them may tender their resignations, thus accentuating the staff shortage and imposing a further burden upon those who remain. A recent survey of these junior officers in Victoria revealed that 95 per cent, of tbem are being subsidized by their parents because they cannot live on their pay. In addition, 80 per cent, or 90 per cent, of them are considering resigning from the department, and will probably do so unless their wages and conditions of employment are improved in the near future. General does not fix wages and conditions and rates of pay offered to them, and leave of employment. They are determined the department to seek better jobs elseby an arbitrator. should refer this matter to tbe Arbitrator cannot be provided.

These young people also complain ibout the living away from home allowances that are paid to them. They say that the allowances are reduced in value as the cost of living increases. They point out, further, that the allowances aro reduced when they receive their annual in crements of pay. That is the substance of the complaint that has been made to me. Earlier in the debate on the Estimate* I referred to the rates of pay of public servants generally. I do not know whether that matter has heen dealt with by the Public Service Arbitrator. I trust that the complaints that I have made to-night will be investigated at an early date, and that the postal employees concerned will receive the remuneration that is due to them. The Postal Department provides some of the ni03t important services in thucountry. Unfortunately there are manj complaints to-day, not only about the paj and conditions of junior employees, bui also about the general decline of the efficiency of postal services. I refer particularly to telephone services. Invariably, the reply of the Postmaster General to complaints that I have madi in tliis chamber about those services ha; been that there is a shortage of suitable staff. It is stated that girls who are recruited for work in telephone exchanges Postmasterdo not like the conditions of employment, where. The result is, according to the Postmaster-General, that efficient service? worse in the world Fourth Division officers vvas best, and I speak from personal exI t will cost perience.

[ mention that as an example of the inefficiency of Australian telephone services over the yeavs, it has been of gveat assisco-day due to the inefficiency of the teletance to the people of the Commonwealth, phone staffs. Unless the salaries and working conditions of telephone employees are improved and made at least comparable with those obtaining in nongovernment organizations, the . Postal Department will never be efficient. I raise this matter because I believe that postal employees, male and female should enjoy satisfactory working conditions and be paid adequate wages. So far, those matters have been seriously aeglected by the Postmaster-General. T hope that some improvement will be effected quickly. L wish to say something about the service provided for second-class passengers ra. trans-Australian trains. As the committee knows, those trains pass through -lorae hot regions in the summer time. Air-conditioning is provided in the firstdearly for their telephone services. In class lounge, and in the dining car, but -:onditions in the second-class carriages are extremely poor, and I should like the Minister to say whether it is intended, in any programme of providing new rolling stock for the Commonwealth railways, to modernize those carriages. Some improvement is needed urgently. There is a great demand for travel on the trans-Australian line. It is extremely difficult to book from Perth to Adelaide, and I believe that second-class passengers, who, incidentally, are paying a relatively high fare, are compelled to travel under -sxtremely bad conditions, especially in the summer time. That applies particularly to women travelling with children. T have not had any experience of comparable long-distjance railways in any other part of the world, but advertisements in .American magazines suggest that on the trans-continental railways of the United States of America, post-war construction programmes have included the complete overhaul of passenger rolling stock and the provision of highjtandard aluminium and steel carriages with observation cars and, of course, air conditioning throughout. T should like to hear some declaration of the intention of the Government in this matter. [9.16] -The Postal Department is one of our most important institutions, and particularly to rural dwellers. Since the war, of course, services have deteriorated due mainly to war-caused shortages and to the necessity to postpone all building works while the war was on. A similar state of affairs exists in many other countries, with the result that there if to-day a world-wide demand for postal and telephonic equipment. I am well aware of this obstacle, but I stress the fact that in this country to-day people living in outback areas are seriously hampered by their inability to obtain telephone services. In the cities this problem does not appear to be so great. Australia is the only country in which an annual rental is charged for a telephone in addition to payment for the service supplied. This is a severe imposition. The people of this country are paying outback areas, prospective subscribers are often compelled to pay portion of the cost of erecting telephone line to their homes, otherwise sevvices will not be provided. This involves considerable expense. We realize that, in many instances, if this charge were not made, the cost to the department of providing telephone services would be prohibitive, but I believe that there should be a reduction of telephone charges to lighten the burden that is placed on country people. Man\ people desiring telephones have experienced great difficulty in obtaining this service, even though their applications have been supported by such considerations as health, and age, isolation, or business reasons. At present, a telenhone subscriber who moves t< another home, cannot take the instrument with him. It is the property of the department, and he has to wait until the department agrees to install a telephonein his new home. The lack of new equipment, particularly cables, has caused existing services in many areas to become seriously overloaded. Most of the equipment that we require, including the telephones themselves, are imported. That",59,Postmaster General S Department

305,"Mr Bernard Coeseb, (Wide Bay)","fact has been the cause of great delay and inferior service in what is a very costly system. The policy of the Postmaster General's Department in respect of telephone charges might well be examined. Telephone subscribers are being charged too much at the present time. I also urge the Government to do all it possibly can to provide for additional trunk lines in areas where at present it takes anything whole of Australia. We should be up to two hours to have a telephone call connected.

That department is doing a remarkably good job in Tasmania. the present shortage of equipment, many people action on applications they have lodged for the installation of telephones, but since the war thousands of people in remote areas have been connected by telephone and now receive mail services which they did not have before. The frequency of mail services to some outback areas in some districts in Tasmania has increased from perhaps two or three deliveries a week to five deliveries corner. However, the honourable member a week. Tasmania has been very well treated by the Postmaster-General's Department, and I desire to pay a tribute to all the members of the staff of that department, from the Acting Deputy Director of Posts and Telegraphs, Mr department to accumulate a fund to T. P. Hanify, and the district inspectors, to the linesmen who actually carry out the hard work associated with telephone communications. Linesmen have to work in isolated districts, in all weathers, General's Department was, "" To not and if any fault is to be found with the staff of the department it certainly does not lie with men "" on the ground floor "", who do the hard work. Shortage of equipment had retarded the progress made in installing new telephones, but, in common with many other honourable members, I was delighted to learn that a new factory has been opened by the department near Sydney, which will manufacture telephone equipment, and so reduce the expenditure of dollars on the importation of telephone equipment. I also pay tribute to the work done by the non-official postmasters throughout Australia, of whom there are approximately 7,000. Each of those non-official postmasters has to aet as guide, philosopher and friend to a large number of people in isolated areas. I was associated with the agitation to have their pay increased, and I am pleased to say that legislation was enacted last yeai which has had the effect of increasing their annual salary by £250,000 and providing greater amenities for them. The unofficial postmasters, most of whom are situated in remote parts of the country, bear the burden of maintaining communication between people in those isolated areas and the more populous centres. 1 was surprised to hear the honourable memBecause of ber for Flinders( Mr Ryan) advocate an increase of pay for members of the are still awaiting Public Service, and I welcome the change of attitude manifested by members of the Opposition in that matter. The honourable member for Wide Bay( Mr Bernard Corser), who usually has something interesting to say, although we do not always agree with his point of view, complained that it costs 2id. to send a letter through the postal service to a recipient who may be only around the forgot to point out that a letter may be sent to England or to the islandf of the Pacific for the same amount. The halfpenny surcharge, about which we hear so much, is used by the provide telephone facilities and other services for people who previously had no hope of obtaining them. Before the war, the motto of the Postmasterspend money; reduce costs"". To-day, the motto of the department has been changed to, "" Spend money and improve the service "", and the department is doing a fine job in spite of all the difficulties which confront it. Telephones are badly needed in isolated parts of Australia, particularly in areas which are being developed as tourist resorts. In a remote part of Tasmania, a young girl died from snakebite during the last summer holidays be-, cause telephonic communication with a doctor could not be established, but I am pleased to say that the department, because of the co-operation whi'ch it has received from the State authorities, has now agreed to include that area in its telephone network.

I ask the Minister repre-enting the Postmaster-General to coney my suggestion to his colleague be-ause the adoption of my suggestion, vould save the department a considerable imount of money which is now expended m the erection of telephone lines. At present, applicants for telephones who live more than 5 miles 18 chains from the nearest post office have to bear, 'he whole cost of erecting poles, insula'ors and telephone cable. I should 'ike the Postmaster-General to extend the present radius to 10 miles. I have previously discussed this proposal with 'he Postmaster-General and the Director General of Posts and Telegraphs, Mr Streak Lightning is backing away: Fanning. Since the present regulations -vere made conditions have altered very :ons.iderably, and the development of new ireas has resulted in the settlement of people at increasingly greater distances from, townships. The result is that -nany people, who badly need a telephone, ire deprived of it. In the electorate of VVilmot, which I represent, two gentlemen named Harold Bowen and Walter Barrett, who are most anxious to obtain ""elephone communication, are deprived of it beca.ii.se they live more than 1£ miles beyond the prescribed radius of 5 miles 18 chains. To have a telephone installed in their homes they would have to pay £300, which is a fantastic requirement. That is too heavy an impost for them, to bear. They are in urgent need ){ the telephone service, but they will not descriptions of football matches be broad [U'oceed with their application under these conditions. I trust that the regulation will be amended to provide for an extension of the limit to 10 miles so that telebroadcast descriptions of race meeting? phones may be provided for farmers at the cost of the department. The department is losing revenue by its rigid adherence to the existing limit. I propose now to make some comments on the broadcasting of sporting events, in particular, on what I regard as the needless interruption of the broadcast descriptions. On Saturday afternoons luring the winter months football is played throughout Australia, particularly in Victoria and Tasmania, where the Australian rules code is so popular. Descriptions of football matches are Mr Duthie. broadcast over the national, network, our very often at a critical period in the match, particularly in the third, or las' quarter, the broadcast description is inter rupted by a switch to a description of t. race meeting, in which the commentatoi says, "" The barrier is down at RandwickA little later the football description ic again interrupted by a voice saying, "" Wt are now crossing to Mentone"". Ali too frequently, when a .goal is expected to be kicked, a voice breaks iii again saying, "" The weights are right a' Flemington "". Suddenly there is a switcl'. back to Randwick and an announcer after giving the pedigree of the horse^ about to start in a race says, "" D a r l Moon has turned sideways at the moment. Heather is having difficulty with Aton. Bomb "". Interruptions of that kind an continued throughout the whole of thi broadcast description of a football match and are most frequent when the matcl is reaching its climax at the end of thi last quarter. Very often football enthusiasts have to wait: until the raw descriptions are over in order to a3cer tain whether or not their favoured tean> has achieved victory.

After, making their statements both bonorable the chamber. They would not wait to listen to the facts concerning the matters which they placed before the committee. Here are some of the figures relating to the activities of the Postmaster-General's Department. In 1938 there were 43,000 employees in the department; this year there are 69,000 employees. Thus, the attack by the honorahle member for ""Flinders simply goes by the board. that the department is rendering efficient jprvice. employed the honourable member for efficient. The honourable member's interjection proves the truth of something to which I shall refer in a moment or two. [n 1938, when the honourable member was a member of the Senate, 630,000 telephones were installed; in 1948 the number was 963,000. That increase was made possible because this Government has brought, prosperity to Australia and people who could not previously afford a telephone can now do so. In 1938, 1,000,000 wireless licences were L?sued in Australia; to-day the number of current wireless licences is 1,800,000. Very many people are buying wireless sets to enable them to listen to the speeches of Labour members in this Parliament. In 1938, the department made a profit of £3,500,000; in 1947 the profit was £5,103,000. Eental and other charges in connection with telephones, and postal charges, whether by air or surface mail, are the cheapest in the world. The attacks made by honourable members opposite are all apparently a part of a softening up process inaugurated at the conference of the Eederal Council of the Liberal party held in Adelaide last month. Thp honourable member for Wakefield should know all about, it, because he wa present.. The Adelaide Advertiser wa the only newspaper which reported tin deliberations of the conference on th< subject of public utilities. All othei newspapers suppressed the report..

Trans-Australia Airways, the Commonwealth Bank, and Eadio Australia, which my department administers so efficiently, to private enterprise. Honorahle members opposite complain that the Posi Office is inefficient and insufficient^ staffed. When I show them that the number of employees in the Post Offici has increased by 80 per cent, since thej were in office, they say, "" The staff ic inefficient"". At another time thej suggest that services of thousands of public servants be dispensed with and that they be thus conscripted to work on farms or in secondary industries in citj and country centres.

It cannot supply more and more telephones, employ greater numbers of people, pay higher wages, and at the same time cut down the -iources of its income. The honourable member for Flinders spoke about junior officers in the post office with tears in his voice, but he is not very interested in the conditions of the people. The main base grades of employees in the Fourth Division of the Gommonwealth Public Service have been granted increases by the Public Service Arbitrator. Male assistants in GradeI . received an increase of £20 on the minimum of the range, and £16 on the maximum of the range.

Other grades of the Fourth Division, and juniors, will receive comparative increases. The over-all cost to the Government amounts to £1,250,000 for a full year, which is a considerable in'-rease. -peak again later this evening? able gentleman makes a worthwhile contribution to the debate I shall. In 1947-4S £5,230,000 was expended on telephone exchange services, which cover exchange switching equipment, both automatic and manual, underground cables for local services, subscriber's aerial wires, and apparatus to provide telephone services. The estimated expenditure for 194S-49 is £6,275,000. That represents an increase of more than £1,000,000 in that particular item alone. At the 30th June, 1947, the total number of outstanding applications for subscribers' telephone lines throughout Australia was SS,049. Of that number, 70.175 were for telephones in metroof country districts. The number of additional subscriber services connected; during 1947-48-and I ask the committeeto specially note this figure-was 5S,137. which constitutes an all-time record. Despite that, the number of outstanding applications at the 30th June, 1948, was 113,911, of which 90,938 are for themetropolitan areas and 22,973 for country districts. Those figures reveal the continuing prosperity of this country. The figures in regard to trunkline services show an expenditure of £1,3SS,496 for the year 1947-48. The estimated expenditure this year h £2,150,000, which is an increase of £761,504. Approximately 250 additionaltrunk-line channels were provided during the year 1947-48. £2,150,000 represents capital expenditure t priation is of revenue. The expenditure in relation to capital will be dealt with under another item. During the year 1947-48 payments for new physical lines or carrier-wave systems included the provision of twelve additional systems between Sydney and Canberra and also another twelve between Sydney and Dubbo. It is also proposed that the trunk-line programme shall he expended appreciably during the year 1948-49, and the plans provide for the provision of 400 extra channels the Minister during 1948-49, including the following:-Between Sydney and Melbourne., twelve channels; between Adelaide and Port Augusta, twelve channels; between Hobart and Launceston, twelve channels ; between Sydney and Tamworth, twelve channels. It is expected to complete the underground trunk cable between Sydney and Bathurst, and also to complete the installation of carrier equipment. This shows the tremendous activity which is going on in the provision of all these services to the community. Additional radio-telephone systems are also to be provided in centres where it would be difficult to install other types of telephone services.

In .Brisbane and Perth, second high frequency transmitters are to be installed to serve outlying areas, whilst in Sydney a high frequency transmitter is to be installed to serve the north coast which is considerably less than the and south coast areas, pending provision of frequency modulation services. I bring these matters briefly to the notice of the committee to show that the Postmaster-General's doing a wonderful job. As soon as telephones can be made, and other material supplied, and when people can be obtained to work in the post officesthere is a very great difliculty in getting labour everywhere these daysthe work I have mentioned will be undertaken. I have advised the PostmasterGencrfil that I shall make available to him, at an early date, 400 Baltic migrants, who will dig the trenches required for extension of the department's services in various parts of Australia, and for which type of employment no Australians are applying. We shall make more and more people available, so that when we discuss the Estimates next year we will be able to report so much progress that consideration of this item of the Estimates will occupy only a matter of seconds. -In dealing with the estimates for the Postmaster-General's Department I pay a tribute to the honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr Bowden), who last year stressed the necessity for a fund to provide telephones in isolated places. The honourable member for Wilmot( MrI paid a similar tribute to the Minister Duthie) to-day suggested that the length of telephone line which the departmenl will erect from the exchange to the subscribers be increased to 10 miles Both of those claims are justified, but 1 think that the proposal of the honourable members for Gippsland has a much widei implication, because it is to provide telephones for people in isolated places, each locality to be judged on its merits. That isof paramount importance as a means of alleviating the difiiculties of people in T with this modern means of communication. I should like the Minister tc inform the Postmaster-General thai honourable members on both sides of this chamber are agreeable to the proposal. According to the budgei the amount expended in 1947-4. 4 for mail services was £3,307,008. amount of £3,631,500 which was voted for that year. The estimated expenditure on mail services for 194S-49 i> £4,3S7,900, which is over £1,000,000 more than was expended on them lasi Department is year. This year, the Postmaster-General'.* Department is to subsidize Trans-Australia Airlines to carry mails, and it is proposed to pay in subsidies more than twice as much as was paid under contract last year for the carriage of mails by weight. I cannot see any justification for that. last year, the Post Office made a profit of more than £5,000,000, and this year the department proposes to increase its expenditure by £5,424,000. Evidently, therefore, the Government is determined to spend all of last year's profit, instead of reducing the cost of services to the public. Once this Labour Government gets it9 hands on anything, whether it be the uniform taxation scheme, or an extra half-penny on the postage rate, it never lets go. It reminds me of the travelling salesman who when he gets his foot in a doorway, refuses to give up until he has made a sale. In view of the large profit made by the Post Office, the people are looking for a reduction of postal rates. I wish to pay a tribute to the Minister for Information ( Mr Calwell), who, in this chamber, represents the Postmaster General (Senator Cameron). Last night.",65,Postmaster General S Department

Provision is made in the Estimates for an amount of £1,252,000 for air-mail subsidies. The people should know that that payment is one reason why postage rates are so high.

Yesterday we learnt that thc operations of Trans-Australia Airlines for twelve months had resulted in wnother heavy loss. been bigger if Trans-Australia Airlines had not received the mail subsidies. to hide the heavy losses on this nationalized service, the Government is transferring huge sums from the Postmaster-General's Department to Trans-Australia Airlines.

Surely the Minister has sufficient sense to know what is happening. The transport of mails, which is now being undertaken by Trans-Ausrralia Airlines, could be carried out by private airline companies provided they were permitted to purchase a few additional aircraft.

That thought leads me to the excessive cost of sending food parcels to Greav Britain.

341,Mr White,"I submit that my repeople have telephones. inference which I draw then is that most of the people who still require telephones live in my electorate. Scores of my constituents have been endeavouring to secure telephones for long periods. Earlier, the representative of a country constituency said that all the telephones must be installed in the.large cities. I hasten to assure him that they are not. [ am not criticizing the officers of the Postmaster-General's Department. The courtesy with which they render service and the promptness with which they answer correspondence are extremely satisfactory. The department has some excellent engineers, who are equal to the best in tlie world. The Minister for ^formation, though, who becomes intoxicated with the exuberance of his own verbosity, has said that the next government monopoly will be television. day for him if the proceedings of the Parliament are televised. Television and frequency modulation services will be monopolized and other great wonders will be performed by the Government, no doubt at a cost of millions of pounds. Undoubtedly television and frequency modulation must come to Australia, but chey should not become Government monopolies. The Minister should give his attention to other more pressing, if less spectacular, matters. He should unsure that telephones are supplied to the scores of thousands of applicants in the eity of Melbourne and its suburbs. Some of these people are in dire sickness, others are aged 100 yards to a public telephone, but some people in the country are 20 miles away from the nearest telephone. walk 100 yards, but I admit that the needs of country people are more urgent. The Communist party head-quarters at Marx House in Sydney has a score of telephones. munist organization has them.

I do not blame the officers of the Postal Department for this state of affairs. The Government is at fault. While it talks of grandiose schemes, the millions of pounds that the department spends and earns, and itsscores of thousands of employees, the Government neglects the ordinary everyday wants of the people. There is mucb that can be done to improve existing telephone services. For instance, the automatic telephone is a thing of common usage all over the world, yet, in some of the largest suburbs of Melbourne, subscribers are still served by manual exchanges. I do not want to be unfair to the operators at the Windsor exchange, but sometimes it seems to be quicker to write a letter than to make a telephone call in that area. That is scarcely ai> exaggeration. Many thousands of subscribers are connected to that exchange. Central exchange in Melbourne, the It will be a bad principal exchange in the heart of the city, is also manually operated. Everybody knows that the automatic telephone has been a great aid to humanity, but this Government, despite all the bragging of the Minister, cannot even provide automatic services for the principal cities and their suburbs. The speech made by the Governor General at the .opening of this session of the Parliament contains several paragraphs extolling the excellence of our postal services. I pay tribute to the w?ork of some branches of the department, but others provide an inadequate service. The profiteering on postage, the lack of telephones, and the existence of obsolete manual exchanges in our principal cities, call for strong criticism of the Government's policy. I realize that there have been shortages of cables and telephone instruments, but, if the Government can plan great expensive undertakings for the department, surely it can arrange for the purchase or manufacture of telephone equipment so thai we can be provided with a satisfactory service.",70,Postmaster General S Department

In fact I first raised this matter in this chamber about sevenr cen years ago. Mr ""WHITE I remember that. orable member for Balaclava ( Mr it with pleasure. The first section of the White) was a member of a government which made a number of promises to build a new post oflice in Brisbane, but, unfortunately, it did not honour them. The honourable member for Wimmera( Mr Turnbull), to whose speech I listened carefully, declared that nearly all of the modern post offices in Australia had been built under the administration of anti-Labour governments. That boast certainly does not apply to Brisbane. The general post office in that city would be a disgrace to any capital city. It is true that in 1939, when the honourable imember for Barker( Mr ciency, I am convinced that no other Archie Cameron) was Postmaster General, the government of the day set aside an amount of £50,000 for the construction of a new building. However, war broke out, and, of course, the money had to be expended for other purposes. Nothing more was said about the project until hostilities ended, but each year since then I have pressed for the commencement of work upon it. I give credit to both the present Postmaster-General, (Senator Cameron) and his predecessor in that oflice, Senator Ashley, for what they have done in the interests of employees at the Brisbane Post Office. They have authorized many improvements there, and. I am pleased that these additions have been made so that they can become part of the permanent structure when the proposed building is eventually erected. Both the Postmaster-General and the Deputy Director of Posts and Telegraphs in Brisbane, Mr Stewart, recently announced that the Government intended to proceed with the new work during 1948-49. Consequently, I regret that I have been unable to find any reference in the Estimates to a proposed appropriation for the undertaking. I sincerely hope "" that the Postmaster General will fulfil the promise which he has made, not only to me, but also to th>people of Brisbane. the programme of works for Queensland for the erection of the first stage of the new post office building for Brisbane. to have that information, and I am sure that the people of Brisbane will receive new building will be erected on the site of the existing mail ofiSce in Elizabeth Street, which is a disgrace and in which no Commonwealth employee should be called upon to work. The honourable member for Flinders( Mr Eyan) said thai the Postal Department had difficulty in securing efficient employees and alleged that this was because the treatment of postal officers was not so good as it should be. I have had considerable experience in connection with the Postal Department, and I have been in constant touch with its officers in Brisbane and, despite ths honourable gentleman's allegations of ineffigovernment department offers greater civility or better attention than is provided by post office employees. Thev are very efficient. This is largely due to the enlightened treatment that they have received under the regime of thi* Government. Although the General Posi Office building in Brisbane is an old one. the amenities that are provided for the employees and the general public are a credit to the Government. They are much appreciated, and it is pleasing to know that they will continue to be provided when the new building is completed. I receive many requests from my constituents with regard' to postal and telephone facilities. During the war the Postmaster-General's Department was hampered by a shortage of materials. Although the position has improved considerably in the last twelve months, there are still many persons who are waiting for telephones to be installed in theii homes. In Brisbane, every application for the installation of a telephone is considered on its merits. There is no unfairness, and I receive very few complaints in that connection. The position is improving every day, and I have been successful in securing many telephones",71,Postmaster General S Department

The postal employees have to apply to the Public Service Arbitrator. I sincerely hope that the Postmaster-General will -insure that the increases to which the Minister referred are granted as soon as possible.

It is probable that the activities of those two departments penetrate further into the inland, and particularly into the Northern Territory, than -lo those of any otlier government departments. I propose to confine my remarks now to the estimates for the CommonAvealth Railways, and I shall discuss inland mail services when the estimates for the Nortliern Territory are discussed, if I obtain a call from the Chair. The Government will be forced shortly to make an announcement of its developmental policy with regard to Commonwealth Railways. Adelaide to Alice Springs was built at a rime when there was little supervision of contractors, and the Government war imposed upon by a gang of "" go-getters "". I do not propose to criticize private contractors, because I think Australia needsmore of them to-day. In my opinion, it if far better to utilize their services than to waste money upon socialistic experiments. In the NorthernTerritory, in particular, public money is being poured down the sink by the Department of Works and Housing. I shall have more tc say on that subject to-morrow. Something will have to be done to put the Adelaide-Alice Springs railway in better order than it is now. The trans-Auscellent lirst-class carriages are air-cooled, but, as the honourable member for Fremantle ( Mr Beazley) said, the secondclass carriages are not really satisfactory. The railway journey from Adelaide to Alice Springs, a distance of approximately 1,000 miles, takes three days. Even in the first-class carriages women are huddled together, and no baths are provided for them. For fourteen years I have been pressing for carriages thai will provide reasonable amenities for the women who travel on that line. They are the real battlers of the centre of Australia. It is time that something wa> done. I receive many complaints from constituents in the Alice Springs districi with regard to the preference that if given to tourists on this railway. The inhabitants of the Northern Territory do not object to tourists. On the contrary, they welcome them, although the young bachelors have indicated to me that they would prefer to see more "" streamlined "" tourists among the elderly people who apparently spend the savirig that they have accumulated during many years in order to make a tour of the territory. During the months of May. June and July nearly all of the seatf on the trains between Adelaide and Alice Springs are taken by tourists, and the residents of the Northern Territory find it very difficult to make bookings. I ask the Minister for the Interior( Mr Johnson) whether, during the tourist season, arrangements can be made for The railway line from seats on the trains to be made available to residents of the territory who desire to travel on them.",72,Postmaster General S Department

Those conditions were obtained for them by the Minister for Air( Mr Drakeford), when he was u member of the Opposition, and myself. We fought a battle to get the Public -Servico Arbitrator to go through that urea. One of the finest reports upon the conditions under which railway workers live in outlying places was that which was written, by the Public Service Arbitrator in 1936. I am afraid that I cannot remember his name at this moment. He was shocked to see the conditions under whicli those unfortunate men were living in that grim country, and, acting upon his report, the government of the day improved conditions. I am glad rhat the present Minister for the In terior has continued that good work, and f give him. full credit for what he has 'lone. To-day there are messes all along rhe Hue to Kalgoorlie.

As other members of the Opposition wish to speak before the time allowed for this debate has expired, I shall reserve my remarks f»n the Postmaster-General's Department. for the Interior) [10.52] I wish to make one or two brief observations on -some of the matters that have been raised in connection with Commonwealth railways. The honourable member for Fremantle ( Mr Beazley) asked what the Government intended to do to improve second-class accommodation on transAustralian trains. The Government proposes, a soon as possible, to provide addiduring the war, would be a credit to any tional comfort for second-class passengers nn those trains. I remind the committee that this Government, as the honourable memher for the Northern Territory ( Mr Blain) has said, inherited a legacy from the previous Administration. Wheni l assumed office no improvements had been made to the accommodation on the transAustralian line for many years. The housing conditions of employees on thai line were the worse in Australasia. In faet, there was better accommodation in shearing sheds on many pastoral properties in the most isolated parts of Australia than was provided for employeesof the Commonwealtli railways until this Government tackled the housing problem. inspect that line long before that. build houses. To-day there are new dwellings all along the line from Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta. The old huts that the unfortunate workers and their families 1 were compelled to live in have been abandoned. Each of the new homes is fitted with refrigeration. In reply to the representations tha.i have been made by the honourable member for the Northern Territory for an improvement of the North-South line, 1 have to inform him that this matter if under consideration. At the moment, a survey is being carried out for a standard gauge line from Port Pirie to Alice pose, therefore, to purchase new rolling stock of the 3 f t . 6 in. gauge for thisline. the old route? will avoid the double crossing of the Flinders Bange, and thus enable trains to carry much greater loads of coal from Leigh Creek and other places, at considerably reduced freight charges. Like the trans-Australian railway the NorthSouth line deteriorated considerably during the war, when both lines had to carry heavy loads of men and materials. In the relatively short period since the war ended, the efforts that have been made by the Government to make up the leeway of repairs accumulated administration. I hope that in the near future the line from Port Pirie to Broken",73,Postmaster General S Department

It is of no use building railways if there is no freight for them to carry. If the Northern Territory can be developed on the lines that this Government hopes that it will be developed, there will be every justificasome money in the country areas. tion .for the completion of the line. Unfortunately, there is not sufficient time for me to deal with other matters that [ should like to mention, and I shall reserve my remarks on them until a later date. believe that the should expend a greater proportion of the funds at his disposal on the provision of better telephonic services in country areas. Many rural settlers live far from the amenities enjoyed by town people. Even in Victoria, which is a comparatively well developed State, some country people, live 20 miles or more from the nearest doctor. Most of the post offices in those areas are non-official establishments, and the telephone exchanges are closed from 12.30 p.m. on Saturdays until Monday morning, or, a I a holiday week-end until Tuesday morning at 9 o'clock, and it is impossible to make telephone calls. WhilstI should like to see the surcharge of one halfpenny on letters removed, I should rather see it retained if that would mean the provision of better services in country areas. I believe that the people of Australia generally would be quite satisfied to continue to pay the extra halfpenny if services would be improved. It is essential that automatic telephone exchanges should be established in country areas. Recently near Inglewood in Victoria, a man became ill suddenly. As the local postmaster had gone away for the weekend, as he was quite entitled to do, his friends had to travel nineteen miles to telephone for a doctor, and unfortunately the man died. member's colleagues has complained about the Government expending money in the very manner suggested by the honourable member. plained. The Government has made considerable revenue out of the Post Office in the past. I am opposed to postal revenue being paid into the Consodidated Revenue Fund.

I intend to do. The following are the terms of the letter which I intend to direct to the Prime Minister:My Dear Prime Minister: Following an interview which the Security Police had with me this afternoon, I received a letter from the Acting Director of the Commonwealth Investigation Service which reads in thc terms following. T have already read the terms of the letter to the House. The letter continuesThis letter has been considered by a joint meeting of the Opposition Parties and they have directed me to write to you in the following terms:Under the provisions of the Constitution, section 49, it is provided that the powers, priviassure him that he w ill not be allowed to leges and immunities of a member of Parliament shall be such as are declared by the Parliament, and until declared will be those of the Commons House of Parliament of the United Kingdom, and of its members and committees at tlie establishment of the Commonwealth. "" The matter which was raised by me was raised in my capacity as Leader of the Country Party. The letter which has been received by me shows that the Investigation Service is investigating a suggestion that two documents from which it is said I quoted have either been stolen or are forgeries and upon this I am said to be interrogated. Thc questions which the joint opposition parties have directed that I should place towards ypu are1. Did the investigators of this service interrogate me at your direction or at the direction of your Government? 2. Is either of the extracts which I quoted to the House, or both, admitted by your Government to be genuine extracts from any official document? If so, is it admitted that they are genuine extracts from official documents of proceedings of the British Cabinet on 8th July and of proceedings nf the Council for Scientific and Industrial Eesearch on 6th July last? 3. If they are not admitted to be genuine extracts from any such document or documents, .Tre they admitted to be genuine extracts from any other confidential documents of the Government, and, 4. If so, which? The joint parties take the view that unless the quotations I made are admitted to be genuiue extracts from genuine official confidential documents, the action of tlie Security Police is, to say the least, the grossest invasion of the freedom of speech which is accorded to members of Parliament by the ancient privileges of our Parliament, and any attempt to break down those privileges will be resisted by every means within our power. If they are not genuine extracts from genuine confidential documents, obviously no question can arise which could justify the high-handed T h a t is exactly what action which the Government has directed.

I asked the then Prime Minister, Mr Curtin, whether the publication in the House and outside the House of what the then honourable member for Maranoa claimed to be an official military document was an act of treason, if it were genuine, or was an act calculated to destroy the morale of the country, because the allegation was that many hundreds of thousands of Australians were to be left undefended. I asked the then Prime Minister to state whether such an act, calculated to destroy the morale of the country, constituted an offence against a specific statutory rule made under the National Security Act.

The reason fer its failure to do so was that the then honourable member for Maranoa was a Labour supporter. An analogy may be drawn between that incident, which occurred in war-time, and the action of the present Prime Minister in turning the secui'ity police on to one of his political opponents, because he has said something which embarrasses the Government. A week ago, the Leader of the Australian Country party ( Mr Padden) made a quotation which, he said he had been informed, was an accurate quotation of a statement made by the present Prime Minister to the British Cabinet. He invited the Prime Minister to say whether or not the quotation was accurate. A week has passed, but the Prime Minister has not uttered a word about it. He has merely turned the matter over to the security police, who are known in another country as the gestapo. The honourable member is proceeding to discuss a matter which the Chair has already ruled out of order. not discussing the question of privilege. The honourable member may not, under any pretext, discuss a matter which has been placed on the notice-paper. issue of privilege. issue may not be raised in any way.. Prime Minister on this subject can lead any reasonable man only to the conclusion that the quotation made by the Leader of the Australian Country party was an accurate quotation. The whole matter can be disposed of in a moment by the Prime Minister saying, "" The quotation was false"". He is the only man in this country who knows whether it is true or false. It is utter and arrant hypocrisy to turn the security police on to a member of this Parliament in order to discover the answer to a question which the right honourable gentleman already knows.

It is not proposed to table the papers as requested by the honourable member. the honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr Bowden) asked a question concernI am not trying to ing the hour3 of duty for light-keepers. The Minister for Shipping and Fuel has supplied the following information:Since 1930, fifteen light stations have been converted to automatic or semi-automatic, at which night watching has been discontinued and the hours of duty of attending staffs reduced to the standard applicable to other callings. It is not practicable, however, to simiI am not trying to larly reduce the hours of duty at lightstations where a continuous watch must be maintained. Two applications have been made to the of duty of light keepers since the lighthouse service was transferred to Commonwealth control in 1915, the last to the Public Service Arbitrator in 1920. On both occasions, the applications were refused. Lightkeepers are eligible for membership of the Fourth Division Officers Organization of the Department of Trade and Customs and the determination made in favour of such organization applies to them. It is open to light keepers to make a further application to the Public Service Arbitrator through their organization for a variation of their hours of duty. The majority of duties performed by light keepers are comparatively light as they consist in the main of watchkeeping, i.e., keeping a watch on the light and/or for signals from passing ships. In addition, they perform minor station maintenance duties for approximately eighteen sary. The Public Service Board has agreed to pay an allowance to light keepers, at stations where a continuous watch is necessary, who are imable to porticpate in the benefit of reduced hours which was recently granted in industry generally, and it is hoped that this matter w ill be finalized at an early date.",82,Roland S Browne Acting Director

This latter production lays emphasis on the approach which should be made to local civic authorities, commercial interest; and to the local ,press and radio. Free or sponsored advertising is an integral part of the campaign, but it is merely supplementary to the national and local coverage for which funds have been provided. In addition to the funds approved for expenditure on the national campaign which is now entering its final phase, funds have been allocated to a l l commands and militar y districts for use by units under command in order to decentralize publicity. These funds may be expended at the discretion of commands and military districts and no. requests have been received at Army Head-quarters for .additional funds.

Foodstuffs are purchased and forwarded in bulk from Australia by the "" Food for Britain"" organization and are packed in England for despatch through the Post Office. This is done in order to save freight rates and ensure that a maximum amount of foodstuffs can be made available for 10s. 2. The foodstuffs are forwarded for this specific purpose only and thc arrangement has thc approval of the British Ministry of Food. Foodstuffs are not supplied from Ministry of Food stocks but are purchased in Australia from manufacturers by the Food for Britain appeal. upon notice1. Has he seen the statement, by St.. J. E. Hoogstraten, Secretary for Economic Affairs in the Netherlands East Indies, to the effect that Anstralia formerly had a stable trade with the Netherlands East. Indies but that the trend in that country in the last three years has been to buy elsewhere! 2. Was it stated that, whereas the Netherlands East Indies formerly purchased Australian flour, that country now used American? 3. Was great damage inflicted on Australia's trade with the Netherlands East Indies as a result of the trade unions' ban on Sutch shipping? 4. Can he indicate what steps have been taken by the Government through its trade commissioner service or through other means to recapture any of this lost trade? honourable member's questions are as follows:1. I have not seen the statement by Sr. Hoogstraten, but it is true that Australia's ? ost-war trade with the Netherlands East udies has not progressed owing to shipping and other circumstances. 2. Flour importers in the Netherlands East Indies are purchasing North American flour mainly because it is cheaper, than Australian and also because of the transport difficulty. . 3. There is no doubt that trade in this area suffered by the' transport difficulty and the disturbances iu the Netherlands East Indies. Of course there has been a strong demand for Australian goods from other countries and our overall export position has not . suffered substantially, on account of the conditions applying to Netherlands East Indies. 4. A trade commissioner has been appointed 1 to Batavia and will proceed tiiere shortly. Meanwhile the Australian Consul-General in Batavia is watching Australia's trade interests in the Netherlands East Indies.",84,Akmsd Forces Militia Scrub Typhus Recruiting
