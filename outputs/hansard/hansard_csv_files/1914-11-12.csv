The Osnabruck, at the time of the service of the detention notice, was loaded with an outward cargo of Australian produce. The whole of that cargo has been discharged in Sydney, with the exception of a quantity of loose lead concentrates in powder form. MrJ . H .

15,Mr Hughes,"I am not prepared to to make any interim statement of as many of the facts as it is advisable to disclose. Attorney General is replying to a question. inquiries set on foot under the emergency legislation recently passed, it had been ascertained that the control of the market in metals had long been-to a great extent-in the hands of the Germans, or of corporations which, even when British in name, were in fact controlled and chiefly owned in Germany. It was further ascertained that this control was, in great measure, continuing after the declaration of war, and there was reason to believe that a great part of the profits of the metal trade was finding its way into German pockets; whilst there was much doubt whether adequata precautions were being taken to prevent the products themselves, which are of a kind to be of service to warlike operations, getting into enemy territory. There were also reasons for believing that attempts to trade with the enemy were being made. In time of war, when the national safety is at stake, it is not always possible to consider private feelings; and it was thought proper that the information required should be obtained by the use'of the emergency powers conferred by Parliament. The results of the inquiry cannot yet be stated, except to say that information has been obtained which justified the action taken. I hope shortly to make a fuller statement on the matter. In those cases where investigation discloses no grounds for action, the fullest publicity will be given to this fact, war, he assumes there is no architectural so that no citizen may remain unjustly under the shadow of suspicion of having in any way helped the enemy. port yet been received from Sir Maurice Eitzmaurice regarding naval bases throughout Australia, and particularly in reference to the Henderson Base at Cockburn Sound? If not, when is a report expected'( course of the. next week or two the final report of Sir Maurice Fitzmaurice will be in Australia, dealing with the whole question of the naval bases in Australia. [23] Mr J. H . CATTS -I s it a fact that the ex-Minister of Home Affairs at the end of June last called for competitive architectural designs for the Parliamentary building at the Federal capital ? Further, is it a fact that, although communications have been opened up with the Department by a number of architects in various parts of the world, and, although those architects are proceeding with the preparation of plans, the call for designs has been cancelled ? to tlie dates referred to by the honourable member, but, owing to the war, the present Government have deemed it advisable to cancel the advertisements calling for designs. As will be readily seen, the war would confine the competition almost entirely to Australians aud Americans, seeing that so many professional men of other countries are now at the front with the Allies. Mr J. H . CATTS -When will the competition be resumed? owing to the war, and, at the time, we were in hopes that the question could be re-opened at an early date. But, of course, if the war continues for any length of time-thoug h we all sincerely hope it will not-w e shall have to consider what further steps are necessary. ister of Home Affairs wish the House to understand that, because England is at ability at Home fit to compete in the designing of our parliamentary buildings? Is the Minister aware that the ex-Govern r ment architect for New South Wales calculated, thirteen years ago, that those buildings could be put up as a nucleus at a cost of £250,000 in two years and a any final rehalf. We are now in the fourteenth year of the existence of the Commonwealth ? not assume that there wero no architects in England, France, Belgium, or Germany not engaged in the war, but it did occur to me, as a matter of fairness and justice, that the younger or middle-aged men who are at the front should not be debarred from competing. thing is to be hung up?",5,Conoiliation And Arbitra

When the States federated, it was believed that a system of Inter-State Freo Trade was to be brought about; but now we see that, by means of inspection dues and by in spectors in certain States refusing to adm it goods from other States, the Federal Constitution is, to some extent, nullified. honourable member refers was taken by a Labour Government. They raised the cost of living in Western Australia. MrM c GRATH enter into that aspect of the matter. I do not think that the Liberal Government in Western Australia led by Mr Wilson came out of it too well. A t any rate, I am satisfied that the Liberal Government in Victoria have come out of the matter very badly, because it has been largely responsible for the retaliatory acts of the Western Australian Government. It allowed the potato expert to certify that certain diseased potatoes were clean and permit them to be sent to Western Australia. Certain merchants had bought these potatoes at £ 1 per ton and sold them in Western Australia at £ 4 0 per ton, and it was proved that inspectors were acting in collusion with certain agents in Victoria. thati Agriculture in Victoria, in whos3 Department the inspection is done, did his best to hush up the matter, and we were unable to ascertain all the facts. member was Premier of Victoria. many other statements you made during the elections. member was Premier of Victoria, his M in ister of Agriculture was the Hon. George Graham, and it was while he was in charge of the Department that this trick was done by an inspector and one firm in Melbourne. on the part of the Minister? The Commonwealth MrM c GRATH I say that he was lax i u regard to his duty. F u l l publicity should have been given to the matter. should make that statement out of Parliament, and see what Mr Graham would do to him. MrM c GRATH In view of Mr. Graham's experience before Judge Hodges in the Chinn case, I do not think he would say anything. of the Chinn case very well. The honourable member should be very careful about references to the Chinn case. toria are somewhat to blame for the fact that Western Australia has charged heavy I have no desire to inspection dues on Victorian potatoes. Had this inspector, and this firm to which I have alluded, been prosecuted, and f u l l publicity given to the fact that they had worked together with a view to introducing diseased potatoes into Western Australia, I do not think the Western State would have taken the action it did. Western Australia were not legal. tralian Government made a charge of 15s. per ton inspection dues. Last session, the honourable member for Wilmot and I brought up the matter in this House, and the then Minister of Trade and Customs was good enough to make representations to the Western Australian Government, so that we ultimately succeeded in having was the fee reduced to 23. 6d. per ton. labelled "" inspection dues,"" put on by the Labour Government of Western Australia. ber for Wannon, who has by interjections W h e n was it? raised the question of the increased cost of living in Western Australia, should be more careful. When the Liberal GoT h a t is about as true as vernment were in power in that State, they refused to allow any Victorian potatoes to go into consumption in Western Australia until they had first been peeled in bond, which raised the price of potatoes in Perth to £ 4 0 a ton.

Later on, inspection dues were substituted by the Labour Government. various States ar© to be permitted to charge these excessive inspection dues, we might just as well not have Inter-State Eree Trade, because the intention of the framers of the Constitution is defeated. I see no way out of the difficulty, except in the direction of the Commonwealth Government taking over the entire control of the inspection of Inter-State produce shipments. trol of the inspectors and the appointment of them. When an inspector certifies that an article is true to name and free from disease, it should be possible to send that article from one State to any other in the Commonwealth. Until we arrive at that situation we shall have, year after year, the trouble we have experienced within the last twelve months. Some six months ago a shipment of potatoes from Melbourne, certified by a local inspector to be free from disease, was declared by a Western Australian inspector, upon its arrival at Fremantle, to be affected by some disease. The shipment was consequently returned. I am not going to say upon whose shoulders the blame should be thrown, but there can be no doubt thafc both fche producer and the agent suffered a considerable loss. They acted in good faith . Believing the Victorian inspector to be competent, and acting on his certificate, they shipped these potatoes to Western Australia, where another State inspector declared that they were likely to introduce some disease into that State. I do not for one moment suggest that any produce likely to introduce a new disease should be admitted into a State. No one desires that; but there is abroad to-day an impression that if we have, say, a plentifu l supply of potatoes here, while the supply in Western Australia, let us say. for the sake of argument, is somewhat limited, influence is brought to bear upon the inspectors to declare shipments of our produce unfit to enter. There is an impression abroad that it is not so much the quality of the potatoes as the desire of a few people to control the trade of a State fchat causes trouble. I shall not further discuss the matter. We are all agreed, It h in k , that we should provide for uniform inspection. question is whether we have the constitutional power to give effect to this proposal. If we have not, then, at the next, referendum which the Labour party propose shall take place some time before the If the next general election the people should be asked to give us the necessary power. This question of inspection does not apply only to potatoes. I remember a case cited by the honourable member for W i l mot, who said that apples shipped to Sydney from Tasmania, and rejected as. diseased, were returned think. I must have made a mistake. given by the honourable member was fchat apples shipped to Sydney, rejected there, and returned to Tasmania, were placed: in fresh cases and shipped once more to> Sydney, where they were passed by the inspector who had previously condemned? them. Apples, potatoes, bacon, meat, and many other products passing from State to State are affected by fchis question of inspection. I trusb that the Minister of Trade and Customs will give serious consideration to it , and that if we have the constitutional power he w ill arrange for the Commonwealth to take over as early as possible the inspection of all goods passing between the various States. occupy a somewhat peculiar position today, since the motion submitted by the honourable member for Ballarat is identical with one that I have put before the House on several occasions during the last few years. ber was not successful. seen whether the honourable member wiU be any more successful than I have been. This movement, in which I have taken ar* active part, has, at least, met wifch some success. Last year, when Western Australia was imposing the tremendously heavy inspection charge of 15s. per ton,, the Commonwealth Government intervened, on the suggestion of myself andi other members of this Parliament, as well as members of the Tasmanian Parliament, and the Minister of Trade and Customs was instrumental in having that charge reduced to 2s. 6d. per ton. IF Parliament had been in session at the time, the then Minister would have received more credit for his action than The was actually accorded M m .

The issue, I admit, is a difficult one, but I do .not propose to discuss it at length, be--cause, as Hansard will show, I dealt with it fully in this House in 1913. I first took action in 1910; in 1913 I again brought forward this motion, but when we met early this year, private members' ""business was not dealt with, owing to the -peculiar situation in which we found ourselves prior to the double dissolution. In the circumstances I had to content myself Tby putting questions to the Minister, with the object of impressing him with the -urgency of the matter. At the opening -of the present session I gave notice of a motion similar to that now before us. 'The House, however, adjourned over the -day on which it was set down for discus-sion, and consequently the notice of motion given by the honourable member for Ballarat has secured precedence. I hope that the Minister will look seriously into this question. I do not wish him to harass *.ny State, but the time has arrived when -the interests of the producers of the Commonwealth must be more carefully studied than they have been. In good seasons, when there is no particular pest or disease effecting our produce, we do not hear much complaint; but as soon as a disease makes its appearance in one State, producers in the rest of the Commonwealth -complain if an attempt is made to land -shipments of produce from it. suggest that diseased produce should' be .admitted into any State. As a matter of ""fact, there is no trade or commerce in diseases. When produce is refused admittance into a State, and afterwards -proved to be fit for consumption, trouble is caused, the producers naturally alleging that the refusal to admit it was due to the desire to preserve the market for local -growers. Section 112 of the Constitution ireserves to the States the power of inspecworking arrangement would probably be tion, but if the power is used unreasonably or unfairly, the Commonwealth may annul the State law under which it is so used. It was considered that the Western Australian inspection fee of 15s. a ton was excessive, and the honourable member for Ballarat, when speaking on my motion in 1913, specially called attention to it as affecting growers in his district. If that fee was more than the reasonable expenses of the inspection, the Government of Western Australia acted unconstitutionally in levying it, and was endeavouring to preserve its market for its local growers, contrary to section 92 of the Constitution. Honourable members can obtain some idea of the reserve police powers of the States under section 112 by reading the reports of cases which have come before the American Courts. A very valuable opinion was given on the matter some years ago by the honourable member for Angas in connection with a South Australian question. Messrs. Quick and Garran, in their work on the Constitution, draw attention to a number of cases whicli can be consulted on this point. I shall not take up time now by referring to these cases in detail, nor by repeating what I have said on other occasions. My views are to be found on pages 2722 and 2723 of the Hansard reports of the debates in 1913. A great deal of produce now passes from State to State, and as the trade increases the importance of this inspection question increases. This Inter-State trade provides"" a great deal of employment in connection with the growing, handling, and transport of the produce. At present producers complain that they do not know how they stand. When trouble arises their business is thrown into a state of chaos. They cannot then get merchants to buy their produce, and cannot continue their farming operations without selling it. This is not good for trade, nor conducive to the harmonious relations between the States. The Minister should obtain the best opinion from the law authorities as to the position of the Commonwealth in this matter, and he should also try to get the States to come to a satisfactory arrangement between themselves. If more common-son se were displayed, a good arrived at. It is becoming easier each",11,Inter Sta Te Produce

77,Mr Atkinson',"I certainly do notyear to bring about such an arrangement, because the Directors of Agriculture of the various States meet annually to discuss questions of the character of that w it h which I am now dealing. A good deal of trouble has recently been caused by an increase in the price of bags. It has been suggested that there is a combine controlling the price. I am not aware of evidence to support that view, but if there is a combine the M in ister should make himself acquainted with the facts and remove the evil. The honourable member for Darwin, when in Tasmania some time ago, urged the farmers to vote for the referendum proposals of the Labour party, because, for one thing, the carrying of those proposals would bring about a solution of the troubles arising from the inspection of produce passing from one State to another. I challenged his statement, and have never had proof of its correctness. Having obtained advice from competent constitutional authorities, I am confident that the position would be unchanged by the carrying of the proposals referred to, unless very strong and u n f a i r action were taken by the Commonwealth against a State, action such as could hardly be expected of any Ministry. Nothing, therefore, is to be gained by postponing the settlement of this matter until the next referendum has been dealt with. If there were a special referen. dum on the question some good might result, but matters w ill not be affected by the carrying of the constitutional alterations proposed by the Labour party. I hope that, now that this matter has been introduced fro m a different quarter, the Minister will bend his energies to a serious effort, and obtain satisfaction for the deserving producers of Australia. Trade and Customs) [ 3 . 3 1 ] objection to the carrying of the motion. The inspection of produce passing from one State to another is a matter which the Commonwealth could well control, but it would be a mistake to have a double control. I am not sure that even if the Constitution were altered the States could not appoint inspectors to prevent diseased produce from entering their borders. Inspection at the port of export is not always satisfactory. Of course, if frozen meat sent from Victoria to Western Australia is good when it leaves Victoria, it will be good when it reaches Western Australia, providing that it is properly carried; but that does not hold w i th vegetables and f r u it , which may deteriorate on the voyage, and which must therefore be inspected at the port of import. I would be in favour of abolishing inspection by State officials and leaving the work wholly to Commonwealth officials. That is what has been done in connection w it h the meat inspection in Queensland, but the meat that is inspected is exported overseas. It may be news to honourable members that Tasmania sends twice as much f r u it to the mainland as she sends oversea. In 1911 her export of f r u it was about 1,500,000 cases, of which about 1,000,000 cases came to the mainland, and the remaining 500,000 were sent overseas to the United Kingdom and to foreign countries. It is a mistake to suppose that the inspection charges which were objected to have been imposed by Labour Governments. Althoughi t is a Labour Government that is now in power in Western Australia, it was an anti-Labour Government tliat imposed the inspection charge to which objection has been made. It is a mistake, in my opinion, to attempt to make party capital out of this question, because there are Statesi n which anti-Labour Governments have acted detrimentally to producers. When my predecessor was in office, there was, I think, a statement read to the House which showed what fees were then being charged. Western Australia the charge was 15s. per ton, while in other Statesi t was 6d. and Is.

Personally, I am not at all sorry that the honourable member for Ballarat has submitted the motion, which deals with the question that has been brought under our attention previously by the honourable member for Wilmot. understand it ; but, as I said before, my opinion is that of a layman. If it is possible for the Commonwealth to control the work without this leading to duplication, I am in favour of an amendment of the Constitution to that end; but, otherwise, it would be better to try to arrange with the States for a more satisfactory method of inspection. -This is a perennial question; but the discussions have undoubtedly resulted in a proximation of charges, and an approach to the ideal we all desire. The Minister of Trade and Customs has expressed the opinion that the Commonwealth cannot take control without an alteration of the Constitution; and he has evidently forgotten that on the 14th August, 1910, he said in this HouseI consulted the Attorney-General as to whether we had the power to do what is proposed without an amendment of the Constitution, and I helieve that, not only my honourable colleague, but his predecessor, the honourable member for Angas, agreed that it was quite possible that we had that power, and could exercise it, by legislation, without an alteration of the Constitution. Undoubtedly the Commonwealth has complete control over Inter-State trade and commerce. At the same time, there is reserved to the States a complete police* power to protect plants, animals, andi. In Western Australia the charges people within their own areas. No matter what alteration of the Constitution"" might be made, the people would resist very strenuously any attempt to take away that power. Our experiencein connection with ""small-pox has shown the absolute necessity of local assistance as well as Eederal control. But, as regards this particular matter, I think the Minister is quite right in sayingthat we ought to get the State Ministers 1 to meet together and to try to make their regulations approximate as closely as possible, not merely in regard to the question of charges, but also in regard to the methods of inspection, so that there might be mutual recognition of certificates. Wecannot escape from the fact that the States are very much concerned as regards the spread of disease within their own borders, and when we consider that a State like Western Australia or Queensland comprises an area equal to that of several of the other States put together^ I have stated the position as I we must recognise that to such States the prevention of the spread of disease presents a very big problem indeed. They have their own staffs for the prevention' of such disease within their own areas,, and what we require to do is to link up the administrationI am speakingparticularly of New South Wales and Queensland-so that there may be mutual co-operation between the States to prevent the spread of disease. My opinion in regard to the charge fixed in Western Australia-and I expressed it at the time-wa s that it was. excessive. Section 112"" of the Constitution is perfectly clear that, the States can only make inspection charges on goods passing into or going out of States. I sent several despatches with a view to getting the Western Australian Government to let us know the exact cost of inspection. This we found them reluctant to give us. At last Mr Bath, the then Minister for Lands, and I met in Melbourne, and we agreed that the Commonwealth and State officers should examine on the spot the whole of the charges and ascertain what the Western Australian Government were actually expending and receiving for inspection.

State, but was -debiting those goods with the cost of the prevention of the spread of disease within the State. The Western Australian Government were practically making the .Inter-State traffic bear the cost of administration of the whole of their internal inspection. That was a wrong principle, and no State Government had the light to do that. They undoubtedly had a right to make any other regulations they thought necessary to prevent the spread -of disease from Victoria to Western Australia, and I informed Mr Bath that as long as the State of Western Australia was exercising those powers with all reasonable caution for the purpose of protecting its own farmers, no other portion -of Australia had a right to complain. -So long as those charges represented a just exercise of the inspection law they were legitimate, but no State had the right to set up a protective law under the guise of an inspection law. nexion with the inspection of apples, I know; but I managed to get those restrictions modified, and, in effect, the attitude effective system.

The honourable member is looking at the question from the point of view of one who is in a State which desires to export potatoes to another State. The producers in Victoria felt the pinch, rightly I admit, of tlie restrictive laws of another State. But one must also look at the question from another point of view when dealing with a proposition like this. Suppose that Victoria were threatened with the introduction of a disease from another State, say, for instance, the tick from Queensland, or the fruit fly pest from that State. ral officers be just as strict as the State officers ? the whole system of the inspection and eradication of disease within a State is largely based in the first instance on internal administrationy The States must have complete machinery within their own borders to prevent the spread of any disease from one part of a State to another part, and I think that the continuance of State inspection should be found to be the most more than mere inspection; they"" have the power to follow a disease up and eradicate it .

The Minister says that it is not wise to unduly duplicate the inspections. I say that it is not necessary to do that until we have absolute proof that the existing system is a complete failure. There have been several cases in which friction has arisen, but the trouble has not been so great as to lead to a break-down of the existing system.

As .one representing a farming and grazing district, I think that the scope of the proposal might well have been extended, and I suggest that the honourable member should in clude after the word "" p r o d u c e "" the words "" and stock,"" because I think it would be well to have the one set of in spectors to do the work of inspecting both produce aud stock passing from could you State to State. Of course we are u p against tlie Constitution. It would be well if the Government would take caref u l notice of this matter, and bring it before the next Premiers' Conference. The subject might, with great advantage to the producers, be discussed by the Premiers, and if we can get their sympathy the presence of and their undertaking to bring the subject before their respective Parliaments we might arrive at some scheme of co-ordination between the States* I recollect, some four vears ago, attending a very influential Farmers and Settlers' Conference in New South Wales, and resolutions very similar to this motion were introduced and agreed to by the conference unanimously. I reWe undoubtedly member also hearing of one case in which a farmer present at the conference had sent 6 tons of potatoes to Deniliquin from Millthorpe, near Orange. Before those potatoes could reach Deniliquin they had to pass through Albury, vid Echuca. A t that particular time Victoria was suffering from the Irish blight, and, so far as the State of New South Wales was concerned, the whole of Victoria was quarantined, although the blight affected only fche potato-growing districts, particularly I think that the last Warrnambool. These particular potatoeswere not affected by blight, but just because they had passed through a few miles of Victorian territory they were considered to be blight-stricken, and were A t the same condemned. It is high time we had an alteration of that state of affairs. The same regulations apply to Queensland aa regards stock. We know that only certain portions of Queensland are affected by the cattle tick, but all cattle coming from thafc State into New South Wales have to be dipped. If these regulations were brought under the control of the ComI symmonwealth, the inspectors would see that cattle and potatoes coming from affected areas were treated and came under the quarantine supervision. For that reason, I think that Federal control would be a good thing. The producers seem to be under great disabilities in connection with fche disposal of their produce. The different Chambers of Commercei n the respective States make varying regulations which are hard to conform to. Producers may be conforming to the regulations in New South Wales, but when their produce reaches Victoria or South Australia it comes under different regulations.",16,Inter Sta Te Produce

I would like the Minister of Trade and Customs to give some little consideration to the importation of sacks and jute goods from India. exactly the same for wheat sacks from India, though there are four or five different qualities. Some sacks are very good, but others are very poor, yet all cost the same. If the Minister of Trade and Customs oould arrange to have some uniformity in the quality of the imported sacks, the agricultural community would be very pleased. As the Minister has supervision over all imports, he could stipulate that all sacks should be properly labelled according to standard. I base my support to the motion mainly on the report of the Royal Commission ozi the Fruit Industry, which travelled through the States, and of which I was a member. The Minister of Trade and Customs has now an excellent opportunity of introducing a reform in regard to the inspection of produce. At present we operate under six different State laws, and the work of inspecting produce cannot be carried out under six conflicting State laws without some infringement of the principle of Inter-State Free Trade. When the Fruit Commission visited Queensland complaints were made by banana shippers that other States were using their powers of inspection almost to the extent of excluding bananas. For instance, bananas certified to in the northern ports of Queensland as clean were condemned on reaching Sydney or Melbourne. particularly against Melbourne. plaint made before the Royal Commission was by a grower who had sent down a large consignment to Sydney, which was apparently condemned because the bananas were carried in a vessel which also carried frui t supposed to be affected by fruit-fly. Complaints arr also brought against Victoria just as acutely. On the other hand, in Victoria there were grave complaints made about the inspection of potatoes sent to Queensland. The operation of conflicting State laws, and the lack of uniformity in regard to inspection, does not give people faith in the pretution. If we have the necessary power, sent system. Probably double inspection is required in regard to half the amount of perishable produce sent from one State to another, in order that disease may not bftransmitted from one State to the other; but in regard to the other half, especially in regard to certain classes of We pay fruit, inspection and certificate given at the port of shipment should be sufficient. there should be no double inspection unless the shipment is challenged? be taken from one State to another, fruitfly particularly. In one State there is inspection under certain laws. In another State, at the port of entry, the form of inspection is very rigid and under a different set of laws. However, I do not think that the States will object to having their powers of inspection taken from them. fruit-growers would hail with satisfaction tbe establishment of uniform inspection laws. By accepting the present proposal the trouble will only be met half way. Under the various Vegetable Diseases Acts in the States there are varying forms of inspection of orchards; all sorts of liberties are taken in one State as against another; therefore a uniform system of inspecting orchards and dealing with diseases in orchards would be acceptable to the fruit growers. no power to do that. the Commonwealth takes over the task of inspecting produce, it will deal with the Inter-State shipments only, which is really the only part with which we can deal; but in regard to the export nf frui t trouble has arisen through the division of supervision among .the States. Chaos and confusion prevail in regard to the export of fruit to the oversea countries, as well as in regard to the inspection of perishable produce passing from one State to another, and, all this is brought about by divided autliority. The only cure is for the Commonwealth to assume control of the inspection, as well as the absolute control of the export of fruit.

I trust that the M in ister wil l have the question thoroughly investigated, so that he w ill have some basis to go on. Another reason why the duty of inspection should be taken over by the Commonwealth is that the different States use their powers for the purpose of defeating the Federal principle of Inter-State Free Trade. I hope that the House w ill agree to the motion, and that the Minister w ill give the matter his i m Bureau of Agriculture under the Commediate attention, and that if the Constitution empowers h i m to take over the duties of inspection the instruction of the House, by the passing of this motion, w ill be held to be sufficient warrant for him to take action at the earliest possible moment. hope that the House will not agree to the motion. I can quite understand honourable members who represent electorates in States where there is abundance of diseases amongst f r u it and potatoes asking that some new control of inspection should be given, and I can understand their complaints about the administration of several of the States; but there is no doubt that, if the Constitution has been infringed by a State imposing excessive charges for inspecting produce, there is an ample power already possessed by the Minister of Trade and Customs. It has already been shown that, though the Western Australian Government imposed an inspection fee of 15s. per ton on potatoes, on representation being made to him, the Minister of Customs in the last A d ministration had the fee reduced to 2s. 6d. per ton. Apparently f u l l power is vested in the Commonwealth to control a State imposing excessive charges. tain that States which are clean and free from diseases in vegetables and f r u it would raise very strenuous objections to the control of shipments being vested entirely in the Commonwealth. Take, for instance, the occasion when Irish blight was somewhat bad in the eastern States, and there was an interdiction upon the entry of their produce into Western Australia. A t that time. I discussed the matter with Professor Lowrie, and he was most emphatic in the assertion that if Western Australia was to be kept clean, potatoes infected with Irish blight should not be permitted to enter the State. deal with that matter? State officers could do it better. has no Department which could efficiently control a matter of this sort. To go into an avenue of this kind we would need an A g r i cultural Bureau, and experts on this particular question. AB ill for the purpose of establishing a Bureau of Agriculture was brought forward last session, bufc was not passed. Until we have an efficient monwealth, and officers who can advise us on all these subjects, it would be a very great mistake to ask that the Commonwealth should have fche sole power of the inspection of perishable produce. The Minister has ample power now in regard to any State imposing excessive charges. On the other hand, I feel that any State is justified in attempting to prevent another State where there is a vegetable disease from sending to it produce affected by that disease. I hope that the motion will not be agreed to. [4.17] -This question has been discussed in the House on many occasions. While any State, by quarantine methods or by local Statutes, can prevent another State from sending its produce into that State, there is no Federation, and there is no Inter-State Free Trade. The essence of Federation is that there should be free interchange between all States of all their products. Why shouI3 the Commonwealth inspectors wish to allow diseased produce of any kind to pass from one State to another? If they did such a thing, it would be the mission of the Commonwealth to put them in gaol. But how are we to ascertain wliether we I am cerhave the necessary power unless we take over the work and allow the State concerned to go to the High Court and test our action? The only way in ' which we know that a law exists is by breaking it . When the Commonwealth Bank was first organized, it was said that it would have to operate under the State laws, and that cheques upon the bank would have to be printed with duty stamps upon them. The late A t torney-General, however, upset that view. I heard able and eminent solicitors and barristers declare that the Commonwealth could not avoid paying this State tax upon the cheques of the Commonwealth Bank, and business men all over Australia were put to the expense of pay-",18,Inter Sta Te Produce

The Commonwealth should take over this inspection of Inter-State produce at once, and declare that the States do not possess the power to carry out the work. Then let the States go to the High Court and test the matter. should take over the inspection. Not to do this is trifling with the matter. Fancy Western Australia imposing an inspection fee of 15s. per ton! 2s. 6d. per ton. cause a good Christian State Government saw fit to reduce the charge. That State could have charged an inspection fee of £10 per ton. and Customs compelled the State Govei'nment to reduce the charge. duced by the State Government. The Minister tells us that he has no power. I hold, however, we should take over the inspection of produce, and allow any State which feels dissatisfied to test our action in the High Court. Lawyers in the House will tell honourable members of a famous case in which a butcher was arrested for sending meat from Ohio into Minnesota without a licence, and was sentenced to a term of imprisonment. On appeal to the Supreme Court of the TJnited States of America, however, the conviction was quashed, and it was declared that the State of Minnesota had no power to interfere with. Inter-State Free Trade. The State of Tennessee also passed a law requiring representatives of life insurance companies from other States to pay a licence of 50 dollars. That, too, was declared by the Supreme Court of the TJnited States of America to be a violation of Inter-State rights. honourable member say that no State has a right to shut out diseased produce? has power to prevent the introduction of healthy produce from another State, and it is the duty of the Commonwealth to appoint inspectors to see that all produce passing from one State to another is healthy. Our Constitution is largely a copy of that of the TJnited States of America. If it is not, then why do we want a referendum with a view of bringing it more into line with the Canadian Constitution, under which we have a centralized form of government? During the Convention debates, in which the honourable member for .Angas took a prominent The Commonwealth part, it was strongly urged that the States should surrender as little as possible of the power they possessed. They agreed to surrender, amongst other things, the power to impose Inter-State barriers, and out of the powers which they gave up the Commonwealth was formed. The Commonwealth is not a new territory; it is only, so to speak, an aggregation of the powers which the States saw fit to surrender. The Commonwealth, then, is simply the dome of the States, and no State has the right to interfere with the principle of Inter-State Free Trade. Past Governments have positively neglected a duty they owe to the people in failing to see that the powers of the Commonwealth in this respect are fully exercised. States are operating different laws. We have no Federation except in name, and shall have none until the old State politicians have been dead and buried forty or fifty years. There was really no Federation in the TJnited States until after the Civil War. The arbitrament of war cemented the Federation. Prior to that one would hear a man say, "" I am a Kansas man,"" while another would declare "" I am a Kentuckian."" In the same way most of the battles in this House are between Victoria and New South Wales, and occasionally Tasmania drops in. Why talk about the powers we havel Why not test them? When Roosevelt was President of the United States of America, he was interviewed by John Mitchell in regard to the great colliery the strike in Pennsylvania, involving the employment of 400,000 men. It was pointed out to Roosevelt that the colliery-owners would not even meet the men to discuss the dispute, and he was asked to intervene.

He announced further that, as soon as this application was made, he proposed to dispossess both the owners and the workers; that the Government would take possession of the mines under martial law, and work them. The mine-owners very quickly settled the dispute. And so, I say, let us test our powers regarding these matters, instead of merely talking about them. Let us take action, so that our powers may be tested. Why is it that a champion like Jack Johnson can lick all his opponents? Isi t not because they are frightened of him before they start to fight? It was said that I had no power to do many things that I did do as a Minister; but everything came out all right.

The object in view is that the method of election to the Senate shall be such as will give representation to effective parties in proportion approximately to their comparative strengths as apparent at the polls. Our parliamentary institutions are, happily, democratic in principle; but I do not think they are, as yet, absolutely democratic in operation. There is, perhaps, no word whose significance is more abused in application or so ill-defined as the word "" democratic,"" and I certainly shall not attempt to define it to-day. I think I may say, however, that we can sometimes tell what a thing is by stating what it is not. We can at least indicate in that way what it is. 1 hold that democratic representation does not exist in a Parliament unless that ""Parliament is really approximately a reflex of the popular mind. I think it was Burke who said, applying his principles rather to his aspirations than to reality, that the virtue, spirit, and essence of the House of Commons was that it was an express image of the feelings of the nation. So far as the best method of election can secure it, Parliament should reflect the leading lines-no t all the lines, because some education has to be carried on before a party attains that magnitude which entitles it to representation-of popular opinion. We ought to aim at, not only majority rule, but minority representation. That principle of government has received the endorsement of not only thinkers and economists like Mill, and historians with the wide range of Lord Acton, but men like the Chartist, Ernest Jones, who, in 1867, in his celebrated reply to the great protagonist of Conservatism, Professor Blackie, said, pointing out the necessity of having a fair balance of all the parties in the by Sir ROBEBT State in Parliament, that Democracy meant the rule, not of a class, but of a nation-that it tempers one class by another. The freest and most democratic of Governments require the corrective of an intelligent and The check is more necessary really in the case of a Democracy than under an autocratic difliculty with the head of a State who thinks that he has in himself all power. There are very few instances-w e have, perhaps, one at the present time in Europe, and Louis XIV . was another -of monarchs who thought that they were the embodiment of all political and human wisdom, or who, at all events, laid claim to embodying in themselves the general consensus of popular opinion. But I think I may say, without any invidious comparisons of parties, that almost every majority that comes into power believes that it contains in itself the very last word of human wisdom aa conceived by the electors who returned it. It can be shown that a majority, almost from its traditionary methods, one might say, regards itself as above opinion, and as being entitled to press power to",20,Inter Sta Te Produce

It is necessary, therefore, that there should be a healthy minority in each House, and that representation should be based numerically on the apparent strength of the parties in the State. Bagot says that a popular Government is the most sternly stupid of all Governments to what is unheard by the deciding classes. in the Commonwealth there is some danger of the dominance of majorities increasing, and of the weakness of minorities becoming more pronounced. Parties here are being cast on Continental lines. That involves an immense subordination of sometimes healthy individual opinion to the interests of party union. able member recognise that there are only two parties in this Parliament, whereas in some Continental countries there are half-a-dozen ? member been listening, he would know that referred to that fact. I have said that Continental lines, and that that involves a tremendous subordination of individual opinion to the interests of party. In the circumstances, we require, more than do small communities, the check of a healthy criticism w it h in Parliament. Let me, on this point, give a quotation from Lord Acton's essays on liberty. Lord Acton is a man who writes in a temper we can all commend, whatever difference may exist between us as regards the method of applying our principlesThe one pervading evil of Democracy is the tyranny of the majority, or, .rather, of that party, not always the majority, tliat succeeds, hy force or fraud, in carrying elections. To break off that point is to avert the danger. The common system of representation perpetuutcs the danger. Unequal electorates afford no -security to majorities, equal electorates none to minorities. Thirty-five years ago it was pointed out that the remedy is proportional representation. It is profoundly democratic, for it increases the influence of thousands who would otherwise have no voice in the government, and it brings men more near an equality by so contriving that no vote shall be wasted, nnd that every voter shall contribute to bring into Parliament a member of his own opinions, 'rhe origin of the idea is variously claimed. It really does not matter much what was the origin of a good thing, so long as we .are privileged to enjoy it . present method. able member has an immense reserve of reason which he does not always make apparent, and I am trying, by appealing to it , to bring it into force. An y party that is large enough to have a quota of representation ought to get it . As regards the Senate, I think that proportional representation would mean that, with six places to be filled, any party that had one-seventh of the total votes cast would be represented, or, with three places to be filled, any party that had a. fourth of the votes cast would be represented. In 1859 proportional representation was first mooted by Mr Hare, in his celebrated work on representation, time. We always attempt, by some i m perfect method, to attain a good thing, and the attempt was made in England to obtain a solution of the difficulty caused H a d the honourable by the occasional disfranchisement of minorities or the too great representaI have already inferentially tion of majorities by the establishment of three-member districts, and the casting parties here are drawn on of two votes. Buti n 18S5 these were abolished, and one-member districts were established. The Proportional Representation Society then commenced its propaganda, and this resulted in the Imperial Commission of 1908. That Commission presented its report in 1910. It stated that proportional representation was practicable, and, for second Chambers and municipal councils, sound; but the majority was against the present adoption of the system for the House of Commons. The minority took exception to that pronouncement as not being within the limits of the Commission's authority. The Commission recommended the adoption of the principle for the I r is h Senate, each of the I r is h provinces to be a division. That recommendation was adopted unanimously by a resolution of the House of Commons, and has been embodied in the I r is h Home EuleB ill , which has been passed into law, and is to come into operation when the war is over. There was also a resolution carried embodying the recommendation that any constituencies returning three or more members to the House of Commonsi n Ireland should vote on the principle of proportionate representation.

According to a pamphlet which reached me a few week3 ago, a resolution has been carried in the Dominion Legislature of SouthA f r i ca affirming that the principle should be applied to all elections for the two Dominion Houses, some reasonable provision being made for a modification to cover what were thought to be the necessities of sparsely-populated districts. We have, therefore, the application of the principle to existing Legislatures within the B r i tish Empire, and the recommendation of its application to some of the most authoritative. I notice that Switzerland proposes to take a referendum this year-it may have been already taken-as to whether the principle of proportional representation shall be applied to the Federal elections there. Honourable members know that they seldom refuse to accept sound constitutional amendments Switzerland, whatever fate may be meted oufc to occasional legislative proposals submitted for approval. long time to make up their mind. matters.

That is as true of elections here as of elections at Home. Mr Fisher Williamscalled attention to the matter in a recent book on proportional representation. Here are a few figures which are significant of the difference between the results of proportional representation and voting in single member districts. In 1900 the Conservatives in Great Britain obtained a majority of 134 by the single-seat system, but under the system of proportional representation their major i ty would have been two only. In 1906 the Liberals had a majority of 356, whichunder the principle of proportional representation should have been 114, and, in the December election of 1910, they had a majority of 126, which should have been 38. There might have been influenceswhich would have somewhat modified these results had proportional voting actually taken place, but approximately they in are correct. L e t us now consider theworking of the block vote in regard toour Senate elections. Generally it is truethat if parties are solid, and one has a L i k e us, they take a slight numerical advantage, it will alwayscarry the Senate seats.

158,Mr Glynn,"dispute. That was not a true representation of the public feeling, and was, therefore, not a democratic result. In 1913 Labour polled 2,895,043 votes for the Senate, and the Liberal party 2,857,152; Labour having a majority of 37,891 votes, eleven seats going to Labour candidates, and seven to Liberal candidates, which was proportionately unfair. A t the last election Labour Senate candidates and Liberal candidates, 5,499,231 votes, a majority of 735,647 for the Labour party, which thus gained thirty-one seats, the other five going to the Liberals. Honourable members w ill admit that that was not a true reflex of public opinion as expressed by the numbers at the poll. About the others who did not vote we need not care twopence; if a man does not exercise the franchise it is not for h i m to grumble, and only in those who take an interest in the elections should we display any concern. The present system, both in the House of Representatives and the Senate, enables, as I said before, a very small number of the electors sometimes to change the whole character of the legislative power. Let me now refer to the Senate. As matters stand, the Senate does not realize any true conception of what a Senate ought to be. In operation, it is not a State House, and I never believed that it was to be a State House. The late Mr Kingston and myself, throughout the Conventions, argued, and voted in accordance with our opinion, that the justification for equality of representation, in which I firmly believed, was not that the Senate was to work as a State House, but simply that the preponderance of numerical power, as expressed in its representation, should to some extent be modified by some State colour when occasion required. A t the same time, we held that in effect it would operate not as a State House, but as a national or party House. Convention were not with you. ence is more potent than the opinion of legislators. On the question of the powers of the Senate, Mr Kingston, Mr John Henry of Tasmania, a few others, and myself voted to deny the second Chamber the same financial power as was possessed by the popular House; and that, of course, is the principle of the nnancial relations of the two Houses. On the question of the double dissolution I pressed, against a somewhat reluctant Convention in three sessions that for reasons which are quite applicable to this question as to the powers of the Senate, the method for the settlement of a deadlock ought to be the double dissolution. I do not think I have ever spoken on the polled 6,234,878 votes, question of the double dissolution in the House; but it is strange that the proposal for it was pressed by me right to the end, and ultimately moved by, I think, Mr Wise. I pointed out that the Senate, would really operate as a party House, and not as a State House; and, therefore, it was ridiculous for the smaller States to think that, unless there were to be a dissolution of the House of Representatives first, the power of the smaller States would be neutralized. However, this is what I said of the Federal system in one debate at the Convention : I say it is a mixed principle in its organization and a unification in its powers. In its essence it is a unification in its purposes. That is the principle of Webster, and the principle of the interpretation of the Constitution. I went on to sayFederation was a consolidation having imposed upon it the check of an Upper House with equal representation. . . . In my opinion the practical result of the operation of the Constitution will be a unification with a large measure of protection for local interests, through the principle of equal representation in the SenateI believe that the legislation of the Federal Parliament will be mostly in matters of general policy, and not in one case in a thousand in matters touching State interests. And I think that is about what it is. WhatI and Mr Kingston also impressed on the Convention was that we should give all parties a fair representation in the Senate, to l i m it the financial powers of that House, and to prevent too great a pressure of numbers through the equality of representation. I know; but experimember think that the Senate is required at all? question which would take me beyond the limits of my subject, though I have my own opinion regarding it .

162,Mr Glynn,"I am not going into aa House of neither revision nor criticcism. terialists, who, I say, w it h the greatest respect, have on some points, to some extent, their opinions forestalled by the decisions of their party, or, at all events, by the preconceptions of the House of Representatives as registered in the motions and Bills sent up. On the other hand, there are five critics, animated by the most extraordinary fortitude, and with a hope, that is almost forlorn, of bringing the pressure of what they consider to be common sense to bear on the dissertations of Ministers and their followers. The result is that the Senate now seems to be nothing more than, I debating society, but a Chamber for the re-statement of foregone conclusions. I was inclined to quote from a German authority, Prince Bulow, but I am rather afraid to do so under the circumstances. even of our enemy; and I am not quite in agreement with some people, who probably have not read Prince Bulow's works, as to the temper of some of his more recent writings. He is not a writer like Bernhardi, nor of the school of whicli Treitschke is the leading historian. Speaking of parties, Prince Bulow, in Imperial Germany, in 1914, saidThat the varied life of a nation, ever changing, every growing more complicated, cannot be stretched or squeezed to fit a programme or a political principle. . . . number of events in public life cannot be included even in the comparatively comprehensive programmes, nor can Conservatives and Liberals hold different views with respect to them. This bears out what I said, namely, that the division of parties on lines involves an immense suppression of individual opinion within any party. to the methods of election, I suggest a single transferable method that is recommended by the Commission; and, perhaps, I might be justified in giving just one quotation from the report of that body. The principle is that each elector shall have only one vote, but that he shall mark his preference numerical order from one to six. He will pick out his party first in order of preference; and there may be men outside of his party for whom, if he finds it impossible for the last choice in his party to get returned, he would like to vote. Mr Glynn. But not a vote he casts for any one in There are thirty-one Ministhat way can possibly touch or affect any others first on the list, so we have absolutely unfettered preference in regard to the elector's own party, w it h the power of expressing preference for others outside. The surplus votes that are cast for those who first obtained a quota are transferred to others according to the preference laid down. This is the principle recommended by the Commission:The elector votes by placing the figure 1 opposite the name of the candidate he likes best, and is invited to place the number 2 opposite the name of his second choice, the number 3 opposite his third choice, and so on, numbering as many candidates as he pleases. should be sorry to say, a mere The Returning Officer ascertains the result of the election as follows :1. He counts each ballot-paper as one vote to the candidate marked 1 thereon; he also counts the total number of votes. 2. He ascertains the quota. I speak w it h some respect 3. He declares elected the candidates who have received the quota. 4. He transfers in strict proportions the surplus votes of those candidates who have received more than the quota, and credits them to the unelected candidates indicated by the figures 2, 3, and so on, as the next preferences of the electors whose votes are transferred. 5. He declares elected those candidates who, after the transfer of surplus votes, have obtained the quota. S. Ho eliminates the candidates lowest on the poll one after another by transferring their votes in accordance with the wishes of their supA large porters to the candidates indicated as next preferences. This process is continued until the required number of candidates, having each obtained the quota, have been declared elected, or Cfie number of candidates not eliminated is reduced to the number of seats still vacant, Continental in which event the candidates not eliminated are declared elected. As That is the principle. The quota is the Droop quota, which enables the smallest vote. That is the number possible to get a representation in the Senate. The Droop quota is attained by dividing one more than the number of vacancies to be filled into the total number polled, and adding one to the result. In other words, if 240,000 votes are in polled, and there are three vacancies-as usually occurs for the Senate-on e more than the number of vacancies is four, and that, divided into 240,000, gives 60,000, which, with the one added, shows a Droop quota of 60,001. It is quite clear that any man who gets 60,001 votes cannot be beaten by any one else, and, therefore, that number returns one member. We have the effect that at an election where there are three vacancies, instead of the whole of the vacancies-as at the last Federal Senate election-goin g to one party, any party which has one more than a fourth of the total number of the seats. The question arises, what has to be done with the surplus over the quota? Tho Commission recommend transferring it to the persons who are next in order of choice, according to the indicated order, but transferring those surplus votes in the proportion in which there are second choices on all the votingpapers of the returned candidate, whose surplus is being dealt with. There are second choices expressed in the total of the voting-papers for the candidates who have attained a quota. This method is mathematically correct; but it is not necessary to explain it ; we can tell the time without knowing the mechanism of the clock. But supposing, for instance, that there is a surplus over the 60,001 of 10,000 votes, and that amongst the next choices tliere is one man who has foursixths of these choices on all the voting-papers of the returned candidate, and another man has two-sixths. In such case this surplus of 10,000 is to be divided between these men in the proportion of four-sixths and two-sixths, which votes, and apportions them on a strictly mathematical basis. It is not necessary, however, to be so strict as that. Bills have recently been introduced into the British House of Commons, and these bear the democratic name of Snowden, together with that of Chiozza Money, Lord Robert Cecil, and others as backers of the Bills. One was for proportional representation for the House of Commons, introduced in 1913, and the other was applying the same principle to municipal elections. There they do not count all the surpluses, because there are times when the counting of the surpluses cannot make an appreciable difference in the order in which the remaining candidates, who have not obtained the quota, stand on the list. Therefore it is provided thatA transfer of votes under this rule shall and even that number was chiefly due to not be made unless the surplus votes of the the voter being compelled to record three elected candidate, together with any other choices. I do not believe in compulsion surplus votes not transferred, exceed the difference between the total votes of the tworemaining candidates. When, in 1909, I helped to d r a f t a B ill to give preferential voting to the House of Representatives and proportional representation for the Senate, it was suggested that the method which is now incorporated in these Bills, and was prevotes ' cast must get one of viously incorporated in municipal Bills, might be adopted for economizing time in transferring the votes when it was imposside for tlie result to be affected. To summarize, the short cuts were these1. Instead uf distributing all the ballot papers of a candidate who has a surplus, but at a fractional value, actual ballot-papers are distributed, selected according to rule, equal in number to the surplus. 2. So as not to complicate the counts, small surpluses are not distributed when it is mathematically impossible for the result to be affected. 3. Two or more candidates may be excluded at a single process when it is mathematically impossible for the result to be affected. 4. The result may be declared without further transfers whenever it is impossible for further transfers to affect the result. The effect, I believe, would be to very greatly expedite .tlie actual count. It may be said that if we apply this to the Senate we may delay undulv the counting of the Senate poll. I have mentioned that in Ireland they are to adopt the principle, and apply it to each province, and Ireland has a population about the same as that of Australia. In Tasmania, in 1901, the practically absorbs the total Senate candidates were elected as a whole on the principle of proportional representation. The election took place on Two the 29th March, and the poll was declared on the 5th A p r i l . That was pretty good counting, but, of course, the number of votes polled was comparatively small. The ballot-papers amounted to only 18,403, the'quota was 3,067, and the number of invalid votes was only 419 5 a very small proportion, I think , actually smaller than the average cast at the ordinary elections for the whole of the State. As a matter of fact, at the present time 85 per cent, of the results of the Senate are known on the Monday following the elections. I may mention, also, that in the application of this system to the State elections in Tasmania today, the proportion of the informal votes is comparatively small. I believe that at the last State election it was only 2.87, in this matter, and I can see that it works badly. Mr J-IA.IRD SMITH dead-lock. and may defeat the end which it is in have' all parties represented proportiontended to accomplish. However, the proally. portion of informal votes was very small, are and the report says that even that numshare of ber was largely due to compelling the follow the course of education u n t i l elector to exercise three alternative they can prevail upon the masses to choices.

It is a very old subject with me. In 1899 I introduced a measure into ths Victorian Legislative Assembly for providing a system of electing members to the Commonwealth Parliament. It had become the responsible duty of the various State Parliaments to prescribe the means of electing the members of the first Commonwealth Parliament, and the Bill that I introduced had three objects. First of all, it provided for the limitation of election expenses; secondly, it divided the State of Victoria into single electorates for the election of members of the House of Representatives, and it proposed that the method of election should be the process of preferential voting; thirdly, it proposed that the candidates for the Senate should be elected by the system of proportional voting. urgently on the attention of the Victorian State Parliament, but that body considered that the preferential voting and proportional representation were rather too academic, and that there had not been sufficient experience of them to recommend them, so far as the election of Commonwealth legislators was concerned. It is with great pleasure that I now find the same old subject recalled by the motion brought before the House by my honourable and learned friend. Above all things we should make our electoral law as non-party in its character as possible. The aim and object of both sides of the House should be to secure more perfect representation of the people, and thus make Parliament more effective, and to avoid persons sitting in Parliament elected by minorities. The outstanding object of the system of proportional representation, as has been well demonstrated by the various examples submitted by tlie mover of the motion, is the securing of majority rule, and the representation of substantial minorities, and the process by' which this can be achieved has been demonstrated as mathematically and scientifically correct. If that object can be secured, we are more and more perfecting our system of reSir Robert Best. presentation, and giving greater force to Parliament itself, making it in a higher degree a reflex of the people's opinions. The fairThe anxiety of honourable members should be to secure a Parliament faithfully representing public opinion, and the voice of the people in proportionate strength. I think it will appeal to the minds of most men that it is obviously unfair that the whole of the representation should be secured by one partyj while a substantial minority, almost equal in power to the majority, is practically unrepresented. But such a result is achieved by the block system, which only requires good organization and the preponderance of a very limited majority ""to secure the whole of the representation. Such a system is a menace to representative government, and we should be very loth to tolerate such a condition of affairs. The honourable member for Boothby, speaking in a non-party spirit in regard to the matter, has demonstrated that he simply aims at perfecting representative government, and that should be the outstanding object of honourable memI pressed this last matter very bers. brought down last year contain any of the principles embodied in the motion? as a member of the party then in power I was quite prepared, if that Bill had been dealt with by the Opposition in a more non-party spirit, to have moved the .necessary amendments in order to secure the system which my learned friend is seeking to bring about by the motion now before the House. However, no matter what has been done in the past, we can all agree on these premises, that our chief aim and object should be the perfection of our electoral law, and if the fact that the system of proportionate representation is fair to the people, and has for its object the greater perfection of our system of representative government, is demonstrated, those who are now in a majority can afford to be generous and magnanimous by taking steps to achieve the object to which I have already referred.

Speaking subject to correction, and roundly, for the two elections about 9,750,000 votes were recorded-that is, for the election of the 13th April, 1910, and the election of the 31st May, 1913, which two elections constituted the Senate as it existed during the last Parliament. The Labour party in those two elections had an insignificant preponderance of 30,000 or 40,000 votes; but the actual resuit of the election was that the Labour party secured twenty-nine seats as against seven seats which was the extent of the representation of the Liberals in the Senate, though the votes were practically equal. Ministerial side would willingly introduce a law which would have that result. sentation is always advocated by your party when in Opposition. to the menace to representative government as demonstrated by the figures to which I have referred, it is our duty to realize the difficulties brought about by the existing system, and secure a more perfect system. My friend has reproached me with the fact that our party has never, when in power, moved in the direction of securing a system of proportional representation. He is incorrect. sought to introduce the system in 1902-3. The late Mr Justice O'Connor then submitted to the Senate proposals for proportional representation, and I and a number of other members of the Liberal party supported him. It is, therefore, not correct to suggest that we have never attempted to bring this system into force. they could not carry it. carry it, but were unsuccessful. On the occasion of the last election the Leader of our party announced that, if returned, his Government would introduce a Bill to provide for proportional representation.

I am not dealing with this question from a party standpoint. I am merely supporting a system which I sought to bring into operation some fifteen or sixteen years agoa principle which I have consistently supported ever since, and which I am glad of the present opportunity to endorse. If the results to which I have referred are the outcome of over-representation in Parliament, surely we cannot afford to No honourable member on the ignore them. It is scientifically demonstrated, and experience has shown, that improvements can be achieved by the introduction of this system. and referendum reduce the so-called abuses ? that question is involved. We are dealing with representation in Parliament. ferendum gives the people control over their representatives in Parliament. another matter. The honourable member will agree that the object of our electoral law is to mirror in Parliament the wishes The Liberals of the people. That is a fundamental principle of our system of representative government, and if it can be demonstrated that there is a system which will enable us to more closely achieve that result, we should be prepared to give it a trial, more especially having regard to the menace caused by the obvious defects of the present system. I have pleasure in supporting this motion, and trust that it will be dealt with in the non-party spirit in which it should be approached. This question has been sprung upon the House, and I am afraid that few of us are thoroughly conversant with it. From what I have seen of the operation of proportional voting, however, I have come to the conclusion that it is rather conducive to the development of factions in the community.

I do not think it is the desire of honourable members that this Parliament shall become a greater centre e f dissension than it is at present. But if we are to have here representatives of all the varying combinations of opinion in the Commonwealth-the Single-Taxers, the Quakers, the Temperance party, the Liquor Trade party, and others-ou r position w ill be very much worse than it is. Proportional voting is still more -or less of an experiment. am aware only one State has adopted ifc,_ and whilst its operation in Tasmania does not appear to have made any material alteration in the state of parties there, from what I can learn it has led to considerable friction, has intensified public feeling at election time, and on the whole has done more harm than good. As a general principle proportional representation sounds all right, but in Parliament all opinions have to be resolved into the "" yes "" and the "" no "" stage, and the nearer we get to the highest -common denominator of public thought outside the better. If we had all sorts of side issues specially represented in Parliament, I think we should have a considerably greater waste of time than now occurs. view it seems to me that we should give pause to any such change in our system of representation as is proposed by this motion. system of election for the two Houses? sonable proposition that a system that is good enough for the election of members of one House should be good enough to apply to the other. I cannot for the moment see what is in the minds of those who advocate this change. are probably dissatisfied with the result of the recent elections. cated before the last election. that honourable members on this side of the House have advocated such a change? has. not bound by individual opinion. Proportional representation is no part of the policy of our party. If it were, I , in common with my fellow members, would have fco consider my position. When additions are made to our programme the members of our party may either accept or reject them, and any member who does not approve of a new plank in fche platform is freo fco stand down. There has been apparently no unanimity of opinion amongst our supporters on this rather vexed question. I fchink that the system must tend to complicate an election, and that in itself is a Sof a r as I serious drawback. It renders more difficult the ascertainment of public opinion. The varying parties have to be expressed, so to speak, on the ballot papers, and fche sorting out of candidates at election time, always a difficult matter from the stand-point of the people, would become still more difficult. I think that we should give the people as free and as untrammelled a choice as possible at the poll. If I bad my way there would be no pre-selection by parties. An y party man who desired to stand should be allowed to do so, and the public rather than any party should be allowed to do the sorting out. In this way we should eliminate one of the worse features of the party system. From a common-sense point of able member carry it out? By preferential voting? without any pre-selection.

I cannot deal now with the figures which the honourable and learned member for Angas has used, but having been familiar with the discussion of this subject for the past twenty years, I have no difficulty in A big majority of speaking upon it now.

There is a section of the Conservative party which, to its credit, does not believe in the proposed change, but has sufficient knowledge and belief in the principle on which the British nation has been built up. The position is very simple. There is a growing demand on the part of the great mass of the people for a share in the increased production of the age; while, on the other side, there is a desire to see that they do not get it-to protect vested interests Any our stem the rising demands of Democracy.

I therefore ask honourable members to refrain from these continuous interjections. the Australian NotesA c t was submitted in 1912 it met with a rather hostile reception in regard to the proposal to reduce the gold reserve to 25 per cent., which was a good thing to do. However, that is not the point with which I am going to deal. During the discussion on that then honourable member for Fawkner, pointed out a difficulty that might arise in regard to the banks during a nnancial crisis, and suggested that the Government, or some person nominated by the Government, should be delegated to step in and stop what might otherwise be a disastrous result. I suggested at the time that I thought the Treasurer, on the advice of the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank, should be empowered to step in and give assistance and make the advance a Crown debt, because the parties interested could not be injured by the fact that an advance which, in nine cases out of ten, might tide them over a temporary difficulty and avoid a crisis, had been made. However, I think the proposal in the B ill now before honourable members is a better, clearer, and safer way, understand prepared to accept it , the Commonwealth Bank will be in a position to lend them deposit money and have the advance regarded as a Crown debt. Thus the same end will be attained without any delay or trouble. I ask honourable members to give that phase of the matter very special consideration. Clause5 specifies that a Savings Bank agency may be established anywhere within the British [24] Empire with the consent of the Treasurer. My predecessor at the Treasury, and the late Attorney-General, found some legal difficulty about the continuance of the branch of the Savings Bank in London.

I see great necessity for it . I am sure honourable members will be happy to know that during the recent financial crisis the Commonwealth Bank and the Bank of England were the two banks tliat were able to help people in London at that time, especially Australians. They were able to help when others were unable to give assistance by the payment of gold to travellers, and those persons were assisted in that way to return to Australia. to the Savings Bank Branch.

I hope and trust that immediately this B ill receives the assent of the Governor General, the Attorney-General and his officers will see that the regulations are drafted. There are many articles and ingredients needed in Australian industries at once. Prices have gone to an exorbitant height, and because we have been dependent on the enemy for certain ingredients, the manufacture of many articles is being prevented. I hope the Attorney-General w ill not be too gentle in his attitude, but w ill act as quickly and ing to operate. Here we have a Statute firmly as possible to give Australians an opportunity of operating under the provisions of this measure, so that an i m petus may be given to industries which are now in a parlous condition, on account of certain material not being available. Sir EOBERTBEST (Kooyong) [S.4S] -In explanation of a remark I T h is is no question of made on the second reading, I desire to say that what I intended to convey was that the rights and remedies of the alien enemy in regard to patents, as in regard to other matters, are suspended during the war. First of all, it w ill be essential that voidance shall be made, and, subsequently, that the necessary licence shall be given. It w ill be observed that the regulations last only during the term of the war, and for six months afterwards. But, according to paragraph d, someI w ill explain that thing done under these regulations may last for years after that period. I hope that it w ill be made clear that the mere fact of the regulations having become void in the meantime w ill not interfere with the extension of the term which is granted under the regulations, valid at the time the licence was granted, but void perhaps during the subsequent operation of the licence. The position is that the licence may extend for three, four, or five years beyond the term of the existence of the regulation; and I wish it to be made clear that that subsequent term wherein the licence continues is not going to be prejudiced by reason of the fact that the regulations have, in the meantime, come to an end. It would be an appalling condition of affairs if , when the rights and powers of our present alien Committee: enemies have revived, the patentee could subsequently go into Court against the man who possessed the licence, and claim that the regulation was void, and that, therefore, the licence was no longer in existence. The licensee must have the benefit of absolute security to induce h i m to invest capital in any enterprise of the kind. I think this is probably attained; but I ask the Attorney-General to consider and satisfy himself on the matter. ney-General) [ 8 . 5 2 ] I think it is a well-settled principle that a right given under an Act is not rendered void by reason of that Act being repealed or ceas-",43,Patents Trade Marks And Designs Bill

325,Mr Hughes (West Sydney,"Attorwliich authorizes licences to be issued during a certain period to do certain things. Let us suppose that this Act will last for six months, and that rights are given to A, B, and C for seven, five, and three years respectively. The Act terminates, but the rights given to those persons remain during the remainder of the term for which they were granted. For they were rights granted under the law by a properly-constituted authority, and those rights are not in any way impaired by the Act disappearing, as it were, by effluxion of time. It was one of the conditions of that authority that it should bo only a temporary authority, but with the right to issue licences for periods much longer than the lifetime of the authority itself. If a trustee with power of appointcollect that every man's right to ment has made an appointment his authority lapses, but that does not determine the rights and length of tenure of the appointee. tention to the matter in order to mako absolutely certain. have to consider is: Had the authority, when it made the appointment or granted the licence, power to do so? Clearly it had. Every right that existed under the Patent Act is subject to patent law. The Legislature says, in respect of, say, patent he is going to get anything or nothing. 1456, that a licence to manufacture under that patent shall be granted for a term of years, which must be not greater than the period for which the patent has to run. Subject to that limitation the licence is good. NowI come to the question raised by the honourable member for Wentworth as to the possibility of a patentee fattenI n regard to the suggestion of expediing on our credit. We must look at the subject in proper proportions, and, quite apart from anything else, the amount of royalty which can be in any case drawn by an alien patentee under this proposed Statute is so insignificant, when compared with the colossal expense of this war, that it is as a grain of sand is to the greatest of the Pyramids. But, applying it even in its insignificance to the circumstances, suppose the patentee in Germany, or some neutral country, says to a money-lender, "" There are some royalties heaping up for me in Australia: will you lend me money on them?"" I do not know whether the honourable member for Wentworth ever approached the money-lender, but I venture to say that if he had he would never take this gloomy view of the possibilities of the enemy tapping this country's credit by such means. The money-lender is not yet born who would lend on such security. First of all, no patentee will be able to say what is his share in the royalty. He has no statutory or legal claim to a penny. He will have what is allotted to him, but nothing will be allotted; not even an indication of what he is entitled to expect will be given until after the war. There is, say, a pool of royalties, and it may be that one patentee is entitled to a cup full, another to a jug full, and a third to none at all. It all depends on the circumstances. Honourable members must reproperty must be modified by the circumstances in which he finds himself. A man may be a property-holder in Louvain, and a shell breaks his house down. It is very unfortunate, but the mortgagor of that property will find it very difficult to get any sort of satisfaction out of the position. It is the fortune of war. The property right in patents is in the same position; it must stand the hazard and uncertainty of war, and tbe patenteeunder this Bill can never know whether The first object of introducing this measure is not to safeguard the interests of the patentee, but to safeguard the interests of the community, and consequently we must, first of all, consider what is sufficient inducement to encourage the local manufacturer to make the articles covered by these patent rights. tion made by the honourable member for Maribyrnong, I quite agree with him that this is a thing which, if it be done at all, were well to be done quickly. The honourable member may rest assured that the regulations will be drafted and made available as soon as the Bill becomes law, and applications will be at once received and considered on their merits. There will be no delay other than that which is necessary to inquire into the bona fides of every application, because we must be assured that, in the issuing of a licence, the public welfare will be safeguarded, and that the-",44,Patents Trade Marks And Designs Bill
326,Sir Robert Best,I merely drew at,45,Patents Trade Marks And Designs Bill
327,Mr Hughes,"Yes; but what weapplicant has the capital, the ability, and the intention to turn out an article which w ill satisfy the consumer. When I spoke on the second reading I had not had an opportunity of studying the B ill , and I was under the impression that the measure was providing that these royalties would be paid ultimately to the alien patentee. I find, however, that there is no such provision in the B ill , and that all the alien patentee would have an opportunity of borrowing on is the word of the Honourable the Attorney General. I admit that that word would not be a borrowing proposition before any money-lender in the world ; so that difficulty is disposed of. There is this other point, however, that there is bound to be a certain amount of soreness in regard to the royalties that w ill be claimed, especially in the case of licences granted for a period exceeding the duration of the war. In those cases I think that, to safeguard the Government from any charge of bad f a it h or piracy, the Attorney-General ought to be careful to see that he does not entirely base the question of the royalty to be paid on the evidence of those who are seeking the licences. I am not concerned about the alien patentee; during the currency of the war, I have not many prejudices in favour of the enemy patentee-bu t where a licensee must spend a considerable amount of money in order to erect machinery for the manufacture of a certain article, he must be in a position where he can say that he has given a fair trial to the question of royalty, and this should be taken into consideration in assessing the amount of royalty. licences be granted only unti l the end of the war ? until the end of the patent. war the patentee resumes his natural rights as the owner of the natent? not here. the regulations w ill safeguard men who have put money into the manufacture of articles which require the erection of expensive machinery, so that when the war is over the patentee will not be able to come in here and demand a higher royalty than that paid in other countries. ney-General) [ 9 . 3 ] I thought I had made that position clear. I am obliged to the honourable member for asking me this question, because, for the benefit of fche community, the provision should be made perfectly clear as to the rights of a licensee under the B ill . Those rights may, and in many cases w ill , extend to the f u l l term of the licence. If fche licence extends beyond the war, the licensee's rights will not be affected by the fact that the v/ar no longer exists. The licence will give to him as ample protection as the patent afforded to the original patentee or his assignee. WhenJ first mentioned the matter, I took the case of a man engaged in some manufacturing process where the patent was comparatively small, but where the amount of capital to be invested was relatively large. Such a manwould ask of what avail was the investment of £20,000, or even £5,000, if he was to have the right to manufacture the article for six months only, and the original patentee could then step in . Therefore we must give the licensee such tenure as will induce him to invest his capital in tlie manufacture of the article, and such assurance that he may rest satisfied that he will have all the rights the holding of the patent could give him if he were the original patentee ohis assignee. The licence w ill give that right, and the regulations w ill provide for licences of that nature. Lysol is a typical article. It s manufacture requires the expenditure of very little capital, but there are tremendous profits. In the case of this article, there is no reason why a licence should be issued for any great length of time. We should discourage persons from manufacturing any(Henty) r9.ll-Will thing where there is a margin of apparently 1,000 per cent, profit. I think I have made it clear that, in regard to the items which involve the investment of capital, there will be security of tenure during the currency of the war and thereafter during the balance of the period for which the licence is issued. I wish to be clear that -We all agree as to the necessity for giving fco the licensee absolute security, but under the B ill as framed it is possible for the patentee's rights to revive subject to any licences issued.

I suggest to the Attorney General that, in order to avoid the friction of two rights to manufacture the one article at the same time, he should provide by regulation for avoiding or suspending in whole or in part any patent during the currency provided for in the licence.

362,Mr Groom,"In some of the Statesoutrageous claims are often made against the Government. The land of Western Australia is, of course, exceedingly valuable, as the honourable member for Swan knows; but when I was head of the .dome Affairs Department a claim in connection with the acquisition of land for forts there was reduced from about £10,000 to £3,500. The experts, nevertheless, were honestly of opinion that the value of the land was much in excess of the departmental valuation. When a case goes iuto Court, the question of costs should be left to the Judge; there should not be an arbitrary rule applied, such as that provided for in clause 10. That clause saysIf, in anv proceedings under the last preceding section, the amount of compensation awarded to the claimant(a) is equal to or greater than the amount claimed-the costs of the proceedings shall be paid by the Commonwealth; (b) is less than the amount claimed, and is equal to or less than the amount reconsider the matter. I ask h i m not to offered by the Commonwealth-the costs of the proceedings shall be paid by the claimant; or (c) is less than the amount claimed but is greater than the amount offered by the Commonwealth-the Commonwealth shall pay the proportion of the costs of the proceedings which the excess of the amount awarded over the amount offered bears to the excess of the amount claimed over the amount offered. The Judge will have no discretion, and the claimant may suffer serious injustice after having acted on the best expert advice. The Minister spoke of a claim for ±-20,000, which went into Court after the Commonwealth had offered £850, and £1,431 was awarded; but Mr Justice Isaacs, who heard the case, gave the claimant costs. Having heard all the evidence, and having weighed the equities of the case he had regard to the fact that the land was being resumed compulsorily. I admit that something should be done to prevent excessively high claims. It is the object of the Department to avoid litigation if possible, but it should pay consideration to claims that are honestly made. No member is in sympathy with attempts to bleed the Government, but when a claimant supports his claim with bond fide valuations, he should receive consideration. Valuations cannot be disclosed during the process of negotiations. tbeir hands afterwards. known what our valuations are. case. The valuations may be disclosed when it seems likely tliat an agreement has been reached. mentioned ""£850 was offered. ment has its own way of making an offer. The Crown may have obtained five or six valuations, and may consider them all too high, or it may base its offer on the lowest valuation. offered more than the valuation. avoid litigation, which is a right thing to do. It is a laudable thing to t r y to prevent the making of excessive claims, but the method proposed is exceedingly drastic, and calculated to work injustice. I hope that the Minister will carefully go very f a r with the B ill to-night, so that he may give attention to the questions which I have brought under his notice. No doubt other honourable members have criticism to offer respecting other provisions of the B ill . I do not make a practice of opposing measures, but I feel it my duty to oppose this B ill . In framing it , the Minister has listened too much to his officers, and has had too little regard to the public interest. For a number of years, I have had a deep regard for the rights of the public in park land. In no part of Australia has too much land been reserved for public parks. Many of our local governing bodies are not elected on an adult suffrage, but are chosen on a property qualification, and, unfortunately, the persons who obtain seats in their councils are not as anxious as they should be to preserve the parks for the people. W it h a view to saving the rates, they are glad to make the parks as small as possible. Were the brother of the honourable member for Wentworth a member of this House, he would support me in opposing the proposal to allow municipal councillors to barter away the rights of the people in their parks. The Sydney municipal council has no proper regard for the rights of the people in their parks. They have given a large portion of one of",49,Lands Acquisition Bill Or Recreation Lands Held By A Local

In another part they have permitted the erection of a building which a Melbourne alderman referred to in my hearing as a dead-house. When the attention of the councillors was directed to the matter, they expressed surprise, authority for the erection having been given without their being properly aware of the fact. The Bill allows local governing bodies to permit the Commonwealth to acquire public lands, and they may do this in order to increase their revenue.

We are a National Parliament, and should have more lofty ideas than those which _ characterize the ordinary municipal council. I hope that this Bill will not be allowed to go through to-night, unless the Minister is prepared to withdraw the provision to which I have taken exception. The only object of seeking to acquire such land ,can be to save a few pounds, in view of the fact that, public reserves are likely to be disposed of at a cheaper rate than would private property. Most people take a pride in the beautiful surroundings of their own locality; and I can only conclude that the Minister has not given this matter sufficient thought, or he would not think of depriving the people of places of public resort in such a a letter in my possession from the brother way. the British Parliament would vote for such a proposition, in view of the fact that in municipalities all over the Old Country, and in other parts of the Empire, town-planning and other schemes for conserving the health of the people are being inaugurated on the principle that the first duty of public bodies is to preserve the public health. member confine himself to the question attempt is, on the part of the Minister to before the Chair?

That practice is folCommonwealth and State Parliaments be lowed in all the States at the present time. There is uo reason at all why the Parliament of Victoria should not, for instance, take a piece of the Fitzroy Gardens for some public requirement or build a road through them, but before that can be done the Victorian Parliament must pass a specific law for the purpose. Parliament ought not to be able to take away a reserve under any general law. I have made reserves in my own State, with the very good intention of preserving them for the people, but I found them invaded and whittled away by applications from churches, schools, mechanics' institutes, military bodies, and sporting clubs, unti l we found tliat reserves which had been in curious reason, to be in the mind of the tended for the enjoyment of the people for all time, were being fast depleted. Because of that, I introduced a law which enacted that a certain class of reserve could not be touched except by specific Act of Parliament, just in the same way as, in Western Australia at any rate, the Government cannot close a road without specific parliamentary enactment. any piece of land for a public purpose, surely the State can legislate to allow it to be acquired: and all we shall then have to do will be to acquire this land from the State on the terms agreed upon. To pass a general law to give us the righ t to enter upon any Crown reserves or parks would be a very great mistake. the Government to acquire lands reserved for parks and recreation purposes by lease for 999 years. vernment might as well have the freehold. me that, unless we have the most stringent conditions preserving to the people their parks and reserves, those open spaces w ill disappear. One Admin istration will take off a piece, the next Administration another -niece, and so on, until the reserve or park lands are completely spoilt. There is no reason for this general provision, because when the Government desire to do anything in the way of acquiring land, they can do it by specific Act . I appeal to my honourable friends to make it as difficult as possible to interfere with the Crown reserves, park lands, & c , established for the recreation of the people. Let both put to a good deal of trouble when it is intended to invade the rights of the people in regard to public parks. I do not think the Minister will be able to carry this B ill , because it is contrary to public policy throughout the whole of the States. The people view with great jealousy and anxiety any interference with their park lands and reserves, which are so necessary, and which have been set aside for the recreation and enjoyment of our population. ney-General) [10.11] I rise only to correct an impression which seems, for some right honourable member for Swan, that one of the objects of this measure is to give the Commonwealth greater power to interfere w it h the parks and reserves in the different States. I assure the right honourable gentleman that this B ill is to prevent the Commonwealth doing that. I agree with everything he said, except his statement that the measure enlarges If the Commonwealth requires the Commonwealth's powers. It curtails those powers severely.

I can assure the honourable member that the B ill does not increase our power to take park lands. On the other hand, it circumscribes our power so much that it prohibits us from taking them by compulsory process. This is a measure that has been long required. earnest conversation with the Leader of the Opposition the other night, and he agreed with me that this measure was required. Sir not influence me. the Department is that the law as it stands is most unsatisfactory, not only to the Department, but also to the States and to private individuals. If ' t h e IslandB ill . measure falls short in any particular of bringing the principal Act to the point desired, by all means let us amend it , which we can do in the Committee stage. The Attorney-General has given us the strongest reasons why we should have the opportunity of some slight adjournment before reaching the Committee stage, because it is obvious from his remarks that he has not grasped what is intended by the provision of the B ill to which the honourable member for East Sydney has taken exception. The definition section of the principal Act governs the provision in clause 4 that the Attorney-General quoted. "" land "" means land that is not the land of any municipality or corporation, and section 13, amended by clause 4, is entirely governed by that definition. we take away from the definition the particular qualification with regard to park lands, then section 13 is given a comprehensive nature which it did not have in the original Act. Therefore, the B ill really enlarges the power over park lands given by the original Act in the way feared by the honourable member for East Sydney. The fallacy of the proposal put forward by the present Minister of Home Affairs is that the right to barter away the lands of any municipality does not properly vest in the council for the time being in existence. It is well known that in many municipali[25] may be of an absentee character. The council may be representative of owners of property who are not residents in the area. I go further, and say that the right to barter away any public or park lands in a municipality should only be very tenderly and very delicately submitted even to the residents in the area as a whole, because these lands are vested in posterity, and no person in the municipal area has the right to barter I had a long and away the lungs of the municipality that is yet to be. I hope that the Minister will recognise that view of the matter, and not give the right to any municipality to barter away any part of its property. Of course, departmental ofiicers JOHN FORREST -That fact does may take another view, but I take the broad view to which the honourable member for East Sydney has subscribed. view when dealing with the Norfolk will consider what this power will mean in regard to a municipality. In many cases the local authority lives from year to year; generally speaking, it is elected from year to year, and in any one year a municipality may be so badly needing a windfall as to be glad to have the right to sell its park lands. member know the law in respect of municipalities and their power to sell ? sure that my friend does not.

I do not wish to see this temptation put in the way of any municipality, and therefore ask the M i nister to give most serious consideration to the question of meeting the views of some of his own colleagues. I have a considerable amount of sympathy for the proposal put forward in the B ill in regard to excessive claims. Claims against the Commonwealth are very often excessive.

But I do not know that the question can be so readily dismissed as suggested in the clause in the Bill. The largest question that enters into differences of opinion Bill as a very dangerous measure. I iu regard to the value of land is the matter of severance, the assessment of which is difficult, and very often can only be properly done by hearing evidence on both sides. A large number of claims against the Commonwealth are, and must be from their very nature, knowingly bogus. The vast majority of claims are justly intended, but a large number are bogus; and I do not think that those who make bogus claims should be permitted to make them without in some way suffering for them.

I u Committee I shall not be able to deal with the general principles of the measure, and I speak now because I wish to say a few words on the general principles involved. I certainly cannot agree with the view taken by the Attorney-General that the Bill restricts the provisions of the original Act. He surely has not read the Bill. We were told that one of the reasons why the Bill has been brought forward is that the provisions of the Act are not sufficiently wide to give powers which, in the opinion of the Government, are necessary for the Commonwealth in connection with the acquisition of land. Yet now we are told by the Attorney-General that, as a matter of fact, the Bill really restricts the Commonwhat can be done by trustees of wealth powers, and in support of his argument the honourable and learned gentleman quoted clause 4 of the Bill, which deals ""with portion of the measure only. The Attorney-General carefully ignored clause 2, which enlarges the definition of "" land,"" and deliberately includes public parks and land dedicated for the recreation of the people, which were excluded from acquisition by the original Act. The Attorney-General's sophistry is too transparent to deceive anybody in the face of this clause. I regard the do not see that there is any necessity for it, and I hope that the Minister will see the propriety of withdrawing it altogether. I can see dangers to the public interest and to public rights in the Bill in its present form. There will be opportunities and powers for encroachment upon and diversion from their special purposes, of reserves which are supposed to have been dedicated to the public for their use for all time for recreation purposes. Many private firms, in submitting their estates for public sale, in order to obtain higher prices, and to sell the ground profitably to themselves, hold out as an inducement the fact that a certain portion of an estate has been reserved to the people for public recreation for all time. But these promises, these declarations, will go for absolutely nothing if by this Bill we empower the Commonwealth to make an arrangement, not by any Act of Parliament, but by private treaty with the trustees, be they private trustees or public trustees or municipal councils, to acquire lands which the public have fondly but delusively believed were to be absolutely inalienable and preserved for their use and recreation for all time. The definition in the original Acb provided that public parks vested in or under the control of municipal or local authorities, and dedicated to or reserved for the recreation of the people, or such other lands dedicated to or reserved for the use and the enjoyment of the people, as have been specified by proclamation by the proper authority in the State in which the land is situated, should not be acquired by the Commonwealth by compulsory process.

Time after time attempts have been made by the Railway Commissioners to obtain slices of that park for railway extension purposes, and we have found the trustees at times apparently disposed to lend a willing ear to such proposals. Repeated and emphatic public protests alone have saved Hyde Park from being destroyed and. built upon. If the Commonwealth Government is empowered to make private arrangements with trustees, as proposed by this Bill, there will be no safeguard to the right of the people to the full enjoyment of public parks and recreation reserves. Encroachments have already been made upon several of our public parks in Sydney. As the result of negotiations'between the trustees and private individuals, areas but who, as the result of thrift, managed have been shut off from public use and given over to bowling and other recreation clubs. In this way the greater part of a small park in the constituency of East Sydney has been dealt with, and we are now asked to allow the Commonwealth to continue this sort of thing on a much larger scale. There is no limit to the powers with which it is proposed to clothe the Commonwealth Government in regard to the acquisition of public parks. I hope that the House will seriously listen to the suggestion made by the honourable member for Darling Downs, and to the exhortations of the honourable member for East Sydney, who has earnestly drawn attention to the dangerous character of some parts of this Bill. Coming to the question of compensation, if the Commonwealth is going to plunge owners of small areas into costly litigation much dispute so far as small areas are Minister is prepared to accept them. Wa concerned. [25]-2 happen to know that disputes extending over years have arisen with owners of small areas proposed to be acthe amounts involved are certainly comparatively trifling. These people have received notice that the Commonwealth propose to take over their land, and they have had the greatest difficulty, not only in obtaining a settlement, but in securing what, in my opinion, is a reasonable valuation. The valuations placed upon these areas by the Commonwealth are far below those made by private valuers familiar with values in the vicinity, and the unfortunate owners have been subjected to a long process of waiting and harassing, with the apparent object of wearing down their patience and forcing them either to go to law or to accept what the Commonwealth is willing to pay. ""Under clause 15 the Commonwealth will have power to harass small owners in that way to an even greater extent than is at present possible. If the Bill be carried they will have no option but to submit to payment of costs arranged on an arbitrary basis which, in some cases, would involve the grossest injustice. I have in mind the case of a few working men in my own constituency whose wages constitute their only income, to acquire small blocks in what is now known as the Liverpool training area. They bought these areas with the object of devoting their week-ends and spare time to the cultivation of small orchards or the establishment of poultry farms. Their land has been taken over by the Government, and for two or three years they have been deprived of their use. Inone case the whole sum does not amount to £200, yet these unfortunate men have been harassed for months, and are quite unable to secure what they regard as a fair settlement. I see in this Bill all the elements of injustice and hardship to deserving men. I am sure that the general sentiment of the House is against encouraging anything of the kind. I hope that the Minister will withdraw the Bill for the time being, in order that it may be recast tn a form that will be more acceptable to the House.

It would be betterfor the Government to withdraw clauses 2 and 4. I admit that a difficulty exists at the present time, bepass as it stands, we shall make it poscause two or three my own notice, but it could be got over by the introduction of Bills from time to time. Not many municipalities have the power, or are willing, to trade away park lands of which they are trustees; but I hope that nothing will be done which will facilitate the curtailverning bodies, but by altering the dement of public recreation areas. Clause 15 provides an arbitrary method of determining who shall pay the cost of any proceedings connected with a resumption, and is therefore bad. The Judge who has to decide what is fair compensation for the owner of land is the person who is qualified to say which party shall pay the costs of the hearing. The payment of costs must be taken into consideration in the determination' of compensation. If the clause is passed, the result will be that a Judge who, with the law as it at present stands, would have ordered the Crown to pay costs will add the amount of the costs to the compensation he awards to the owner of the land.

If this proposal were to go to a vote at this moment, and members voted according to their convictions, it would be rejected. also advise the Government to strike these objectionable clauses out of the B ill . I have reason to appeal in that way because I have heard honourable members on tlie Opposition side speaking in such a fashion that, if they had belonged to the Adelaide City Council or the Legislative Council, and had cut out the iniquitous system of plural voting, we would have had more green spaces in Adelaide than we have to-day. Wheni t is a matter of parting with the breathing spaces of the citizens, patriots do not always rise to the occasion. A t the time referred to by the right honourable member for Swan, Adelaide would have lost several acre's of her park lands if the proposal had not conflicted with the interests of the picture shows, who did not want to see the White City established in opposition to Consequently the whips were cracked, and because certain people had financial interests at stake, they opposed the B ill .

The only punishI f my memory is correct, the present park lands were dedicated to the citizens when South Australia was made a self-governing Colony, and were provided for by Colonel Light, who was intrusted with the laying out of the city. The encroachment on the park lands is mainly for bowling greens; the clubs pay a minimum amount to the City Council, and they are able to whip up the plural vote, which is strong enough to overwhelm the opinion of the poorer citizens whose children wish to use these breathing spaces. The ballot on the question as to whether these lands should be alienated from the It is to be hoped citizens is generally taken on an afternoon when all the workers who use the park lands are unable to record their votes. Notwithstanding that the State Parliaments and trustees of park lands have been recreant to their trust, we should see that the National Parliament keeps its hands off the people's breathing spaces, which mean so much to the rising generation. I know that we roust make provision for the training of our military forces, and we have been told how necessary it will be for every man in the community to become an efficient fighting unit ; but I believe that it is possible for the Military authorities to get whatever lands are required without encroaching on the park lands, which belong to the people.
