He is not permitted to debate, as proxy for Mr MacDonald, what the Government -hould do. for External Affairs whether the Government has received any communication from Mr Macmahon Ball regarding the statement'that has been made in Singapore and the attitude of sections of the population in Malaya towards the Australian Goodwill Mission and Australia'^ immigration policy.

That is the mission which Mr Macmahon Ball is now leading in South-East Asia. Last week, the Minister for External. Affairs stated that those governments -had been consulted prior to the departure of the mission for the purpose of ascertaining whether it would be welcome.

14,Mr Abbott,"To-day' s newspaperswas a newspaper report-no t an official announcement-of the projected mission, but to the best of my knowledge when Imade the statement and also now what I said wasand. is correct. I said that the Australian Government had communicated, not only with the Governments of Singapore and the Federation of Maiaya but also with every one of the. governments constitute had received from them assurances that the mission would be welcome. We have since received thanks from those governments for the work that the mission has done. ment of the intention to send the goodwill mission to South-East.

I was elected to the Canberra Community Hospital Board as a representative of the Australian Labour party last year, and, incidentally, by a very large majority. The Industrial Board made provision the approval of the House must be obtained before the honourable member can continue in this manner? member for Balaclava an authority on the Standing Orders? Perhaps he may be better off if he sticks to legal matters. that! in this House that when honourable members are attacked outside the Parliament, they have the right to reply in the House. made provision in the award for the appointment of a deputy matron for the Canberra Community Hospital. TinHospital Board, of which I am deputy chairman, obtained a direction from th« Minister, and proceeded to makethai appointment by calling for applications, examining the applicants, and choosing, one of their number for the position. A of the countries that complaint was lodged with the Industrial South-East Asia, and Board by the Hospital Employees Federation, that, the Hospital; Board had acted unjustly in not appointing-a certain applicant and alleged that she was not chosen because of her activitiesin. the HospitalEmployees Federation, of which she had been secretary. That case ha* now been heard by the Industrial Board, and in to-day's issue of the Canberra Tim.es the following report appears:Replying to Mr Sheehan, Mr Fraser sadd that the union affiliation of Sister Curley, had never entered his mind and' was only a secondary consideration to the credentials and qualifications of an appointee to such an important position. The report continuesMr Sheehan attacked Mr Fraser, as a unionist, for not looking first to a member of the. Federation to fill the post. WhatI actually said yesterday to the board was that, in considering the qualifications of the applicants, union membership was not in my mind, and that the clause of the award requires that preference shall be given to members of the federation, provided they are of good character and possess the necessary qualifications. ment and Employment Act come into it? ber for Fawkner cannot enter into a debate on that matter.

26,Mr Beale,"I rise to order. Standingthis matter must he suhject to the indulgence of the House. I am aware that on several occasions, by the indulgence of Mr Speaker, honourable members have been allowed to make personal explanations, but I point out that on a strict interpretation of the Standing Orders, che indulgence of the House must be obtained. honourable member, as a lawyer and a potential Speaker, to examine the Standing Orders a little further. I actually made was that when I , as a member of the Hospital Board, was considering the qualifications of various applicants for the position. of deputy matron, union membership was not in my mind. In conformity with the requirements of the case, I had first to -decide whether an applicant possessed the :uecessary qualifications, and not until that !had been done had I to consider the matter of union membership. That is not stated in the report; nor is it stated that the chairman of the board immediately said that my remarks in that connection were entirely correct. The newspaper also -reported Mr Sheehan as having saidThere was some unseen influence at work, -which probably took Mr Fraser's mind off that ported in larger quantities in chests. No -aspectThat is the aspect of union membershipsome unseen influence which we are not able to discover. The report does not say that Mr Sheehan -did not make that statement until after the hearing of evidence had closed, and that I immediately pointed out to the tribunal that Mr Sheehan had had me in the witness box for cross-examination, that he had net made any suggestion of that kind during cross-examination, and that I was willing to re-enter the witness box to allow him to cross-examine me on any -of those points. Those matters are not brought out in the report. Finally, I -desire to say that the Industrial Board has decided that the Hospital Board did not exercise any discrimination against an unsuccessful applicant because of her union activities. The board has yet to make a decision on other matters that were raised. External Territories inform me whether the itinerary of the King and Queen next year will include a visit to Papua and New Guinea? If not, will it be possible to bring to Australia a contingent of native people from those territories who served with distinction in World War II . , to take part in the celebrations, possibly as members of guards of honour in the capital cities? has been prepared for the Royal tour of Australia does not provide for a visit to the territories of New Guinea and Papua. I understand that consideration was given to the question of whether there should be some representation from those territories and also from Norfolk Island, which will not be visited, so that their peoples might feel that they have participated in the welcome to the Royal visitors. I shall make inquiries and inform the honourable member whether that can be arranged. TEA. of 5d. per lb. when imported in packets of under 20 lb. and of 3d. per lb. when imtea is grown in Australia. The Prime Minister has said, I understand, that the Government intends to withdraw certain subsidies that are now being paid, including that on tea. If that is done, the price of tea will rise. Will the Prime Minister take action to have the duty on imported tea removed so that the price paid for it by consumers will be as low as possible ? for Trade and Customs, the honourable member knows that the increase or decrease of customs and excise duties is a matter of government policy. The duty on imported tea will be considered when the matters to which the honourable member has referred are reviewed by the Government. his recent attack on the Australian Wheat Board, the Minister for Commerce and",13,Canberra Community Hospital Appointment Of Deputy Matron

Has any decision been made with regard to that matter? Australian Wheat Board, referred to by the honourable member is a figment of his imagination. authority or any individual, I hope that [ shall do it properly. I did not attack the Australian Wheat Board. In a speech that I made in this House recently T related the facts regarding their response to an inquiry that was made of them in connection with the wheat agreement with the TJnited Kingdom. That -vas all. The appointment of a chairman -pf the board is a matter of Government policy. I am sure that, when the Government docs make a decision, the honourable member for Wimmera will be delighted with it. told the House that it will not be possible for him to make a definite announcement -is to the Government's future policy with regard to prices control until it has been '-onsidered by the caucus of the Parliamentary Labour party at the meeting that is to be held next week. Can the right lionorable gentleman say whether caucus will then .be asked also to consider the reports exchanges of views have been tention of other forms of control, such as clothes rationing and capital issues control, that are at present being administered by the Australian Government?

I point out that the Defence (Transitional Provisions) Act, from which the Government derives itsauthority to administer these controls, expires at the end of this year. honorable members to inquire from the Prime Minister or the Leader of the Opposition what either proposes to submit for consideration at party meetings. I have not been so presumptuous as to ask the Acting Leader of the Opposition what he is likely to put to his party. AllI can say is that a Cabinet sub-committee is examining the whole matterWhenI . attack any relating to subsidies and controls as related to subsidies. In many cases subsidies and controls are interlocked with rationing and' the dollar shortage. The matters so affected comprise a long and varied list. I cannot say precisely what will be put to the Parliamentary Labour party at its meeting. That would be expecting too much of me. The matter will be thoroughly examined -by the Government. Minister seen the report that the Premier proposed that all State Premiers should meet the right honourable gentleman to discuss the transfer of rents and prices control to the States? Is he aware that several of the Premiers have indicated that they favour this proposal?

However, I was informed this morning that according to press remade by telegram between the Premier* of some States with the object of arranging a conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers to consider the transfer of rents and pricecontrols.

Another important aspect was that Qantas Empire Airways Limited would be operating in partnership with the British Overseas Airways Corporation, which is entirely owned by the TJnited Kingdom Government,' and under arrangements made between the Australian Government and the United Kingdom Government. It was immediately apparent that many advantages would arise from both operators being completely owned by the respective Governments, including simplification of negotiations on financial matters, which are exceedingly .complex in a service of this nature. After a very full examination -of the position, the conclusion was reached that complete government ownership of Qantas Empire Airways was desirable, amd an approach was accordingly made to -Qantas Limited regarding the sale of its 50 per cent, shareholding to the Commonwealth. On the 26th May, 1947, following upon a period of discussions, the vice-chairman of 'Qantas Limited wrote to rhe Acting Minister for Civil Aviation .advising the willingness of his board "" to negotiate and to receive an offer"". The negotiations were held in a spirit of friendly co-operation, and on the 5th June, 1947, an -offer was transmitted to rhe company on the basis of a cash payment of £455,000 for its holding of 361,500 shares in Qantas Empire Airways Limited, the sale to he effective as at the -'10th June, 1947. A condition was that Qantas Empire Airways Limited should declare and pay a dividend at the rate of 7 per cent, for the year ended the 31st March, 1947, the Commonwealth thus purchasing the shares ex the 1946-47 dividend, but with full rights to all profits earned between the 1st April and the 30th -Tune, 1947. Another condition was that rhe purchase would carry full right to the -use of the name or design "" Qantas"" in -onnexion with future air services. On rhe 14th June, the company advised its cation by its shareholders. An extraordinary general meeting of the shareholders of Qantas Limited, held in Brisbane on .the -3rd July, 1947, duly ratified rhe terms of sale to the Commonwealth, £455,000 was effected during the following week. The position now is that as from the 1st July, 1947, Qantas Empire Airways Limited has been operating as an entirely Commonwealth-owned undertaking. It must be emphasized, however, that apart from necessary changes in the board of directors, the personnel of the company and the wealth of tradition inherited from the original pioneer company, added to since 1934 by the operations of Qantas Empire Airways Limited itself, remain unchanged. While the original company, the Queensland and Northern Territory Aerial Services Limited, has virtually passed out of existenceI believe that itliquidation is now in process-the name "" Qantas"" coined from its initials and which has become world famous through the years, is still the hall-mark of a mighty airline which can now look for ward to the fulfilment of a destiny probably never dreamed of by the original founders in 1920. Of these founders. Mr W. Hudson Fysh is at the head of the present company as chairman and managing director, and I cannot speak too highly of his outstanding qualities, or of the place which he occupies, not only in this country but also in the international sphere as an authority on civil air transport. Unfortunately, the original chairman of Qantas, and later of Qantas Enipire Airways Limited, Sir Fergus McMaster, was forced to withdraw some time ago because of ill-health, but no reference to Qantas would be complete without acknowledging the part played by Sir Fergus in building up from a very humble beginning an organization known and respected throughout the world. In addition to Mr Hudson Fysh, the present board of directors comprises the vice-chairman, Mr W. C. Taylor, a director of Tasman Empire Airways Limited; Mr G. P. N . Watt, acting secretary to the Treasury, who is also a member of the Australian National Airlines Commisimportant posts in the Commonwealth Public Service, including the position of Director-General of Civil Aviation; and Sir Keith Smith, whose contribution to aviation is too well known to require am mention here.",19,Second Reading
67,"Acceptance Of This Offer, Subject To Ratifi","sion; Mr D. McVey, who formerly heldI should now like to make some mention of the actual price paid to Qantas Limited for the 261,500 shares sold to the Commonwealth, namely £455,000. That price represents approximately 34s. lOd. per share, and as a negotiated price has no exact basis of calculation. Regard was had, however, to an expert valuation of the shares as at the 31st March, 1946, which was carried out in connection with a previous purchase from the British Overseas Aircraft Corporation, to the level of profits earned since that date, and to the appreciation in value of certain assets above the figure to which they had been written down in the company's books. Consideration was also given to the improvement in the future prospects of the company since 1946 by the purchase of modern Constellation aircraft, and also to the. fact that the Commonwealth's existing 50 per cent, shareholding implied it guarantee of future profitable operations Commonwealth is responsible for the proand returns to the private shareholders. In all the circumstances, the price of £455,000 was considered to be very satisfactory from the viewpoint of both parties. It enabled the Commonwealth to become the sole owner of a well established aii' transport undertaking, and it provided sufficient funds to enable Qantas Limited to return to its shareholders upon liquidation an amount equivalent to the quotation of their shares on Australian stock exchanges at the date when negotiations first commenced. I am quite satisfied that the transaction reprements to be provided through the annual sents a good purchase by the Commonwealth, and fair and just compensation to che Qantas shareholders. The bill before the House is designed to ratify tlie purchase from Qantas Limited, and to appropriate the amount of £455,000, which was temporarily paid from the Treasurer's advance. f referred preA'iously to the purchase hy Qantas Empire Airways Limited of four Lockheed Constellations at an approximate total cost of £2,000,000, and also to the fact that that order was placed before the Commonwealth purchase of the British Overseas Aircraft Corporation shares. As the company did not have the necessary capital to finance this purchase, it arranged terms with the Lockheed corporation, under which some .£900,000 of the purchase price would be Mr Drakeford. covered by promissory notes maturing in series over a period of four years from the date of delivery of the aircraft. TJnder this arrangement, promissory notes are now in existence to the value of approximately £S70,000, and it is considered desirable, for many reasons, including a substantial dollar saving on interest payments, that the notes should be paid off as soon as possible. The remainder of the Constellation purchase has been financed from the company's existing resources and. by an overdraft with the Commonwealth Bank, which is now approaching £700,000. Other commitments of the company are of the order of £500,000, leading to the conclusion that the company is undercapitalized to the extent of £2,000,000, present share capital being still only £523,000. As the sole owner of the company, the vision of adequate canital to enable it to carry out its programme of planned development of international services, and this bill seeks authority for the provision by the Commonwealth of such additional capital sums as are required from time to time. The bill contains provisions for a special appropriation of £2,000,000, which it is intended shall be paid to the company before the 30th June, 1948, to enable outstanding commitments to be met at that date, and it also contains a provision to enable future capital requirevote of the Department of Civil Aviation. In brief, the bill provides for ratification of the Commonwealth's purchase of Qantas Empire Airways Limited and for the availability of funds to allow of its future development as Australia's international air transport operator. I am firmly convinced that this purchase has been in the best interests of Australia, and that in Qantas Empire Airways we possess an instrument which is serving, and will continue to servej Australia in the maintenance of our rightful place in international air transport, with its consequent benefit to Australian trade and industry and the reduction of our geographical isolation which must benefit the Commonwealth as a whole. adjourned.",20,Second Reading
68,Debate (On Motion By Mr Habbison),"Debate resumed from the 10th June (vide page 1918), on motion by Mr stock sales. The Minister must be fully That the bill be now read a second time. -This bill is for the purpose of providing the Governinent with sufficient funds to carry on the affairs of the country until the budget for the next financial year is dealt with by the Parliament. take this opportunity to the general with particular reference to some of the statements made last night by the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture ( Mr told the man that, if he sold all of his Pollard). General opinion throughout Australia, irrespective of the Minister's views, is that the present rates of tax are crippling production. The Minister claimed that the Governinent is-entitled to all the credit for the prosperity which exists to-day. He well knows, as everybody knows, that the tragedy of war caused shortages, which brought about the high prices which now prevail throughout the world. We need only to cast our minds back to the days of World WarI . to recall a similar steep increase of prices as the result of similar in-fluences. In those days, the producers received a higher price for butter than they received at any time during World War II . or afterwards. Those responsible for the winning of the war were the men and women who offered everything in order that we might retain our liberty. They were prepared to make that sacrifice so that we might have the benefits of the high prices and prosperity which we now enjoy. The Minister wrongly declared that everybody in Australia to-day is happy. The truth is that people will not go to the country districts for employment because of the unsatisfactory conditions of heavy losses. work and life there. The Minister also said that one could visit any country sale-yard and find almost every farmer from States show similar trends. In Queensthe surrounding districts in attendance land, the number of dairy cattle -and ready to buy stock. That may be true, heifers has declined by 14 per cent, since but the honourable gentleman wrongly in1942-43. However, that does not tell terpreted the reasons for this state of the whole unfortunate story. The situaaffairs when he declared that it indicated tion has been aggravated by an even prosperity. The honourable member for greater decline in the number of calves have confirmed the statements which 1 made in this House some time ago giving the real reasons for large attendances at aware that unless a farmer who sells his stock replaces it in the -same financial year, the bulk of his receipts from the sale is taken from him in the form of taxes. I know of one man who, because of drought, considered selling all of his stock). He took his problem to a taxaI tion expert who told him that, from a discuss financial point of view, his best course subject of taxation, would be ""to sell 50 per cent, of the stock, allow 25 per cent, to die, and try to save the remaining 25 per cent. The expert -stock, the amount he received for it-would be so heavily taxed that, when the drought finally broke, he would have only enough capital left to enable him to buy about 20 per cent, of the original number. If the Minister thinks that that indicates prosperity he must have a very strange outlook. He must know thai the farmers attend stock sales for two reasons. The first is the effect of heavy taxation. The second is that their only means of livelihood is the raising of stock. Whenever farmers sell stock they must' buy more. The severity of taxation has also caused a shortage of stock. Numbers have decreased year by year, until to-day it is almost impossible to obtain new stock. The result is that buyers must pay fantastic prices in order to replenish tlieir herds and flocks. Statistics tell the :sad story. As an example, I -refer to figures for Queensland,, which I have taken from the Year Book. In 1942-43, the number of cattle and heifers in Queensland was 1,308,780. By 1946-47, the total had .decreased to 1,123,273'.",21,Second Reading

In 1947, the total corporated in the Constitution whioh gave was only 15S,203, representing a reduction since 1943 of 32 per cent. What are the reasons for this decline? 'Obviously, taxation has been a very important factor. Shortage of labour is .another factor. Unsatisfactory living -conditions in such areas do not entice people to go tbere to live and work. Provernment in the 'thirties. There are two duction figures in the dairying industry .also show an alarming decline. Referring .again to Queensland, production of butter in that State in 1942-43 amounted to 49,782 tons. In 1946-47, the last year for which complete statistics are available, the amount was 33,068 tons. I know that droughts have aggravated the situation, but, even allowing for their -effects, the. best that can be said is that production is only being maintained. Milk production in Queensland in 1938-39 totalled 347,336,000 gallons. In 1939-40. when the number of cattle in production was greater tban in 1938-39, the total was only 325,344,000 gallons. The number of cattle increased after 1938-39 until it reached a total of 1,308,780 in 1942-43, after which there -was a gradual decline. I shall compare the milk production figures for 1938-39 .and 1939-40 with those of 1946-47. In 1946-47, only 204,863,000 gallons were produced. If this trend continues, the -Government will have to buy an additional fleet of transport aircraft in order to bring milk from New Zealand to supply our population. .V Minister who can rejoice in this situation, .boasting of increased production and prosperity, must have a weird imagination indeed!

In fact, a provision was in.to the Commonwealth Parliament power to make laws relating to invalid and old age pensions.

Reductions were made in those pensions by the Scullin Gosides to every question. sioners' homes from them? than taking 5s. off their pensions? I say that it is not one-way traffic, and credii is also due to previous governments which improved social services. Does the Government desire to remain in a statir position? Is it not the function of any government to try to improve the position from year to year? Is it not a condition of election to the governmem benches that the honourable members concerned shall be progressive in relation to social services, conditions governing primary production, and in any other direction possible? The Government i so devoid of good works that it musi continue to live in the 'thirties, or in Adam's age, to try and justify its presen: position. I do not want to be misunderstood.

The Government does not want to hand the profits back, but desires co retain them and treat them as government revenue. opposes everything! be based on world prices. That applies to beef and every other product. I wish to deal with dairying. The Minister claimed credit for securing the price of 2s. per lb. for butter. I should like to cite a few facts. I have referred to the decline in dairy cattle and che number of calves that are reared, which is a serious position if we want that industry to progress. I contend that the present price.of 2s. per lb. for butter is inadequate, and people will not go to the country because of the conditions prevailing. During World WarI . the dairymen received as high as 2s. 5d. per lb for butter. I may say that I have known the hardships of dairying, because I have been a dairyman. In fact, I still have a dairy on my farm, hut I am not working it personally while I am representing the people in this Parliament. When the Scullin Government was in oifice, I received as little as 6d. per lb. for butter. cotton industry, but unfortunately, that was never in power. in power. During the years between 1919 and 1939-excludin g the period when 2s. 5d. per lb. was paid for butter, but including the disastrous period of the iScullin administration when only 6d. per lb. was paid-the average price for that commodity was 16.39d. per lb.; in the six years of World War II . the dairymen received an average of 15.44d. per lb -nearl y l d . less. I ask honourable members to take particular notice of those facts. The low prices being paid at thf beginning of the war were continued until Opposition members ultimately forced the Government to increase the price. The report by the advisory committee on production costs in the dairying industry. which was made by practical men of the industry, recommended that 2s. I j d . per lb. should be paid, but the Governmem did not adopt that recommendation The report covered all condition operating in the dairying industry, where people were required to work 56 hours a week. Such conditionare not applicable to the city. The public servants on the commission said. "" That is good enough for the serfs in the country; we want cheap butter "". The report was accepted iby the Government. The dairy-farmers bave to pay heavy taxation out of the 2s. per lb. received, and the result of the realization is not as good as previously. The Government should be prepared to face up to the position. dirty cowyard! people in the city expect everybody tc wallow in it so that they may have cheap food. The Government continues to hide its head behind its hands as the ostrich buries its head in the sand,, and takes m notice of the serious decline of the industry. I say that, in order to assess the position correctly, we must have regard to the quantities being produced. Australia is, undoubtedly, losing money because of the reduction in exports, due tf the decline in production. Australia should have a flourishing industry is almost out of eixstence. The guaranteed price of only 15d. per lb... which this Government offers, prevents producers from growing cotton profitably The Tariff Board has investigated thisindustry on three or four occasions, and each time has recommended a price lower than the Government's guaranteed price. In 1939, the Menzies Government offered a guaranteed price of 15d. per lb., which,, at the time, was very satisfactory, and in the following season, the cotton cropwas the largest ever grown in Australia. In later reports, the Tariff Board recommended to this Government a price less-",23,Chifley

81,Mr Adeemann,"Yes, but tinthan 15d. per lb. Honourable members who study the basis of these recommendations, will see that the board believes that the industry should pay low wages. If members of the Tariff Board consider that peoplewill seek employment in the eotton industry for wages of 25s., £2 or £2 10s. a week, they are not worthy to hold their jobs. If the basic wage, which is payable to workers in secondary industries, were made applicable to employees ia primary industries, the guaranteed price of: 15s* per lb., would obviously be too' low. Eecently, the Government withdrew some of the subsidies that it had paid for several years on cotton goods imported from' Egypt. Although these goods cost a minimum of 32d. per lb., the Government expects Australians to grow cotton for 15d. per lb. In effect, the Government proclaims that it does not want a cotton industry in Australia . The market here for our cotton is almost unlimited. Our people urgently require cotton goods, but the Government, instead of encouraging the growing of cotton, prefers to pay subsidies on imported cotton goods. The growers have not been encouraged to increase production and reduce costs iby using machines. [ understand that two machines have been imported, and that a licence has been granted for the importation of a third. That will assist to improve the conditions, but unless the Government accedes to the recommendation of the Queensland Cotton Board of a fair price of 22d. per lb., practically no cotton will be grown in Australia. Primary producers, other than a few who grow it on a small scale as. a sideline to other primary products, because it suits them to do so, will not beinterested. Even by guaranteeing a price of 22d. per lb., the' Government would save lOd. a lb. compared with the cost of imported cotton goods. The. Minister for Commerce and Agriculture has made a statement upon the grain sorghum industry. another industry which he personally is sorghum should go to the growers; that is responsible for practically extinguishing to say, the growers alone should receive in Queensland. I make that. assertion in the benefit. Only the unsold grain the realization, that it is a serious one, but sorghum wasto be exported. Then the when we compare last year's production Minister for. Commerce and Agriculture with, this year's figure; thetruth of my made an attack, on the co-operative ifr. Adermann. assertion -will readily be seen. Production last year exceeded. 4,000,000' bushels, but this year it is less than 1,000,000 bushels, ©rought conditions cannot be blamed for the decline, although they may have aggravated the position slightly. I admit that, because I want to be fair. According to a statement issued by the Queensland Department of Agriculture, the planting of grain sorghum this year does not exceed 40 per cent, of last year's acreage. That proves my assertion. When the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture was asked to grant a licence to export surplus grain sorghum last year, he pretended that he desired to protect the interests of the growers. Honourable members on this side of the House made vigorous representations to the Minister in support of the granting of the licence, and we were obliged to battle for months before we were successful. After the Minister had repeatedly refused to accede to our requests, some of usapproached the Prime Minister( Mr Chifley), and. conferred with the right honourable gentleman and the Minister for the purpose of having the decision revoked. The advice which -had been tendered to the Minister was that, on the basis of the consumption, of grain sorghum during the first six months of the year, the balance of the crop would be required for domestic requirement? during the second six months. We pertinently reminded' the Minister that the first six months of the year had followed one of the worse droughts in Australia's history, while in the second six months the country had received bountiful rains, and the demand for grain sorghum had eased. All we wanted the Minister to tell.us was where markets for grain sorghum were, offering, overseas. When the licence was finally granted, it was too late' to encourage primary producers to plant large areas with grain 1 sorghum this year. We also urged that the net realizaThis is tions from the export of the surplus grain organ ization whicli had received the licence. He said, in effect, that the organization had made a bad mess of the business; that it had received a price of £24 a ton (Australian) at which price the merchant had made a profit of £9 a ton. One of the members of the board described that statement as a malicious lie. I shall relate the facts. The price received was £24 a ton (Australian); the price at which the grain sorghum was sold was£22 10s. a ton (sterling), which was equivalent to £28 2s. 6d. a ton (Australian). But the price at which the organization made a deal was on the basis of "" into store""; rhe price at which the grain sorghum was sold to the merchant who exported it was on a f.o.b. basis. The merchant had also to carry out certain services, and he received only £3 12s. 6d. a ton to cover all expenses. That answers the statement of the Minister. I read the report of his remarks in Hansard, and I desired to correct them. is supporting the middle man. kind. I remind the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction ( Mr Dedman) that 1 fought to establish the principie. that all a broker's fee, and will pass the the realizations should go to the growers, and that onl^ the unsold grain sorghum held by the growers should be exported. What did the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture do? Unknown to any one else, including the organization, he allowed a merchant at Wallangarra, in Queensland, to export 325 tons of grain sorghum, which he had probably bought for £7 or £8 a ton and sell it for about £28 a ton this making a net profit of dustry has almost been forced out of approximately £20 a ton. Who is supporting the middle man ? Obviously the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture is, because he allowed the middle man to make a profit of approximately £20 a ton on that sale. I challenge the Minister to resorghum. In view of the need for this fute that statement. I ask again, who is supporting the middle man? is. fectly well who is supporting the middle man. I wonder what is behind the action of the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture in allowing a merchant to export [05] grain sorghum outside the growers' organization, and in attacking the organization. PerhapsI should refer here to an interesting piece of Queensland history relating to this co-operative organization. It'handles this -business at cost without a brokerage fee. When the then wheat board decided to buy out a milling company in Queensland, at a price of £450,000 in order to make it a co-operative concern, the Queensland Lahour .Government, in which the present. Director-General of Agriculture, Mr Bulcock, was the Minister for Agriculture, introduced a bill designed to prevent the transaction. In effect, the Queensland Labour Government tried to make it a personal matter against the chairman of the board, in the hope of nullifying the deal. However, the organization persisted with its efforts and today it is an outstanding example of successful co-operation in Queensland. It can handle the sale of grain sorghum. The statement by the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture seems to me to he another attack on this co-operative organization. Why should an attack be made on a body that will handle grain sorghum without charging whole .of -the proceeds from the sale to the growers? Why should merchants be allowed to sell it and make a profit of £20 on each ton in so doing? All these matters require to be explained, and it will not do for the Minister merely to adopt a pious attitude and suggest that his actions are designed to protect the interests of the growers. The grain sorghum inexistence. A socialistic experiment is at present being undertaken in Queensland. The State government is to expend £2ji000.,000 and the British governmenl £500,000 on the production of grain commodity in the United Kingdom and otlier countries, I wish the experiment every success, hut all the grain sorghum that the vGovernment requires could have been produced this year by the farmers of Darling Downs, without using extra labour. The land on which the grain could have been grown is lying idle because the Government refused to",24,Chifley

I have often referred to the tobacco industry. On this occasion I shall content myself with saying that it is a pity that we do not grow more tobacco in Australia. The reason why we do not do so is that the price paid to the growers is not a profitable one. The Government tried to help by increasing the percentage payments, but the meth.od of handling and marketing the crop was faulty. The Government showed weakness when it allowed the tobacco combine to take charge. If it desires to save VII . of the Social Services Consolidation dollars it should encourage the production of more tobacco in Australia and thus avoid the necessity for imports from dollar areas. ""We can produce larger quantities of good quality leaf than we are doing at present. There has been a ! ong debate on the subject of wheat. opposite had the worse of it. growers had the worse of it. So far as the Minister's statement on wheat is concerned, I need only to refer to the lost opportunity to export wheat from Australia because, owing to the Government's policy of restricting the quantities that ""ould be grown, not enough was produced. might deal with the peanut industry. He knows more about that than about wheat. eo deal with an industiy in which I am personally interested, because it might be thought that I was "" flying a kite "". [ can deal with it as occasion arises, and three months or longer. If a worker in a have done so. However, I say in passing that had it not been for the fight that I waged in this House, there would have been no market to-day for peanuts. The Government sought to divert the entire Australian crop to the manufacturers of peanut oil. It reduced by l d . a lb. the price paid by the manufacturers to the growers, but no corresponding benefit was given to consumers. That reduction of the price reduced the growers' return by £80,000, of which £40,000 was reimbursed to them by the Treasury. The price fixed by the Prices Branch operated Had the Government only in relation to the growers' co-operative organization. Anybody outside the organization could sell at a higher price, but the Prices Branch, which only wanted to hamstring a co-operative organization acting on behalf of the growers, did not worry about that. I want now to deal with unemployment and sickness benefits. In a question addressed to the Minister representing the Minister for Health recently, I suggested that it was necessary to amend the act governing the payment of these benefits because some employees did not lodge their applications within the prescribed period and in consequence received no payment. Pari Act of 1947 provides for the payment of sickness benefits from and including the seventh day after the day on which the claimant becomes temporarily incapacitated for work, provided the claim if lodged within six weeks of that day. The Minister replied that he thought that sufficient latitude to deal with late applications was allowed to those administering the act, hut cases which have been brought to my notice since then show that there is no elasticity. The country employee, in particular, is penalized because of his ignorance of the provisions of the act. Conditions in the city are different because there men congregate together and are able to acquaint one another with the provisions of various acts of Parliament that affect them. The act should be amended so thai workers in country districts who have the misfortune to fall ill and do not lodge their applications within the prescribed time, shall not be penalized. I suggest that the period should be extended to country district becomes ill , his wife is at her wit's end to keep the home going while he is away in hospital. When he returns to his home, his first thought is to ease his wife's distress and get conditions in the home back to normal.

Mrs. BLACKBURN (Bourke) [12.12]. -This debate provides me with au opportunity to add"" something to the remarks, made earlier in the debale by the honourable member for Hunter( Mr James). I support his appeal for aoiincreaseof pensions, ancl the abolition of the meansi test. Honourable members representing industrial districts have a more intimate knowledge of the need's of the workers than haveother honorablememhers,, and I believe that Australia is sufficiently prosperous to provide adequately for every one livingin it. We have frequently been told that the workers are better off now than ever before in the history of the country, and that the Government has raised pensions and improved social services. That, of course, is true, but the net gain to pensioners is very little. Prices have risen so much that the pound' is not worth nearly as much as before. In fact, I should say that a pension of 37s. 6'd. a week is to-day worth no more than one of 25s. or 27s. 6d. before the-war. High wages were received by the workers dairing the war, but in many instances, they served only to re-establish tliose who had suffered during-the depression. In any case, the workershad little to spend their money on during the war because goods were not available. The money they saved to provid'e themselves with homes is now not enough fbr the purpose, because of the extravagant increase of building costs. It will take them years of saving to make up fbr the increased cost of building. Those who have acquired homes, at. inflated prices, will suffer severely if a depression-, comes.. Many of those without their own homes have had to pay out a large part of their wages in rent, because rents are outof alt proportion to incomes. Many workers have had which have none of the labour-saving devices which,, it is claimed,, the workers are enjoying. Therefore, when it is said, that workers to-day are much better off than formerly I feel bound to trial areas there is little or no evidence to support the statement. There is still anxiety and an ever-present fear of another depression. Rents ai'e high, and with the failure of the Government'sueferendum, proposals, they will be higher stiil. High rents affect particularly those ioL-the lower fixed income groups. I have pointed out on a number of occasions that age pensioners are being hard, hit by high rents. Other memhers of the Parliament including the honourable member for Hunter, and Senator Tangney have alsodrawn attention' to this f act.

109,Mr Deputy,"she was informed 'by the Minister for Social Services (Senator McKenna) that any person who believed that he was being charged an excessive rent could take the matter to the Rent Controller. That assurance, however, is of little comfort when we recall that two age pensioners in Sydney, who protested against an increase of the rent for the small cubicles that they occupied, were forcibly' evicted and found themselves without any accommodation at all. These things leave an unpleasant taste in the mouth. Recently, at one of the Melbourne city courts, every one of 104 cases listed for hearing, involved the eviction of a tenant. There is nowhere else for these people to go. It is urgent that the represents their homes, but while it stands Commonwealth and State governments should make more adequate provision for the housing of aged people. All the available institutions are full, or as full own their own homes. This seems to me, as their staffs will permit; yet many pitiand to them, an unnecessary hardship. ful cases are creating a problem that no authority is attempting to solve. This means that there is an ever-present sore spot in our community in spite of the social services now provided. In contemplating this problem, I draw enough to acquire homes, others, through the attention of honourable members to a no fault of their own, have not had an pamphlet through the Carnegie Endowment for have some part of the necessary capital International Peace.

For the aged and the sick, care, and with the health implications of there should be higher pensions side by the greatest factor in promoting disease side with an adjustment of the remunerain the world to-day-the problem of tions of those in the low fixed income poverty"". It is said that there is no groups. I receive a number of letters on poverty in Australia to-day and that this matter, but I shall quote only from people are much better off than they have one. It was written by the secretary of over been before. But I know that there is poverty in Australia. I have urged the abolition of the means test; I do so again. If it is impracticable at present to abolish the means test altogether, surely its operation could be modified. Every week people approach me on these matters. I receive letters from pensioners and would be pensioners not only in my own constituency, but also throughout the Commonwealth. There are elderly persons, including widows, who have a few war bonds and have been waiting for an opportunity to buy homes for themselves. The money that they have saved to tlieir credit, they are ineligible for a pension. If they are forced to live on their small capital they will never be able to By relaxing the provisions of the means test, these people could be made eligible for pensions, thus placing them in a similar position to others who already own their own homes. The only difference is that whereas some have been fortunate recently made available opportunity to do this, although they To plead that the majority of the The article defines who live on low fixed incomes. Many of the Retired State Employees Association and it is relevant to my remarks. The writer saysThe members of the above association desire to bring before your notice the fact that the Commonwealth means test on social services has in many cases deprived them of the 25 per cent, cost-of-living increase granted by the Hollway Government. When we got our 25 per cent, increase on superannuation pension to meet the increased cost of living, those of us receiving any portion projects which are absorbing extraof the widow's, invalid or old-age pension, had that pension reduced by 25 per cent, owing to the means test. This means that tbe Commonwealth revenue got our increase. I have received similar letters from other associations of superannuated omcers who are living on what may he termed the ""'bread and jam line"". Recently, I referred to the living allowance paid to reconstruction trainees. In reply, the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction ( Mr Dedman) claimed that this allowance was more than the basic wage; but in the State of Victoria the allowance has been at least 2s. a week less than the basic wage, and since the recent increase of .that wage, the disparity has been even greater. I do not know of any adjustment having been made in the allowance corresponding to the increase of the basic wage. People living on the reconstruction training allowance are unable to pay the higher rents charged in the inner suburbs of our cities, and have to live in the outer districts. This means the payment of increased fares, for which the fares granted in the allowance is totally inadequate. That further increases their general expenses. ""Whilst the provisions of adequate housing for the people is part of the platform and policy of the Labour party,, and is regarded by the World Health Organization as fundamental to community health, we have not yet made much headway with the construction of homes in this country. It can safely be said that in any year the number of houses constructed has not equalled the number of marriages. The lag still remains because sufficient homes have not been built. In Victoria alone the State Housing Commission has a waiting list of over 30,000 home-seekers, and no emergency accommodation is provided for those who are evicted from time to time. Evictions frequently take Hrs. Blackburn. place when houses are sold over the lieads of the tenants. I know of a great number of cases of that kind in my electorate. Many of the people evicted have families of young children. The shortage of housing is always attributed to a shortage of materials and labour; but a large volume of housing material and a proportion of building labour is being used by the Department of Defence on ordinary sums of the taxpayers' money. Consequently, many of our youngest generation are being allowed to pass through infancy and adolescence without a home, and the care which a home represents. In order to do justice to the children of families that cannot obtain houses-and their number runs into thousands-the Government should make a special grant to provide more nurseries, creches and other pre-school centres which could help to offset this evil. If we have the regard for the population of this country which we claim to have the Government would not hesitate to follow that course. These matters are even more urgent than increasing the flow of migrants from overseas, or the housing and entertainment .of royalty. I say that without prejudice. Finally, I point out that although it may be said that to-day our people generally are in better circumstances, the fact remains that at both ends of the age scale there are cases of extreme hardship. The very old cannot live decently on the present rates of pensions, and much less can those who are infirm, whilst in many instances babies are turned out of the hospitals where they are born within three, or five, days. The claims of those people are not recognized by any government in the provision of shelter and home-life. I urge the Government to give consideration to their needs. Mr O'CONNOR (West Sydney) [12.29] -The Opposition has taken advantage of this debate to recapitulate everything that it has thrown against the Government during the last eighteen months. Its members have attacked the Government with respect to its taxation policy, and have made an unwarranted attack upon, the conciliation commissioners. They had much to say about strikes, but they omitted to say anything about the attitude being adopted by the British Medical Association in relation to the Government's free medicine scheme. With respect to taxation, it is, indeed, interesting to note from the criticisms offered by honourable members opposite that the ordinary individuals in the community would receive very little benefit under their proposals; the people who would benefit from any relief that was provided by them would be those in the higher ranges of income. Consequently, the ordinary citizen will pay very little attention to honourable members opposite. The honourable member for Parramatta ( Mr Beale) made an unwarranted attack upon the conciliation commissioners appointed under the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act. The purpose of that measure was to streamline industrial arbitration, and from the time it was implemented it has, despite certain deficiencies, justified itself not only because it has streamlined industrial .arbitration but also because it has been the means of establishing more cordial relations between employer and employee than existed previously. When the bill was before the House the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Menzies) and other legal honourable gentlemen opposite pointedly criticized the possible appointees. The theme of their song on that occasion was that only persons who had legal training should be appointed to those positions, that is, persons who had graduated at universities and were able to use the letters LL.B. after their names. However, the Government made a wise choice, and the appointees have justified their appointment. Industrial arbitration does not call merely for interpretation of the law; it requires arbitrators who, themselves, have experienced the conditions existing in industry. The men who were appointed as conciliation commissioners had spent many years in industry, whilst many of them had had considerable experience as trade union movement advocates before industrial tribunals. On that ground alone, the appointees are admirably equipped for their work. From the day of their appointment they have helped considerably to improve relations between employer and employee. It is amazing that at a time like the present, when we are enjoying industrial tranquility, the honourable member for Parramatta ( Mr Beale), being unable to cite any disturbance in recent months, should deal with industrial unrest which existed as far back as November last. That was typical of his indictment of the Government. However, when he chose to fall back upon events which happened in November, my mind went back. to the position which existed on the Sydney waterfront in December. At that time. I referred to the dislocation on the waterfront resulting from action taken by the Metal Trades Employers Association of New South Wales. I again refer to it because of the criticism made by honorahle members opposite in this debate, and to show that industrial disruption is not caused solely by trade unionists. In December last every shop on the Balmain waterfront was closed as the result of action taken by the employers. For workers engaged on the Balmain waterfront last Christmas was a black Christmas, indeed. Small employers who did not want to be drawn into the dispute were forced by Mr Fowler, the secretary of the Metal Trades Employers Association, to enter into it. Many of those employers approached me personally and told me that they were not involved in the dispute, but had been instructed by Mr Fowler to close their shops. That dispute originated over a matter concerning the crane drivers at Poole and Steel's works and it was deliberately extended to all employers on the waterfront. The dispute lasted seven weeks, but from the point of view of the workers concerned it was not merely a matter of loss of employment for weeks, or even months. That close down seriously affected their livelihood and, at the same time it had grave repercussions on production in this country. That dispute, I repeat, was not brought about by trade unionists but was deliberately engineered by employers. It is interesting to comment on the silence of the Opposition on the attitude bf tbe British Medical Association to the Government's free medicine scheme. Its silence was paralleled by that of the press and the radio stations of Australia, which, until the last few weeks, suppressed statements made on the subject by the Minister for Health (Senator McKenna). The Government has made several approaches to the British Medical Association with a view to ironing out satisfactorily the differences between them on the subject of free medicine, but the association has taken the attitude ef "" This is our stand!"" The Minister for Health suggested some time ago to the Association that it should appoint three representatives to confer with three nominees of the Government on the difficulties, but the association has refused to co-operate. Its policy is a deliberate attempt to destroy the efforts of the Government to give to the people the free medicine that is their right. Many varying opinions have been expressed about the British Medical Association-peopl e are entitled to their own opinions-bu t my opinion of it is that it consists of prostatement made by one doctor, it is suffessional mediocrities who bask in the reflected glory of a few eminent men in the medical profession. Mr ""WHITE -Nonsense! Mr O'CONNOR I say that quite definitely, because I believe that the British Medical Association in Australia exerts an influence out of proportion to its standing and Avithout parallel in any other British community. The British Medical Association in England does not wield an influence so powerful as that wielded by its counterpart in Australia. The attitude taken :hy the Australian association on the subject of free medicine is dictated, not by ethical instincts, but by commercial instincts. It is frightening to reflect that because of perversity of the British Medical Association people on low wages and pensioners are deprived of the right to get for nothing such drugs as those in the sulfa group, which, if prescribed for them on other than the Government form that entitles them to the free service, cost them from 10s. to 15s. a time. It has happened before, and it will happen again, unless the association's attitude softens, that people who have saved £200 or £300 against their retirement have lost the lot in paying doctors, hospitals and chemists. The Government has removed from people's minds the menace of hospital hills. The hospital benefits scheme, with which about 97 per cent, of the hospitals in Australia have become affiliated, entitles public ward patients to absolutely free treatment and patients in intermediate and private wards to a reduction of their bills by £2 2s. a week. Now, when the Government proposes a sound scheme to remove from their minds the menace of chemists' bills, the members of the British Medical Association ruthlessly stand in the way of that most desirable objective. Its attitude is incomprehensible. According to the press to-day, more than, one-third of the prescriptions dispensed since the 1st June would have been free had doctors used the Gommonwealth Government's prescription form. The formulary covers 672 prescriptions and, according to a ficiently wide to cover 85 per cent, of normal prescriptions. The Government will not resort . toconscrip tion; it asks the doctors to support the scheme of their own volition. Australia is not the first coimtry to introduce a free medicine scheme. Similar schemes exist in other countries. The system has operated in New Zealand for a long time. The formulary adopted by the Government is designed to avoid the abuses that have crept into the New Zealand scheme. I hope that a spirit of tolerance will prevail among the doctors and that they will soon realize their responsibilities and co-operate with the Government. They should be aware that their lack of cooperation is antagonizing the people. J commend the scheme to the medical profession and congratulate the Government on having removed from people's minds the fear that long periods of illness will swallow up their savings in hospital fees and medical charges. adjourned.
