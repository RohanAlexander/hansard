In view of his claim that the Government's failure to increase child endowment once ih the past twelve years is justified because the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission fixes the basic wage on the ability of indussures are being taken to combat the spread try to pay, I ask whether it is not true that in 1960 the commission granted no increase in the basic wage at all; that in 1961 an increase of 12s. was made to meet increased living costs only; and that, in any case, the wage fixed by the commission is based on the needs of a man, his wife and one child only. If all thisbe true why, then, does the Government continue to refuse toincrease child endowmentpayments to the 1,300,000 Australian mothers who are entitled to receive them? the Opposition has employed his own words to give a shorthand account of the reply that I made to a question addressed to me yesterday. Having done so, the honourable gentleman went on with an argument which, I confess, I could not follow very ciliation and Arbitration Commission, in capacity of the economy to pay.

But if they require any assistance from the Commonwealth Department of Health, we shall be glad to give it. question to the Prime Minister. Two years ago, the right honourable gentleman agreed with the Queensland Premier that Queensland would pay to the Commonwealth interest on the loan for the Mount Isa railway at the rate from time to time determined by the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development for new loans of not less than twenty years' currency. I ask the right honourable gentleman: Since the world bank rate of interest is now 6 per cent., will Queensland stiU be obliged goods to Ghana. It is spread over a very to pay this rate, or will the State Government be permitted to pay the lower rate required of Western Australia under arrangements made within the last month, or the still lower rate required of New South Wales and Victoria under the arrangements made three years ago for the railway from Albury to Melbourne? will be gratified to know that, the better part of two years ago, at the request of the Queensland Government, we agreed not to apply the ruling rate fixed by the Interaddition to being registered for employment, national Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and that we fixed a rate of interest in complete agreement with the Queensland Government. I am sorry that the honourable member has not been able to hear of that during the last two years. Minister a question. In view of the humane attitude adopted by the Australian Wheat Board on behalf of the Australian wheat growers in the sale of £27,000,000 worth of wheat to China to assist the Chinese in time of famine, and the inability of the Chinese Government to pay cash, can the right honourable gentleman affirm whether honourable member for BanksI remind him the recent report of an interest-free loan that unemployment benefit is paid to those of some £8,000,000 by the Chinese to Ghana is correct? If the report is correct, how best can the people of Ghana be told that, in fact, the Australian wheat-growers are making possible this interest-free loan by selling wheat to China on credit? some inquiry about this matter. An agreement on economic and technical co-operation between Ghana and continental China, resulting from Dr. Nkrumah's visit to China, provided for a non-interest bearing loan to Ghana of £7,000,000 Ghanaian, which is equivalent to £8,250,000 Australian, to be advanced between 1962 and 1967-that is, over a period of five yearsand repaid within ten years from 1971. So it is not a very vast transaction, and it is certainly spread over a very long time. It is a restrictive loan and, indeed, it is in reality an agreement for an extended credit under which Peking, according to its capability, will supply technical assistance and certain long time stretching up to ten years from July, 1971, and I think that the honourable member may be assured that nobody could seriously say that this is beingfinancedby the Australian wheat-grower. the Minister for Social Services: Is there a provision in or under the social services legislation respecting unemployment benefit which insists that unemployed persons, in shall produce written evidence from employers that they have made efforts on their own part to obtain employment? I have a constituent with a wife and family who has been denied unemployment benefit on grounds connected with this, although he is without any sustenance. I appeal to the Minister for help in this case. In view of the fact that there are no employment vacancies registered at the Commonwealth Employment Office where this person is registered for employment, will the Minister take action to see that relief is immediately given so as to assist this family, which is facing starvation?",11,Outbreak Of Measles Among Aborigines

I think I am correct in saying that over the past ten years, more than £2,000,000,000 has been carried on the revenue budgets of this Parliament over and above the amounts which could be raised by way of loan for capital purposes. If, as part of this great programme of national development, we can secure finance additional to that which we can raise internally in this way, it will be a very valuable contribution to the productive development of Australia. Minister for Health. Is it true that the Tadio-active fall-out created by atmospheric nuclear bomb testings causes a harmful Consumption by human beings-particularl y -Children-of the poisonous substance iknown as strontium 90? Also is it true that the strontium content is heavier in the northern hemisphere than it is in the southern hemisphere? Has the Minister any information on the possible consequences to the health of the Australian people of the recent monstrous acts of the Soviet Union in resuming these tests? Dr. Speaker, strontium 90, or radio-active strontium, is a harmful substance if imbibed in sufficient amounts. It is a product of all known types of nuclear explosions, and the danger is in proportion to the amount of strontium that is liberated by an explosion. The honourable member asked me whether the strontium content was heavier in the northern hemisphere. For meteorological reasons, the fall-out tends to circulate in the air .in greater concentration in the northern hemisphere if the explosions take place there, than it does in the southern hemisphere. It is too early for us to have any information about the results of the explosions that have taken place in the past few days; but there is an extensive monitoring service operating throughout Australia by which samples of fall-out are taken, fhe results are processed by the Commonwealth X-ray and Radium Laboratory, which is a section of the Department of Health. That process is a continuous one, so we are kept constantly informed about the quantity of radio-active fall-out and the amount of it that is present in the Australian atmosphere and in Australia. Treasurer. Have the financial advisers of the Government, or have members of the Government, evidence that United Kingdom investment in Australia will diminish as a result of the special measures of the British Chancellor of the Exchequer restricting British investment abroad, or is there any reason to doubt that overseas investment in Australia will continue to increase in the next few years at the same rate as it has done in the past couple of years? What action, if any, does the Government intend to take to counter the effects of the curb on United Kingdom overseas investment? gendeman, in the latter portion of his question, asks generally whether there is reason to believe that there wdl be some decline in overseas investment in Austraha. There has been no evidence so far of any such decline, and we would believe that the stability of Australia and its growth at present would continue to attract investment, not only from the United Kingdom but to which until comparatively recent times were not substantial investors in Australia. So far as United Kingdom investment in Australia is concerned, developments arising from the entry of that country into tbe Common Market, if that were to take place, could have some bearing on the position. It may be that the most recent measures that have been taken there will also have some bearing. In this regard the position is not yet entirely clear, and I am looking forward to pursuing the matter further with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Mr Selwyn Lloyd, at the forthcoming meeting of Commonwealth Finance Ministers in Ghana.

Has the Minister received a report from his officers that the secretary of the Clothing Manufacturers Association claims that orders are now pouring in and that hundreds of workers are now needed? Is it true that factories will have to work overtime, at heavy penalty rates, to meet the rush of orders? Also, is it true that skilled machinists are scarce and that retailers will be lucky to get their full quotas before Christmas? Is this failure to place orders at the usual time due to Labour's disgraceful calamity campaign to cause fear and lack of confidence? that Mr Upjohn, of the Clothing Manufacturers Association, had stated that the industry now requires large numbers of employees, including technical employees. I am very glad that the honourable gentleman has brought that matter to the attention of the House. 1 understand that Mr consequent great loss of income and probUpjohn also said that unless the retailers get in with their orders now the manufacturers will not be able to fulfil the orders in time for the Christmas sales.

Labour and National Service whether he has had an opportunity to examine the circumstances associated with the present Mount Isa industrial unrest. Has he seen any evidence which would indicate the existence of a genuine industrial grievance, or, alternatively, is the unrest part and parcel of a pattern of political and economic unrest designed to further an ideology that finds little that is compatible in this country? last week in answer to a question asked by my friend, the honourable member for McPherson, I have kept in touch with the development of the industrial dispute at Mount Isa. I regret to say that go-slow and stop-work tactics have been adopted with the result that some observers have come to the conclusion that output there will be reduced by about 50 per cent, with ably unnecessary unemployment in the northern parts of this country. In answer to the second part of the honourable member's question, I think there are strong, but not conclusive, indications to suggest that there are political as well as industrial motives involved in this dispute. It would be regrettable if the sensible trade unions of this country became too closely identified with those elements which are bent on disruption rather than ensuring full employment and increasing output in the northern parts of this country.

It would also be conceded that the form which our system takes should allow for this to be the case. A democratic form of government, to most people, means the right to practise the four freedoms, the operation of the adult franchise with each vote having equal value, and free and secret elections at regular intervals, with the government for the time being consisting of the party or parties receiving the majority support. Australians certainly enjoy, to differing degrees, all of these.

56,Mr Stewart (Lang) [3.21],"MrHowever, the system adopted in Australia gives to the Government, through its Ministers, far greater facilities and privileges for informing itself and its members than is given to the Opposition. A party or parties elected to government immediately have at their disposal a neutral and efficient public service. Each Minister has a department. The department is under the control of a departmental head and consists of various sections to deal with such matters as policy, research, and administration. Each officer in the department owes loyalty to the departmental head and he, in turn, owes loyalty to his Minister. Each Minister, therefore, has under his direct control a complete organization-a n organization which can analyse, evaluate and appraise trends in the particular field covered by its activities. Every policy decision is based on submissions prepared after thorough research. Local and overseas statistics are dissected and examined. The Minister's every wish, suggestion, or query is answered by his departmental officers. The department has at its disposal the most up-to-date information available. All of this gives the Government, through its Ministers, a tremendous advantage over the Opposition-a n advantage so great as to be unfair. After all, the Opposition party or parties in any Federal Parliament would represent between 40 per cent, and 50 per cent, of the people. Yet, the only special staff which is provided for the Opposition is restricted to the Leader and Deputy Leader in the House and in the Senate. This staff is small and is expected to perform the same duties as the staff, not only of one department, but of the entire Commonwealth Public Service. It will undoubtedly be said that each member of Parliament should be capable of doing his own research and preparing material for his speeches. This could be the case if members of Parliament were allowed to devote sufficient time to this aspect of their duties. However, it must be admitted that very few members would survive many elections if they devoted the correct proDorMon of their time to research, study and preparation. The duties of members-and this has been recognized by the informed section of the community-deman d that they devote the greater proportion of their time to public relations. There are innumerable meetings of political, charitable and service organizations to address, constituents to advise and assist, and social functions to attend. Every member realizes that neglect of these matters would mean a very short term as a representative of the people. Votes are won in the electorate, not in this chamber. A survey of a cross-section of members of this chamber shows that between 50 per cent, and 80 per cent, of their time is devoted to electoral or public relations activities. This leaves very little time for the vastly more important activities of research, analysis of statistics, study of departmental reports and preparation of speeches for delivery in this place. Ministers, certainly, are called on to perform the same electoral and public relations activities as is the ordinary member, but they possess the distinct advantage of having a departmental and a personal staff to do the research which is necessary to keep them informed of the latest developments in their specialized fields. The ordinary member on the other hand, has to rely on his own resources, and, at the same time, is expected to have a thorough knowledge of all government policies and functions. Opposition members seldom know of the introduction of bills amending or introducing legislation prior to the bills being placed before us in this chamber. The details of such bills are never the property of the Opposition until a bill has been presented in this place. The debate on bills is rarely sufficiently delayed to allow an Opposition member to undertake proper research. The result is that the Opposition finds great difficulty in being as well informed on pending legislation as is the Government. This, in my view, creates a very serious fault in the operation of our democratic system. After all. an opposition in this Parliament represents almost half the people of Australia, and those people have every right to expect that their representatives shall have research facilities and assistance similar to those of members who support a government. This fault needs to be rectified if our democratic way of life is to keep pace with the other ideologies enunciated in various narts of the world. We believe in criticism and freedom of speech. Constructive criticism ensures the proper working of our democratic system, but constructive criticism cannot be voiced unless the Opposition is well informed. What, then, is the solution to our probtage over back-bench members on the Golem? First of all, we need to decide what vernment side, as the latter would still be are the functions of the Opposition. These, expected to perform their own research. I suggest, are-(1 ) to offer an alternative This need not be the case.

57,Mr Bland (Warringah) [3.32],"Mrencountered and to remedy the defects in administration. The committee was constituted under the Public Accounts Committee Act 1951, but it was not formally appointed until 1952. The reason for the delay was the opposition to the establishment of this committee that was .displayed by the present Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Calwell). He considered that the committee would not be independent and that, therefore, Labour ought not to be associated with it. I think that even he would readily admit now that his apprehensions were entirely ill founded. The Public Accounts Committee has been quite independent in its activities and has shown a degree of cohesion which, I think, is a model for other committees to follow. One has only to read the committee's reports to realize just how free it has been in conducting its business. I want to discuss some of the features of been made. That, of course, is one of the the Public Accounts Committee's activities handicaps that we have in the workings of and look at what has been done over the the committee: It deals with things of the period of almost ten years during which it past rather than things of the present.

The powers and functions of the Public whole of fhe work of the committee has Accounts Committee, as you, Mr Chairbeen directed to enhancing the power of the man, know, are set out in section 8 of Parliament to control the finances of the the Public Accounts Committee Act. With country. the concurrence of the committee, I incorporate the provisions of that section in Public Accounts Committee collaborates in "" Hansard "". They are as follows:The duties of the committee are(a) to examine the accounts of the receipts are the Public Service Board, the Audit and expenditure of the Commonwealth Office and the Treasury. The Public Serand each statement and report transvice Board was created to manage the public mitted to the Houses of the Parliament service, and it is concerned with recruitment by the Auditor-General in pursuance of sub-section (1.) of section fifty-three and organization in the various departments. of the Audit Act 1901-1950; i(ib) to report to iboth Houses of ithe Parliament, with such comment as .it .thinks fit, any items or matters in those accounts, statements and reports, or any circumstances connected with them, to which the Committee is of the opmion that the attention of the Parliament should be directed; (c) to report to both Houses of the Parliament any alteration which the Committee thinks desirable in the form of the public accounts or in the method of keeping them, or in the mode of receipt, control, issue or payment of public moneys; and (d) to inquire into any question in connection with the public accounts which is referred to it by either House of the Parliament, and to report to that House upon that question, and include such other duties as are assigned to the Committee by Joint Standing Orders approved by both Houses of the Parliament. The powers and functions of the committee relate to quite a series of matters, but they all deal with expenditure that has already We also had to decide the best way of able to control the finances of the Government than it is at the present time. The There are three agencies with which the its work and which, in effect, the Public Accounts Committee supplements. Those It is frequently under examination by the Public Accounts Committee in regard to matters which come before it. The Auditor-General is concerned with seeing that the accounts of the departments are kept honestly and efficiently. He provides a check upon regularity of departmental expenditure. The function of the Public Accounts Committee, in relation to the Auditor-General's reports, is to ensure that as far as possible the Government gets value for what is spent. A study of the report is important in that it shows the way in which the Public Accounts Committee has approached the problems that have confronted it. When the committee decides to investigate a department, it asks for statements showing its powers, its functions, the staff it employs, what kind of organization it operates and how much it costs to run the organization. The committee analyses the statements that it receives from a department covering those matters, and subjects the head of the -department, or a representative appointed by him to appear before the committee on his behalf, to an oral examination. Honourable members will see from the committee's fifty-third report that what the committee was concerned with in that particular inquiry was the adverse comments made by the Auditor-General in relation to the activities -of a number of departments. The Public Accounts Committee proceeded to examine these comments, and the Auditor-General supplemented the statements he had made in the report. The committee also took evidence from representatives of the departments concerned and as a result reached conclusions about the administrative defects which required rectification, and make recommendations accordingly. Honourable members will find set forth at the end of every one of the ten chapters the committee's conclusions and recommendations regarding the action which the committee felt should be taken if the defects were to be remedied. I should like to say a few words about the committee's operational procedure. Evidence is taken on oath. Originally the committee discussed at great length whether evidence should be taken on oath, and it finally decided to follow that procedure. The evidence is recorded and printed, and is circulated to the members. In addition to the record of evidence, great wads of material in the form of statements and exhibits are submitted to the committee. Those documents, the record of evidence, and the exhibits, provide a body of administrative data which would enable any body investigating the Public Service of the Commonwealth to see what the Public Service did and how it worked at this particular time. Any one studying the documents and exhibits submitted to the committee by departments, and examining the evidence taken on oath, can get a picture of the whole organization of the Public Service over a period of years. I think it can be said legitimately that the Public Accounts Committee, in the ten years it has operated, has won its spurs as an organ calculated to promote good government. I think it has had the confidence of all the Public Service and has won the respect pf the public and the Parliament. A complaint often made is that the reports of committees such as the Public Accounts Committee are simply put aside and not looked at again. The report submitted today by the chairman of the committee, the honourable member for Deakin( Mr Davis), shows the kind of thing that the committee has been doing. In this particular case, the committee has been, over a period of about five years, inquiring into the way in which the Estimates and Budget Papers ought to be prepared. Whether or not effect is to be given to the recommendations of the committee lies within the hands of the Parliament itself. The honourable member for Deakin has said, in effect, "" There is the material, and if the Parliament wishes to alter the procedure it is up to the Parliament itself to do so "". I hope that the Parliament will pay attention to that report, which has taken so much effort and so many years to compile. In order to ensure that the suggestions made by the committee would be heeded, the committee arranged with the Treasury that reports of the committee would be forwarded to the Treasurer, who himself would bring the matters dealt with under the notice of the departments concerned and ask for a report from them as to the action they intended .to take arising from the committee's suggestions. After replies have been received from the departments the Treasurer prepares a minute which the committee then transmits to the Parliament. Honourable members will find in the last part of the fifty-third report of the Public Accounts Committee an epitome of two of the reports which the committee has made, and the Treasurer's replies to the committee's comments and suggestions on what the Treasury has proposed to do in respect of the matters concerned. The Public Accounts Committee has placed one limitation upon itself. It will not deal with government policy, except indirectly. The committee looks at the results of policy and not at the actual policy. a report on procedure, which was circulated I commend the committee's report to honourable members, who, I hope, will find there something that will enable them to improve the working of the parliamentary system. of the Parliament operates under a set of standing orders that do not permit the full utilization of the experience and talents of honourable members. Not only do the Standing Orders stultify the endeavours of honourable members to give their best, but the size of the Parliament itself precludes members from taking a full part in debates. Because of limitations on debate members on both sides often feel frustrated. Even after a member has done a lot of research into a matter and would like to take part in a debate he can find that the limitations to which I refer prevent him from doing so. I do not blame the Government for this. The position is quite difficult. The Parliament sits for three days each week and each of the 124 members has something to say about almost every bill. 1 ask the Government to consider an alteration of the Standing Orders which would allow members to give a wider service to the community. I advocate now, as I have advocated for some years, an extension of the system of standing committees. At present, we have two standing committees, one on public works and the other on public accounts, but we do not go beyond that. My suggestion is by no means revolutionary, because other parliaments in Western democracies make a far greater use of the committee system than does the Australian Parliament. The United States of America uses the committee system extensively, but f admit that the constitution of the American Parliament and the American executive is different from ours. If we take a parliament that approximates our form of governmentI refer, of course, to the British Parliament-w e find that the Standing Orders of the House of Commons provide for the appointment of standing committees on bills. Some years ago, the then Clerk Assistant of this House, Mr Tregear, spent some time at the House of Commons learning the procedure and gaining experience in the methods adopted at the mother of parliaments. He furnished at that time. Part IV. of his report, which contains very valuable information, deals with standing committees on bills. Mr Tregear made many wise observations which should be considered seriously by this Parliament. He said that the Standing Orders of the House of Commons provide for the setting up of standing committees on bills. Each committee has a core of twenty members and the Committee of Selection is required to have regard to the composition of the House. In other words, the Government has a majority on the standing committees and that is reasonable. Mr Tregear reported that it is customary for the appropriate Minister to be appointed as a committee member. Thus, the Minister knows what is taking place when the contemplated legislation is being discussed by the committee. Mr Tregear adder! that work for the committees is well established. With the exception of tax bills, consolidated fund bills, appropriation bills and provisional order bills, all public bills are referred to a standing committee for the committee stage, unless the House otherwise orders. Obviously, the House would order otherwise frequently for a variety of reasons; the Government does not always want bills to be referred to a committee. In his conclusion on this subject, Mr Tregear saidThere is high merit in the Standing Committee System. It relieves the House of business, and consit'erable saving of time in the House can be effected by having a number of Standing Committees considering Bills simultaneously . . . Further, Members have more opportunities to participate in framing legislation . . . That is the point I make. Members should have a better opportunity to participate in",21,Estimates 1961 62
58,Mr Bird (Batman) [3.44],"This House the framing of legislation. A private member, of course, could not make much of a contribution, but no doubt the House of Commons has proved by experience that members do make valuable suggestions. Mr other side of the chamber sometimes have Tregear continuedFurther, Members have more opportunities to participate in framing legislation, especially those would frequently improve a bill. I do not who, by reason of their special qualifications, are appointed additional Members of Standing Committees . . . At Committee meetings, there is a "" let's get down to work"" atmosphere without undue hustle or bustle, full consideration being given to every point. The absence of Party feeling makes for speedy business. In fact, argument on some occasions is principally among Members of the same Party. The comments of Mr Tregear should be given weighty consideration. He understood the workings of this Parliament thoroughly, and he compared procedure here with the procedure of the House of Commons. In this matter of standing committees, we could certainly learn from the House of Commons. The procedure adopted there gives the ordinary member a chance to do something worthwhile. Here a member may sit day after day waiting for the opportunity to make perhaps only one speech in a week or a fortnight. I do not suggest that any highly controversial or contentious matter should be referred to committees. On these matters, political parties have a deliberate and premeditated course to pursue. With such a clear, unambiguous line of divergence, there is no hope of arriving at any agreement on any facet of such problems. On the other hand, numerous matters come before Parliament on which, in many respects, there is no great gulf of disagreement between the Government and the Opposition. At present, it is only on very rare occasions that the Government will accept any Opposition amendment to a bill. I have been here for twelve years and 1 can recall only three Opposition amendments that have been accepted by the Government in that time. On the other hand, the "" Hansard"" reports of the proceedings of the Victorian Parliament show that frequently the Government, whether a Labour government or a Liberal government, will accept an amendment from the Opposition. There seems to be some unwritten rule in this Parliament that any amendment suggested by an Opposition member must be condemned because it comes from the Opposition. This attitude acts to the detriment of the Australian people. No government can claim that all the wisdom of the world resides in its ranks; members on the worthwhile and meritorious suggestions to make, and the adoption of these suggestions indict this Government any more than the previous Government. All governments in the Federal Parliament for many years have taken the stand that no amendment of any kind coming from the Opposition will be accepted. That attitude is to be deplored. A provision that bills be referred to a standing committee would give members a chance to make some worthwhile contribution to the framing of legislation. I first became enamoured of the committee system when 1 was a member of a municipal council. I found that people representing all sections of thought in the community could sit at a committee table and hammer out ideas that would be of benefit to the ratepayers. My views on committees were reinforced when I became a member of the Public Works Committee of this Parliament. This committee produced, and still produces, positive and tangible results. It has a non-party approach in considering the numerous projects that are the responsibility of the Parliament. The Government, of course, rightly has a majority on the committee, but the members discuss the merits of a proposal without regard to political allegiance. I must say that during the time. I was a member of the Public Works Committee, no member opposed a suggestion put by any other member simply because it came from a member of the opposite political party. That is not the attitude adopted in this chamber. Any suggestion made here is immediately opposed by a member of the opposite party, but any suggestion made in the Public Works Committee is discussed entirely on its merits. The functioning of this committee has been to the distinct advantage of the Australian people. During the last war, the Joint Committee on War Expenditure was set up by this Parliament. It consisted of members from both sides of the Parliament and it had the responsibility of examining expenditure before it was incurred. The committee had the right to make suggestions as to whether the expenditure was wise. To-day, the procedure is for the Estimates to be prepared and served up to members in book form. The figures cannot be disputed. At the end of the war, the suggestion was made that the Joint Committee on War Expenditure should continue its activities in peacetime. I understand that the Treasurer ( Mr is that members of the Opposition, whatHarold Holt) was a member of this wartime committee. Apparently nothing was done by the previous Government or by this Government to continue the activities of the committee. I honestly believe that if a joint committee were set up to discuss the Estimates before they came before honourable members in their present form, a considerable saving to the Australian people would be effected. I suggest that standing committees would improve the parliamentary machine and give added strength to the democratic system. In this age and generation, when we are being assailed by a totalitarian form of government in the shape of communism, we should do all in our power to strengthen the parliamentary machine as we know it. When we attend in this chamber we have bills put before us. The Government has already decided that they must go through before any Opposition member makes a point at all. It seems that democracy would be better served if all the people were given a say in the preparation of the bill. The Government has a majority in all the standing committees to which I have referred and obviously it can say whether a suggestion should be adopted or rejected. The committees that I suggest should be set up could consider many matters and make a well-reasoned approach to national problems without the emphasis of any particular political outlook. Some of the subjects that could be delegated to committees are social services, transport, radio and television, primary production, immigration, national development and housing. There are numerous others, but they are subjects on which there is not such a wide divergence of opinion between the parties, and I believe that some Opposition members could make sensible suggestions on bills dealing with those matters which could be embodied in the legislation. At present, the only chance that an Opposition member has to submit an amendment is in the committee stage, and he has not a ten million to one chance of having it accepted. If we had committees as the House of Commons does, the Minister in charge of a bill would attend the hearings and the Government would have a majority of the members. The experience in Great Britain ever party they belong to, frequently make very good suggestions before a bill goes to the House. The committee can make recommendations, but it is for the government to accept or reject them, just as is done in this Parliament in respect of the Public Works Committee. If the government does not wish to accept a recommendation made by the Opposition, it has the right to refuse. AllI am suggesting is that these standing committees would function in this respect on the same basis as does the Public Works Committee. In addition, any decisions of a standing: committee would be made on balanced conclusions arrived at in the atmosphere of the committee room beyond the influence of heat and rancor often experienced in the Parliament. Such a system would lead to a better approach to many national problems. Under our system, a government might bring forward legislation which has many defects. While it might be sound basically in many respects, it could certainly be improved if suggestions from the Opposition were accepted. A government does not accept any suggestions from the Opposition on the floor of this chamber, but I am satisfied that if the legislation was discussed in a committee room before the bill was finally framed much useful information could be imparted by the Opposition to the Government. The Government could realize the sense of the proposition and it could become part and parcel of the bill to be presented to the House. Other parliaments use the committee system to a far greater extent than we do, and surely we should not be so swollenheaded that we cannot learn from anybody else. Nobody can say with truth that the talent of members of this Parliament is used to the full extent. We sit here day after day or we wait outside because we do not have a chance to speak in the House owinq to the limitation of time. The standing committees would meet outside the parliamentary sitting hours as they do in -the House of Commons. They sit for certain hours on certain days of the week and meet regularly throughout the parliamentary session. able member's time has expired. that last yeaT I followed the honourable member for Batman( Mr Bird) in speaking on these estimates and, as on that occasion, I have been impressed with the sincerity of the arguments he has put forward. I am sure that he is desirous of seeing the Parliamind, and support my friend and colleague, ment work in the smoothest and most efficient way that can be devised and that he wants to help it to do so; but I do join issue of the work of the Public Accounts Comwith him on one or two points he made regarding the use of committees and on amendments and the acceptance of amendments put forward by members of the Opposition. First, the honourable member made reference to the present Standing Orders of the House which, as he would know, are under review. The review has not been completed yet but as he would also know, the members of the Standing Orders Committee infdude some honourable members from the Opposition side as Well as members from 'the Government side. I suggest that the honourable member put forward to the representatives of his party who sit on that Standing Orders Committee any special ideas he by the honourable member for Batman in has for the better working of the Parliament. relation to the use of committees, I cannot I know very well that the report prepared help feeling that this argument would have by a former Clerk of the House, Mr been greatly strengthened had he been able Tregear, and to which the honourable memto point to the fact that the Opposition joins ber referred, has a tremendous amount of with the Government in the Foreign Affairs very valuable and useful information in it; Committee. but I think we should be a little cautious in drawing a comparison between the operations of the House of Commons and the House of Representatives. The House of Commons has well over 600 members and, Committee was established a number of in fact, can seat only approximately half years ago under Mr Casey, as he was then, of those members at any one time, whereas as Minister for External Affairs. It has this House has 124 members and we are operated for quite a number of years and able to seat every one of them. That does not mean that I am opposed been kept open for members of the Opposiin any way to the strengthening of the comtion who would care to sit on that commitmittee system where it can be suitably tee. It was established as a joint committee worked out. There are a number of standand it is still a joint committee, but unfortuing committees which operate very successnately the Opposition has not seen fit to join fully and very efficiently. There are also a it. The result has been that the seats that great many other committees which the have been kept open for members of the general public outside do not hear about and know nothing of. They function on the Government side as well as on the Opposition side. I know that there are many private members' committees operating in relation to different subjects and different departments on the Opposition side of the chamber and most of us, if not all of us. on the Government side are members of two or three and more committees dealing with particular subjects in which we are interested. I would add this point while it is in my the honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Bland) in his remarks concerning the value mittee of which the honourable member himself was a distinguished chairman. The honourable member modestly did not mention that. Knowing him as we do, we realize that he would not give himself any credit for the work that he has done over the years, but those who have read the reports of the Public Accounts Committee and know the work that has been done by him and other members of this Parliament, feel that we owe a debt to him and the present chairman, the honourable member for Deakin( Mr Davis) for the thought, time and work that they have expended in the nation's interests in watching the public accounts. Going back to another point put forward and I excluded such committees. during the whole of that time, seats have",24,Estimates 1961 62

62,Mr Drury,"The Foreign AffairsOpposition have had to be temporarily occupied by members from the Government side. I hope that in the fullness of time honourable members opposite, in their wisdom, will decide to join the Foreign Affairs Committee and take part in its deliberations. I agree with the honourable member for Batman that there are some subjects-and I believe foreign affairs should be one of them -in respect of which we should have a great degree of unanimity of thought and approach. If we could be satisfied that honourable members would bring a reasonable unity of approach to their consideration accurate that I believe it worthwhile to of foreign affairs, then I am sure that the Foreign Affairs Committee would be very greatly strengthened by the appointment to it of honourable members of the Australian Labour Party. I further agree with the honourable member for Batman that it is a pity there are not more occasions on which we can have discussions on a non-party basis. There are many matters on which we can meet on common ground. An outstanding illustration is in the field of matrimonial law. I remind the committee that within the last year or two we have had two extremely important and comprehensive debates on matrimonial causes legislation, each of which has been conducted on strictly non-party lines. I am reminded of another point made by the honourable member for Batman. He claimed that during the years in which he has sat in this chamber only three amendments to proposed legislation, put forward by the Opposition, have been accepted by the Government. While in no way detracting from the honourable member's integrity of purpose, I challenge the accuracy of his statement. It is perfectly true that many amendments proposed by the Opposition are not accepted by the Government, because they are not politically acceptable. This is understandable, because the whole political philosophy of the Opposition is quite different, in many ways, from that of the Government. I believe, however, that if the records were analysed it would be found that a great many more than three amendments have been accepted by the Government over the period to which the honourable member has referred. In the field of matrimonial law, to which I have just referred, I think the Attorney-General( Sir Garfield Barwickl accepted a number of amendments suggested by the Opposition. The Estimates show that a total amount of £1,322,000 has been appropriated for the Parliament for the financial year 1961-62. This is a little less than the actual amount spent last year. I think we must all agree that the cost to the nation of this Parliament is very low. In a speech I made on a previous occasion I gave the result of a check I had made to establish the cost of the Parliament to each individual in the community. The figures are still so nearly repeat them. It costs the tax-paying population just over 5s. a head to maintain this national Parliament. Speaking in terms of total population the cost is about 2s. 6d a head. Nobody could say that Parliament is a costly institution, particularly when one has regard to the tremendous importance of this democratic institution in the life of the country, and when one considers what would be the alternative to the democratic, parliamentary way of government. It is popular in some quarters, of course, to decry and belittle parliaments, but every one of us in this chamber has been elected under the well-known and well-tried method of the secret ballot. Those who may, perhaps, be tempted to criticize this Parliament as an institution should remember that they are really criticizing the electors who sent us here. The Parliament, of course, has its faults, and I would like to put forward one or two suggestions for improving it. I do not claim that these are by any means the only suggestions that could be made, because parliament as an institution has been evolving for many hundreds of years. The copy of Magna Carta in King's Hall, a copy which dates back nearly 700 years, is a constant reminder of the antiquity of parliaments and the great traditions and customs that we are fortunate in this country to have inherited from the mother country. I believe that criticism of parliament should at all times be fair, honest and constructive. If criticism of this Parliament meets those requirements then I believe it plays an important and helpful part in the running of the affairs of the country and of the Parliament. There is, of course, a tremendous responsibility on every one of us who sits here to uphold the parliamentary traditions, and not to do anything to besmirch the good name to be repeated. They appear on page 2, in and prestige of the National Parliament. the foreword written by the President and Sometimes, perhaps, we do not measure up the Speakerto the required standards, and I think that on an occasion such as this, when we are are more easily lost than won, and that we all have indulging in a purely non-party debate on a duty to guard and sustain those precious privileges the Estimates for the Parliament, it is system salutory to remind ourselves of the responsibility that rests on the shoulders of every I suggest that the Government should conone of us.

65,Mr Haylen,"No, but you watch thethe gallery. We have here a little tendency -sometime s more than a little tendencyto isolate ourselves from the people who own this Parliament and who are our masters. Last night I asked one of my colleagues why so many people come in with no stronger an invitation than their enthusiasm to watch and hear us at work, and he replied that their visits here are on the same traditions. The National Parliament is not basis as visits to the zoo to see the hippopotamus. People go to the zoo to see the hippopotamus to be convinced that there is such an animal, and after that they never go again. That statement may have some basis of truth, but I hope that our visitors will not take it too literally; I hope they will come again. Because of our limited accommodation visitors sometimes find that they are in thtop gallery. Last night I was very distressed and embarrassed because of an incident that happened to me. A man who has country interests and had been on his farm, although he lives in the city, came to me with his daughter to obtain admission tickets. Naturally, I went to the Speaker's secretary and obtained two tickets for the Speaker's Gallery for my guests. When we went to the door there was a fine flurry of excitement. An extraordinary thing had happened. The man was wearing a turtle-neck sweater and the very beautiful girl was wearing slacks so it was explained to me in nervous excited English that I had made a faux pas. Men who wear a jersey and girls who wear slacks are distinctly for upstairs, and women who wear mink reeking of mothballs are distinctly for downstairs. Well, I have been here for eighteen years and I did not know the rule. In fact, I was rather shocked when I learned it. We can take things too far. Bernard Shaw said something to the effect, "" IfI take off my shirt my disciples may take off their trousers "". One can go a little too far in irregularity We should perhaps look to ourselves if we of dress, but surely to goodness in a hot climate we should not look down on a man in a well-tailored open-neck sports shirt or a girl in slacks-the shape of things we appreciate over the years. Who becomes the sumptuary authority on food, drink and dress in the House? I think we take the matter too far. If a man wearing a turtleneck sweater and a lovely young lady wearing a pair of quite delectable shorts are wafted to the upper regions willy-nilly, I think there is cause for resentment. There is a common mean in all these things and the whole procedure looks rather silly to me. Although the honourable member for Ryan is almost pathetic in his love of the old associations and our traditions, I would be prepared to go a long way to wipe out some of the fustian about our the Elizabethan Theatre. We should not have stalls and gods. The galleries belong equally to the peopie and no rule of dress should preclude people from obtaining seats downstairs, if honourable members opposite are democrats they will agree with me on that. bikinis? a most progressive mind, asks me what I think about bikinis. Well, I think about them constantly. The curious thing is that if members oi the diplomatic corps decided to come here, the gentleman in a loin cloth and his distinguished lady in a bikini, we could do nothing about it because they enjoy diplomatic immunity. We, too, would enjoy that class of diplomatic immunity if it lifted some of the colour of the House to the level that I have suggested. I do not want to labour this question but surely, as this progressive Parliament moves on, we should not have old-fashioned ideas about these things. If we are having trouble with the textile industry and if 60 per cent, of its operatives are out of work, is it not a good thing that men are wearing welltailored open-neck shirts instead of wrapping themselves up? It is not what one wears that counts. Visitors in the upstairs gallery look down on us. I have seen a few one-man slums among honourable members. want to have a sartorial standard, but it seems rather absurd to say to a man that he may not enter if he is not wearing a. tie. Over at the local hotel the level of a man's social prestige is judged by whether or not he wears a collar. The whole practice seems to be completely outmoded. 1 know a very distinguished gentleman who bustled into a very well-known hotel in Canberra and was thrown out again because he was not wearing a tie; but he obtained",29,Estimates 1961 62

Nothing is laid down in regard to it, as I learnedfrom a reading of the Standing Orders, following my embarrassment with the man and his daughter to whom I have referred'. I felt rather bad aboot that incident. However, I found fhat the standard of dress was decided upon years ago by some snoopy old Speaker of fhe past-h e cannot get me now because he is either dead or has retired. It is time that this rather old-fashioned practice of sorting thesheep from the goats -the gods upstairs from the peanuts and the others down below-wa s abolished. Our accommodation here is limited.

He pays for it, but still he has to go upstairs. The honourable member for Hume( Mr Anderson), who is interjecting, always looks the essence of sartorial elegance. There is another matter which I should like to mention. There is a tendency amongst honourable members to bridleyou all know the old-fashioned word out of Jane Austen's novels-if some workers come here on deputations. They seem to think that their sanctity is being invaded; but they receive £4,000 a year to compensate for any loss of sanctity and sometimes the boss has to come in to see whether they are doing their job. King's Hall recently? Hall incident. I saw nothing wrong with that. But I saw the honourable member scuttling out of King's Hall like one of the rabbits in his electorate, and making a jolly good job of Johnny Cottontail disappearing in the distance. King's Hall is the property of the people of this country and if the Speaker in his, wisdom allows deputations, and. if sometimes deputations, get a little out of hand, it is good for us. The honorable, member, would not want toi live in isolation. He. has a. most distinguished! record in this land with' an auctioneer's mallet. I never forget that.. We all have some record' of our own, and the peopleout there want to see. us, speak to us, and see what kind of: denizens we are. in this place. I hope that they will all come along again. We must not retreat from the approach of the people. If out-of-work unionists come to this place we cannot say "" Peace committees."" Corns.! "" and refuse to see 1 them. I have never heard any one say "" Liberals!"" in such a way as to cause me to take to my cave and refuse to come out. I do not think any distinction should be made against a worker looking for a job, irrespective of his political convictions or philosophies. In the general sense we ought to make this Parliament more of a place where the people who pay the taxes to keep it going can come without inhibitions. I I regret very much that King's Hall is laden with the most atrocious portraits of past leaders that we have ever had. One of these daysI have been working on it for years through various associationsI hope we can make it a bit more representative of the present. But it is something to look at. I would tell visitors that whilst they can find every aspect of -mediaeval grandeur and all the old portraits of dead and gone leaders, whom we respect, on the top floor, if they want to see Australian books and Australian paintings, they will find them down in the cellar.

I do not know how I get offside with public opinion on these matters but, with all due respect to the Speaker who is not present in the House, and who, thanks to the canniness of the English Parliament, is not aware of anything that goes on in committee, I think that a presiding oincer who has half of a sheep over his head and wears a bombazine gown looks like the widow Twankey in a pantomime.

I am often wanted in another place, but 1 do not always turn up. One has to be careful about these things! A lot of the ceremony is traditional. It enough of that many years ago.

It seems to me that in saying so they are selling the wrong line. That is the point about which I rose to speak on. I was disturbed last night to think that there was class consciousness and a snobocracy developing in accordance with which people who, in somebody's view, were not properly dressed must go upstairs to see our proceedings and those who have the mink and mothballs can come downstairs. We want to alter that trend because it is not democratic. The parliamentary institution will never be hurt or destroyed and will not people come in and see what you are doing and look down on you-metaphorically , I hope, and not practically-and have all the facilities available to them.

72,Mr Anderson (Hume) [4.29],"Ther econduct. We do not allow members of Parliament to come here in sports coats or to smoke pipes and use spittoons, because Parliament represents the people, and the people of Australia are essentially people of good manners. It is manners which are essential if we are to have a democratic parliament functioning in an orderly way, because people who share your good manners respect you and have your respect. No matter whether a person is in apposition or a member of the government there is no reason, so long as his conduct represents good manners and integrity why there should not be mutual respect. Indeed, Parliament depends on that to-day. We have heard the honourable member for Ryan( Mr Drury) complimenting the Bird) on his very reasoned speech. I have here a note also to compliment the honourable member for Batman although I will criticize him a little later. I cannot help yet been trained to use the British parliacriticizing the Opposition, because to do so is part of my task, but the importance of Parliament is something that we must never forget. The honourable member for Ryan said that freedom depended on the Parliament and the judiciary. I beg to differ from him. I say ment alone is the sole protector of liberty in Australia, and we are the people who have to preserve liberty. Nothing .preserves liberty except the institution of Parliament. The judiciary implements the law, but the Parliament makes the law. If the law, as made by Parliament, is tough or unfair or unjust, the judiciary must interpret it, so Parliament is the one institution which preserves our liberty. Sometimes I have heard party politics criticized but if you cast your mind over the whole world to-day you realize that the only places where people are free are the places where there are party politics. In no place are people free where there is not party politics. So those are institutions which are part of parliament and which have been devised over a long period of history. Edward I. called the first model parliament together and summoned the lords, the barons, the major abbots, the knights, the burghers and citizens. They set up the two Houses, the House of Lords and the House of Commons. That was the start of Parliament. The British parliamentary institution has a long and wonderful history. We inherit it, and it is we, the people of to-day, the elected members, who have to see that this Parliament is preserved. Whether the honourable member for Parkes( Mr Haylen) disagrees with me, I do not know. I believe that the dignity of Parliament depends on mutual respect. If a person comes to the National Parliament not properly dressed he cannot expect to sit in the Speaker's Gallery. I am not a snob, but if I go to a wedding and I am not properly dressed I do not go into the church. Parliament is under continual attack because it is the sole means of securing this land's freedom. Now the newly emerged ing themselves-and they have only a short history of the British parliamentary institution. They find that their peoples have not mentary system. It requires a long period of parliamentary government before Parliament is secure. I am talking about the importance of maintaining the dignity of Parliament, because we in Australia are assimilating a large number of newcomers who have not that Parliament and Parliahad the benefit of an historical background such as the people who come from the British Isles have in regard to the parliamentary institution. Therefore our Parliament, in this period of great difficulty when we are assimilating new people, should be very careful to see that it is preserved. One of the difficulties we encounter at the present moment is the press. There are members of the modern press that one admires, but, by and large, I think it is fair to say that all members of Parliament and a great many of the thinking public are not satisfied with the press of Australia. I do not think that is an over-statement. There are one or two newspapers which command some respect, but, by and large, they have not the respect of the people of Australia and they certainly have not the respect of any member of Parliament. I do not think that we who engage in this political life care about criticism. We all get criticism, but I do feel that so long as the criticism coming from the press is unfair,",32,Estimates 1961 62

75,Honourable Member For Batman ( Mr Nations,"place s like Pakistan-ar e governthrough the use of the wrong word or deliberate distortions, or the slanted report, party rules. the press should examine its own soul, because once Parliament is destroyed by continual attacks on members of Parliament and on the parliamentary institution, what will replace it? I have never been in favour of broadcasting the proceedings of Parliament, for I believe that when the proceedings are broadcast too much of the debate is directed to influencing the listenMinisters and the answers given by them. ing public. I believe that the standard of debate in this chamber would rise enormously if proceedings were not broadcast. The honourable member for Batman( Mr been drawn up, the project could be spread Bird) made a very useful suggestion. I have not been a member of an Opposition, but I can understand the frustration that takes place among its members. In my opinion the Opposition has an important role to play in the proceedings of this Parliament, and I now offer some criticism of the present Opposition which I believe its members should examine. Because of party rules the Labour Opposition does a great disservice to Parliament. For instance, a member of the Labour Party may not criticize his leader, nor may he openly criticize the policy of the party. Again, he is not permitted to vote according to his conscience, a restriction that may well destroy the parliamentary institution more quickly than anything else. If we are to gain full value from a debate, each member must be free to express his ideas and his convictions. If he agrees with a proposal submitted by the Government, he should be able to support it. Again, if he prefers his own ideas, he should be able to state them and vote for them without hindrance. Similarly, if he disagrees with a proposal submitted by his party, he should be free to criticize it. That is not the present position in the Labour Party. Those of us who have sat as members of joint committees all know the good work that can be done and the excellent results that can be achieved when members of both Government and Opposition parties co-operate in a joint effort. AlthoughI believe that the proposal submitted by the honourable member for Batman-that more work be done by committees-is sound, such a proposal cannot succeed so long as members of the Opposition are bound by pledges and the restriction of their civil rights imposed by 1 think; all members of this chamber realize that the present Parliament House is no longer suitable for the purpose it is intended to serve. For instance, the acoustics of this chamber are dreadful. My hearing is as good as that of any other honourable member, but I have the greatest difficulty in hearing questions being put to That difficulty is experienced by all honourable members. I suggest that we should plan for the erection of a new building now. Certainly it would be an expensive undertaking. However, once the plans have over a long period so that the annual charge on thefinancesof the Commonwealth would not be very great. There is no doubt that the work of parliamentarians has become infinitely more difficult in this building in recent years. Certainly the existing building is no longer a source of pride to us. It could be used for many other purposes. The Government should in the very near future consider making world-wide competition for plans for a new building to house our National Parliament. Preliminary work should be started now. The preparation of plans should be started immediately and the complete project spread over ten or fifteen years so that the burden each year would not be too heavy. As there are many uses to which the present building could be put, no money would be lost to the Government. I am confident that all honourable members agree with me that this Parliament House is no longer conducive to efficiency and that it certainly makes the work of parliamentarians very difficult. I should like now to refer briefly to the demonstrations that take place from time to time in the King's Hall. The honourable member for Parkes( Mr Haylen) thinks that the holding of such demonstrations is a good idea. I do not. I believe that these periodical visits by large numbers of people from Newcastle, Sydney and other places are intended to be intimidatory, and I am very resentful of any attempt to intimidate me. In my view, their object is to get the public accustomed to this sort of demonstration. Each successive demonstration seems to become more violent. The last demonstration was a disgrace, though it was not accompanied by the wild scenes that were reported in the press. I passed through the King's Hall many times on that occasion and I saw no wild scenes. Occasionally there were noisy outbursts, but there certainly were no wild scenes. One newspaper reported the incident under the headline, "" Wild Scenes in the National Parliament"". The important point is that the reports from this newspaper were broadcast over Peking radio, and the impression received by people over the whole of eastern Asia was that there were wild scenes in the National Parliament of Australia, the one great bulwark of the parliamentary institution in the southern seas. Such broadcasts immediately create in the minds of our Asian friends doubt about the security of our Government. They must doubt its security when they hear stories about wild scenes, riots and and wrote a book about his trip he made the like in the National Parliament of Australia, There were no wild scenes, nor were there any riots, yet such happenings were reported in this particular newspaper as having taken place. I believe that these demonstrations serve no useful purpose. Certainly not one member of the Government is intimidated by them and they can lead to circumstances under which Parliament can be abused and overthrown. There is in Australia now a publication circulating in large numbers which shows how a totalitarian force in Czechoslovakia, by a misuse of parliamentary procedures, took over the government of that country. That is the technique employed by our enemies, and it should be a warning to the people that if you destroy Parliament that is the end of freedom. Our task is to preserve it. agree with much of what the honourable and gallant member for Hume( Mr Anderson) has just said. I certainly agree with what he has said about demonstrations in King's Hall. There is no doubt that the demonstration to which he referred in particular was at times unruly, unseemly and noisy, although the men to whom I spoke could not have been more polite. There is a danger to the institution of Parliament in gatherings of that nature, and I sincerely hope that, in the event of a recurrence of such a gathering in the King's Hall in the future, Mr Speaker and the President of the Senate will take whatever steps they may find necessary to disperse it as quickly as possible. F.7613/61 -R -[31 ] Earlier, we heard from the honourable member for Parkes( Mr Haylen) one of his normal light and frothy talks. We have only to cast our minds back a comparatively short time, to remember that the honourable member paid a visit to mainland China. 1 do not criticize him in the slightest for making that visit, but I remind honourable members that at the time he was visiting mainland China there were many very interesting happenings going on over there. For instance, there were a large number of minor uprisings against the Government of that country. By that, I mean that they were minor in physical size. It would have been impossible for the honorary member for Parkes not to have known a good deal about what was going on while he was there, yet when he returned to Australia no mention whatever in that book of what must have been some of the most serious sides of his trip. That is significant of his approach to many subjects. He simply glosses over the deeper, more important things and smothers them with a lot of froth and bubble. Earlier still, the honourable member for Lang( Mr Stewart), who delivered an extremely well read speech, complained bitterly about the fact that members of the Opposition did not have full opportunities for research. I agree with him. I , too, think that the time a member of Parliament has for carrying out research, and the opportunities for it, are undoubtedly restricted. It occurred to me while the honourable member was reading his speech that he was contravening Standing Order No. 61 which says that a member shall not read his speech. I should say in passing that it surprises me to note that more and more honourable members are getting into the habit of reading their speeches. Those who preside over our proceedings should take steps to prevent honourable members from getting into such a bad habit. The impression I gathered from the speech of the honourable member for Lang was that not only had a considerable amount of research gone into its preparation, but whoever had done the research had also written it. T mention this matter in passing because I believe we must get away from the habit of reading speeches.",33,Estimates 1961 62
76,Mr Mccolm (Bowman) [4.41],I,35,Estimates 1961 62
77,Mr Forbes,"You are unkind.do not think the practice would be indulged in to the extent that it is if the proceedings day night, after which the House would of this Parliament were not being broadcast. One of the disadvantages of broadcasting the proceedings is that those who are listening to the broadcast and hear a brilliant flow of language are often quite unaware of the fact that the gentleman whom they think is delivering an excellent speech is in fact reading a well-prepared document. The most important matter that the honourable member mentioned was one which was brought up also by the honourable member for Batman. It concerns the twelve committees. time available to members, the facilities available to them, and the question of committee work. I agree with what was same difficulty. I suggest that members said by the honourable member for Batman must spend more time in Canberra if their particularly on the possibility and desirwork is to be done effectively, particularly ability of using more committees. But through the committee system. 1 believe before we say that because this is done in it would be greatly to their advantage to the House of Commons we can do it here have more time here in order to get to we have to bear in mind that the House know some of the departmental officials of Commons has a membership of 630 or better. I believe that that would shorten, 640 and a quorum of 40 or 42. Consein many ways, representations which have quently, a lot of committee work is done to be made. It is much better to write a while the House is sitting. IfI remember letter to somebody you know than to a rightly, there are fourteen committee rooms complete stranger. It is even better to be ranging from one which is capable of holdable to ring up. I believe also that we ing 300 people, down to those that will could learn a lot by meeting and mixing hold about twenty. trouble, too. but the main trouble is the lack of debating time. That can only be adjusted in one of two ways, both of which would mean that members would have to spend more time in Canberra. One simple way in which the deficiency could be remedied would be most effective, but I do not recommend it. That way would be to enable members to return to their electorates at public expense only once a fortnight or once in three weeks. That would hit harder at the people with young families. The second way in which it could be done has already been suggested and, I understand has been rejected mainly because it does not appeal to Opposition members. 1 refer to the proposal that the sittings of the House should be adjusted to run from Monday to Friday in one week, commence on the following Monday and go to Thursrise for a week. Unless something of this nature is done there would not be an opportunity for committee work to be done effectively. Even at present, with the number of existing committees, including Government members' committees there is a rat race to see which committees get the available committee rooms. If we had any extension of committee work, nearly every meal-time would be taken up in attending the sitting of a committee. from time to time with more of the diplomatic people here. Members should do Parliament. The other suggestion that I have to make is one to which I hope serious consideration will be given when standing orders are being reconsidered. That is that the size of the existing quorum be reduced. As I have said, the House of Commons, with a membership of 630 or 640, has a quorum of 40 or 42. We have 124 members and a quorum of 43-on e larger than that of the House of Commons. That does not make sense. Another matter that I would like to mention relates to the prestige of the Parliament. From time to time some Opposition members quite deliberately set out to provoke the Speaker into naming them. It is a practice which seems to be growing.

I carefully considered. like to comment on the final statement of the honourable member for Bowman( Mr just like to say that the scheme proposed McColm). One of the political techniques by the honourable member for Bowman has of the Government, and of the leader some very good features. We certainly writers of our daily press, is to write down are rushed for time in dealing adequately the Opposition. I know that we have only with the matters that come before the joint 45 effective votes in this chamber-tw o parliamentary committees, the committees Opposition members have limited voting of Government supporters and Opposition rights-compare d with 74 on the Governmembers' committees. As I pointed out by ment side. That is the electors' fault. We interjection earlier, we on the Opposition hope that it will be rectified in three months' side of the chamber have twelve active time. I feel that it is quite wrong, and committees which cover the whole range of quite bad, to have 74 members on one federal legislation. I know that Governside of a chamber and only 45 on the other. ment supporters have formed nearly as I agree on that point. But Government many committees. This committee activity supporters, headed by their Prime Minister is all to the good. It is very important. ( Mr Menzies), are very arrogant in their feeling of security in this place. The newspapers also have been arrogant. I feel that we, on this side of the chamber, in spite of our smaller number, have been an effective Opposition in all debates. the chamber have pioneered this kind of We have forced divisions. That is about committee work, and, as the honourable the only weapon that we have. We have member has just said, Government supmoved amendments in committee on many porters form committees to match the bills. We have fought hard to indicate to Opposition members' committees. the country that there are two sides to most questions.

The disparity between the numtion Whip, I have at present the job of bers in Government and Opposition is not trying to co-ordinate the meetings of all the essential point.

My office will be used five times this week for meetings of various Opposition committees. The office of the Leader of the Opposition will also be used. This means that I have to be put out of my own office, which I use to undertake my own correspondence in addition to my work as Whip, at lunch-time and during dinner breaks in order that the Opposition committee system may function properly. This is completely wrong.

Why does not the honourable member move from his room and give us more office space? man, I shall not be side-tracked by the honourable member for Perth. He knows in his heart that we have not enough committee rooms in this building. I suppose that the only real solution is the construction hope, Mr Temporary Chairman, that the of the new Parliament House, which appears still to remain in the dim, distant future. I should just like to touch briefly now on the acoustics of this chamber. We have raised this matter at question-time and during the consideration of the Estimates year after year, but I do not think that we have seen any improvement in the acoustics here since I became a member of this place. A little earlier this afternoon, I was told by some friends from Victoria whom I entertained at afternoon tea that they could not hear what the Prime Minister said when answering questions to-day. My friends were sitting only two rows from the front of the public gallery which directly faces the Chair, and, although the Prime Minister is a very good speaker, they could not hear what he said. I pity those visitors to this place who sit right at the back of the public galleries. No doubt they find it impossible to hear answers to questions and some of the speeches that are made. We are pleased to see visitors, but I feel that we should give them more thought. Perhaps the difficulties in hearing are partly our fault. Possibly, we do not speak loudly enough. I do not know. Whatever may be the reason, the acoustics of this chamber clearly are not good enough. There ought to be iome way of enabling the voice of an honourable member on the floor of this chamber to be heard clearly in the various galleries. Even the press reporters have to resort to the use of special apparatus to hear the proceedings. We are in the middle of the twentieth century, and we see frequently the benefits gained by the use of modern acoustic techniques in halls, theatres, television studios and other places. Yet we still have not solved the acoustic problems in this chamber. provide a solution. The honourable member for Kennedy and the honourable member for Port Adelaide can be heard without difficulty. tunately, we all are not made with voices and lungs of the same power as are those of the two honourable members mentioned. As a consequence, we need to adopt some mechanical means to enable honourable members to be heard clearly in the galleries. I acoustics of this chamber will be carefully studied during the next recess and that, when we return to this place after the election, we shall find a completely new acoustic system.

94,Mr Turnbull (Mallee) [5.0],"Mrthings that have been said this afternoon, and I disagree with others. I should like to say, first of all, that I am glad that the honourable member for Bowman( Mr representation in this place. If every honorMcColm) this afternoon supported what I have said previously about the increasing number of honourable members who read their speeches in this place. There is not the slightest doubt that the reading of speeches can amount to representation by proxy. There is nothing to prevent me from getting some of the best scribes in the country to write speeches for me to read in this place, but that would not be expressing my own thoughts on the subjects discussed. After all, the voters who elect a man to this Parliament expect him to have a knowledge of his electorate and to speak in this place about his electorate as he sees it and knows it, and as he thinks about it. I have noticed, on a number of occasions, the similarity between some of the speeches that are read. looking at members of the Liberal Party of Australia now. look at the honourable member, because I do not think that he is completely without fault in this matter. However, I am referring not to any particular group of honourable members. I am not suggesting that the reading of speeches is peculiar to the Opposition alone, to members of the Liberal Party or to members of the Australian Country Party. I am dealing with the members of this chamber in general. After all, at present we are considering the estima.es for the Parliament as a whole. If every member of this place would speak of things as he sees them himself, he would do much better than he does by reading a speech written for him by somebody else or one based on what somebody else has told him. That sort of thing is not in the best interests of the Parliament. Therefore, I support the remarks made by the honourable member for Bowman. I am glad to see that he supports my views on this subject, which I raised in this chamber a long time ago, and that he is striving with me to get better representation of the people. Immediately an honourable member says I know that Australia is a big country. T in this place something which is perhaps did not realize just how big it was un il I favorable to his electorate, we hear the old travelled across it in a slow train. But we cry, "" Parish pump! "" The members of this chamber represent the whole of Australia. Not one part of the country is without able member devoted at least part of his speech to the subject of conditions in his electorate and the wishes and ambitions of his constituents, with particular reference to the subject under discussion, all honourable members, as the people's representatives, would know what was going on throughout Australia. This would be in the best interests of the country as a whole. We know, of course, that an honourable membei cannot discuss his electorate all the time. He has, of necessity, to discuss matters over a wider range and further afield. Australia is a big country in international affairs, although it has only a small population. Various honourable members, and particularly some on the Government side of the chamber, have suggested from time to time that the Parliament sit from Tuesday to Friday inclusive in one week and from Monday to Thursday inclusive in the next week. Honourable members would spend a week-end in Canberra between the two weeks in which the Parliament met, and would then return to their electorates for a week. I absolutely oppose that proposal. the attendance lists, I find that some honourable members cannot attend even the present sittings, let alone any additional ones. The arrangement suggested might serve very well for honourable members from Western Australia, but most members come from the eastern States and they are able to get home to their electorates very well at present. I point out that, although I live in central Victoria, honourable members who come from Western Australia may leave their electorates nine hours later than I have to leave mine and they can still be here in time for the meeting of the Parliament. ber walk? travel by car and train to Melbourne and from Melbourne to Canberra by aeroplane. f",38,Estimates 1961 62

Members of Parliament can come to Canberra in a very short time now.

There is a growing tendency among members of the Liberal Party and the Australian Country Party to try to run the affairs of the Australian Labour Party.

Interior was in this chamber when certain statements were made by the honourable members for Hume, Bowman and Mallee, and he did not raise any point of order then. This is typical of the attitude that is adopted by the Government in this Parliament. Surely on the estimates for the Parliament I am allowed to criticize the conduct of honourable members. SurelyI am within my rights in doing that.

Surely if honourable members opposite can hand i: out they can take it in return? The honourable member for Bowman made certain remarks about a speech that I made earlier. I admit that it was a wellprepared speech, but I do insist that every word in that speech was prepared by myself. If the honourable member for Bowman cares to see the Deputy Librarian he will be informed who did the research and who prepared the speech, ln a very mean, unfair and despicable statement he suggested that my speech was not prepared by me. It was prepared by me. All my speeches have been prepared by me, and always will be prepared by me. I prepared this one fully and well because of the fact that I had to encompass, in fifteen minutes at the most, a subject which could have taken at least an hour to develop. One thing I will say for myself was that the speech expressed original in the whole of the speech given by the honourable member for Bowman. The honourable member for Hume talked about members of parties and of party politics, and said that members of the Labour Party had no right to voice their opinions or vote against party decisions in the House. Let us look at what happens the honourable member for Mallee, but of the Country Party ever voted against Government-sponsored legislation? As far as the honourable member for Mallee is concerned, the only times he has ever voted against the Government were on such things as the application of the gag. He has never had the courage to vote against the Government on any matters of import. So far as the reading of speeches is concerned, let us see the honourable member for Mallee or the honourable member for Bowman take a point of order on the Prime",40,Estimates 1961 62

Let us see them have the courage to do that before they criticize inembers of the Labour Party. The affairs of lhe Labour Party in this chamber will be managed by us alone. We do not need the advice of honourable members on the other side, l f they were to devote more of their time to looking after the affairs of their own parties this country would not be in the predicament it is in at the moment. I challenge the honourable members opposite, particularly those who are always talking about communism, and particularly those who, time after time, talk about unity tickets, to say what they have ever done to defeat communism. Every statement they make in this place takes away something of the weight and the authority of members of the Labour Party who have been continually fighting against the uprise of communism in Australia. Honourable members opposite are not fair dinkum. They want unity tickets and they want the spread of communism through Australia. If the Government is not prepared to control the spread of communism, this Parliament will not be functioning for very long. The Labour Party has always been in the forefront of the fight against communism. No one in this chamber would be prepared to say to me that I was a Communist or a Communist sympathiser; yet Government supporters group all members of the Labour Party together as Communists and Communist sympathisers. It is about rime that the Government speech without engaging in personal abuse. faced up to its responsibilities to safeguard I do not think that abusing other honorthe Parliament and realized that, unless the able members serves any purpose. democratic institution of Parliament is properly run, communism will become a telling force in Australia.

So far I have been disappointed. should like to say a few words in reply to the honourable member for Lang( Mr Stewart), who has just resumed his seat. It is said that if a contestant in a debate becomes abusive, he has been completely beaten. The honourable member for Lang was very abusive when referring to my speech. SinceI have been a member of the Parliament, I have always attacked policies; I have never attacked individuals. That is why I have so many good friends in the Australian Labour Party. If the honourable member for Lang likes to take a different view, I cannot do much about it, but I will continue to debate against policies. IfI do not like Labour's policy of democratic socialism, I cannot be forced to speak in favour of it, but there is no need for me to make a personal attack on honourable members who support it. I have never done so. It has been said that my speech this afternoon was an attack on the Labour Party. I made a special point of saying that I was referring to the whole Parliament. AlthoughI do not claim that my speech was in any way exceptional, there has never been a speech made in this chamber that had less of a party political flavour. I referred to the whole Parliament. Why the honourable member for Lang should attack me is beyond comprehension. I cannot understand it and I do not think he can either.

When he expresses his views on this subject as he has, he reflects on the back-bench members of the Parliament. allowed to read their speeches when introducing bills. speeches. Every one must acknowledge that Ministers here every day read prepared answers to questions. They do not give an answer off the cuff, but read prepared answers. Some objection should be taken to this practice, particularly when the questions are supposed to be questions without notice. The former Treasurer used to say that he had anticipated the question, but Ministers now have not the nous to say even this. I do not reflect on the Chair, but every day, at question time. Ministers read answers, although this conflicts with Standing Orders. There seems to be some conflict between the Liberal Party and the Australian Country Party. The way the honourable member for Mallee addressed Liberal Party members about reading their speeches, it has become a tug-of-war from start to finish. The key speeches this afternoon on the estimates for the Parliament, in my opinion, were delivered by the honourable member for Lang( Mr Stewart) and the honourable member for Batman( Mr Bird). Both made useful suggestions that could well be considered by the Government. It is true that other honourable members have made their contributions. I did not hear the speech of the honourable member for Ryan( Mr propaganda factory. This has happened Drury), but I would be only too pleased to acknowledge any contribution he may have made. The salient point in the speech of the honourable member for Lang was the suggestion that there should be a research section for the Opposition. Members of the Opposition should be able to go to a bureau to obtain essential information and statistical data that they need when debating various matters of great concern to the nation. The honourable member for Batman suggested that greater use should be made of committees in the affairs of the Parliament. Both suggestions are good. The honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Bland) paid a well-deserved compliment to the Public Accounts Committee. This committee is an outstanding example of the way a committee can function in the interests of the Parliament, the taxpayers and the nation. There is clear-cut evidence of the value of the committee. The Public Works Committee also renders outstanding service. I regret that many useful reports and findings of the Public Works Committee seem to be pigeon-holed and forgotten by Ministers who, in the long run,, are answerable to the Parliament. Ministers, fail to take heed of the reports and information carefully gathered by members of the committee. Returning to the suggestion of the honourable member for Lang, 1 point out that it i& important for the Opposition and Government supporters to have the fullest information and knowledge obtained from research so that they may match the efforts of Ministers and discuss various questions on an equal basis There is no gainsaying the fact that there are deep rivalries amongst Government supporters. The fact does emerge from time to time that back-bench members who could make outstanding contributions to the affairs of the nation are held back by Ministers who fear that they may be eventually replaced by such members, who may gain favour with the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies). Because of this, it is of utmost importance that a research section be available to Opposition members, and a similar section be available to honourable members on the Government side, so that they will not come into the Parliament to read speeches carefully prepared by the Government's much too often in recent times. I do not want to mention names but on a number of occasions recently speeches have been read to this Parliament from the other side of the chamber, following a certain course which is the popular line of the Government. Some debate has taken place to-day on the reading of speeches in the House. No one deplores that more than I do.

As it is, we have become accustomed to this practice being excused with the jargon that the member is following copious notes. I regret that a deplorable spirit-if I may The suggestion that has been put forward use that term-develope d out of the useful suggestions that were put forward in this debate, until it degenerated into a fight and a wrangle. The Parliament surrenders its position when it becomes involved in that sort of disputation. We are responsible to a great number of electors, and the people expect us to play our parts on their behalf. There are many good people in all our electorates who would be only too happy to have the privilege and the opportunity of serving their fellows in this Parliament. It behoves members of Parliament on both sides of the chamber to try to maintain standards worthy of this democratic institution. It has been said that the Parliamentary institution is a comparatively recent development in world history. I agree. 1 believe also that Parliament faces a severe testing and is in greater peril than it has ever been previously because of the growing attitude among many people that totalitarianism is right. That ideology suits one particular shade of viewpoint or another; but I believe it should be rejected with the robust, honestHouse, they need not listen.

Democracy can live, flourish and develop in Australia if we come to the Parliament with dignity and honesty, if we make a forthright approach to national problems and if we are prepared at all times to say what is necessary on behalf of the people. The cause of democracy can be advanced if we adopt the suggestions that have been made by a number of honourable members to-day, such as that advanced by the honourable member for Lang( Mr Stewart). I believe that democracy would be assisted also by the adoption of the committee form of parliamentary practice suggested by the honourable member for Batman( Mr Bird). Useful suggestions have been made by honourable members on both sides of the chamber and I regret that the debate degenerated as it did. The subject before the committee deserved better treatment. I can only hope that Parliaments of the future will take notice of what has been said to-day and will try to build on the firm foundations that have been set by those patriotic people who have paved the way for our democratic institutions. by the honourable member for Lang( Mr Stewart) is a good one. I am prepared to support any suggestion that will strengthen the Opposition in this House. I think the suggestion was a confession that the Opposition is weak and so we should all be sympathetic to the idea. However, 1 have risen to speak about the acoustics in this portion of the chamber occupied by the Australian Country Party. I suppose that 25 per cent, of all the speakers in this House cannot be heard in this corner. I do not know whether it is partly because of the position of the attendants' box behind us. It is little use coming into this chamber if we cannot hear the speakers. All of us hear very little of what goes on at question time, particularly from the front bench. I suggest that earphones be supplied for all members in this chamber so that they can tune in if they want to hear. If members want to make a noise and are not concerned with the procedures of the a look at a few parliaments in South-East Asia recently, I noticed that every member was equipped with a set of earphones, mainly for multi-lingual purposes; but I think it is important that if members do want to hear, they should have headphones so as to be able to shut out interference.

Going further down the list, I find that the employee on the salary range with the maximum at about £2,000 lost £133 for the year and £291 in all. Let me now go to a higher grade. The officer receiving a salary of about £3,000 lost £407 for the year, and his accumulated losses amounted to over £1,000. The highest salary given in the list is in the second division, being £5,525 a year. An officer on this salary lost £1,160 for the year and £3,620 in total because of the application of the Public Service Board's formula. I shall refer also to another group of workers who were similarly affected, the postmasters. These are graded according to the classes of post offices of which they are fin charge. The postmaster on the minimum .salary, in a grade 2 post office, is losing £52 .a year. That is the minimum loss. Mr L, R, Johnson,-What would he get? }vh.

The other grades of postmasters incur the following losses:Grade3 Grade4 Grade5 Grade6 Grade7 Also affected were the postal clerks, the telegraphists, the traffic officers and the supervisee. All of the officers in the second and third divisions have lost money in the way I have indicated. Let me tell the committee what the public servants themselves think about this matter -and again I hope that they will remember this on election day, because the Labour Party does not stand for this kind of special formula for its own officers. The"" Federal Public Service Journal"", of February, 1961, had this to sayThe facts of the present Federal Government's political attacks on Public Servants are very clear. The Liberal-Country Party coalition destroyed the independence of the previously effective and efficient Public Service arbitration system and threw us into the costly, delaying, excessively legalistic procedure of the outside individual courts. Having committed this destructive act of wanton sabotage in the middle of one night in a few hours in both Houses of Parliament, the Government then swept into the Arbitration Commission on two occasions, through its plaint Public Service Board the first time and with separate barristers the second time, and induced the Judges to decide that a public servant in the clerical ranks was a second class, depressed and unworthy type of lowly citizen who did not deserve the same economic wage justice as other salaried employees. Those in the lower and middle classifications, who in 1937 and in 1954 were receiving remunerations equal to denned sections in other industries, suddenly found their margins reduced in 1955 and again in 1960, so that they in effect were robbed ol economic justice as surely as if the Government stole the money out of their pockets. That is what the public service organization thinks about this Government and the actions it took in respect of salaries of public servants. I wish to refer to somefiguresthat were given in the annual report of the Public Service Board, which was tabled in the Parliament to-day. The number of persons employed in the Commonwealth Public Service is shown as 165,000, and of these 33,736 are females, or about 27 per cent, of the total. I consider this a high proportion. I do not object to females occupying any positions in any industries, whether in the Public Service or not, but I am conLoss per cerned and alarmed at the possibility that year. females may be doing jobs that should be £ 78 paid for at male rates of wages and salaries. 85 I hope that females are not being engaged .. 105 simply because they may be paid only 75 125 per cent, of male rates. It is an important 145 social proposition that women are entitled to full human rights. Legislation for equal pay for equal work in the Commonwealth Public Service should be introduced forthwith, in my opinion. Any provision for less than equal pay represents an injustice to women and a threat to every breadwinner. Tf an employer has a vacant position capable of being filled by either a male or a female, he will naturally select a female if he can pay her only 75 per cent, of the male rate. Employers will always engage the cheapest labour, consistent with efficiency, whether male or female. This Government was a signatory to the United Nations charter which prohibits discrimination between the sexes. Such discrimination is always condemned at meetings of the United Nations. I appeal to the Government to honour its pledges and to cease exploiting female employees in the Public Service. The Labour Party will end this discrimination when it is given a mandate to form a government at the end of this year. as the men. it. I believe in the principle of equal pay for equal work. The other matter included in the Public Service Board report to which 1 wish to refer relates to the large number of temporary employees in the Commonwealth Public Service. Of the 165,000 persons engaged, not less than 60,000 are temporary employees. In my opinion, any officer in the Commonwealth Public Service who has served satisfactorily and efficiently for at least twelve months should be given permanent appointment. In some sections of the Postmaster-General's Department-the department in which most of these temporary employees are-the turn-over of labour is as high as 50 per cent, of the total period of rapidly increasing enrolments-of staff. I believe this large turn-over takes place because so many officers are not sure of their jobs. The first thing that they want is security and, instead of being interested in retaining their jobs in the Postmaster General's Department they busy themselves looking for a position which will offer permanency. them. for Watson has stated, there is no incentive for the temporary employees to remain in their positions. It is ridiculous that there should be such a large number of temporary employees in the Commonwealth Public Service. The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN (Hon. N. J. O. Makin) -Order! The honourable membtr's time has expired. like to make a few comments on what the is: What has the Commonwealth done? Commonwealth has been asked to do, and The Commonwealth has standing financial has done, in relation to education. Some arrangements with the States which take recent developments in the field of educainto account growth and betterment factors. tion have tended to highlight the Government's interest and responsibility in this ma-.ter. For the purposes of debate three questions might well be asked and answered. The first is: How bad is our education system? To judge the excellence or otherwise of an education system one has to be sure of one's standards. No one will deny that we could provide more by way of educational facilities, but v/e can say also that we could improve our facilities for hospital treatment and our roads. The tendency has been to suggest that the education system is in dire need of an emergency injection of a large sum of money. This has been treated as the final answer to the question. All we can do as a nation is to improve our educational and other social provisions year by year, and in fact, this is what is happening. At the recent Premiers' Conference the Premiers stated categorically that although they had problems ahead of them-the y stated the problems-the y had, in fact, done a good job for education in their States. Obviously they have. For a start, they have been faced with pressures due to increased population. In the last ten years, in a the order of 70,000 a year-the y have maintained their standards. They have provided sufficient classrooms but as yet have not been able to dispense with all unsuitable accommodation. In the next five years enrolment increases will decline to about 40,000 or 50,000 a year. Therefore, it should be possible to make up some leeway and to improve existing accommodation. The States have increased their education activity. Expenditure from loan funds was only £12,000,000 in 1951-52 but by 1959-60 this had increased to £38,000,000. In 1931-52 the tota] expenditure by the States on education was some £46,000,000. By 1959-60 this had increased to over £160,000,000, representing an average annual increase of about 15 per cent. The real situation, therefore, is not that the education provisions have remained static or are deteriorating. No State Minister for Education would admit this; nor is it true. The next question we must ask ourselves",44,Temporary Chairman Thought There Was Not An Original Thought

122,Mr Erwin (Ballaarat) [5.46],"I shouldThe States have indicated the general satisfactory nature of these arrangements which mean that without any special aid, and provided the States continue to apply the same percentage of available funds to education over the next few years, they should be able to make the improvements which were presented as being desirable in the report on education that was considered at the recent Premiers' Conference. Therefore, there does not appear to be a strong case for urgent and separate action by the Commonwealth outside the normal financial relationships with the States. In other ways the Government has inquiry into education at the tertiary level. brought relief to the States in certain fields This flows naturally from the Commonof education. Commonwealth expenditure wealth's interest in universities. At a recent on the Commonwealth scholarships scheme press conference the Prime Minister( Mr has risen from less than £500,000 in Menzies) made it very clear why the 1950-51 to nearly £3,000,000 in 1961-62. Government had moved into this field. The total number of Commonwealth scholarship students in training has risen from 6,500 in 1951 to nearly 12,000 in arrangement such as exists for universities, 1960. Not only has this relieved the States where the Commonwealth and State of the burden of supporting such students, Governments co-operate to assist autowho need support from somewhere, but nomous institutions, and a situation in also it has made possible a greater flow of which the Commonwealth Government trained graduates into the services of the interferes in the domestic administrative States. I need not detail the Government's Commonwealth intervention at the lower record in relation to universities. In colevels of education. operation with the States it has enabled a development in university facilities which is unparalleled in our history. The amount I wish to speak briefly on a matter pertainmade available from Commonwealth ing to the Prime Minister's Department and sources alone for university development particularly on the estimates for the Office has risen from less than £1,000,000 in 1951 of Education. Education is a comparato a projected £14,500,000 in 1963. The final question we must ask ourselves remember that when I introduced this subis: What has the Commonwealth been asked ject in 1956 I was mildly rebuked and to do? In recent months there has been reprimanded by the Minister for the Army pressure on the Commonwealth Govern( Mr Cramer) because I dared to mention ment to institute an inquiry into primary, a matter which he contended was the secondary and tertiary education.

Nor are we sure Commonwealth Office of Education there that the States would welcome a Commonhas been ineffective liaison between the wealth-sponsored inquiry into fields that are Commonwealth and the States.

It does not seem, therefore, that the wealth Office of Education, and provided desirability of such an inquiry is by any means generally accepted, even if the Commonwealth were to take the risk of interfering in this way with a State government activity. The second suggestion that has been advanced is that the Commonwealth should make a large emergency grant for education. State Premiers have indicated certain suspicions about money coming to them earmarked for educational purposes. The Premier of Victoria, Mr Bolte, recently has been very specific on this question. However, the Commonwealth has instituted an There is a great difference between an arrangements and policy considerations of a State government, which is the danger of Mr L. R. JOHNSON (Hughes) [5.54] tively new topic for this Parliament. I that the office would function effectively in respect of all facets of education so that the Commonwealth could always make sure that it accepted its proper responsibility in these matters and that education, in effect, would be guaranteed and underwritten by the Commonwealth because of its great national importance. But, as I say, these provisions were not invoked. The Murray committee, in 1956, broke new ground in its examination of tertiary education at the national level. Of course, there is still a lot to be done despite the emergency relief which was given, because some of our biggest universities have intimated the likelihood of an embargo or a restriction on entry into a number of faculties. I think that is to apply in Sydney in respect of the faculties of law and medicine by 1963 and that a short time afterwards a more general embargo will prevail unless we get on with the job of providing new facilities. And so there is a great deal to be done. A few years ago we used to engage in controversies in this House about whether the Commonwealth should have anything to do with universities and other facets of education. We used to talk about the constitutional position. The Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) often contended that we had no right, as a federal government, to initiate any action in this respect unless there was a request from the States for a grant under section 96 of the Constitution. Suddenly, all those contentions were swept away when the Prime Minister went overseas, accidentally met Sir Keith Murray, brought him back to Australia and set up a committee. Every one knows the results. The committee's report had very startling ramifications for the people of Australia, because the years of financial stringency had brought about a fairly desperate state of affairs in regard to the buildings, accommodation, teaching personnel and facilities of the universities. The whole question had been the subject of neglect and our output of graduates had reached the level of a national crisis. I do not need to go into that matter at length, but will refer to a statement by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Calwell). He discussed a table showing the number of new graduates in science and engineering per million of population in the countries concerned in 1956. It showed that the United States of America had 281 graduates, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics 450, Britain 162, Canada 143, Italy 96 and Australia 79. This was something like the state of affairs revealed by the Murray committee's report. Despite all the difficulties, the Commonwealth had no alternative but to alleviate the situation and it did so by substantial grants made available in the years 1958-59 and 1959-60. But the States had not asked for this assistance. This was a spontaneous gesture on the part of the Commonwealth. We wonder why we should be so selective in our approach to education. Why have we to concentrate on universities? The States have always asked for more assistance for education generally and the Commonwealth would do very well to look at this state of affairs. We wonder why the Commonwealth has chosen to neglect other aspects of education. The States have not pleaded just for aid for universities. That is the whole point. In fact, no special plea was made in that regard. Sitting suspended from 5.59 to 8 p.m. Mr L. R. JOHNSON -Before the suspension of the sitting for dinner, I was discussing the estimates for the Prime Minister's Department, and I had referred, in particular, to the provision for the Commonwealth Office of Education. I had stated that the Commonwealth had appointed a committee of inquiry and had acted on some of that committee's recommendations with respect to universities, but had left unattended the other educational deficiencies of the nation. We on this side, and, indeed, the State Premiers, be they Liberal or Labour, have been anxious to ascertain why there has been this discrimination. Why has the Commonwealth neglected primary, secondary and technical education and concerned itself only with tertiary education? All State Premiers have now made a submission for special Commonwealth assistance for education other than in universities. On 15th June last, the Premiers met the Prime Minister at the Premiers' Conference where they very forcefully submitted a detailed proposal, supported by statistics, for emergency and long-term assistance for education. This request had the unanimous support of all State Premiers who agreed that such assistance would not These are some of the superficial weakinvolve any relinquishment by the States nesses, the apparent cracks in the Australian of their responsibilities in connection with educational system which have been reprimary, secondary and technical educavealed.

123,Mr Chaney,"Are copies of the motion education. To my way of thinking, it isThe Prime Minister claims to have accepted the Murray committee's recommendations. We wonder whether he has done so when we look at the situation as revealed by the report. For instance, in 1957, only 4.4 per cent, of New South Wales students in the seventeen to eighteen years age group entered universities. Only 4.4 per cent.! What a waste of talent! The report also discloses that 16 per cent, of those in any age group have the level of ability considered necessary for birth-rate in those very difficult years. success at the university. The Premiers' Conference considered these matters in June, 1961. The first report was presented last March, so that this Government has had five months to reflect about these matters. I point out that the report of the Premiers was prepared under the direction of the various State governments by the Australian Education Council which comprises the Directors of Education in all the States. At the Premiers' Conference, submissions were made by the Premier of New South Wales on behalf of all six States. All States were unanimous in the approaches made. They contended that the Commonwealth should accept the principle of aiding the States with long-term assistance. They also advocated a committee of inquiry and they called for special assistance. They submitted that not only was assistance on a long-term basis necessary but also that interim assistance should be granted until the committee had completed its inquiry. They declared that the position was such that a special allocation of funds by the Commonwealth was necessary, and all States gave an assurance that they would co-operate in this matter. Gone are the days when the States considered that their sovereignty was sacrificed by accepting Commonwealth aid. No longer do they contend that the Commonwealth has to assume full responsibility for education if it makes grants. They are satisfied that grants can be made without depriving the States of any of their rights in connection with education. Indeed, the Premier of Victoria, Mr Bolte, made special reference to this and the Prime Minister gave the States an assurance that the abandonment of responsibility was not necessary. My time is almost exhausted, and before nical education or teacher training. The concluding I shall summarize the matters point I am trying to make is that the Oppoabout which the State Premiers are consition's motion is repudiated immediately cerned. They are concerned about inadequate buildings, the deficiency of properly trained teachers and the limitation of equipment and supplies. These deficiencies have been caused by a number of factors. First, we had the difficult depression years; then the difficult war years, when there was an almost complete embargo on school building; and then we had to face up to the question of enrolment, recognizing that there was a very serious decline in the Order! The honourable member's time has expired. Opposition has chosen to move an amendment to the vote for the Prime Minister's Department in the terms which the honourable member for Hughes( Mr Johnson) has read out. I must confess to being extremely surprised to hear the terms of the honourable member's motion to reduce this vote. Just to refresh the memory of honourable members, I will repeat what the honourable member for Hughes said. He said that the Government had failed to comply with the unanimous request of the Premiers to establish a committee to investigate and assess the needs of primary, secondary and technical education on a Commonwealth basis; to suggest a long-term basis of assistance, and to make special assistance available as an interim measure. The Premiers, as I understand it, did not request anything of the sort. Neither the statement made by the Australian Education Council nor the letter from the Premier of New South Wales indicated in any way whether the Premiers regarded the statement as an accurate review of the position or supported what wa:, in it. So how it could be regarded as unanimous request for Commonwealth assistance T do not know. The Premiers have made no request whatever for Commonwealth aid for education. They have given no indication whether the\ regard education needs as more pressina than those, for instance, of hospitals. Thero is no indication whatsoever whether they would be prepared to accept, special Commonwealth grants for education or for some particular areas of education such as tech-",50,Temporary Chairman Thought There Was Not An Original Thought

That is to education. Let me show honourable members what to maintain the present standards but also to this report contained.

In the report, 1958-59 is chamber have always taken the stand that, used as a base year and estimates of addiunder the Australian Constitution, the field tional needs until 1963-64 are made.

As has been amendment to the estimates for the Prime pointed out, in order to meet the needs of Minister's Department. What did this report the States with respect to the matters which say in respect of thefinancewhich would be are within their constitutional responrequired? First, it said that, to maintain sibility, the Commonwealth Government has present standards, taking the total expendiover the years made available for educature in 1958-59 as £142,000,000, an addition large amounts out of income tax tional £200.000.000 would be required over reimbursements, which have been increasthe five years. That is just to maintaining every year, and has provided funds by the present standards with the estimated guaranteeing loans to the States and in increase in children going to school. In addition, it stated that, in order to for the States, in their own wisdom, to effect desirable improvements which it listed increase their expenditure on education but which I have not time to state here. by 12 per cent, a year over the last five based on an expenditure of £51,900,000 in 1958-59, an additional £73,500,000 would be required in 1963-64. This would mean. Sir, that in addition to maintaining th? 1958-59 rate of £142,000,000, a total added expenditure of some £312,000,000 would be required in the five-year period to bring secondary and primary education to the Now, Sir, this is why I believe that the say that it would be more than enough to meet all the extra costs envisaged, not only Honourable gentlemen on this side of the many other ways. This has made it possible years, This approach by the Commonwealth will make it possible for the States to maintain over the next four or five years this 12 per cent, annual increase in expenditure on education and, therefore, by the end of the financial year 1964-65 to reach the point which the Australian Educational Council, as stated in its report, regards as desirable. In other words, Sir, by adhering to our principle that matters which are the constitutional responsibility of the States ought to be dealt with by the States and, at the same time, exercising a sense of responsibility and discharging our obligation to provide the necessary additional funds in the total grants made to the States, we shall make it possible for the States to spend on education all that this expert report suggests is desirable. I want to make just one further comment. In fairness, I point out that the assessment which I have made does not allow for rising costs. If costs rise, as these figures are' marginal, the States may not be able to attain the target that I have envisaged. But in the debates in this chamber over the last couple of years, especially the debate on the Government's Budget for the current financial year, and in the economic policies that have been carried out during 1960 and 1961, the Government has made clear its determination to maintain reasonable stability in the cost structure in Australia. With the present Government in office, we can be reasonably sure that the States will be able to get the full benefit of the expendiPrime Minister may plead that he needs time ture that they are able to make on education. If the Australian Labour Party, on the other hand, were able to form a government and implement its highly inflationary proposals, the Commonwealth might have to make a special grant in aid for primary and secondary education, contrary to the terms of the Constitution. I oppose the amendment, Sir. Chairman, I presume that there are not many people who are as ignorant of the proceedings of the last Premiers' Conference as the honourable member for Barker( Mr on 20th February wasForbes) apparently is. For his special edification, I quote a short passage from page 7 of the official report of the proceedings of the Premiers' Conference held at Canberra on 15th June last. The PremierI warn our people that the crisis is qualitaof New South Wales, making submissions tive as well as quantitative. We urgently on behalf of all the Premiers, made these remarksAt this stage, Mr Prime Minister, I ask the Commonwealth to accept the principle of assisting the States in these directions and to agree to establish a committee to investigate and to make an up-to-date assessment of the needs of primary, secondary and technical education on a national basis, and to suggest a long-term basis of assistance. Such an inquiry would necessarily take some time. In view of the urgency of the present situation, I also ask the Commonwealth to agree to make some special assistance as an interim measure. That plea by the Premier of New South Wales was supported specifically, I think, by every one of the other Premiers present At the Premiers' Conference held in June of this year, the Premiers, by their unanimous voice, expressed their urgent wish that the Commonwealth assist them with additional grants for primary, secondary and technical education. So far, there has been no indication, in respect of primary and secondary education at least, that the Government is prepared to act. We all are well aware, of course, that when this matter was first mentioned, the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) expressed the belief that such grants would be unconstitutional. Then various Government supporters told us from time to time, especially last year, that such grants would be out of order, because the Premiers had not requested them. The Premiers, with a united voice, requested these grants last June, but, so far, there is no indication of action by the Government. The to survey and consider the situation. But, in my view, for some years now, sufficient facts have been available to all with eyes and a will to see to enable a decision to be made. One cannot help but contrast the Government's dilatoriness with the courageously determined action of the new President of the United States of America, who, in February of this year, very soon after his election to office, obtained the approval of grant for education of £2,200,000,000. Significantly, the opening sentence of the plea made to Congress by the new Presideni Our progress as a nation can be no swifter than our progress in education. There is a crisis in Australian education",51,Temporary Chairman Thought There Was Not An Original Thought
126,Mr Reynolds (Barton) [8.24],"Mr the United States Congress for a federalneed more and better qualified teachers, many more attractive classrooms, gymnasiums, libraries, assembly halls, recreational facilities and conveniences, and we need, also, much more teaching equipment for our schools. Our needs in these matters have been very effectively classified and specified in the report entitled "" Some Aspects of Australian Education "" compiled under the direction of the Australian Education Council, which, as everybody knows, is composed of the Education Ministers of all the States. But if all these material needs-wha t one may call thc externa of education-were met, there would still be a crisis in Australian education. What we teach, when we teach it and how we teach it are considerations at least as important as are considerations of who teaches and in what environment he teaches. In the short time available to me I can only express my very firm belief that the federal ministry of education and science proposed by the Australian Labour Party would give the States very considerable assistance in research into what should be the aims of our educational system, the content of its curricula and syllabuses, teaching methods and methods of assessment. Such a federal educational research programme could do a tremendous amount to make education more relevant to the nation's needs and to the capacities and abilities of our young citizens. There is need for a federal educational research centre with, say, curriculum laboratories, teaching method laboratories and laboratories for the study of the best kinds of teaching aids. Research in all these fields could be of great help to our State educational research bodies. In my view, the expenditure of many more millions of pounds on the material requisites of education is desperately urgent. But such expenditure will place on us an even greater responsibility for ensuring that the nation gets the fullest possible value for its money in terms of critically determined educational values and objectives that are subject to frequent review. We can be too preoccupied with spending millions of pounds on buildings and so on. What goes on inside those buildings is surely the most important thing of all. "" Some of my colleagues will discuss in some detail the material problems confrontinstitutions to modem standards are difficult to ing our State educational authorities. For my part, I merely want to point out that between 1950 and 1959 the enrolments in all Australian schools increased by 608,000 students, or 42 per cent. In the same period university enrolments increased by 55 per cent. Looking at the enrolments in Australian government primary and secondary schools in 1952 as against 1960 one notes an overall increase of 521,000, or 47 per cent. The really significant part, though, is that whereas primary school enrolments increased by 35 per cent, secondary school enrolments increased by 103 per cent, in that short time. We are told that the cost of educating a child in the upper secondary school is four times as great as the cost of educating a primary school pupil. Just for good measure authorities assure us that enrolments will keep on increasing at a rate of between 40,000 and 50,000 annually for some years ahead. In face of this phenomenal growth of school population, and mindful of the teacher and classroom shortage which is a legacy of the depression and World War IL, is it any wonder that the State governments, even with a total expenditure of £162,500,000 in 1959-60, have had to proclaim, as did the Queensland Premier, Mr Nicklin, at the Premiers' ConferenceUndoubtedly, there is an increasing gap between what is needed by the community in the way of education and what the State Government can provide. In all our debates in this chamber I have never felt that technical education has received anything like the attention that it deserves. Yet, I suppose, technical education has a more immediate impact upon the nation's material growth than has any other form of education. Despite this. I would venture to say that technical education in Australia to-day is in some ways in more difficulty, comparatively, than are other levels of education. Whereas between 1952-53 and 1958-59 expenditure of revenue by the six Australian States on primary and secondary education combined increased by 80 per cent., and on teacher training by 121 per cent., that on technical education increased by only 64 per cent. The report "" Some Aspects of Australian Education "" statesThe costs of rebuilding and equipping technical estimate, but it is anticipated that an expenditure of not less than £13,000,000 is required. Proportionate to the base year, 1951, the trend of increased enrolments in technical education up to 1960 has been almost consistently steeper than the trend in primary or even secondrry education enrolments. The nation's neea is highlighted by the fact that despite there being thousands of unemployed in Australia we are still seeking artisans from overseas. 1 can do no better than quote again from the remarks made by the Premier of Queensland at the Premiers' Conference. He saidUnless we can take more effective action in the future than has been possible in the past, Australia's man-power will undoubtedly become relatively less and less adequately equipped to meet the serious consequences for this nation. I think increasing demands of modern times. Such a state of affairs will weaken Australia's competitive position in the society of nations. Great Britain, according to the British Central Office of Information statement on technical education in 1959, is recognizing the vital importance of technical education. The British have current plans to spend £100,000,000 on new buildings and equipment for technical colleges in the five-year period ending this year. The eventual aim is for universities and technical colleges together to produce by 1970 more than 20,000 fully qualified scientists and engineers every year. The importance placed on technical education in Russia, Germany and the United States of America is fairly well known. For instance, the numbers of graduates in pure and applied science per million of population in 1954, in various countries, have been estimated to be as follows:Union of Soviet Socialist Republics 332 United States of America United Kingdom West Germany .. France Italy .. Australia One feels compelled to agree with Professor Copland in saying that there is no escape from the incessant demands of a technological age whether it be in industry or in agriculture. Having said that, I have to report that in my own experience, as one having trained teachers in technical education for five years before I came to this Parliament, not only are many of our buildings dingy and inadequate, but a good deal of equipment, so important in technical training, is years out of date. Much of the teaching is done by part-time teachers who have never had one hour's training in the art of teaching. Student failure rates are abnormally high. Our whole apprenticeship system, in my view, needs a complete and thorough overhaul. Above all, the technical teacher and the people who undertake technical training need to be given a much higher status in the community. We just cannot have technical education-o r any other type of education for that matter-o n the cheap. We have to think of education not as a cost, but as a richly rewarding investment. Failure to keep up with the technical progress of other countries could have very that there should be a much closer integration of secondary and technical education. In my experience far too much of our secondary schooling lacks realism for the pupils. Too many students not particularly suited to academic work are given too little opportunity to develop their technical talent. Altogether too many schools are barren in regard to suitable equipment. Federal aid must be the solution. In the few minutes left to me I must indicate my very strong support for a vast extension of the pre-apprenticeship courses taken by some pupils which have been a distinct success in giving fourteen, fifteen and sixteen-year-old boys the whole field of crafts and trades before the student is committed to the selection of a particular field. This makes their eventual selection more reliable. Concurrently with this introduction to the field of technical training the student carries on with some of his general or cultural studies in, say, the English lan.. 281 guage, English literature, social studies and 162 153 so on. Everybody connected with technical ..111 education has highly recommended this ..96 system. I think the system ought to be 79 expanded gradually and there ought to be an integration of secondary and technical education which, to my mind, is lamentably absent to-day. The longer we delay our attack on the problems of education the more formidable and almost frighteningly forbidding they will become. Some sacrifices now will assuredly provide generous rewards of skill and increased national productivity in the future, that will in turn ensure a desirable level of continuing educational investment. On the other hand, if we eat our capital, gone are the chances for formula and the increased amounts the developing new and greater productivity. States will consequently make available for On the one hand we have an urgent need education.

Under that system, a child who happens to live in an affluent society has everything in the school he needs, but the child who happens to live in a poorer society has nothing he needs in the school. School standards and the salaries of the teachers are determined entirely by the ability of the people in the district to pay. Therefore, there is a terrific difference in the standard of education throughout the United States. On the other hand, in this country, for all the faults of the system and the crisis that Opposition members talk about, it does not matter where a child lives.

People brought up under the normal system of education available to every child in Australia are the equal of people who have had the benefit of any other education system in the world, and the sooner Opposition members stop knocking our system, the better it will be for education in Australia. I think a debate on this section of the Estimates would be better devoted to a discussion of the money that has been made available for tertiary education. The sums provided by this Government are greater than the sums provided for universities by any government in the history of Australia. But our universities still have a problem, and that is the problem of first year enrolments and first year failures. This is a matter that could well be discussed here; the exchange of ideas would be of benefit to the university students and, I am sure, to the honourable member for Barton, who is interested to talk about the crisis in education. As I mentioned before, the situation varies from State to State. At page 22 of its report, the committee on Australian universities saidWe were told, too, that in New South Wales a study of the records of pupils leaving school on reaching the statutory age of IS years, indicates that a considerable proportion of them possessed the general mental ability which one encounters among under-graduates successfully studying at university.

139,Mr Chaney,"No, I am not at all.I remember that in 1958-the honourable member for Hughes( Mr L. R. Johnson) may also remember thisI spoke to the Dean of the University of Tokyo in Tokyo. I asked him what their failure rate was in the first year. Though he spoke perfect English, he had my question translated into Japanese. He then said to me. "" I thought I had misunderstood you. We do not have any failures; people do not come here to fail."" We walked into the library, where there were some 200 students. The room was flood-lit by television lights, but not one student lifted his head to see what was happening. That is the sort of application that puts a country ahead. Extra grants from the Commonwealth are not necessary to beat this so-called crisis, as Opposition members label it. What is needed is the adaptability and the initiative of the students. I think it will be found that any student at a university, who is prepared to keep his head down and tail up and who will take advantage of what is offered, will not fail. In such circumstances, we would have nothing to worry about for the future of this country. It is easy to say that troubles OCCUT and the initiative to do something about the because money is not available. What State matter.

Any talk of assistance to education throughout the Commonwealth will have to take into account the assistance to the privately owned schools which are taking a burden off the backs of the State governments and are doing a magnificent job for the community. more disappointing features of a discussion of this kind is that the Liberal Party and its members just seem to be unable to face this matter as a national issue. I agree completely with the honourable member for Perth( Mr Chaney) when he says that we must approach it as Australians. That is undeniably what the Australian Labour Party does. Every time there is a discussion on this matter that fact is obvious. We on this side of the chamber choose this topic because, first, the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) has always been in the House on the occasion of such discussions and, secondly, any aspect of education comes under his department.

Therefore, spends 2.5 per cent., Switzerland 2.7, France we should be running well up with the 3.4 and Denmark 3.6 per cent. These are leaders in education. Let us take some of the simple statistics to see whether we are running with the from this booklet. First, the percentage of leaders. It is obvious that we are not. So Australians in the fifteen to nineteen years on that question, I believe, as an ordinary age group attending school is 38 per cent.

If we lag in that simple measure, we are lagging behind equivalent countries. We are even lagging behind countries we defeated only fifteen years ago. Then let us take for a measure the number of pupils to each teacher. In Australia, the figure runs at 32, but this booklet shows that most countries of Europe have better figures. For example, the number of pupils to each teacher in Finland is 28; in the West German Democratic Republic the figure is 25, in West Berlin 30, in Denmark 24, in Iceland 26, and so on.

According to the Commissioner of Taxation, Victoria is the wealthiest State and it has had Liberal or anti-Labour governments for almost the 100 years of representative government. This is a fair measure of whether your governments are offering equal and fair opportunities to the people. In New South Wales last year there were 21,000 students in universities. In Victoria, with three-quarters of the population of New South Wales, there were only 11,000 university students. Last year, and almost every year for the past nine or ten years, almost 50 per cent, of the children who took matriculation in Australia were in New South Wales, which has had a Labour Government for twenty years. This is a fair measure of the effort that is being put into education and the status that the Labour Party gives to education as a priority. ft is a long-term business. If you intend to alter the education structure of Australia, you will have to turn on it some of the dynamics that are being used in the Australian Capital Territory through the National Capital Development Commission. These are to us simple propositions. This is not necessarily a challenge to the Government for its sins of omission or commission, but simply an invitation to the Prime Minister, with all the resources of the nation in his hands, to give to the people of Australia an education system worthy of education to which the Commonwealth its name.

It is recorded which the Labour Party turns its attention. in ""Hansard"", of llth April, 1961, and We know that we have a responsibility on education. That is why we feel that it is up to this Government, with the resources at its disposal, to take up the challenge. We are not concerned simply with the matter of university education, although in this field also my contentions are supported by the fact that in New South Wales there are three universities and two university colleges, while in Victoria, where there is greater wealth per head of population, a second university is still in process of establishment and it is getting off to a slow and struggling start. It would not be doing too well if it were not for Commonwealth assistance. What are we going to do about the higher echelons of technical education in Australia-for instance, at the secondary level? What are we going to do to give every student equality of opportunity in the sphere of secondary education? The Labour Party has accepted the challenge. It has said that it will introduce a bursary system for secondary education. The honourable member for Wide Bay( Mr Bandidt) and the other mercenaries opposed to us will say, "" Where is the money coming from?"". They have said that in respect of every social change since the dawn of time. We think that any person conscious of his duty in this community should face up to the problems.

Some Commonwealth departments have tremendous enterprises engaged in giving training of one kind or another. For instance, in 1959, the Post Office spent £3,750,000 on technical training of staff. It is for these reasons that I say that State Premiers coming here and pleading Commonwealth interest in education does for more assistance.

When it was raised in 1958 the Prime",60,Temporary Chairman Thought There Was Not An Original Thought
147,Mr Cairns (Yarra) [9.5],"Onc e againMinister told us that the Australian Constitution precluded the Commonwealth Government from providing direct nnancial aid for education, and that the States were responsible to provide the money for this purpose. In 1959 the right honourable gentleman added to that statement, saying that none of the State Premiers had requested assistance. I think that was correct, up to that point. As far as I was aware, no State Premier had, until that stage, made any positive request for a change in the situation in which the responsibility for spending money rested with the States, while the responsibility for raising it and distributing it to the States, through grants of various kinds, rested upon the Federal Government. But is that still the position? Is it not a fact that at the recent Premiers' Conference the Premier of New South Wales, speaking either for himself or for a majority of the Premiers, saidAt this stage I ask the Commonwealth to accept the principle of assisting the Slates in these direcor from some one on his behalf. tions and to agree to establish a committee to investigate and to make an up-to-date assessment of the needs of primary, secondary and technical education on a national basis, and to suggest a long-term basis of as:istance. Such an inquiry would necessarily take some time. In view of the urgency of the present situation, I also ask the Commonwealth to agree to make some special assistance as an interim measure. This, I suggest, could be based on the position as disclosed in the statement prepared by the Australian Education Council. We would be happy to co-operate with the other States and the Commonwealth in formulating firm proposals. I would like to know whether this course appeals to the Commonwealth. Did or did not the Premier of New South Wales make that statement at the last Premiers' Conference? Was he or was he not supported by the other Premiers? Has the position changed or has it not changed in relation to the attitude of the State Premiers? If that is the attitude of at least one of them, what is the attitude of the Commonwealth, and what is its reaction to the suggestion? The amendment introduced and moved by the honourable member for Hughes( Mr take an active interest in this subject, L. R. Johnson) arises directly from the remarks of the Premier of New South Wales that I have cited. The honourable member movedThat the vote for the Prime Minister's Department be reduced by £1 because the Government has failed to comply with the unanimous request of the Premiers to establish a committee to investigate and assess the needs of primary, secondary and technical education on a national basis, to suggest a long-term basis of assistance and to make some special assistance as an interim measure. The words in this amendment are almost exactly the words of the Premier of New South Wales. Let us have no technical arguments about whether all the Premiers agreed precisely' with the words of the Premier of New South Wales. A t least one Premier has made this specific statement and I understand that at least four others agreed with it. Furthermore, probably all six were in agreement with the spirit of it. Will the Government respond to this request to set up a committee to investigate the needs of primary, secondary and technical education? Will it suggest a long term basis of assistance, and will it grant some special assistance as an interim measure? Those questions are being asked clearly and positively, and we expect an answer from the right honourable gentleman The second point I want to stress at this stage relates to whether sumcient money is being provided for education. The honourable member for Barker( Mr Forbes) argued that it was. The honourable member for Perth( Mr Chaney) criticized every one who suggested that there is a crisis in education in this country. I think that term has been used for far too long. It is becoming hackneyed, and we would be wise to stop using it because it has been used for ten years to my knowledge. It has been supported by practically every educationalist in this country and has been repeated so often that peonle are beginning to take no notice of it. What is the situation? The Australian Education Council recently published a statement. This council is no insignificant body. It consists of representatives of parents and teachers organizations from all over Australia, and includes also State Ministers for Education. So it is a representative body which, in the opinion of the State governments and those people who knows the requirements of education. This is what the council said, among other thingsThere is an increasing gap between the needs and demands of the community for education and what Stale governments can provide. At the present time schools are short of teachers: many teachers are inadequately trained and qualified for the job they are asked to do; States are rinding it difficult to provide the new accommodation needed; there is a large and growing accumulation of makeshift, sub-standard and obsolete school accommodation, and equipment and supplies of all kinds are required in increasing quantities. Is that, or is that not, a sound statement? Any one who knows the educational system which operates in most States knows that that is a sound statement, and that the requirements of education, even at the existing level, are not being met in this country. The statement continues in this wayUnless more effective action can be taken for the necessary to maintain existing standards. I future than has been possible in the past, Australia's man-power will be relatively less and less adequately qualified to meet the increasing demands of modern times. That is a statement of a committee consisting of representatives of parents and teachers organizations all over Australia, and of the six State Ministers for Education. When I compare the statement made by the council with tho_e of the honourable member for Barker and the honourable member for Perth, I know which I am prepared to accept. At the conclusion of its statement the council has recommended, and has summarized, particular financial propositions. It states that expenditure for the future can be divided into two main types; first, the expenditure required for maintaining present standards, and secondly, the expenditure required for effecting desirable improvements. The council also states that in respect of both these categories, expenditure can be divided into running costs and capital costs. With regard to the first category, which system. The knockers are those who will is expenditure required for maintaining the not take proper account of the need for present standards, the council states that improvement. The knockers are those who running costs additional to 1958-59 expendilook to private schools as the schools of ture should be £4,800,000, rLing over five greatest excellence, and they are found in a years to £27,200,000, and that capital costs majority on the other side of this chamber. should be £22,500,000 annually.

The first is that the State Premiers, £48,000,000 annually. Let us compare those figures with the Government which the Commonwealth Goamounts that actually have been provided vernment can no longer ignore; and the for expenditure on education in recent years. second is that inadequate funds have been Let us take only the amount that is required provided for education over the last ten to maintain existing standards, namely, an years and longer under all Commonwealth annual capital expenditure of £22,500,000. governments. We do not need to distinIn 1958-59 £6,500,000 was provided in guish between one government and another. advance of the previous year. In 1957-58 some £8.100,000 was provided in advance of 1956-57. In that year the increase was £7,800,000. In 1955-56 the increase was £10,600,000, in 1954-55 the increase was £8,100,000 and in 1953-54 it was £3,900,000. The amount required for running expenses commences at £4,800,000 in the current year, and rises to £27,200,000 in five years. Never in any one year in the past have we provided more than one-half of the requirement that the council considers fail to understand how any one can be so ignorant and so lacking in concern as to state in this House that any one who claims that educational needs in Australia are not being paid for adequately is not doing the right thing. The Australian Labour Party has not been interested in knocking Australian education when debates on this matter have taken place over the years. I have a great deal more pride in our public school systemby which I mean the system that is run by the Government-tha n have a good many members on the other side of the chamber, most of whom look to private schools to exhibit their pride and confidence. I look to the schools that are run by the State governments, and I will take second place to no one in my pride in that system. I shall continue to come into this place and require seriously that we recognize the deficiencies and defects in the State education system. We do not regard every word of criticism as a knock at the Australian educational We have made two main points in this or some of them, have now submitted a request for action by the Commonwealth Having established these propositions, a third one must be met. No doubt the Government will submit that if more money is to be provided for all the requirements to which the Labour Party gives a high priority, inflation may well result. That is not a satisfactory submission to make at this stage. opinion freely in this chamber that the prePerhaps when prices were rising by 24 per cent, or 15 per cent, or 10 per cent, a year during the administration of this Government and we had a degree of inflation that has never been equalled in this country, it was legitimate for the Government to claim that the needs of education could not be further met without the risk of inflation. That was the situation upon which the Government relied for year after year, but it cannot rely on that argument now when over 100,000 people are fully unemployed, when enormous excess capacity exists in industry, and when there is an enormous volume of unsold stocks. This Government can lean no longer on inflation to excuse its unwillingness to go further to meet the essential needs of this country. I do not know that that point can be any more clearly demonstrated. If honourable members and the community are not prepared to accept the position now, there is nothing that I or any one else can say to convince them. I leave the debate at this stage hoping that any government to meet every request from the right honourable gentleman opposite has every section of the community immediately sufficiently abandoned his boredom and eloit is made. The reason for that is obvious. quent unconcern with what has taken place You must adjust your economy, your so far in this debate to put us right.

IfI followed the honourable member aright in his argument, he was bitterly criticizing this Government because it had not provided more money for education and, particularly, for the secondary and primary stages of education. I have expressed my sent Government has shown an awareness of the importance of education to an extent that no previous government in this Commonwealth has ever done. I say that without the slightest hesitation or, for that matter, any fear of reasonable contradiction. Consider what the position of the universities was a short time ago, dependent as they were upon the annual votes and the assistance of the States, and the position the universities are in to-day, first as the result of the Murray committee's report and the implementation thereof by this Government and, secondly, by the later Australian Universities Commission's report and the very generous assistance given to the universities, both in buildings for residences for staff and equipment. One cannot but be impressed by the fact that the Government has shown, as I have said, an awareness of the importance of education, particularly in the university sphere. I quite realize that it is not possible for finance and the will of your people to do certain things, so that those things may be done. Let us now look at the complaint education is producing sufficient secondary",61,Temporary Chairman Thought There Was Not An Original Thought
148,Mr Drummond (New England) Which Has Been Put Forward By The Parents,"people and tbe secondary people are sufficiently trained to take up the running in the universities either as graduates or, subsequently, as teachers, lecturers or professors it will find, as has been found elsewhere, that the system itself will begin to crack under the strain. The money spent on tertiary education will to a large extent be affected by that. What is the charge against this Government? It is that it does not provide more money. I am not speaking of something I do not know. I know perfectly well that only the States have in their possession all the facts on which to present a documented case to the Commonwealth Government about why special assistance should be granted for the other sections of education. Have they done so over the years? As a matter of fact, I believe that within the last two years the Premiers turned the proposal down, and why they did so was quite clear to me. The Premiers did not want to have any tags attached to the moneys which are allocated by way of tax reimbursements and grants. They wanted to be able to spend them-perhap s in New South Wales in buying up the Balmain electricity supply, or what you will. The Premiers did not want to commit themselves to say, "" We will spend £X millions on education"". It is only recently, I believe-sinc e the Premier of New South Wales, himself a very distinguished Minister for Education, has managed to get the State authorities together on the subject and document a case to put forward to show why there should be a special allocation for education-that that has been done. It is no use blaming the Commonwealth Government. It is not going to hand out millions in addition to the amounts granted or agreed upon at the Australian Loan Council. It is not going to hand millions out without some assurance that what I think is quite rightly described as urgent will The Prime Minister has fought a resolute be attended to and that the money will be spent on education as agreed upon. So it comes back to this point: If the States are to get the assistance that they ask for and which, having regard to the tremendous growth of our juvenile population I believe they can make a good claim to, they must be able to put down a documented case which the experts of this Commonwealth can look at. Having done so they must be prepared to enter into an agreement like the Commonwealth aid roads agreement or the housing agreement, saying specifically that that money will be spent on education, but with the proviso that if that money is made available to them they will not cut down their own allocations. I rose to speak on this subject because there has been so much hot air and misrepresentation and so much misunderstanding by people who are really keenly interested in education that I felt I should say something about it. Ohairman, I always take pleasure in participating in a debate with the honourable member for New England( Mr Drummond). Most of my own primary, secondary and tertiary education took place when he was Minister for Education in New South Wales. He was a very great Minister between the wars. He is the father of the first university to be founded away from a capital city. I support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Hughes( Mr L. R. Johnson). He Ihas raised a subject which concerns the greatest single body of people in Australia. One-third of our population is under sixteen years of age. It is at least 40 years since there has been such a high percentage of Australians under sixteen years of age. One can therefore say that the honourable member for Hughes is asking the committee to consider the future of that quarter of Australia's population which is now at school. We have for many years now debated in the Estimates for the Prime Minister's Department the anomaly that whereas the Commonwealth assists tertiary education, at least in the universities, by grants to the States for salaries and buildings and by scholarships to a certain number of students, it gives no similar assistance by scholarships, or by State grants, for any other form of education. rearguard action on this matter and the last of the props upon which he has relied has now been struck away. He was at last forced to take refuge in the claim that the State Premiers have never sought assistance for education outside the university field. But they have now. They all have.

In it, he gave various reasons why the Comwas not limited to university students; in fact, it permitted any ex-serviceman to complete any education which had been interThe Prime Minister gave as his second office there were recommendations for both secondary and technical scholarship schemes as well as a university scholarship scheme, but that his Government abandoned the former and proceeded with the latter. The third reason he gave was that the Premiers had not sought help for schools. That reason, of course, no longer obtains. Then, in March, 1959, Mr Hawke, the then Premier of Western Australia, asked for an inquiry by a committee such as the Murray committee into other forms of education. The Prime Minister's reaction was that this would cost a lot of money and that he was aeainst it: but that he would send written replies to the Premiers. At the next Premiers' Conference, in June, 1959, Mr Cahill, the late Premier of New South Wales, asked when the reply would be forthcoming. The Acting Prime Minister and Minister for Trade( Mr speech. I did not remember the other. McEwen) promised that he would send it, and, on 2nd July, the reasons for the refusal were sent. They consisted largely in the Prime Minister asked the House to express fact that the States had, through loans and the opinionthrough State grants, adequate resources for their activities, including education, and, to increased facilities for secondary, rural, technical secondly, that universities had for historical and university training, special adult education, reasons become a concern of the Commonremuneration wealth, but primary, secondary and technical education were still a State responCommonwealth nnancial aid and if this should sibility. Then, when speaking to the Estimates two years ago, the Acting Prime Minister and Minister for Trade again gave reasons. He said that all the Premiers had invited Commonwealth help for the universities and that universities were autonomous institutions. He forgot that although the Commonwealth makes grants for roads, railways and hospitals, in all these respects the State day set up the Commonwealth Office of departments still run their own affairs. Last year, the Prime Minister himself answered on this subject and confined himself to two reasons. The first was that the Premiers were content with their loans and new tax reimbursements, and, secondly, that the Commonwealth would be interfering in State administration if it were to show any interest in education outside the autonomous universities. me at what page that appears? I should like to check you very frequently. F.7613/61 -R -f32 ] September, 1960. The States have made as great resources available for education as they can, but their resources are no longer adequate for the purpose. Since 1948-49. the last year for which a Labour government was wholly responsible, the funds available to the States for all purposes have quadrupled, but the amount of money which the States have spent on education since 1948-49 has increased, not by 300 per cent., but by 470 per cent. The States now recognize that they cannot meet the demands of education. In asking for an inquiry into this matter we are, in fact, only pursuing the attitude which the Prime Minister himself took in the House on 26th July, 1945. Perhaps the right honourable gentleman would like to check this also.

SinceI must confine my remarks to a quarter of an hour I conclude on a matter which is indubitably a Commonwealth responsibility, the provision of benefits to students. The Commonwealth has confined these benefits to students at the universities and the proportion of assistance which the Commonwealth is giving for that purpose is constantly declining. In 1953 the smallest number of students entered the universities since the war. Since then, there has been a",65,Temporary Chairman Thought There Was Not An Original Thought

The expenditure of millions of pounds will not increase the capacity of one person to do a thing if that person has no intention of doing that thing. I think that we have to regard the Opposition's ac.ion in putting forward its present case as one more attempt-and a desperate attempt at thatto kid the people of Australia, in an election year, that only a Labour government can give the people what they want. We know, of course, that the truth is different from that claim. Humanitarianism is not the sole prerogative of the Opposition or of any one political party. There is not one honourable member who, deep down, does not believe in striving to do everything that he can possibly do to help everybody in this community. But we have to be realists. We have to acknowledge the fact that Premiers will at all times demand more money and, if they can, seize on one particular means of getting more money from the Commonwealth in order to relieve them of the responsibility for making certain expenditure through one department, hoping that they can spend their own money in some other way. It is logical and natural for them to attempt to do that. Everything that the Opposition puts up Griffith( Mr Chresby), that anybody who amounts to a cry for more and ever more disagrees with him is a fool and a hypocrite. money from the Commonwealth.

If any of the States were to default, the Commonwealth would be very considerable incursions into the field responsible for finding the money to make of university education which it has undergood the default. Let us have a little common sense in believe that the present Government's this debate, Mr Temporary Chairman.

I for one will never thing that stems solely from the Opposition. seek to take from the Government any There is not one honourable member in this chamber who would not give his right arm to make money available for all the things for which money is badly needed. But we have to face the realities of the situation, including the size of our population, the fact thaL there is a limit to the money that can be obiained, and the fact that political considerations require taxes to be kept as low as possible. Our proposal to raise just under £2,000,000,000 this nnancial year shows that we are not doing too bad a job. We are not satisfied with the job that we are doing. We want to do more, and we shall strive to do more. But let us put the whole thing in its proper perspective. I regard the Opposition's case this evening as sheer political cant and humbug put forward merely for election purposes. If honourable members opposite sat on the government benches, they would face exactly the same financial problems and difliculties as we face, but they would not be able to do as good a job for the people of Australia as we are doing. suppose that a person is in a bad way when he thinks, as does the honourable member for The Commonwealth Government, in the taken, has made perfectly clear that what it is interested in is national efficiency.

The question of the taxpayers which was AlthoughI am a Western Australian, I do raised by the honourable member for Griffith not believe that a highly skilled trainee in is an important one. This Parliament has Western Australia who has attained high no right to tax any person for anything technical qualifications which he cannot use except on the considered understanding that in his own State is lost to the Australian it takes money in taxes only because it will nations if he transfers to the eastern States. spend that money in a better way than the If the whole structure of education in any taxpayers would and that the money will be given State were determined simply by the spent on something which is a national State government thinking in terms of its necessity. I know of no expenditure on own needs, the unindustrialized States education in Australia which has not, in would lose people who had a bent for my opinion, represented the expenditure of industries which were not represented in money in a way better than that in which those States simply because the technical most of the taxpayers would have spent it. and other educational structure of the State The amendment that the Australian Labour tended to be related to its own economy.

It is of no use to say that the question of instance, of whether or not we are tapping national efficiency is a question merely for all the available supplies of our talent by the States. The Australian Labour Party our present methods. Tn the United has had an education committee inquiring Kingdom, half of the national service in the various States.

Western Australia has a much higher level whether the Commonwealth knows. of teacher quality than some of the other States have, simply because there is not in Western Australia so great a structure of secondary industry in which to absorb young people whose bent is technical are science and technical students. Many of lost because they are not catered for them, therefore, turn to teaching, whereas, adequately. Thirdly, since a large proporin the more industrialized eastern States, tion of the Australian children and youth such students go into private industry.

We have no clear idea, for For instance, in general, whether any State government knows, or Secondly, since our secondary school structure is weak on the technical side, many ment and of the buildings for training and scientific teaching, there is a loss of skill. private. In fact, with our shortage of science graduates it would possibly be a good thing not to attempt to put a number of science teachers into each of, say, five schools, but to have a centre which could be used by the five schools, whether they were public or private schools. I believe that this is necessary in the interests of national efficiency. Fourthly, the Commonwealth, which has a high financial stake in university education, needs to know whether the failure rate in universities is due to a determination to limit entry into certain professions, regardless of adequacy of ability; whether it is due to overcrowding of universities; whether it is due to the failure of secondary education in Australia to inculcate the habits of study; whether it indicates that matriculation standards are too low in relation to the actual standards required in universities; or whether it indicates that students entering universities are immature and that the system of secondary education should also include a sixth form or advanced year of study before matriculation. Those are questions the answers to which we need to know. Fifthly, the Commonwealth needs to know the optimum size of a university. Some universities are just going on growing and growing, and presumably we could have them growing to the level where they will have 60,000 students each, like some universities in the United States of America. If that becomes so, I think there will be many losses to the students in what they gain from university education. Sixthly, the Government needs to know whether Australian education for the average child is adequate in duration and content. I believe that there needs to be a new specialization in the technical schools, differentiating between trade schools and institutes with a more advanced technology. We need to have a survey of trends in Australian industry and test against them the adequacy of technical and trade education for Australian industry, to see whether Australian technical education adapts itself quickly to changing techniques and new technical and engineering knowledge. Our committee was told by some people concerned with apprenticeships that too frequently the technical schools were getting out of date. They had certain ways of assisting in the training of apprentices, but, when industry changed its techniques, there was not a sufficiently rapid change in what was taught in the technical schools. There was a declining respect on the part of tha employers for the work done in technical schools in relation to apprenticeships. Another consideration underlying tha proposal put forward by the Labour Party is that the Commonwealth's interest in education has led to a high development of the professional type of education. The professional level of engineering is well catered for, but at the diploma level, the middle level, skilled workers are not catered for to the same extent. As I believe the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Whitlam) said, we need to look at the question of the Commonwealth scholarship system being extended to cover the secondary school level. Thefinancingof able students through a university has become an accepted Commonwealth activity. If this had been mentioned in 1937 or 1938 as a desirable field for Commonwealth action exactly the type of speech made by the honourable member who immediately preceded me to-night would have been made then. The contention would have been, ""This is a State matter involving State sovereignty"". But the Commonwealth Government, acting in the interests of national efficiency, has not invaded the field of State sovereignty; it has simply made grants to the States for a special purpose-the purpose of providing university education-and it has given benefits to the students by making direct grants to them. At the secondary school level it could make direct grants to the parents of able students, if it comes to the conclusion that in the fourteen to eighteen or fifteen to eighteen years age group there is a loss of potential capacitya loss of the kind of young people who, at a later point of time, when they get to a university, we take steps to ensure will not be lost. It may be that a survey of education such as has been asked for by the Opposition will reveal that Australian education is adequate in all those respects. Personally, I doubt whether it will, but since the Commonwealth Government has very rightly taken responsibility for national efficiency at the tertiary level of education, it may well consider that it at least should make a survey to see whether, through the secondary level, we are getting the people to the tertiary level that we ought to be getting. If the university failure rates are valid indicators it appears that we are not.

FRASER -That implies an attempt to break and the Minister said that the Government was not able to break the contract. I have in my hand the fiftysecond report of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and I shall quote from page 43 of that document which refers to hotels and guest houses leased by the Department of the Interior. Paragraph 187 statesThe current lessee of the Hotel Canberra has been granted a lease for a period of 25 years from 30th September, 1950. Paragraph 189 statesThe original lessee leased this establishment in 1935 for a period (including options) of fifteen years at an annual rental of £3,120. in 1935? Mr J. R. FRASER -It was the Lyons Governmenta United Australia Party government. The report of the Public Accounts Committee continuesThe lease was renewed as from 30th September, 1950, at a rental of £3,350 per annum subject to the lessee incurring expenditure of approxisay in the House to-day, not that the lease mately £60,000 on alterations. As from 13th September, 1956, the rental was increased to £5,804 5s. per annum in recognition of improvements carried out by the Commonwealth. Mr Speaker, my recollection is that in 1950, the present administration was the Government of Australia. It is further my impression that in 1956 the Government of this country was the Menzies-Fadden coalition Government. I am not able, of course, to vouch for the accuracy of the report of the Public Accounts Committee, but I have the greatest respect for the ability and integrity of its chairman and the members of that committee from both sides of the Parliament. But the Minister for the Interior might explain to the House how a Labour government which went out of office on 10th December, 1949, can be held to be responsible for a lease granted on 30th September, 1950. The Minister might also explain how, when an alteration of the rental was made on 13th September, 1956, action was not taken to increase the rental to an amount which would recoup the Commonwealth for its outgoings. The Minister might explain, Mr Speaker, why, perhaps, he was badly said ""break"", not advised on this matter. I have an idea he was advised as he came to the table. The Minister, I suggest, might answer the questions that I have put and explain why he sought, if he did so seek, to place the blame in this matter on the shoulders of ths Labour Party, when it rightly rests on those of his own Government. Interior and Minister for Works) [10.30] The honourable member for the Australian Capital Territory ( Mr J. R. Fraser) is apparently a tiger for punishment. The facts as he has given them to-night, so far as the dates of the relevant documents and the amounts payable under the lease are concerned, are quite correct. Hotel Canberra Limited, which is a subsidiary of Tooheys Limited, had a lease of the Hotel Canberra which expired, it is true, on 30th September, 1950. It is not unusual for lessees, when the terms of leases are drawing to a close, to negotiate for renewals. The facts are that in this case the conditions of renewal of the lease were settled in 1948. The term of the lease was for 25 years as from the expiration of the existing lease in 1950, and I was very careful to commenced in the term of the previous Government, but that this Government inherited a contractual obligation which it could not avoid. It is true that there was a variation of the lease in 1956, and the honourable member for the Australian Capital Territory may be interested to know just what that variation consisted of. The lessee came to the Government, entrenched in a strong position behind a lease which did not expire until 1975 Mr J. R. Fraser -And granted in 1950. obligation which, I repeat, this Government inherited. The terms and conditions of the new lease were settled before this Government came to office.

That was the only variation on which we could secure agreement with the lessee. I think that pu's the situation perfectly clearly and simply, Mr Speaker. [10.33] -Yesterday . Mr Speaker. I asked the Downer) a question without notice concerning deportation orders issued in respect of two Malayan pearlers, named Daris Bin Saris and Jaffa Madune. who have been in Australia in one instance for rwelve vears and in the other for nine years. Many requests have been made throughout Australia for the cancellation of these deportation orders. At the present time a petition seeking a cancellation is being circulated in Darwin, and has already been signed by some 1,500 residents of that town. But it is not simply because these numerous requests have been made that T am asking the Minister again to consider his attitude in this matter. T have pointed out that the two men are comparatively young, and that, owing to the period of time for which they have worked in Australia, they would now find it difficult to re-adjust themselves to conditions in their homeland. The Minister gave no indication, in the reclv given to me this morning, that he would reverse his decision. He implied that agitation aimed at keeping these men in Australia could result in a major departure from, and would strike a blow at, our immigration policy, which has been endorsed by all political parties in Australia. He said that a weakening of the attitude now adooted could result in a demand for the modification of the immigration policy. The Minister also said that the records showed that one of the men had made a visit to Singapore to see his wife and children. I fail to see that this has any particular bearing on the case or on the request for a review of the decision. I point out, first, that in making these representations 1 have no intention whatsoever of bringing about a weakening of our immigration policy. All1 seek is to have that policy implemented in a humane and sympathetic manner. I suggest that when circumstances indicate that a case should be treated somewhat differently from the usual run of cases, the matter should be treated according to its merits. The two men concerned were brought to Australia originally after application by pearling interests. Their entry was welcomed at that time by the Commonwealth Government, because they were willing to accept a type of employment-that of pearlMinister for Immigration CVIr. ing, the most hazardous employment of all -whic h no member of the Australian community would undertake. The Commonwealth at that time was pressing for the establishment of export industries, and it was prepared to go to considerable lengths to foster the pearling industry, so that badly needed dollars could be earned. This is not a case of men coming to the country in an unskilled capacity and now competing with Australian men for employment. It is not a case of men coming to Australia to work at a particular occupation, such as that of cook, and catering for certain classes or races of people, who, by virtue of tradition and custom, have to be specially catered for. Nor is it a case of young people coming here to learn, by way of education or by working in industry, something that they can take back for the benefit of their own country. I know that persons in the categories I have mentioned sometimes ask for permission to remain here, but I venture to suggest that in the case of the two men concerned entirely different considerations are involved. Here we have two men who were admitted, because of special skills nhey possessed, to help establish and expand an industry which would result in the strengthening of our economy, and to engage in an occupation which Australians would not accept because of its highly hazardous nature. Let us consider the Commonwealth's attitude. First, it is willing to accept divers into the community in",75,Adjournment
165,Mr Nelson (Northern Territory),"an endeavour to bolster our export earnings. Then, when the need for their services no longer exists, because the industry has been handed over to the Japanese, it is prepared to throw them back on the scrap heap. This is, to say the least, very harsh treatment indeed. It is true that these men came here, as all other pearlers do, under specific terms and conditions, but I believe that when we invite men to undertake work of this nature, we have a moral obligation to accept some responsibility for their welfare after the need for their services no longer exists. These men have worked for a number oil years in Australia. They have performed tiheir duties to the utmost satisfaction of their employers and they have become first class citizens. We should at least concede them the right to stay in the country. If , by their conduct, they had shown themselves to be unfitted to stay here, tihen I would agree that the Minister's decision should stand. But such is not the case. By their conduct they have proved that they would be worthy citizens of this country. I. repeat that I do not want to have any part in breaking down our immigration policy. I had no part in sponsoring the introduction of persons into Australia lo perform the work which these men were called upon to perform, but I feel that the Australian Government, having acted as it has, should at this stage have another look at the position. These men have undertaken valuable work to help supplement our national income, and to throw them back on to the scrapheap now that their work no longer exists is, to say the least, not giving them a fair deal. I do not think that this is the kind of attitude that a big-hearted people should adopt. I again appeal to the Minister to reconsider this case, not as he would consider an application on behalf of an unskilled worker or perhaps a student who might have come to Australia to advance their own persona] interests or the interests of their country, but as a case in a particular category which requires and deserves special consideration. Certainly let us consider the adverse effect and the hardship that this decision will have on these people, but let us not forget to consider earnestly the underlying principles involved in the case. Immigration) [i0.42] I know that the honourable member for the Northern Territory ( Mr Nelson) has genuine and sympathetic feelings about this case because it is now some months since he first raised it with me. 1 can well understand his approach to this matter, but in the answer that 1 gave him yesterday afternoon at ques ion time. I think I stated fairly comprehensively the reasons for the Government's decision. If there was any ambiguity in my reply I want to allay it at once because, quite frankly, I am not prepared to reverse my decision in relation to these two men. As I understood the honourable gentleman, he stated that the fact that one of the pearlers had returned in 1954 to his homeland to see his wife and children makes no material difference. I think it makes a very material difference because the argument that has been advanced by these men is that they have lost all connection with Malaya, that they have no ties there and that, in effect, they have become Australianized. I do not see how that statement can be squared up with the fact that a few years ago one man returned to what should be his most intimate association with his wife and children in Malaya. So far as I knowI have no evidence to the contrary -hi s wife and children are still living there. Without appearing to be too harsh, I should think that if one could presume to try to make any moral judgment on the matterI am sure the honourable member for the Northern Territory will agree with me in this-on e would have to hold that a man's primary duty is to support and live in company with his wife and children. So, as far as one of the pearlers is concerned, the statement that all ties with Malaya have been cut is not sustained. Indeed, I would say, on the contrary, that he has very powerful family associations there which all family-loving people would think should be resumed. The difficulty with a case such as this is that if permission were given for these two pearlers to remain in Australia it would only be just that many other people in a similar category-peopl e who have been brought here from other countries, particularly from Asian countries, for short-term limited occupations-shoul d be granted",76,Adjournment
166,Mr Downer (Angas,"Minister forp-rrmission to remain here upon completion of their contracts. If one were prepared to do that, it would mean that many hundreds of people in these categories would be granted permanent admission to Australia. As the honourable gentleman will realize by using a very little arithmetic, not more than a few years would elapse before these numbers would represent such an accretion of population as to make quite a perceptible inroad into the established immigration policy which hitherto has commanded warm, virtually unanimous, support from both sides of the House. In essence I do not think that these men are being subjected to great hardship. They are still reasonably young. I think one of them is at the end of his twenties and the other is getting on in his thirties. No one in this chamber could regard men in those age groups as being well advanced in life. Indeed, the reverse is true. These young fellows are very healthy and have the greater part of their lives before them. have support from my evergreen and everyouthful friend, the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith. Before these men came to Australia they were acquainted with their terms of admission. They knew what their contracts contained. The arrangements now have expired and, as I said yesterday, considering what an extremely pleasant, well-ordered and, for an Asian country, relatively prosperous nation Malaya is, I do not think it is a hardship to ask Malayans who have been in Australia for a few years to return to their own country and, in the case of one of them, to return to his wife and children. I listened to-night to the speech of the agreement was made by this Government. honourable member for the Australian Capital Territory ( Mr J. R. Fraser) relating to the lease of the Hotel Canberra. I am contelligence than the honourable member for cerned to learn, first, that in 1948 a Labour government entered into a contract with ter would have his facts, based on sound the people who run the Hotel Canberra, which is a subsidiary of Toohey's brewery, and secondly, that the Liberal-Country Party Government which succeeded the take a report like that from some of his Labour administration two years later is advisers outside and try to cause mischief bound by that agreement. I think that over a simple matter of people paying their this state of affairs is so unsatisfactory and rent for valuable property paid for by the improper that an inquiry should be held into all the circumstances surrounding the signing of such an agreement. I am surprised, too, that in the circumstances an Opposition member should rise in his place and direct attention to a transaction which to me appears corrupt. The honourable member for the Australian Capital Territory, who is now interjecting, was given his answer this afternoon in no uncertain terms by the Minister for the Interior( Mr Freeth), who has the respect of this House. I am amazed that the honourable member, after having been told that the agreement was signed by a Labour government, should rise again and make the statement that the term of the new lease having commenced in 1950 the present position was the responsibility of this Government. He had already been told by the Minister that the contractual obligation had been entered into by a Labour government, but that was not sufficient for him. member for Kingsford-Smith has stated that he does not believe that. He spends most of his time outside. Parliament has stated that he will not accept the word of a Minister!

May I preface my remarks by saying that on the 20th July last two newspaper men from the ""Mirror"" newspaper entered a Commonwealth garage for the purposes, no doubt, of their employment. While there they were asked by Commonwealth police omcers-member s of the regular police force-to give their names, to identify themselves and to show their press passes, after which they left. The honourable member for East Sydney said in this House on Thursday, 17th August, that he had been informed and that he believed that after that event my officers-the officers of the Attorneyhonorable gentleman said on his information was one of the principal negotiators in this business, had gone to the "" Mirror"" newspaper, seen the people in control and had made an agreement vvith that newspaper that, if it would not publish an article which it then contemplated publishing about the security service-thos e are the words of the honourable member, "" the security service ""-for its facist methods in what had occurred at the garage, I would not prosecute the two newspaper men for an offence which the honourable gentleman the garage or by their being there.

So, on 22nd August, I wrote to the "" Mirror"" a letter which I would like to read to the House. The editor's name is Mr Ian Smith. I wrote to him as follows:Dear Mr Smith, On Thursday evening last on the adjournment of the House of Representatives, the honourable member for East Sydney (The Hon. E. J. Ward) referred to a happening on the 20th July last at the Commonwealth garage in McElhone Street. Sydney, in which two journalist members of your staff were concerned. Amongst other things, the Honourable Member said I then set out the quotation from "" Hansard "", which I shall read, if I may. This is what the honourable gentleman said"" The story as given to meI have no reason to doubt it-is that the newspaper strongly resented the action of the security officers in merely because ihey visited the Commonweallh pool evidently in search of a nice story which they believed existed because of this change in "" The newspaper intended to run a story Before the newspaper could publish the story a was held between ei.her the Attorneynewspaper did not publish the story no charges would be preferred against the men who ha'd The Honourable Member had earlier said thai"" No doubt the Attorney-General played some I have had the officers of my department in Sydney and in Canberra and members of the ComPolice Force in Sydney asked wheiheT between any of the officers of my department or members of the Commonwealth Police Force other than two telephone conversations on the in question, each between Mr Morris As far as I am personally concerned you and I know very well that no such conference took place. However, the honourable member's assertions which I have quoted affect your newspaper in the conduct of its affairs and I write to ask whether you would care to make any comment upon the information contained in this letter. To that, I received a reply from M i r r o r Newspapers Limited under date August 25th. It saysDear Sir Garfield, I acknowledge your letter of August 22nd. Then reference is made to what the letter said. It continuesThe facts as presented by you are correct. At no time did this office make contact with the officers of your department or the Commonwealth Police Force other than in the two telephone conversations you mentioned between Mr Morris and Inspector Davies of the Commonwealth police. The assertion that a conference was held and an agreement reached not to publish a story, prothat the "" Mirror"" newspaper was going viding no charges were preferred, is baseless. Thank you for your courtesy in writing. So the honourable gentleman could not have got it from any source such as a newspaper. On the other hand, 1 do not think we ought to think he invented it because the mind that invented it was really a mind that was distorted and weak and sick. We all know that description does not fit the honourable gentleman. We should not think for one moment that he is capable of making this story up, knowing the seriousness of the charge not only against me but against the oflieers of my department and, for that matter, against the newspaper. SoI think we must say: "" Well, here he stands, the simpleton! He believes some silly, stupid story that a man with a red beard at the bus stop told him. He could not have thought it up because he is not that kind of chap."" Attorney-General( Sir Garfield Barwick) hns made an extraordinary statement and I hope to be able to correct him in one or two respects. He commenced by referring to what he evidently regarded as my discourtesy because, on a previous occasion, 1 did not tell him that I intended to raise a matter on the adjournment debate. I did not know there was any provision in the Standing Orders which required me to do so, but if I did commit an offence, I point out that the Attorney-General committed a similar offence by failing to let me have notice that he proposed to raise this matter to-night. He let others know in the hope that I would be told what was going to be raised. Let me say to the honourable gentleman that I am very happy that he has now given me the opportunity to refer to some of the rubbish which he has dished out here at times and his assertions that what I said is false and a fabrication. If he has a look at the report of his speech in "" Hansard""-if he does not correct it which he will undoubtedly attempt to dohe will see that he made reference to the fact that I had referred to the officers concerned as members of the security service when according to him they were actually members of the Commonwealth Police Force. Later he asked: "" Did anybody imagine to miss such a great story of an attack on the security service? "" He used that particular term himself. He asked: "" Would any one suggest that to please him the newspaper was so silly as to miss such a story?"" Let me say to the honourable gentleman that his veracity is not beyond question, merely because he happens to be a knight bachelor. He emphasized when he was reading the letter from the "" Mirror"" newspaper that it was "" Sir Garfield"" that the editor addressed. I think that the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) who recommended him for the honour did what many boys do to stray dogs-ti e tins to their tails when they want to irritate or annoy them. Let us have a look whether this is the great champion of veracity and truth. I remember reading in a document called "" ThingsI HeaT "" deliberately because I knew that honourable members were going to laugh, but the gentleman who publishes it-Frank Browne -is an employee of Mirror Newspapers Limited, whom the Attorney-General has been quoting as his authority to show that my story was completely wrong. I know what the honourable gentleman was hoping I would do, but I am not going to do it. He was hoping to trap me into the indiscretion of telling him who the source of my information was, but I assure him that I am not going to reveal it. Let me go on and read what Frank Browne had to say about the Attorney-General and he has never replied to these allegations. The Attorney-General has also had the opportunity of taking action against Frank Browne if he desired to do so. You are supposed to be the great jurist of this country, the great constitutional authority.

Mr Whitlam asked the Treasurer, upon notice1. In what instances in the last ten years have superior courts interpreted sections of the Estate Duty Assessment Aot and thc Gift Duty Assessment Act in a way contrary to that contended for by the Commissioner of Taxation? 2. Upon what sections of the acts were these decisions given? 3. What steps have been taken to amend these sections? Mr Harold Holt -The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follows:1, In the ten years ended 30th June, 1961, superior courts have not decided any cases against the Commissioner of Taxation under any of the provisions of the Gift Duty Assessment Act. In the same period superior courts have interpreted sections of the Estate Duty Assessment Act in a way contrary lo that contended for by the Commissioner of Taxation in the undermentioned cases, viz.:(a) Robertson and Others v. Commissioner of Taxation 86 C.L.R. 463, in which the questions in issue were whether the provisions of section 8 (4) (e), or, alternatively, section 16A (1) (a) enabled the commissioner to overcome the effect which certain of the articles of association of a private company, in which the deceased owned a suostantial parcel of shares, had on lhe value of those shares at the date of the deceased's death. (b) National Trustees, Executors and Agency Company of Australasia Limited v. Commissioner of Taxation (Chisbolm's Case) 89 C.L.R. 177, which concerned the correct method of ascertaining the rebate of estate duty allowable, pursuant to section 8 (7), in a case where the deceased died domiciled in Australia but owning personal property in more than one country outside of Australia. fc) National Trustees, Executors and Agency Company of Australasia Limited v. Commissioner of Taxation (Cain's Case) 91 C.L.R. 540, in which the questions in issue were whether the value of deceased's right to share in any future distributions of profits made pursuant to the provisions of the Wool Realization (Distribution cf Profits) Act 1948 formed part of his dutiable estate by reason of section 8 (3) (b) of the Estate Duty Assessment Act and, if so. the manner in which that value should be ascertained and. further, whether, in the circumstances of that case, the provisions of section 20 (2) or section 20 (3) of the Estate Duty Assessment Act authorized the amendment of the original assessment to include the value of that right. Although the Full High Court (by majority) held ihat the right to share in future distributions did form part of the deceased's "" personal property "" within the meaning of section 8 (3) (b), it also held that the amount to be included should be the present value of that right at the date of death and not the actual amount which was subsequently received by the executor of the estate. The court further held that, in the particular circumstances of the case, the commissioner had no power to amend the original assessment because the executor had made a full and true disclosure of all material tacts, and there had been no error in calculation or mistake of fact. (d) Perpetual Executors and Trustees Association of Australia Limited v. Commissioner of Taxation (Thomas' case) 88 C.L.R. 434 (Privy Council) and 94 C.L.R. 1 (High Court) in which the question in issue was whether, pursuant to the provisions of either section 8 (3) (b) or section 8 (4) (e), the value of a deceased partner's interest in the goodwill of the partnership, of which the deceased was a member at the date of his death, formed part of his dutiable estate (on the authority of Milne's case 69 C.L.U. 270) notwithstanding that the relevant partnership agreement provided that, in ascertaining the price to be paid by the surviving partners for the deceased's interest in the partnership business, no amount was to be taken into account in respect of partnership goodwill. (e) Lloyd and Another v. Commissioner of Taxation 93 C.L.R. 645 in which the question for decision was whether a bequest to the Navy League Sea Cadet Corps was a bequest for "" public educational purposes"" within the meaning of section 8 (5) and/or section 8 (8) of the Estate Duty Assessment Act. (f) Gale v. Commissioner of Taxation 102 C.L.R. 1 in which the question at issue was whether a gift made by the deceased within three years of hisdeath (and therefore part of the dutiable estate by virtue of the provisions of section 8 (4) (a)) by reason of which his intended spouse acquired an interest in certain real estate, should be valued (on the authority of the decision in Moss v. F.C. of T. 77 C.L.R. 184) in the form in which the gift existed at the date of death, namely,, an interest in real estate, or (having, regard to the decision of the Houseof Lords in Sneddon v. Lord Advocate1954) A.C. 257) in the form of cash. paid by the deceased donor to enable his intended spouse to acquire that interest. (g) English, Scottish and Australian Bank Ltd. v. The Commonwealth 1960 A.L.R. 61, in which the question for decision was whether the charge over all the assets of a deceased estate created by section 34 (1) in favour of the commissioner for the better securing of the payment of estate duty operates in priority to the interest of an encumbrancee secured over the assets of that estate. In addition to the cases referred to above, appellants were partially successful, during the ten-year period under consideration, in two other cases before the High Court, namely Elders Trustee and Executor Co. Ltd. v. Commissioner of Taxation (Braund's Case) 96 C.L.R. 563 and Emanuel v. Commissioner of Taxation (not reported-decisio n given 21st October, 1957). However, as both of these cases relate exclusively to questions of value in relation to private company shares and do not involve questions of interpretation per se, they have not been referred to above. No courts other than the High Court (or Privy Council) have delivered judgments contrary to the views contended for by the Commissioner of Taxation during the ten-year period referred to. 2. See answers to auestion 1 above. 3. The question of amending the estate duty legislation is a matter of government policy to be decided at the appropriate time. Mr Allan Fraser asked the Treasurer, upon notice1. Has he studied the remarks of the Commonwealth Committee on Taxation relating to expenditure on mill buildings and housing as shown on page 96 of its report? 2. As the sawmilling industry has been in the doldrums for several years, is it possible to implement now, and not in twelve months' time, the recommendation made by the committee in paragraph 482, so that mill buildings and housing for employees located in the logging area will be recognized as a wasting asset similar to access roads, and thus become an allowable deduction under section 124P of the Income Tax and Social Services Contribution Assessment Act? MrH a r o l d H o l t honourable member's follows:1. Yes. 2. This recommendation of the committee involves a question of Government policy, and it would not be appropriate to consider the proposal in isolation from policy matters generally. As1 indicated when tabling the committee's report, recommendations involving questions of policy will be examined at an opportune time. Tariff Protection Against Products of the Territory of Papua and New Guinea. Mr Whitlam asked the Minister for Trade, upon noticeFor what products has tariff protection been (a) sought, (b) recommended or (c) granted against products of the Territory of Papua and New Guinea in the last financial year? honourable member's question is as follows:None. However, during the year, three Tariff Board reports arising out of earlier inquiries but touching on the question of tariff protection against products of the Territory of Papua and New Guinea were received and acted upon by the Government. Timber and plywood: In this report, the board recommended that the existing protective duties on imports of Territory plywood in excess of 16,000,000 square feet per annum remain unchanged. The Australian industry had not made any request concerning Territory plywood at the board's inquiry. Animal and vegetable fats and oils: The board recommended that the existing protective duty on peanuts remain unchanged and that tie protective duty on peanut oil be reduced by ls. a gallon. The Australian industry had requested increased duties on peanuts' and peanut oil imported from Papua and New Guinea and other sources. Passionfruit juice and pulp: The board recommended that there be no change in the protective duties on these products but that the volume of imports from Papua and New Guinea permitted entry at concessional rates of duty be increased. The Australian industry had requested cancellation of concessional entry and increased protective duties. In each of these three cases, the Government gave effect to the Tariff Board's recommendations. Tariff Board. The answers to the Mr Whitlam asked the Minister for questions are as Trade, upon noticeOn what matters and dates in the last iinancial year has (a) thc Minister made a reference to the Tariff Board, (b) the board held an inquiry, (c) the board made a report or (d) the Minister acted on a report? honourable member's questions are as follows:-",86,Answers To Questions

I undertook to have a prepared answer made available on other points in the questions which concerned the Treasury. This has been done and I now inform the honourable member that the purchase of the two destroyers was arranged with the United States Government in the same way as the purchase of Hercules aircraft was arranged with the United States of America some time ago. The purchase of the destroyer is to be financed by annual instalment payment for purchase of the ships and, as ments to the United States Government, but subject to the condition that the full cost of each vessel will be met within three Government had raised or would raise in years of the date on which the vessel is delivered to the Royal Australian Navy. The amount paid each year will be included as a debit in the balance of payments and will reduce our overseas reserves in the same way as any other overseas payments.
