I believe that point that to apply the public interest test to a the essence of capitalism is competition, and the monopoly would insulate those monopolies from ability of companies to compete against each any outside attack in the form of acquisitions of other-not, of course, to make it difficult for shares. In other words, that would entrench the them, but to compete against each other-is in position of monopolists. They would be able to the best interests of consumers. That makes act in the market-place, not in the interests of companies remain honest and forces them to the consumers or of their shareholders, but in provide not what the management of a company the selfish interests of the management of those may want, but what ordinary consumers want in monopolies.
