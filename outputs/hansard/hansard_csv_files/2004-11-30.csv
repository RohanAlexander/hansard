Ms MACKLIN (Jagajaga) (4.30 p.m.)-The Howard government has well and truly failed the skills test. The Howard government’s inaction has seen a severe skills shortage develop on its watch, which is hurting Australian business, families and our economy. Skills, as a driver of productivity, have dropped a staggering 75 per cent over the last 10 years, a shocking record from this government. We now have severe skills shortages in key trades and industries-engineers, electricians, mechanics, bricklayers, plumbers and metal fitters-and in the service industries, especially child care and aged care. The Productivity Commission has found that Australia needs more skilled workers and more skills growth to address skills shortages, improve living standards and remain internationally competitive, yet tens of thousands of Australians are turned away from TAFE each year because this government will not fund enough TAFE places. Most of the growth in the New Apprenticeships scheme over the last few years has happened in areas where there are no skills shortages. One study has found that between 20 and 30 per cent of new apprentices receive inadequate training, and about half the people who do not finish their new apprenticeships say it is because they feel they are being used as cheap labour instead of being trained. The Australian Industry Group has found that, across the manufacturing sector-right now, not in four years time-there are between 18,000 and 21,000 unfilled vacancies for tradespeople. What is more, according to the Australian Industry Group the number of traditional apprenticeships has remained largely unchanged since this government came into office in 1996. Just last week there was more bad news. According to the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations skilled vacancy index, vacancies for skilled tradespersons have increased by a staggering 54 per cent over the last three years. The figures reveal sharply rising demand for skilled workers in the key areas of metal trades, automotive, electrical and construction industries. Other figures last week confirmed that the Howard government is doing little to address this demand. According to the latest figures from the National Centre for Vocational Education and Research, there has been a massive 22 per cent drop in the share of apprenticeships in traditional trades since 1999. Only one in three apprenticeships were in training in the traditional trades fields for the June quarter this year, compared to 42 per cent five years earlier. What a shocking record. The NCVER figures also reveal that over the 12 months to June 2004 the number of Australians commencing a traineeship or apprenticeship has dropped 10 per cent, with nearly 30,000 fewer people having commenced training compared to the 12 months to June 2003. There are 9,800 fewer people in training, according to this report. The number of people cancelling or withdrawing from training is up by 5,400 compared to the June 2003 quarter, a jump of 19 per cent. These are the actual figures of what has been happening in vocational MAIN COMMITTEE",106,Ramus Scholarships Alone That Is A Very Schedule Fee Of Bulk Billed Consultations
201,The Deputy Speaker (Hon. I.r. Causley) Took The Chair At 4.30 P.m.,"education and training under this government. You would think it would be a wake-up call. After eight years, what a mess they have created. They have let a severe skills shortage develop, and they are doing next to nothing to address it. It is, of course, Australian business and families that have to pay the price for the government’s lack of action. Yesterday, we saw a very confused Minister for Vocational and Technical Education reveal that he is well and truly out of his depth. He has no understanding of the seriousness of the severe skills crisis that has developed on this government’s watch. In answer to a question from the federal member for Adelaide about whether the Howard government supported industry levies to deal with the acute national skills shortage, the minister replied that, no, he does not support industry levies. The minister clearly has no idea that earlier this month the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission authorised an industry levy on bricks to fund more apprenticeships in order to address a shortage of skilled bricklayers. The government’s inaction has led to the industry having to put a levy on to pay for increased training. The minister responded with what can only be described as confused waffle when I asked him-in light of his answer-what he was going to do to stop this new levy on Australian families and businesses. The minister’s answer was that the issue was not within his remit. It just shows that the minister either does not know or does not care that Australia’s skills shortage is seriously hurting. Amazingly, the minister also put his stamp of approval on increased costs for families and businesses arising from the wage pressures caused by Australia’s skills shortage. He should of course tell that to local business and families, who are struggling to cope with spiralling costs because of the skills shortage that has happened on this government’s watch. On the site of the new terminal at Adelaide airport, the shortage of wall and ceiling fixers is so severe that GMR Interiors, one of the construction companies on site, has to pay up to $600 a week above the industry rate. But the minister does not seem to care about this. Yesterday he said that inflated wages were a good thing, yet the severe skills shortage is clearly jeopardising local industry projects through inflated wages and costs. Local businesses across the country are giving away work because they cannot find enough workers to fulfil demand. And things are set to get worse and worse. According to the Australian Industry Group, right now Australia has a shortage of around 20,000 skilled workers in sectors like carpentry, construction, manufacturing and mining. The AIG says that over the next five years 175,000 people are expected to leave the traditional trades but only 70,000 are likely to enter. That means there will be a shortfall of more than 100,000 skilled workers. But what is the government doing to address this? We are looking at a shortage of 100,000 workers and what do we get from this government? Next to nothing-a handful of technical colleges that are frankly going to make barely a dent. These technical colleges will not start for another year, they will not be in place fully for four years and they will in fact only affect a tiny proportion of school students when they are in place. The skills crisis in this country is here and now and it is growing. Businesses cannot wait another year for action from the Howard government. They are crying out for more skilled workers right now. The colleges will provide training to fewer than two per cent of Australian year 11 and 12 students-that is the contribution they are going to make. The vast majority of senior secondary students will in fact miss out. Early school leavers and year 12 graduates will be excluded from the colleges, and yet every year under this government we turn away 40,000 Australians from TAFE and 40,000 early school leavers join the unemployment queue. MAIN COMMITTEE If this government invested the funds it is using for technical colleges into our TAFEs right now, we could create more than 45,000 desperately needed new places. Instead of wasting millions of dollars duplicating Australian TAFEs and limiting new training to just a few, the Howard government should fund our TAFEs properly and invest in more apprenticeships in areas of skills shortage. But instead of acting to address our skills shortages in this way the government is more interested in playing politics, especially with the states. The government has refused to fund any new TAFE places, and this has gone on for quite a considerable period of time. As can be seen, the Vocational Education and Training Funding Amendment Bill 2004 that we are debating here today continues this neglect. It is further evidence of the government’s inaction on skill shortages. The bill reduces and limits the funding to the vocational education and training sector. The first section of the bill will reduce the level of funds for vocational education provided to the Australian National Training Authority for distribution to the states and territories in 2004. The funding will fall from $1.36 billion to $1.31 billion-once again, a reflection of this government’s failure to strike an agreement on training funding with the states and territories in the last round of ANTA negotiations. The bill will also appropriate up to $1.154 billion in funds for vocational education and training to be distributed by the states and territories for 2005. This amount of money, I have to say, is a stark reminder that the government cannot be trusted when it comes to education and training. While on the surface it sounds like a large amount, closer scrutiny reveals a system which has been starved of funds and is struggling to fill a gaping hole that was in fact created by this government when it first came to power. Just how little value this government places on training and apprenticeships was revealed when it slashed $240 million out of the VET sector in its first two budgets. This was swiftly followed by the 1998-2000 ANTA agreement, which abolished growth funding altogether and froze funding to the sector for the next three years. These funding cuts and the subsequent freeze have meant that more and more TAFE colleges have had to close some of their training facilities, putting teachers and students under pressure, and have threatened the quality in training and skills development in this country. At the same time that the government has been cutting and freezing funds we have had businesses crying out for more skilled staff, and of course there is a major shortage of TAFE places. This is the direct result of the Howard government’s education and training policies. This skills shortage has happened under this government’s watch. No-one else is to blame. This bill is just the latest instalment in a long-running saga surrounding the last ANTA agreement. So, instead of a government that approaches negotiations over the funding of our national training system as an opportunity to work with the states and territories, what we have is a government that just wants to play politics, buck-pass responsibility for its policy failings and, as usual, blame somebody else. No wonder the government has announced that it will close down the Australian National Training Authority. This authority was the vehicle to enable people to work collaboratively-not only the states and the Commonwealth but also business and union representatives-to make sure that we had a group of people whose task was to address the training needs of this country. Well, this government has just decided to abolish it. The government clearly are not serious about boosting the role of vocational education and training; otherwise we would see a much more substantial investment in this bill. They have MAIN COMMITTEE not offered the states any extra growth funding, which is why they have not been able to secure an agreement with the states for the next round of ANTA funding. The government have just walked away-taken their bat and ball-and have decided to abolish ANTA, along with being unable to negotiate a new agreement. For eight long years the Howard government has been wasting talent and missing economic opportunities because it refuses to act to address this growing skills crisis. This did not just happen yesterday and it did not just happen since the election; it has been happening over the last eight years. And the government has not only done nothing about it; if you go back to the early days of this government, its first few budgets had a disastrous impact on the funding for vocational education and training. Our workplaces are facing skills shortages, there is a serious shortage of TAFE places, wage pressures are jeopardising local industry and, of course, families are suffering as wellsuffering because they have to pay more to get their homes built. They will certainly have to pay more if they want a brick home because there is now a new levy on the price of bricks. I hope everybody who is thinking about either doing an extension or building a new home recognises that the increase in the cost of extending or building their brick home is a direct result of the Howard government not properly funding the number of bricklayers in training, and so the industry has been forced to put on this additional levy. The government have had a long time to get this right. They have had eight years to invest in world-class training, but they have not done that; they have just ignored this area. I am sorry to say that this bill is yet another wasted opportunity-yet another wasted and missed opportunity-because it does not provide the additional funding and the additional places for training that our country needs. You do not have to take my word for it; just look at what the Australian Industry Group says about the shortage of workers. This bill today will do nothing to address the shortages that the Australian Industry Group has identified. This bill just extends funding to the training sector for next year. The big disappointment is that it has no additional growth. Here we have a government putting forward a bill in the face of a very serious skills crisis, with no additional growth funding-none-to help cut down the queues of people waiting to get into TAFE and no long-term solution to the training crisis gripping Australian business. I for one know that none of us in this parliament can afford complacency in this vocational education and training area. So, after eight years of neglect, the government are trying to reinvent themselves as a party interested in skills and apprenticeships. When they first came in, they slashed the budget. Then they froze the funding for a few years. They have realised they created this severe skills crisis and know they have to do something-but this bill is not part of it. This bill is certainly not doing anything to add to the training opportunities for Australians, because there is no growth funding associated with it. Instead of building on the successful elements of the existing system, next year the government is intending to create these new technical colleges. As some members of the coalition themselves have said, this will create unnecessary duplication. The abolition of ANTA also clearly signals the end of tripartite collaborative negotiations in this area. No longer will we have a place where all the parties can come together and work out what is best for training in this country. This is particularly important if we are to protect the national training system and to make sure that, for business and for employees, we have qualifications and courses that are recognised right across Australia. The last thing we want is MAIN COMMITTEE a return to a system where qualifications are recognised only in individual states or very narrowly accredited. That would be a disaster for both employers and workers. The highest priority should be given to delivering adequate funding to make sure that our local TAFEs have the money that they need and make sure that there are work and training opportunities for those 45,000 young people who every year-I wonder when the government will wake up to this issue-leave school early. Every year for eight years we have had 45,000 young people leave school early. They join the unemployment queue. They are not going into training, they are not staying at school and they are the people who we should be targeting to make sure that we can get them into training and that they do not face a life of long-term unemployment. It was Labor that actually introduced the first vocational education and training funding bill. We also set up the Australian National Training Authority so that apprentices could have a well-funded national education system. It was an unprecedented commitment to the training of young Australians in particular. We spent our time trying to build up a great training system. Unfortunately, over the last eight years we have seen a government running it down. As I said, this run-down of training has become a major concern of industry. The Australian Industry Group have released report after report, trying to get the Howard government to focus on the growing skills crisis. I quote from one of their reports: Over half of the businesses surveyed currently face skill shortages. Regional businesses in NSW (60% currently face skill shortages) are most acutely impacted followed by businesses in regional Victoria (48%) and Queensland (41%). According to the Australian Industry Group, skill shortages in Australia are endemic‘endemic’ is the word the AIG uses. There is a shortage of around 20,000 workers. This government is not providing growth funding in this bill. The AIG’s warning is that the skills crisis facing Australian industry is here and now. The AIG must be very frustrated that it has a government that is not listening. The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry is also seriously concerned. This is what a survey of investor confidence, published this year, had to say: For only the second time in the history of the survey Business Taxes and Charges ... has been removed from its position as the foremost constraint on investment. Taking number one position for the first time is the Availability of Suitably Qualified Employees ... A much tighter labour market for skilled workers has seen this constraint rise from fifth highest just a year ago to second position in January and April, then finally to first in the current quarter. The first issue for business, the biggest concern for ACCI members, was the growing shortage of skills. The Senate Employment, Workplace Relations and Education References Committee has also found that Australia does not have enough skilled metal engineering and manufacturing workers to carry out the $20 billion worth of major infrastructure and resource projects expected in the next 10 years. Industry groups and a Senate committee have recognised a serious risk to economic performance and productivity resulting from this government’s lack of action over the last eight years. Unlike this government, we took a policy to the last election to boost Australian skill levels and address shortages in a much more substantial way. Our strategy to build the skill levels of the Australian work force included the following: an additional 36,600 real growth placesthat is over and above the money being provided in this bill-including 20,000 new TAFE places, and a commitment, which I think was very important, to pay the TAFE fees of seconMAIN COMMITTEE dary school students. There was not a limit on the number of young people who could go to technical colleges. We were saying that all secondary school students who wanted to gain vocational qualifications while they were still at school would have their TAFE fees paid by a federal Labor government. Our strategy also included 6,600 skill-up apprenticeships through group training in regions of high unemployment or skill shortage; a significant increase in funding for group training organisations to support small and medium enterprises and to create up to 8,000 additional apprenticeships; more opportunities for mature age Australians to update their skills; a training bonus for aged care and child-care trainees who complete their training; and national protocols to make sure that TAFE fees and charges are affordable. The government complain about these TAFE fees, but they do not do anything about it. I do not know what they think they are in government for. They are not there to have a whinge; they are actually there to fix problems. Our policy also included a quality training agreement with state and territory governments to address current and emerging skill shortages and to make sure all apprentices and trainees receive quality training. These initiatives built on Labor’s commitment to create 20,000 additional university places every year, including in nursing, teacher education and medicine. It also augmented a terrific program we wanted to put in place, called Bright Futures. This was a school based program to help schools raise the awareness of post secondary work and study options, including the benefits of a career in traditional trades. These initiatives form a comprehensive strategy to tackle the skills crisis and boost Australia’s skills level. Compare that to what we are debating here today: a bill that has no growth at all to address this serious skills shortage that we face right now-a shortage that has been described as endemic by the Australian Industry Group, a shortage that is not in any way, most unfortunately, addressed by the bill. Of course we want to see this money flow, but I say to the government: you need much more than this if we are going to address the very serious skills crisis that this government faces. of the Vocational Education and Training Funding Amendment Bill 2004 and bring to the attention of members the important role of vocational education and training in assisting young people to reach their full potential and to find their own place in the world of work. This government has actually made significant progress, despite the words we have just heard, in developing vocational education pathways for the 70 per cent of young people who do not go directly from school to university. Currently, 95 per cent of secondary schools across Australia offer vocational education and training programs. Certainly in my electorate of Bass in Northern Tasmania there is a level of involvement to varying degrees in every secondary school and college. I take this opportunity today to congratulate the teachers and principals in these schools who have had the foresight and the professionalism to introduce these programs into the curriculum. I especially commend them where they have used VET courses as a way of re-engaging difficult or at-risk students who stand to genuinely benefit from this extra option while at school. There has been significant growth in the numbers undertaking VET in schools from around 60,000 in 1996 when the Howard government came to office to almost 203,000 today. That is rather a different picture to the one just painted for us by the Deputy Leader of the OpposiMAIN COMMITTEE",108,Vocational Education And Training Funding Amendment Bill 2004
202,Mr Michael Ferguson (Bass) (4.55 P.m.),"TodayI wish to speak in strong supporttion. Nationally that represents 44 per cent of all senior secondary students. There has also been a large increase in the number of young people undertaking school based new apprenticeships. There are now 14,000 young people in school based apprenticeships compared to just 1,500 in 1998. This is nearly a tenfold increase. Will we as politicians ever be really able to understand the good this has done for our families and our young people? I am confident that for every student who takes up this option with the support of their family and their school there is a success story of a satisfied, fulfilled young person very happy to be doing something worthwhile and looking forward to a real career with a real job. These pathways provide young people with industry recognised qualifications and provide viable pathways for those young people who do not wish to go to university for whatever reasons they may have for not wanting a tertiary education. However, too often the message is sent to young Australians that a career in a trade is not as valued and not as valuable as a university qualification. This message has contributed to the growing skill shortage we are facing today and to the high drop-out rate of students in their first year of university. Australia’s university drop-out rate is among the highest in the developed world: 40 per cent of students who begin university study do not complete it. Government analysis shows that 100,000 of the 228,000 people who got a HECS place at university this year will not finish that course and 40,000 will have left before the end of the year and will never come back. How can this be happening? It is because so many of them are striving for university entry but have no particular long-term purpose in doing so except to gain a tertiary award. Perhaps they do not really know what they want to do with their lives; perhaps some have virtually had the decision made for them by their family, by their college or school or by their peers. But, for whatever reason it is happening, it stands to say that so many people are missing the opportunity to reach their potential and to attain personal fulfilment in their lives. WhatI will not dwell on today but would like to mention is that for those students who do drop out of university there is an enormous price to be paid: the accumulation of a HECS debt without reaching the goal that it contributes towards paying for; the social cost and embarrassment; and, more importantly, the months or years that are in many cases simply lost to that individual. Another price that we as a community pay is having a large number of young people who have been taught to feel that there is no prestige if they only want to leave school and get a trade, as if it were an inferior option to tertiary study. As a former schoolteacher of maths, science and IT at Kings Meadows High School, I impressed upon as many of my students as I could our school motto, ‘We have our part to play.’ We have all heard how the abolition of technical colleges by the states has meant that over the past few decades many young people have lacked clear training and skills pathways, particularly the 70 per cent of those who choose to not go directly from school to university. Unlike the previous speaker, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, I am excited about the Howard government’s pledge to invest $289 million over four years to establish 24 Australian technical colleges. These will promote pride and excellence in the teaching and acquiring of skills at the secondary school level. These colleges, one of which is to be based in my own region of Northern Tasmania, will be open to talented year 11 and 12 students interested in gaining a trade, but while also being able to complete their secondary schooling. I am saddened, however, by Labor’s negative, rhetorical approach to this important initiative. Repeatedly in the House of Representatives question time since the opening of the parliament, quesMAIN COMMITTEE tions from members of the Labor Party on the subject of Australian technical colleges have uniformly described them as ‘overdue and insufficient’. We have just heard the Deputy Leader of the Opposition say also that the Australian technical colleges will make barely a dent in the skills shortages in Australia. What a sad comment. The fact is that these select high-achievement colleges will provide tuition for up to 7,200 young people in years 11 and 12 every year. They will be implemented from 2006, within virtually one year from now-not the mystical four-year figure which is being used. Students at the colleges will be able to undertake academic, information technology and business courses. They will graduate from the colleges with trade, entrepreneurial and business skills, with the capacity to be self-employed in the future or to go on to further education and training. All students would have the opportunity to take up a school based new apprenticeship. Colleges will be endorsed and led by industry. They will be run autonomously by principals, who will be able to engage teaching staff on a performance pay basis. Interestingly, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition referred fairly frequently to the Australian Industry Group. In a press release on 24 November, Ms Macklin stated that the government’s Australian technical colleges were not a solution to skills shortages and that the government should address this issue immediately. However, this was not a view shared by industry. On the same day, a press release issued by the Australian Industry Group expressed strong support for the initiative and applauded the government’s leadership in addressing the skills shortages issue. To me, these words from members of the Labor Party are a disgrace. If they secretly thought that the colleges were a good idea, good public policy and good for addressing the issues that we are all concerned about, then they could at least have kept quiet about it and let the bill go through. They could even have publicly supported it, reversing their predictable opposition from the time the policy was launched during the election campaign. But these new Australian technical colleges need to be supported, they need to be championed, and Labor ought to spell out right now what they would do when the Australian technical colleges are progressively opened from 2005. Will they support them then? They need also to say what they would do to them if they won office after the next election. Would they mothball them? Would they still describe them as insufficient? Or was it a Freudian slip for them to describe them as ‘overdue’ and they do actually believe that they may have some merit? Also, during question time today I heard the answers to the questions asked by the Labor members that I have referred to. I listened to Minister Hardgrave’s answers when on each occasion Labor members were interjecting with calls such as, ‘You have had eight years to fix this,’ or, ‘You have done nothing for eight years,’ and other claims that somehow the government had been asleep at the wheel. This is breathtaking hypocrisy. Are the Labor members claiming that the government has missed its opportunity to address a skills shortage that existed in 1996 after they had left office after 13 years in government? No, I do not think they are saying that. The fact is that Australia is, in a way, a victim of its own success. Strong economic management, responsible decisions, not being beholden to unions, effective employment programs, industrial relations reforms and welfare reforms have rescued Australia. Today we have a strong and growing economy, consistent budget surpluses, lower income tax rates, MAIN COMMITTEE evaporating government debt from the $96 billion debt left to us by Labor, more people in work, higher participation and an unemployment rate that is virtually half what it once was. The growing economy has caused the higher demand for skills. The demand for skills has employed more people, which means that the pool of people left to take up new skills and provide them has been reduced. In short, under Labor we had people looking for jobs; under the Howard government we have jobs looking for people. This is, with due respect to the seriousness of the challenge, a good problem to have. Also during the previous speech we heard of unmet demand in Australia. In fact, as the previous speaker correctly identified, today we have unmet demand in TAFE colleges in Australia at around the 40,000 level. I think it is important for me to remind members that, on the government’s coming to office, that figure was 89,000, so there has been quite a dramatic turnaround since that time. It also has to be said that the government, with the leadership shown in the past and even today from the Minister for Education, Science and Training, have turned a spotlight on the issues and we are actively doing something about them. In contrast, Labor have sat on their hands. The Minister for Education, Science and Training reported on Labor’s sudden interest as recently as August this year, prior to the recent election. He said in the chamber on 11 August: In the almost three years I have had the privilege to be this country’s Minister for Education, Science and Training, I have had 59 questions in question time. Fifty-four of those questions have been about universities, and five have been about training-and in those five questions the word ‘apprenticeship’ appeared once, as an afterthought. In relation to funding for TAFE colleges through the ANTA agreement, I say this: if Labor were serious about TAFE, then during the failed ANTA agreement negotiations earlier this year and even prior to that, when the federal government offered ongoing increases of 2½ per cent on the condition that states would increase their own funding to their own colleges by just 1½ per cent, they should have picked up the phone and told their Labor colleagues in the various states and territories to sign on the dotted line. This government has also taken steps to strengthen careers advice. Earlier this year the Minister for Education, Science and Training announced two initiatives to address this issue. One was a professional development package for careers advisers, including a best practice resource for all careers teachers in secondary schools, an accredited online course to enhance the skills of career and transition advisers, and an elective course in career education to be offered as part of Bachelor of Education degrees. Another initiative was the Career Education Lighthouse Schools Project, which aims to support the leaders in career education programs in schools and promote best practice models to other schools. These measures will assist students to navigate their way through their career options, make the most of their vocational learning experiences and make a smooth transition from school to work. Raising the profile of the benefits of VET in Schools pathways is also of major importance. The challenge is to ensure that both students and their parents recognise the value of VET qualifications and the pathways they can offer. To acknowledge the achievements of those students who have chosen VET in Schools pathways, a national student prize for VET in Schools students and school based New Apprenticeships students, consisting of a cash prize of $2,000, will be awarded to 450 VET in Schools students and 50 school based New Apprenticeships students each year across Australia. This initiative will support students MAIN COMMITTEE in exploring a variety of options when they are making crucial choices about their futures. The national student prize will also encourage parents to talk to their children about the importance of VET in Schools programs and the career opportunities that are available to them in a broad range of industries. This bill will provide further funding for the development of strategic initiatives to expand the range of VET in Schools programs and enhance transitions to employment and further education for students. In reply to the previous speaker I only have one further comment, and that is in relation to the description of this bill as somehow being a reduction in money to the states and territories. This plainly ignores or disregards the fact that during the breakdown in negotiations toward the next ANTA agreement, where the states declined the offer of increased funding because presumably they did not wish to dip into their own coffers, the government’s response was to take the additional money which was being pledged and to simply tender it out to the local community. That tender process created 7,500 places around the country. In conclusion, the Howard government’s commitment to vocational education and training is strong. It is illustrated by the significant funding provided through this bill and the new initiatives announced this year, particularly in addressing skills shortages. Since 1996 the coalition government has reinvigorated vocational education and training with record numbers in training, record numbers in new apprenticeships and significant progress toward developing a high-quality, truly national system. Today, 12 per cent of Australia’s working age population is in VET training. This year the Australian government will spend a record $2.1 billion on vocational education and training, which will underpin this nation’s strong economic growth and low unemployment. We have also announced new measures in our election commitments to a total of $1.06 billion over four years. This is one of the most significant boosts to vocational education and training ever undertaken by any government. This bill will provide the Australian government funding required to support Australia’s world-class vocational education and training system in 2005, and I commend it to the House. Dr EMERSON (Rankin) (5.12 p.m.)-Government contributors to this debate on the Vocational Education and Training Funding Amendment Bill 2004 have been saying at the same time that the skills shortage confronting Australia is a great problem to have and that they have taken all of these measures to avert a skills shortage in Australia. The truth is that the government cannot have it both ways. The fact of the matter is that there is an acute skills shortage in this country and it is not a great problem to have. It is a serious problem for our economic prospects both in the short term and, just as importantly, in the longer term. I want to outline the dimensions of the skills shortage in Australia. The Australian Industry Group has found that in the manufacturing sector there are between 18,000 and 21,000 unfilled vacancies for tradespeople. I do not think that is a great problem to have. Further, the Australian Industry Group has identified that numbers of traditional apprenticeships have remained pretty much unchanged since 1996, when the Howard government took office. So when this government talks about apprenticeships it does not talk about traditional apprenticeships as the people of Australia know them but of some variation or cheap inversion of apprenticeships. Traditional apprenticeships have not grown under the Howard government. Indeed, according to the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations skilled vacancy index, vacanMAIN COMMITTEE cies for skilled tradespeople have increased by an astonishing 54 per cent over the last three years. According to the Australian Industry Group, right now Australia has a shortage of around 20,000 skilled workers in sectors like carpentry, construction, manufacturing and mining. The Australian Industry Group says that over the next five years 175,000 people are expected to leave the traditional trades but only 70,000 will enter. That means a skills shortage in the traditional trades of more than 100,000 workers. That is not a great problem to have. Instead of wasting millions of dollars duplicating the Australian TAFE system and limiting new training to just a few, the Howard government should fund our TAFEs properly and invest in more genuine apprenticeships in areas of skills shortage. The government refused to fund any new TAFE places between 1997 and 2001. The same government provided only one-third of the funding states and territories needed between 2001 and 2003. This bill will reduce the level of funds for vocational education that are provided to the Australian National Training Authority for distribution to the states and territories in 2004. The funding will fall from $1.36 billion to $1.31 billion. What is the government’s response to the skill shortage? It is to cut funding to the Australian National Training Authority in 2004. Indeed, looking at the history of this government, in its first two budgets it slashed $240 million out of vocational education and training. Then it followed up with the 1998-2000 ANTA agreement that abolished growth funding altogether and froze funding to the sector for at least three years. Here is a looming skills shortage, which started emerging in the mid-1990s. The first response of the Howard government to that skills shortage was to take $240 million out of vocational education and training and then follow it up by freezing funding, no growth funding, in the subsequent years. Those funding cuts and a subsequent freeze meant more and more of the TAFE colleges closed their training facilities, putting teachers and students under a lot of pressure. To cap it all off, the government has announced that it will close down the Australian National Training Authority. That was a vehicle to work collaboratively with the states, and the Howard government has obviously made a judgment that it does not want to work collaboratively with the states in addressing the acute skill shortages that have built up while the government has taken action to cut funding for vocational education and training and then to freeze it. I foreshadowed this sort of response in the great GST debate when we talked about the Prime Minister’s great tax adventure and the Treasurer’s streamlined new tax system for a new century. It was clear that the government was going to allow specific purpose payments to the states to erode over time. On the day that the GST was introduced, the government abolished $18 billion in untied grants. It was plain to see that the government would allow the tied grants-which were of a similar order of magnitude-used for such purposes as vocational education and training to erode, contravening the spirit of the memorandum of understanding that was signed by the Treasurer, Prime Minister and state premiers. I remember well the Treasurer saying, ‘We have this memorandum of understanding and it will guarantee no cuts to the specific purpose payments.’ The way to reduce the value of specific purpose payments is not to adjust them for cost increases and general inflation and allow them to erode with population growth instead of providing the same per capita amount. Those two mechanisms were available to the government. Like a big, black, hungry dog, the government got in there and made sure that those two mechanisms were used effectively to erode the specific purpose payments to the states. Here, MAIN COMMITTEE today, we have evidence of that, and only a few years after the government said: ‘Trust us. We have signed a memorandum of understanding with the states. We won’t do it.’ Well, they did. We knew they would. We knew they would do it in health. We knew they would do it in education. And this bill today shows that is exactly what they have done. Government members are saying that a skill shortage is a great problem to have. I need to relay the story of Australian productivity growth, because today’s productivity growth is tomorrow’s prosperity. Labor recognised that when it was last in government and set out a major, comprehensive economic reform program designed to lift productivity growth in this country. Labor knew that the yield from those reforms would take some time, and, indeed it did. But Labor was patient, Labor was determined and Labor had a coherent program of economic reforms designed to lift productivity growth. When those reforms were implemented, by the early 1990s productivity growth in Australia did indeed begin to respond. From 1993 right through to the current day, Australian productivity growth has been faster than almost every country in the world-faster than most countries in the world, with the exception of Finland and Ireland. So those economic reforms did work. Labor created the open, competitive economy. Labor opened the door to competition, both from abroad and from here in Australia, and it lifted productivity growth. When you see the Treasurer crowing about strong economic growth in this country, he is in fact crowing about the returns, the dividends, the yield from that economic reform program instituted by the Hawke and Keating governments. However, having opened the door once to create the open, competitive economy, you cannot open the same door twice. You can keep it open and you can push it a little bit further where possible. That is why the Productivity Commission recently released a report advocating further reforms in competition policy and an improvement in the efficiency of various industries and infrastructure provision in this country. But the Productivity Commission knows that the main game-the opening of the economy-has already occurred. We now come to the point in 2002 when the Intergenerational Report was released. The Intergenerational Report contains very worrying forecasts. The Intergenerational Report forecasts that Australian productivity growth from next year, 2005, will slip back to our 30year mediocre long-term average-that is, down from 2.05 per cent during the late 1990s to 1.75 per cent for the coming decades. That 1.75 per cent productivity growth is a serious problem for Australia because we are confronted with the ageing of the population and it will be productivity growth almost exclusively that Australia will need to use to combat the ageing of the population. The ageing of the population is a fact. The die is cast. To invoke the phrase used by the Treasurer: ‘demography is destiny’. The ageing of the population is a result of decisions made by parents over the last 40 years that will affect the age profile of the Australian population over the next 40 years. So the die is cast. We cannot prevent the ageing of the population. Fertility continues to decline and it is forecast to decline further to 1.65 per cent over the 40-year projection period. That forecast is contained in the Intergenerational Report. So, if the die is cast on the ageing of the population, we need to rely on strong productivity growth to combat the effects of the ageing population on Australian prosperity. We may ask: what are the forecasts for per capita GDP growth, which is the best available measure of the growth in living standards in Australia? The forecasts contained in the Intergenerational ReMAIN COMMITTEE port are for a slump in Australia’s per capita GDP growth from 2010 onwards that would constitute the slowest rate of growth in that measure of living standards since the decade of the Great Depression. Everyone in this room and this parliament should be alarmed at those forecasts and should be doing everything possible to prevent those forecasts from becoming a reality-and we can. If we were able to maintain the productivity growth of the late 1990s that has been going on through to the early 2000s then we could successfully deal with the ageing of the population. Yet it requires us to identify the new sources of productivity growth because, if we have opened the door to competition, if we have created an open, competitive economy and we cannot open that door a second time, we must identify the new sources of productivity growth. The international evidence on this matter is stark. It is clear: the strongest, most powerful, most potent source of productivity growth in the Western world is skills formation. That brings us back to this legislation, because at a time when we should be investing in skills the Howard government is disinvesting. It is running down our skills base. It is divesting in skills in this country at exactly the wrong time. time. These are not just statements from a Labor Party politician; they are statements from people who have analysed these matters. I will cite some of those. The OECD, in a major international study in 2003, identified skills generation, skills formation, as the most important source of productivity growth in the 20th century, followed by investment in innovation and, thirdly, by investment in infrastructure and, of course, keeping the economy open and trading with other countries. So what is the Australian experience with skills formation, of which this legislation is a reflection? It is a very sorry experience indeed. I will quote from the Productivity Commission. This is a damning indictment on the Howard government, because the Productivity Commission said: ... the weight of evidence suggests there was a slower rate of accumulation of human capital in the Australian workforce in the 1990s, which all else equal would have detracted from a productivity acceleration in the 1990s. In other words, that strong productivity growth that was achieved out of the economic reform programs of the Hawke and Keating years was weakened by a detraction caused by a slowdown in skills formation. Similarly, the Productivity Commission said: ... there appears to have been no significant acceleration in workforce skills in the 1990s. In fact, the evidence shows a faster increase in skills in the 1980swhen Labor was in power. These conclusions are confirmed by the OECD’s empirical work, which indicates that skill upgrading made no contribution to Australian productivity growth between 1990 and 2000. Drawing together the work of the OECD and the Productivity Commission, Saul Eslake asked this question: ... why has education apparently not made any discernible contribution to the improvement in Australia’s economic performance over the past decade? The answer, unfortunately, seems to be that there has MAIN COMMITTEE",113,Vocational Education And Training Funding Amendment Bill 2004

204,Dr Emerson,"Not enough bricklayers, not enough tradespeople, at exactly the wrongnot been any discernible improvement in Australia’s educational outcomes-at least insofar as they impact on productivity growth-during this period. Saul Eslake is the Chief Economist for the ANZ Bank. He is no lackey of the Australian Labor Party and that is the conclusion that he has drawn. Steve Dowrick at the ANU has had a very extensive career in looking at skills formation as a source of productivity growth in Australia and overseas-a lot of empirical work-and his conclusion is this: These international comparisons suggest that Australia’s educational report card should be marked: ‘Started well, but slackened off. Substantial room for improvement.’ What an indictment on the Howard government. What an indictment that we have legislation here today that involves the abolition of the Australian National Training Authority and the continuation of completely inadequate funding for skills in this country. Skills formation is a big problem now and investing in skills is the best investment that we can imagine in this country, and yet we have a piece of legislation that abolishes the Australian National Training Authority and pursues the Howard government’s ideological agenda of bypassing the states. The government has announced that it will set up its own technical colleges that will not be completed for another four years. So this is the government’s urgent response to the urgent problem of skills shortages in this country: to announce an initiative in the election that will produce no discernible improvement in skills in this country for another four years, and yet the government has the temerity to say that this is a great problem to have-it is boasting that this is the problem that it has. Well, it is not a problem for the Howard government; it is a problem for Australia. Unless we turn around this government’s attitude towards skills formation in Australia the Productivity Commission’s work, the Intergenerational Report forecasts, will all come true-that is, from the end of this decade, in this country, we will have the slowest rate of growth per person since the decade of the Great Depression. You would think it probably could not get much worse than that, but it does, because the forecasts for the subsequent decade, the 2020s, are for an even slower rate of growth. If we are to combat the ageing of the population, we must invest in skills in this country now. This legislation fails to do that. It abolishes the Australian National Training Authority, it pursues the government’s ideological agenda-the government is not interested in cooperating with the states-and it realises the government’s intentions back in the year 2000, when it signed a sham memorandum of understanding with the states, saying that it would maintain specific purpose payments to the states in all areas. It has done nothing of the sort, and it has betrayed the future of this country and of all young people who live in this country, young people who yearn for a decent opportunity in life and for the skills to enable them to develop their talents and contribute to this great country. This is one of the most shameful pieces of legislation that have ever been brought into this parliament. It is one of the first pieces of legislation brought into the parliament in the new term of the Howard government. It shows how miserable and mean it is when it comes to investing in the nation’s future, when it comes to investing in the talents of our young people, and the government should be condemned for it.

205,Mr Wakelin (Grey) (5.31 P.m.),"The Vocational Education and Training Fundingrow because of the terrible way the government are running the country. The opposition cannot escape the fact that apprenticeship numbers in this country have nearly tripled in the time that we have been in control of the Treasury benches. I think it is really important to note the whole change in culture that our government have been working towards over many years. When you add a progressive policy approach and the desire to establish 24 Australian technical colleges, as well as the belief that skills other than those attained in the universities of this country are of equal value to them, then you get an idea of the direction of this government and its commitment to the working people of this country. It is a particular pleasure for me to rise to contribute to this debate today. As someone who has not had the opportunity to participate in an apprenticeship scheme, university or even years 11 and 12, and as someone who comes from rural and regional Australia, there is nothing more important to my mind than seeing this sort of legislation in the parliament and people having the opportunity to remind anyone who cares to listen, but particularly the young people of Australia, that what they do with their young lives in terms of developing skills is of equal value to what others do, whether they be doctors of medicine, doctors of philosophy, schoolteachers, nurses or whatever. It is so important that we get in this country an equal opportunity for every Australian, and this is what this legislation is about. I will say a few words about the 24 Australian technical colleges, the Australian network of industry career advisers and of course the financial assistance for Commonwealth trade learning scholarships, toolkits and residential support for new apprenticeships. Coming from an electorate that is 1,000 kilometres by 1,000 kilometres-just under one million square kilometres-I can say that residential support for new apprenticeships is a very significant step forward, with the youth allowance being offered in a way that is only being offered to a particular sector of the community. I also remind the Main Committee that not only have we seen almost a trebling in the number of apprentices in this country over the last eight or nine years but we have seen a very significant reduction in unemployment. And now this whole debate about the shortage of skills right across industry and right across the economy demonstrates clearly the strength of our economy. This is a government that not only supports every Australian and encourages every Australian but puts into place policies within an economy strong enough to deliver on those aspirations which are so vital to every Australian, particularly every young Australian. While I am thinking about young Australians it is very timely, particularly with the issues on Palm Island, for me to talk about young Aboriginal Australians. As the Chairman of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs in the 41st Parliament, can I say that there is no more important issue than offering young Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people the opportunity to be employed. This sort of legislation, in cooperation with the states and territories-they are vital-is absolutely essential to the future of Aboriginal people. Unless we can offer the hope, the self-esteem and the opportunity for young Aboriginal people to develop the skills to work in their communities and to have a productive life, we will only continue the tragedies that Palm Island has witnessed over these last few days. I am always delighted to speak on this sort of legislation, this sort of acknowledgment of the value of every Australian, particularly those Australians who are not necessarily academically inclined. The opportunities for regional, rural and remote young people in particular, in MAIN COMMITTEE the tertiary sector, in the university sector and even in the TAFE sector, are very limited when we look at the opportunities in our urban centres. This bill, supported by the policy announcements from the last election, has given us the hope of and supported the aspiration of young people to a very positive future. There is more to be done, because if you live 1,000 kilometres away from a centre of learning, whether it is a TAFE, a university or any other institution which enhances education, then you are behind the eight ball. And then, if you have financial circumstances that, compared to those of most other Australians, add a bill of $5,000 or $10,000 per annum in order to have that opportunity, it is something which I have to describe as still being work in progress. With great pleasure I support the bill and wish it every success. The measure of this bill will be particularly in the years ahead, as we see the vision that this government has given and will continue to give this country through its leadership, offering young people great opportunities to develop their skills. Ms GEORGE (Throsby) (5.38 p.m.)-I rise to speak on the Vocational Education and Training Funding Amendment Bill 2004 because it provides another opportunity for me as the member for Throsby to put on the public record my congratulations regarding the wonderful efforts of the staff and the directors of the Illawarra Institute of TAFE for our region. While located in Wollongong, of course, the institute has campuses in many outlying areas. The vocational education and TAFE system is a remarkable system, publicly funded and publicly accessible, that provides a wide range of educational opportunities. I visit the TAFE colleges quite regularly and talk to the teachers about some of the issues that they face as workers in the system. I also appreciate the very important role that the TAFE system plays in advancing the economic issues and dealing with the imperatives that face our regional economy. It is a wonderful system because it provides opportunities for the young and not-soyoung, giving a lot of adults in particular a second chance and a second go. Its courses range from traditional trade training through to basic literacy and numeracy. In our area, particularly important are the programs for newly arrived immigrants and refugees in basic English language. It is also a system that is critical for Australia’s future economic success. In that regard I have to express my profound disappointment that the bill before us in fact reduces and limits the funding that is available this year to that very important system. It is amazing that, at a time when we all acknowledge the importance of productivity and economic growth-and investment in human capital is going to be a really important marker for the next spurt of productivity improvements that will sustain our competitiveness-we find this government actually reducing the level of funds available for this system. As the brief indicates, the funding will fall from $1.36 billion to $1.31 billion, largely as a result of the incapacity of the federal government to reach agreement with the states in the last round of ANTA negotiations. When you look back at the record of the Howard government it is quite an appalling record for this important sector of our education and training system. The first two budgets, of course, saw cuts to the system, followed by a freeze in funds at a time when growth in demand was outstripping available places. For years the TAFE directors unanimously have been arguing the case that the government has a responsibility to provide extra funding to meet the unmet demand if we are going to meet the challenges that we all know are important for our nation. The government walked away from trying to finalise an MAIN COMMITTEE agreement. I was not surprised when the states maintained a firm position of rejection of the offer that was made by the federal government through the minister. The government has really failed the challenge of seeing the critical role of this sector and funding it in a way that provides continuing opportunities for all Australians, particularly young people, those who want to continue the route of trade training and those who see TAFE as a system for providing upskilling of workers already at work. All of this is going to impact severely-and is impacting severely-on Australian businesses; and not just on businesses but also on the students, many of whom are rejected year after year even though they have the capacity to successfully undertake courses. With that freeze in funding and the limit on growth funding, enormous pressure has been placed on the extremely dedicated staff who I know work at the local institutions and those who I daresay work in other areas. I think we all understand the imperatives that warrant a much better resourced system than is there at the moment. I guess that, when you just look at the statistics, you do not see things as clearly as you do when you are actually dealing with the outcomes of a system that is inadequately funded and resourced. I want to talk a little bit about the impact that the government’s complacent attitude is having on the regional economy of the Illawarra and the huge crisis we are facing, with youth unemployment levels hovering around 30 per cent at a time when we have a crisis in terms of skill shortages in the area. I would have thought that, if anything, the fact that business is screaming about the problems in attracting skilled labour would have been sounding alarm bells for this government, but it seems not to be the case. We have had at best a very pathetic response. The only tangible response has been the proposal to create 24 additional TAFE colleges, which will not be up and running for a few years at a time when industry is crying out for skilled labour now. What a waste of taxpayer funds, to put that money into creating an alternative system-alternative structures, alternative bureaucracies, alternative collegeswhen that money could be so easily and readily absorbed by the existing TAFE institutions! There is no rationale or justification for expending taxpayer funds in establishing a duplicate TAFE college system. Regrettably, the Howard government has not heeded the warnings that have been given for some time now by industry, by the union movement, by the TAFE system and by the TAFE directors. There was a recent Senate inquiry which obviously the government has taken no notice of. One wonders why enormous amounts of time, energy and resources are put into producing well-researched documents with comprehensive recommendations when they only sit on a shelf and are ignored. The report of that Senate inquiry, entitled Bridging the skills divide, outlined the seriousness of the situation facing Australia. I think we would be very foolish if we did not recognise that the current and projected skill shortages are going to threaten Australia’s future economic capacity and development. You do not have to take my word for that. The Australian Industry Group made it very clear in its submission to the Senate inquiry that over half of the businesses it surveyed face skill shortages. And ACCI, one of the other peak organisations, said to the inquiry that ‘Australian firms are greatly concerned at their incapacity to recruit employees with appropriate levels of skills and retain skilled employees, with such pressures being particularly acute in regional and rural Australia’. Recent research conducted by the ACTU estimates that the growing shortage of skilled workers, particularly in the traditional trades, will cost the Australian economy up to $9 bilMAIN COMMITTEE lion in lost output over the next decade. That body of research also estimated that, on current intakes and projections, over the next five years up to 170,000 tradespeople will leave industry and only 40,000 will be entering. With an ageing population-and we hear a lot about the ageing of the population, but it applies equally to the traditional trades areas-we are not training enough young people to replace the looming shortages that are going to emerge in those traditional areas. Again, if you do not believe me, have a look at the government’s own figures, which show that the job vacancies in the traditional trades are now at their highest level for 15 years. In fact, the recent departmental skilled vacancies index, which looks at the vacancies for skilled tradespeople, showed a 54 per cent jump in vacancies, rising from 97.1 per cent in November 2001 to 149.4 per cent in November 2004. This has all been happening while the Howard government has been in power-when it has been asleep on its watch. This skills shortage that everyone had been referring to for years continues unabated with no constructive solutions to redress the critical situation. As I said earlier, the government’s belated-and, at best, only half-hearted-publicly indefensible policy response was its proposal to establish 24 new colleges. From what I understand, they will not start operating until 2006 and will not be fully operational for some years after that. Even then, these new colleges will provide training to fewer than two per cent of year 11 and 12 students. An estimated 7½ thousand students in years 11 and 12 might get the option of undertaking a course at the colleges. You have to ask the question: is that the best means of expending taxpayers’ funds to address a crisis that exists now? It is not a crisis that will be there in four years time; it is a crisis that is there now. While attracting young people into trade training and apprenticeships is important, it is really a drop in the ocean in terms of the magnitude of the problem. As I said, it does nothing to help the crisis now. The Australian Industry Group, the AiG, in their document looking at regional indicators which was released recently, said that the crisis is ‘endemic’, with an estimated 20,000 job vacancies in manufacturing alone. I would argue that the money set aside for the creation of these new colleges should be redirected immediately to create and open up new TAFE places, to do what we are attempting to do in the Illawarra in our apprenticeship pilot, which extends into the member for Gilmore’s area too. We have been able, with small incentives, to create in the space of eight months 60 additional apprenticeship opportunities for young people who would have missed out otherwise. The government should assist local organisations who are grappling with their own regional solutions to the particular nature of the skills crisis that confronts them. The government needs to move away from the top-down approach and have faith in communities to come up with solutions that best fit their particular needs. In my view, what would best meet the needs of employers, students and families in our area would be to redirect that money immediately into a well-functioning system that has provided lots of opportunities in the past and can do even better with additional resources and funding. I think the government has also failed to develop a strategy for, and have a clear understanding of, the impact of skills shortages at a regional level. It is fair to say that you can access data on national and state trends, and the department does that adequately, but when you try and go beyond those global statistics to look at the impact at a regional level it is sadly wanting. The government needs to develop a clearer picture of the impact of the skills shortages at a regional level in order to assist businesses in trying to develop a coordinated solution MAIN COMMITTEE to address the problem. There is no magic bullet and there is not one solution that in itself is going to solve the crisis. What we have done in the Illawarra is to rely on limited data that has been collected by a range of organisations. I mention that AiG Illawarra did a survey based on 44 local companies. Of those 44 companies-a limited survey-91 per cent said they were experiencing skills shortages. Based on that, current and projected skills needs were 740 positions just in that very small and limited sample. So that gives you some indication of the real crisis and the constraint on economic development that is staring our region in the face. Regional trends may be quite different for a variety of reasons-sometimes for historic, geographic and cultural reasons. For example, in the Illawarra our close proximity to a booming Sydney labour market in more recent times has had a significant impact on the ability of local firms to attract suitable applicants. In 2001, according to the census data, 17 per cent of employed people in the Illawarra region commuted outside our region for work. That had grown from only three per cent in 1981. WhatI am trying to say is that regional skills shortage problems have a variety of underlying causes and a multifaceted strategy is needed to address this situation. The problem that we have locally is not just that we do not have enough skilled workers as a result of a general shortage of skills but also that we have an inability to recruit skills that are required locally because the labour market is competitive and often more attractive wages and conditions take labour out of the region. Through the creation of a local task force in the Illawarra, we are attempting to look at the areas of current and future skills shortages and trying to tackle those through a variety of responses. I urge the federal government to be sympathetic to any applications that come from our region for assistance in conducting a proper analysis and audit so that we can base our responses on the actual problems that we identify locally. Currently, our work is being assisted by the efforts of the Illawarra Regional Information Service and some of the work that it is undertaking for the regional development board. But what seems quite clear in our area is that the shortages are evident not just in the traditional blue-collar trades but also in a number of white-collar employment areas as well. The overall picture in the Illawarra is that most skilled labour is now in short supply relative to demand. I will list the occupations with the most critical shortages to give you feel of the problems that are emerging: aged care nurses and carers, boilermakers, chefs, electricians, engineers, fitters and turners and truck drivers. So it is not just in the traditional trade areas, where it is so obvious at the national level, that the acute crisis is emerging but also across a range of very important occupations that service community needs. In the time that I have left I want to say that, disappointingly, the Vocational Education and Training Funding Amendment Bill 2004 does nothing to instil any confidence in me that the government is on top of this crisis which is going to impact on economic performance and productivity. Failure to invest in the development of human capital and skill development is going to be a major constraint on future economic growth. Twenty-four new TAFE colleges to duplicate existing TAFE courses will not address the problem in any meaningful long-term sense. The severe skills shortage that a number of people have addressed in their contributions in this debate has developed while the government has been asleep on its watch. It can blame no-one but itself. I think the bill before us this evening confirms that the government has no coherent strategy or coherent plan to tackle the crisis at the national level and to assist regions MAIN COMMITTEE like mine that are now facing the constraint of skill shortages. Businesses are running up against that constraint, and the government has no solution to address that problem. My plea is for the government to support innovative solutions at a regional level and provide assistance and resources to local organisations, be they task forces, community groupings or the area consultative committees-whatever framework exists at the local level-to try and analyse and address what is and is going to be a critical problem. (Time expired) and Training Funding Amendment Bill 2004 for a number of reasons, first and foremost because it does go to the heart of a lot of the issues that I have been concerned about throughout my working life both in this place and prior to coming to the national capital. Secondly, I am pleased because it also affords me the opportunity to talk about the general issue of skills shortages. There has been a lot said over the last couple of months on the ageing of the population and the resulting crisis that may occur in our society at various levels, whether it be in health expenditure, the ageing of the work force or work force participation. Along with the member for Gorton-I have to keep reminding myself of that change-I sit on a House of Representatives parliamentary committee which at this very moment is looking at the issues of work force participation. Many of the issues that have been raised by the Productivity Commission, the Minister for Workforce Participation and even the Victorian state government in one of its submissions, which I will refer to, are issues that we are very much aware of. There is a skills gap and a need to entice more people into the work force. Nowhere is that more evident than in the traditional trades. This does give me a good opportunity to speak about some of those issues without going into the outcomes of our parliamentary committee, as it is still early days. But I will reflect on at least one or two points that have crystallised in my mind from some of the evidence that I have read. Vocational training was rightly a key election issue throughout Australia, arguably no more so than in my electorate of Deakin in Victoria. The blue-collar trades are of critical importance, I guess regardless of where one resides. There is always a substantial number of bluecollar trades, even though we may feel at times that it is in dramatic decline. As I travel throughout my electorate I am fortunate enough to witness enthusiastic tradespeople of all ages contributing to our economy and our society in an important and worthy way. The tradeand vocation-bashing days of the Hawke-Keating era are thankfully behind us. There is more and more talk about valuing a trade and the alternative career path that young people take to the one which was promoted vigorously during the eighties and nineties-namely, going on to university. As I said, the Productivity Commission draft report came down recently with a series of comments about the ageing work force. It did identify issues to do with the ageing work force. One of the things that have come out from some of the evidence that I have seen is the notion that by 2020 there will be 500,000 jobs in Australia with no-one to fill them. I do not make any judgment about where those jobs are, but because of the sheer size of that figure, and it being only about 15 years away, it certainly concerns me that we could very well have 500,000 jobs with no-one to fill them. It alarms me particularly if they are in areas where we are currently relying on older workers to fill jobs, such as in the trades. The Victorian government, in a report they brought out recently called Preparing for Victoria’s future: challenges and opportunities in an ageing population, say: MAIN COMMITTEE",121,Vocational Education And Training Funding Amendment Bill 2004
206,Mr Barresi (Deakin) (5.58 P.m.),"I am pleased to speak on the Vocational EducationWith fewer young people entering the labour force, it will be increasingly important that all young people gain the skills and training needed to participate in employment. In order to support future growth and the productivity of our labour force, education and training for young people will need to focus on the development of higher skill levels and the types of skills necessary to support new and emerging industries. That might very well be the case, but we also should not neglect the traditional industries out there that are crying out for people to go into them-that is, the trade areas. While I welcome that kind of statement from the Victorian government, I also note that one of the other comments they came up with in their report is about apprenticeships for the group of people aged 25 years or over. The report says: In the five years to 2003 commencements of New Apprentices for people aged 25 years and over grew from 9 700 to 52 000, an increase of 435 per cent. Over half ... of commencing Victorian New Apprentices in 2003 were aged 25 or over. There is an argument there to encourage people to go into apprenticeships at a more mature age rather than simply at school age levels. The Herald Sun also commented earlier this year that in Victoria there are hundreds of apprenticeships that are not being filled by school leavers. Training organisations blame this on a bias towards universities and low pay for apprentices. The school curriculum is targeted towards higher education. We have all known this for many years. I am pleased to see that there is a change of attitude taking place in the community and also at the legislative level. The growth of vocationally based employment since 1996, contrary to what the member for Throsby said, is an achievement of which this government can rightly be proud. The sector has been reinvigorated, and the number of people in New Apprenticeships has grown to almost 416,000. This number is three times that of 1995. Complementing this is a growth in vocational education and training. Minister Nelson highlighted recently that the most recent figures showed there were close to 1.7 million students in VET in 2002. Significantly, this represents over 10 per cent of Australia’s working age population. So we have seen some considerable movement, and we have really only seen it because of the concentration on vocational education by this government. One of the most memorable experiences of the recent election campaign was visiting the Eastern Industry Education Partnership in Ringwood with Minister Nelson to discuss vocational education with local trainees. It was heartening to see young people-many dressed in their overalls-brimming with pride and enthusiasm that they actually got into the trade of their choice, that they actually had a job, that they were learning some skills. You could see the self-esteem that was emerging in these young people-a sense of self-worth and a belief that they were on a path to a fulfilling career. It is this growing willingness in young people that underpins this government’s commitment to developing vocational training opportunities. The key to future development in vocational education and training is to work directly with industry. The federal government provides $510 million in incentives each year to employers to provide opportunities to new apprentices. I am pleased that the most recent trend in funding through the National Skills Shortages Strategy is continuing. Central to this is the $2 million this year and the $4 million for each future year to tackle shortages in traditional trades such as those of carpenters, plumbers and electricians. At March 2004, 35 per cent of new apprentices-147,000 of them-were in training in the traditional trades. MAIN COMMITTEE I find it a little ironic that the federal Labor Party are now beginning to squib for some moral high ground on this issue. The fact remains clear that it was Labor policy that set Australia on the course towards a skills shortage. The member for Throsby stated outright that she believes it is a failure of this government. Skills shortages do not happen overnight. They build up over successive years, and in fact sometimes can take a generation to occur. What we see is very much the culmination of the fact that previous governments ignored the issue and placed the full emphasis on tertiary education for our young people. The fact remains clear that it was Labor policy that set Australia on the course towards a skills shortage. High unemployment created an initial shortage of places for blue-collar workers. It is fraudulent of the ALP to feign interest in vocational education. I am sure the members opposite remember how the Minister for Education, Science and Training would often entice the member for Jagajaga, the shadow minister in this area, to ask a question on vocational education. He would stand at the dispatch box and urge the member for Jagajaga: ‘Please ask me a question on vocational education.’ This happened throughout the last term. In fact, you could probably count on one hand the number of questions that the member for Jagajaga asked in this area in the three-year period. Now we have come into parliament this term and there is this new-found interest in vocational education and having a hit at the government. Of course, complicit in this fraudulent concern for vocational education are the state ALP governments. In December 2003 the state and territory Labor governments rejected the federal government’s $3.6 billion offer for a new ANTA agreement, a real increase of 2.5 per cent per annum. This represented the state governments walking away from 71,000 additional VET places over three years. They basically turned their backs on the agreement and in doing so turned their backs on 71,000 additional places. The decisions of the state and territory Labor governments highlight the deficiencies of the ANTA agreement. The federal government applied the additional funding offered through ANTA to purchase additional training places for priority groups such as older workers and disabled workers. However, the federal funding for vocational education and training should not need to be administered in such an ad hoc fashion and at the whim and the mercy of state governments who play politics with all Commonwealth funding, no matter what the policy area may be. Melbourne’s eastern suburbs area, irrespective of it being snubbed by the Latham election bandwagon and the Bracks Labor government, continues to be a desirable place for people to live. It remains a strong growth corridor where an increasing number of families require an appropriate mix of training opportunities. Prosperity, however, creates challenges and, rather than meeting these, the ANTA system has failed our local area. I would like to share with this House a real example of how the ANTA funding has failed the people in the electorate of Deakin in the eastern suburbs of Melbourne, particularly in terms of the deficiencies of ANTA’s funding distribution process. I would like to refer members to a very significant government school in my electorate, one which I am certainly proud of: the Ringwood Secondary College. It is a good government school with strong enrolments; it is a strong state government school with a proud history. In fact, it celebrated its 50th anniversary earlier this year, and I was pleased to take the Prime Minister to the school for its celebrations. The school and its principal, Mr Michael Phillips, MAIN COMMITTEE saw a valuable opportunity to establish an automotive and manufacturing skills centre to assist students throughout the eastern suburbs to obtain an accessible vocational education. Naturally the first step for the school was to apply for capital funding from ANTA. I was particularly confident-they had a great submission-that their proposal would be successful. Skills shortages were starting to bite in the region as more and more experienced tradesmen were leaving their fields. In fact, the local ACC, Jobs East, back in the early years when I first got elected, did a needs analysis on skills shortages in the area and showed that in the metals industry, the traditional trades, there was a huge gap in people taking up opportunities. The demand for the labour was greater than the supply. You would think that a proposal by a local school which would help fix the skills gap would be welcomed by ANTA. You would also think that the submission would be supported by the Bracks government, who after all do believe that they should be supporting the eastern suburbs, even though their actions do not prove that. The fact is the Ringwood Secondary College was unsuccessful. Not only did the school miss out; not one application for ANTA funding in the eastern suburbs was successful-not one from any of the schools in the entire eastern region, which of course makes up 40 per cent of Melbourne’s manufacturing base. In appraising what were wrong, it became blatantly clear that the ANTA funding allocation process was flawed. On closer inspection it was evident that successful applicants were located in traditional Labor heartland areas, particularly in Melbourne’s western suburbs. has put forward, that would provide funding for the Ringwood Secondary College to provide this excellent training that the member for Deakin asserts is necessary? dorothy dixer, and I will get to the point. Yes, not only is the skills centre funded by the federal government, but it is funded in collaboration with the employers the Eastern Industry Education Partnership Group, which looks after young kids in the school. The workshop will be located at the Ringwood Secondary College. The interesting thing is that they have now introduced one other skill, and that is robotics in the manufacturing technology. So you have automotive skills, manufacturing technology and robotics. You have an organisation like ANCA, which is a precision technology organisation; you have AAA, which is the largest manufacturer of airconditioners for the motor vehicle industry; and you have a number of other organisations all in partnership with Ringwood Secondary College. But it is not only for the benefit of that college. Because they will be providing the training for other government schools and, Member for Denison, independent schools in the area, it will include everyone. It is embracing employers, government and non-government schools and those who are charged with finding jobs for young people. SoI am very pleased that has taken place-and, of course, not with any help from the ANTA funding process or, can I say, from the Bracks government. The federal government does allocate its funding to the states and territories in accordance with a funding act.

211,Mr Barresi,"I will be very pleased to elaborate to the member for Denison on thatrangements for VET programs. The experience of Ringwood Secondary College demonstrates that the organisation is flawed. In particular, ANTA is a hindrance to effective planning for future vocational programs. The partisan agenda of the Victorian Bracks Labor government ignored future trade workers in and around my electorate. Significantly, the sad bevy of local state Labor members, many of whom of course were not expecting to be in parliament, has been quiet on the issue, and they have failed to effectively represent the eastern suburbs. I for one have no faith whatsoever in the Bracks government or any of the Labor governments meeting their obligations under ANTA. It has been a dishonest approach by that government, and unmet promises have left many Victorians high and dry. SoI am pleased that this particular project has got up and running. Skill shortages do not occur overnight, as I mentioned. The biggest crisis facing the trade sector is a lack of incoming skilled workers to replenish the work force as experienced workers retire. I certainly recall speaking with many secondary school students in Deakin who described how a failure stigma can follow young school leavers who pursue a blue-collar career. For many parents of my generation, the old state technical school system was an effective system which produced school leavers of the necessary skills and enthusiasm to pursue a trade apprenticeship. I appreciate that we cannot wholeheartedly go back to that system, but I do look forward to the increased concentration by governments of all persuasions at the state and federal level-and even the community-on placing greater value and greater emphasis on trade qualifications. This bill is a first step towards achieving that. The abolishment of ANTA in July 2005 is the second step. Certainly, I believe the creation of the trade colleges is a most welcomed addition to valuing the trade areas and also giving real hope and aspiration to young people who are looking at alternative career paths. I welcome the upcoming negotiation of the 2005 ANTA agreement, and I welcome the changes that the minister will be introducing in the next six months. for Deakin’s contribution. I am happy to also acknowledge his interest. He is one of the very few government members who show an interest. Of course, he was Chairman of the House of Representives Standing Committee on Employment and Workplace Relations and I was a member of that committee, and I think it is fair to say that, as chair, he certainly conducted himself well. He certainly showedterm he was chair. He showed an interest. SoI suppose it therefore makes it all the more difficult for him to have to get up and defend the government. Because for him to actually get up and boast that one of the great things about this government is that it has abolished ANTA, that it has not supplied the TAFE places required, is an unfortunate thing. It is an unfortunate thing for someone who I believed had a passionate and sincere interest in vocational training. Therefore the government has really placed the member for Deakin in an unenviable position: to have to get up and justify these very crude decisions by this government.

On occasions in this place I have criticised, with qualification, I accept, some of the deficiencies of the Hawke-Keating period because there were some. I think, in general, there were more better things done than worse things. There were mistakes, we made them and we have acknowledged them. But this government fail to ever accept any responsibility or acknowledge their own failings. A division having been called in the House of RepresentativesSitting suspended from 6.20 p.m. to 6.38 p.m. that governments and government members have a responsibility to accept mistakes and failings and to try to rectify them. Unfortunately, it seems that this government wants to continue to blame any fault or any problem with the system, including vocational training, on Labor governments that ended their time in 1996. I think it is important that the government owns up to its own failings. There is no doubt there is a major skills shortage in this country, and it is something that we have to rectify. As we know, before the election, Labor was promoting the idea of increasing TAFE places in order to meet some of those shortages. Unfortunately, the fact that Labor failed to be elected meant that that was never going to occur. But I think it is now important for the government to announce what it wants to do to sort out some of these major problems. As I said earlier, there were skills shortages in the Hawke-Keating period, but the shortage trend has continued over the last eight-year period. The Department of Employment and Workplace Relations estimates trade shortages in construction, engineering and automotive trades, but also indicates that there are many shortages in the area of specialised skills. Some trade occupations have remained consistently in shortage for long periods of time. The department says that trade occupations which have been in short supply for a number of years include pastry cooks, chefs and motor vehicle mechanics continuously from 1994; tool makers and upholsterers continuously from 1995; boilermakers, fitters and turners, metal machinists, pressure welders and sheet metal workers in all but one or two years since 1995; refrigeration and air conditioning mechanics continuously from 1998; panel beaters, vehicle painters and automotive electricians continuously from the end of 1998. We have many skills shortages in our labour market. I will add another. I think the Deputy Leader of the Opposition raised this and it has been raised in question time. We have a critical shortage of bricklayers. I suppose one could say it is nice to see a bricklayer make $100,000 a year. We are probably in MAIN COMMITTEE",131,Vocational Education And Training Funding Amendment Bill 2004
215,Mr Brendan O’connor,"Indeed. As the member for Denison suggests, they clearly",132,Vocational Education And Training Funding Amendment Bill 2004
216,Mr Brendan O’connor,"Before the suspension, I was making mention of the factthe wrong game, Mr Deputy Speaker! But I think that points to a real problem in the workplace; it points to a real shortage. Two of the occupations which have not been mentioned perhaps as often and for which I think demand is going to grow exponentially over time are those of child carers and aged carers. Whatever the occupational description, those caring and learning industries represent large areas and involve particular skills. We do have a shortage of child carers. One of the reasons for that is that it is market driven. The wage or salary of a child carer is so low that many qualified child carers choose to just get out, because a career in that field is just not worth pursuing if you want to pay for a mortgage-increasingly a more expensive mortgage relative to income-or to do other things. There are real problems in child care. As we know, there is an increasing demand for aged care workers. Again, I think that is a very low-paid occupation commensurate with the skills and responsibilities required of those workers. We really have to turn our minds to that. In the Australian Industry Group’s recently released skills policy statement, entitled Worldclass skills for world-class industries, which was presented in August this year, it was highlighted that Australia faces a skills crisis in the next five years as the existing work force retires and the number of new tradespersons is insufficient to fill the gap. Labour supply problems are being experienced in many industry sectors but those that have heavily relied upon the traditional apprenticeship system as the major means of recruiting and skilling new entrants have experienced greater difficulties in sourcing skilled labour. In a survey of more than 760 manufacturers, entitled ‘Australia’s skills gap-costly, wasteful and widespread’, the AiG found that one in two firms were experiencing difficulties in obtaining skilled labour. The greatest difficulties were in metal based sectors, particularly for transport equipment manufacturers. High levels of difficulty in finding skilled labour were also evident in the machinery and equipment, fabricated metals and basic metal manufacturing sectors. Across manufacturing overall, there were 21.8 vacancies per 1,000 workers. The highest vacancy rates for skilled labour were in the wood, wood products and furniture sector, which had about 45 vacancies per 1,000 employees, and in the machinery and equipment sector, which had nearly 38 vacancies per 1,000 employees. All other metal based sectors had very high vacancy rates. What that report points to, in quantifiable terms, is that there is a major skills shortage in many occupational groups in this nation. The AiG estimated that the national skills shortage was 21,000 positions and that filling these positions would deliver a fivefold increase in the number of new people employed in manufacturing over the last 12 months. The largest numbers of skills shortages were in the areas of chemicals, petroleum and coal products; transport equipment; and machinery and equipment-each with estimated shortages of at least 3,000 positions. One report after another confirms the assertion I am making-indeed the contention that the opposition is making-that we have a fundamental problem. It is not being acknowledged by the government. I do not know how they work this out, but they believe there is a nexus between the HawkeKeating period and the skills shortage in 2004, and they do not want to turn their minds to fixing the problem. There is a further report. A discussion paper was commissioned by the Dusseldorp Skills Forum amidst concerns over the growing shortage in trade skills. It was presented at a round table convened in July 2003 by Group Training Australia. It presents new data on long-run MAIN COMMITTEE apprentice training rates by broad occupation groups. The data show a significant and sustained decline in the training rate over the last 10 years. The author of this report discusses the implications of this decline and provides an overview and assessment of the key explanations. I would advise members who have not come across that report to do so because it does provide some of the reasons why there have been these shortages and suggests policy recommendations to address the decline. In short, these recommendations include training levies, an increase in public sector training, changes to employer incentives, improving the quality of operations of group training companies, re-establishing pre-apprenticeship programs, improving VET in Schools, improving multiemployer coordination, increasing innovation intensity of industry and improving marketing of apprenticeships. Those are some of the things the author of that report points to as what we could be doing to fix the problem of the critical skills shortages we have in the labour market. Instead of looking at some of these things, this government has been blaming others. It has been blaming the states-and, as we know, a favourite hobby of the Commonwealth government is to blame either previous federal Labor governments or, indeed, current state Labor governments for the Commonwealth’s failing. It is either doing that or not making much headway in this area. If announcing the abolition of ANTA is supposed to be some sort of beneficial reform, I do not see it. What it does say to me is that it is perhaps a symbolic exercise in what this government really thinks about vocational training. We in the Labor Party were the creators of ANTA in 1992. We were the ones who supported ANTA and promoted the idea of vocational training. This government have paid lipservice to the notion of vocational training. There are shortages of training places. As a result, there are shortages of skills in the labour market. The government need to focus on those deficiencies. If they do not listen to the ACTU then they should listen to the employers, if that is what they wish to do. If they are not willing to look at a survey that might be commissioned by the ACTU, because of their ideological blindness to the reality of what is going on, they should listen to the employers. The major peak employer bodies are saying there are major skills shortages. Most employers are not sitting around talking about the need to make laws unfair for employees in the areas of termination; they are talking about skills shortages and asking what the government will be doing to fix them. There is not a great amount of detail on the duplication of technical colleges, which was announced during the election campaign. I do not want to be negative, but it seems to me that it was an announcement for election campaign purposes. On the face of it, it does not seem to be particularly practical. We are going to have a TAFE system and, standing beside that, these Commonwealth technical colleges. Instead of funding the TAFE system that exists, the Commonwealth is now going to divert energy into a separate system so that they will run concurrently but separately. That does not seem, on the face of it, to be a very wise thing to do. As I understand it, it is going to be some time before those colleges are up and running. As I understand it from the proposal of the Prime Minister during the election campaign, one of those colleges is proposed to be in or around my electorate, in Sunshine. I share the suburb of Sunshine, a great working-class suburb of Melbourne, with the member for Maribyrnong-I am not sure which one of us is supposed to be the beneficiary of this college. It will be a learning institution and, if it is at all effective, constituents of mine and, indeed, of the member for Maribyrnong and of other members will obviously be able to use it. I have to MAIN COMMITTEE say that my electorate and surrounding electorates do need more places. There needs to be more support for many of our constituents. If you look at the average levels of unemployment or of skills, I think the electorate of Gorton probably is not as well favoured as other places. It is a great place, it has a great pride and it is a great community to represent, but perhaps it has not been afforded the same opportunities as other places. People do not complain-they get on with it-but it would be great to see money funnelled in there to provide the wherewithal to ensure that my constituents and their children will be able to be properly trained up for full-time employment. Having said that, I am not convinced that the way to go about it is to set up this separate system which will not rectify the fundamental problems we have. Indeed, it will detract from the focus that I think the Commonwealth needs to have upon the TAFE system. It seems to me that it is going to be robbing TAFE to fund these ‘you-beaut’ tech colleges. I will accept whatever works. As the member for Gorton, representing people who I am sure would delight in more resources going into the area, I am not ideologically predisposed to one particular design or the other. But I do think that the system has to be coordinated, and I do think the Commonwealth have to start being a little bit more mature in the area. Instead of blaming the states, they should be working with them. Instead of failing to reach agreement on ANTA with the state governments, they should be showing some leadership, moving forward and reaching agreement. If they were to do that, they would have my respect-if not my entire agreement on the way in which they proceed. So there are some significant problems, as I have outlined over the last 20 minutes or so. In so many areas and occupational groups there are deficiencies, and those deficiencies have been cited by employer groups. I would have thought the government would listen to those employer groups when they shout from the rooftops that they have major problems employing people in particular areas because of those skill shortages. tion and Training Funding Amendment Bill 2004. The purpose of this bill is to amend the Vocational Education and Training Funding Act 1992 to appropriate a total of $1.15 billion as the Australian government’s contribution to the delivery of vocational education and training in 2005 and to adjust the currently legislated funding limit for 2004 to reflect the outcome of the ANTA agreement negotiations for that year. This bill supports the Australian government’s plans for a smooth transition to new arrangements for VET funding to be put in place from July 2005. The Australian government is committed to maximising vocational education and training opportunities for our youth and continues to deliver real results for the 70 per cent of school leavers who do not go directly to university from school. A hallmark feature of Australia’s highly successful VET system is the growth of new apprenticeships and their diffusion through the work force. Since 1995, when Labor was last in government, the number of new apprenticeships has increased by 195 per cent to over 416,800 in training as at the end of March 2004. Last year, there were 2,300 new apprentices in Dobell, compared with 650 new apprentices in 1995 when Labor was last in government. That stands in stark contrast to the comments of the previous speaker. This growth in new apprentices is in direct response to the needs of industry for skilled workers. The evidence of the program’s success is staggering. Employers are embracMAIN COMMITTEE",132,Vocational Education And Training Funding Amendment Bill 2004
217,Mr Ticehurst (Dobell) (6.53 P.m.),"I rise today in support of the Vocational Educaing higher skill levels, with 85 per cent of all new apprentices in training participating at certificate III level or higher. Since 1996, the number of women in VET has grown by 30 per cent to 812,900. The number of Indigenous students has grown by 85 per cent over the same period. Forty-three per cent of VET clients are now in rural and regional Australia. The growth in new apprenticeships has been the strongest for people aged 40 years and over, where the numbers have increased almost sevenfold in the last six years. This is a great achievement. The reskilling of mature age workers helps to position industry to address the labour force challenges of the future. The VET in Schools program is also working well. In 2002, over 185,500 students were participating in VET in Schools. In fact, the number of school students undertaking training has grown by 97 per cent since 1997, reflecting the huge success of the VET in Schools program, which is now available to more than 95 per cent of Australian technical schools. In fact, at the Wadalba high school in my electorate, 84 students in year 11 are involved in VET programs. That is quite an achievement. Next year that school will be doing year 12 for the first time. The coalition has introduced school based new apprentices and there are more than 14,000 in training today. However, while there has been great interest in service industries, such as hospitality, tourism and business, there has been less growth in school based new apprenticeships in the trades. The coalition is providing $17.9 million over four years to help a further 4,000 school students get into school based new apprenticeships in the trades through group training. Our local work force reaps the benefit from having school leavers ready for work duties, and the only way this can happen is through good policy and strong partnerships between government, educational institutions, training organisations-like Central Coast Group Training, which does a fantastic job locally-and local businesses. The Central Coast campus of the University of Newcastle has been working hard to expand the VET opportunities for its students. The Australian government has an integrated and comprehensive plan to ensure that the value of trades is enhanced as a career path. This includes providing expanded opportunities for students wanting a career in the trades, better advice on career opportunities, greater financial assistance for new apprentices and industry initiatives to build our skills base of the future. In fact, in my electorate of Dobelltraining scheme has been quite successful. They have over 400 apprentices on the local Central Coast involved with many of the businesses. Also, the local Central Coast manufacturers group hosted a meeting of school advisers from all the secondary schools to give them an opportunity to understand where the skill shortages are in the trades. This is a practical way in which people can be involved. One of the most significant boosts to vocational education and training ever undertaken by the government was announced by the Prime Minister in his election commitments. He announced various measures to address industry skill shortages, including the establishment of 24 technical colleges throughout Australia, and one to service the MAIN COMMITTEE",135,Vocational Education And Training Funding Amendment Bill 2004

220,Mr Ticehurst,"No. I wish to continue with my speech. In my local area, the groupCentral Coast. These technical schools are actually years 11 and 12. They are not competing with TAFE in any way, as members opposite would have us believe. This is great news for the electorate of Dobell and for Australia. It is wonderful that we can have an Australian government that is achieving record results when it comes to vocational education and training yet is committed to providing even more funding to VET to further maximise opportunities for our kids. The 24 Australian technical colleges will be created in regions suffering serious skill shortages and high rates of youth unemployment and which are supported by a significant or rapidly growing industry base. The abolition of technical colleges by the states has meant that over the past few decades our young people have lacked training and skills. These pathways would have been provided particularly to the 70 per cent who do not go directly from school to university. The price we have paid is the current severe skill trade shortages we are experiencing in many of our key industries. The colleges will provide tuition for up to 300 students in years 11 and 12 and offer both academic and vocational education to students while completing their school studies. Earlier this year the Howard government also announced the provision of a Commonwealth Trade Learning Scholarship to enable new apprenticeships in skill shortage trades. The scholarships will provide $500 to new apprentices starting their apprenticeship on or after 1 July 2005 at the end of the first and second years of the new apprenticeship. The initiative will assist around 60,000 firstand secondyear new apprentices from year 1, July 2005. Many new apprentices eligible for a Commonwealth Trade Learning Scholarship will also be eligible for an $800 tool kit which the coalition government will provide to new apprentices in areas of trade skill shortage. The Howard government has taken a leadership role in determining the overall direction and strategies to develop a skilled Australian work force. Skill shortages are always of concern to industry, but, as you can see, the government is committed to providing record funding levels toward VET initiatives to address this. Industry is increasingly recognising that an investment in skills is critical to its bottom line. As a result of the coalition government’s investment in training and direct assistance to employers of new apprentices, Australian employers are spending more on training their employees than ever before. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, employers are spending 52 per cent more on training than they were in 1996. The Australian government’s vocational education and training program continues to go from strength to strength and is in stark contrast to the poor VET results of the Australian Labor Party. As I mentioned earlier, new apprenticeships have increased by over 195 per cent since Labor was in government. However, this is not the only evidence of Labor’s lack of commitment to the provision of vocational training opportunities. When the Howard government offered a new ANTA agreement to the states and territories in May last year, every state and territory rejected our offer of an additional $220 million of funding for the creation of thousands of new training places. To keep good faith, the government applied the funding which was not taken up by the states and territories to purchase a total of 75,000 training places for priority groups. These are older workers, parents returning to work and people with disabilities. In this way the Australian government has fully maintained its level of commitment to vocational education and training in 2004 despite a lack of cooperation from federal and state Labor. MAIN COMMITTEE We have announced new measures in our election commitments to a total value of $1.06 billion over four years. This is one of the largest boosts to vocational education and training undertaken by any government. These new measures include extending youth allowance to new apprentices who are currently not eligible to receive youth allowance, even though they undertake studies while they are employed. This contrasts with the situation for university students. They are enabled to combine study and work while retaining their entitlement to youth allowance and Austudy within current eligibility requirements. The coalition government will provide a further $5 million over three years in residential assistance to new apprentices who have to move away from their family home in order to start or continue a new apprenticeship. The coalition will provide funding for prevocational training, which is a prerequisite for many businesses. This will provide apprentices with basic skills in the workplace, including familiarity with tools and simple work practices, before they work as new apprentices. It is disappointing that over recent years the states and territories have been slashing places in prevocational training in the trades, limiting opportunities for young people to get a step up into a trade. The coalition government will provide $35.5 million over four years to more than double the new apprenticeship access program, which gives participants assistance with basic literacy and numeracy, employability skills and other relevant work and trade skills. The Australian government has played and will continue to play a leadership role in the overall direction and strategies needed to develop a skilled Australian work force. Funding under the VET Funding Act in 1995 was $77.9 million. For 2005 under this bill the government will be spending $1.148 billion, underpinning the nation’s strong economic growth and low unemployment. Since coming to power this government has revived Australia’s vocational education and training system. The numbers in training have grown from 1.27 million in 1995 to over 1.72 million-an increase of 35 per cent. The number of new apprenticeships has grown by 195 per cent to span over 500 different occupations. New apprenticeships are vital to ensure the future economic prosperity of my local region and of our nation. The continuing financial support for the training of new apprenticeships is provided for in the bill presently before the House. I urge members opposite to support this important piece of legislation. tion and Training Funding Amendment Bill 2004 and want to acknowledge at the outset the great privilege that I had in the previous term thanks to the decision of the then Leader of the Opposition, the member for Hotham, in appointing me shadow minister for employment services and training. The opportunity to be involved in vocational education and training took me to every state and territory, where I was able to discuss the challenges facing Australia in providing a skilled work force and also to talk first-hand to a great many Australians who were providing that vocational training in schools, in TAFEs, in private training organisations and in group training organisations. This issue is also one that I raised continually in the last parliament. Only when the federal election was upon us were skills shortages-which had been created as a direct result of government policy-acknowledged by the government. Before then it was clear that everyone, from peak business organisations to financial journalists and the Governor of the Reserve Bank, had been talking about Australia’s emerging skills crisis and its potential to threaten MAIN COMMITTEE",136,Vocational Education And Training Funding Amendment Bill 2004
221,Mr Albanese (Grayndler) (7.05 P.m.),"I am pleased to speak to the Vocational Educafuture economic growth. According to Group Training Australia, there are currently national skills shortages in all key trades, including the engineering trades, all the vehicle trades, all the construction trades, all the food trades, as well as the electrical trades, electronics, printing, the wood trades, hairdressing and furniture upholstery. Service industries such as nursing, child care and teaching are also desperate for new entrants, to keep up with demand. The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry in its July 2004 survey of investor confidence found that for the first time in 14 years the availability of suitably qualified employees was the No. 1 constraint on future investment decisions. Specifically, 79 per cent of firms surveyed said recruiting employees with appropriate skills was a major or moderate concern. In September the Australian Industry Group released its survey, which found that more than one in two manufacturing firms were experiencing difficulties finding the skilled workers they needed. According to the Australian Industry Group, the skills crisis was here and now. The government’s own department, in the DEWR skilled vacancy index for August, found that vacancies for tradespersons had reached the highest level since such data was collected. Unfortunately it is likely to get worse. Over the next five years 175,000 workers are expected to leave the traditional trades, with only 70,000 expected to enter. Due to this, the Labor Party established a Senate Employment, Workplace Relations and Education Committee inquiry into skills shortages-something that was opposed by the government because they said it was not an issue. Yet the committee found that a failure to have enough skilled metal, engineering and manufacturing workers to carry out the $20 billion worth of major infrastructure and resource projects expected in the next 10 years would threaten the very viability of those projects. Indeed, it has been estimated that current skills shortages could cost Australia $9 billion in lost output over the coming decade. The absurdity of this is that, at the same time that you have this shortage of skilled workers, you also have a significant reservoir of untapped labour. In particular, Labor identified and came up with a strategy to address the fact that 45,000 young people leave school early to go nowhere-not to go into further education, training or into a job. The Leader of the Opposition, Mark Latham, deserves a great deal of credit for being ahead of the game. As the centrepiece of his first budget reply, he announced the youth guarantee, a comprehensive approach to tackling skills shortages, addressing the needs of young people and providing them with those opportunities. That policy is not surprising, because that is part of a proud tradition of the Labor Party. It was the Whitlam Labor government in 1973 that first provided Commonwealth financial support for apprenticeships through the establishment of the National Apprenticeship Assistance Scheme. This scheme was a landmark for apprenticeships in Australia. It marked the beginning of what has been continuous Commonwealth funding for apprenticeships and ensured that they became a national priority. It was the Hawke Labor government in the 1980s that took on the states and territories and put in place new industrial arrangements that enabled the traineeship system to be created in the first place. It was the Keating Labor government that in 1992 got the agreement of all the states and territories to the establishment of the Australian National Training Authority. This was a statutory body which sought to overcome the inconsistencies of our federal structure and bring a national focus to the delivery of VET. But what we have seen over the last 8½ years of the Howard government is an undermining of this system, culminating in the announcement in a MAIN COMMITTEE press release-not during the election campaign-that ANTA would be abolished from July next year. It is absolutely outrageous that nothing about this issue was mentioned or put to the Australian people prior to the election on 9 October. But it is not surprising, because the whole structure of vocational training has been under attack. Indeed, since 1997, real funding per teaching hour has dropped by 19 per cent and the proportion of VET funding coming from the Commonwealth has fallen from 25 per cent to 22.2 per cent. So none of these arguments about the responsibility of the states stand; the Commonwealth has not been keeping up its share of the bargain. Inevitably, these cuts have undermined the quality of training that 1.72 million Australians are currently receiving from the VET sector. At a time when we most needed our federal structure to be working cooperatively, Minister Nelson went along to the ANTA negotiations last year. The states would not sign up because the offer had no growth funding in it and it had the government’s ideological industrial relations agenda attached to it, so the minister simply said, ‘I’ll get back to you next October after the election.’ He broke off negotiations. That is not surprising, given the decision after the election. The agreement was supposed to commence on 1 January this year, and the government could not even get its act together to get that in place. It also could not get its act together to have an ANTA CEO, because she resigned some months ago and was replaced by a temporary appointee. We all know now why that occurred, as well. With respect to the government’s much-vaunted New Apprenticeships scheme, we know that it has become a numbers driven operation. When the government says there has been a massive growth in new apprenticeships, we know that most of that growth has been in the higher volume, higher turnover industries, as a means to subsidise wage bills, not to provide adequate training in what most Australians would see an apprenticeship as being-that is, a combination of on-the-job and off-thejob training in a profession, be it white collar or blue collar, over a number of years. The government did announce at one stage during the election campaign-there was a leak in the Sydney Morning Herald-that skills shortages were going to spur a $725 million spree. What did we actually get? We got a tool box to fix the skills shortages. How out of touch! Obviously the government was not aware that construction, electrical, metal fabrication and other awards contain tool allowances of up to $22. If you add that up, you get an amount that is greater than $800. When I raised that with Steve Balzary, from the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, he assured me that no employer out there would seek to have the tool allowance removed, even though they were having their tools provided for them. It was a very bold commitment indeed. The government also announced an $18 million plan for an institute for trade skill excellence. This was to provide ‘industry endorsement of qualifications provided by private and public training providers, including TAFE, identifying excellence and the preferred providers of high-quality and industry relevant training’. That was ANTA’s job. So they announced a replacement for a national body that has been doing the job and that involves employers, unions, TAFE and the federal-state relationship. They announced its replacement in a five-page document that did not mention the name ‘ANTA’ once. The institute will have four shareholders: ACCI, AiG, the Business Council of Australia and the NFF. The government said: ‘No TAFE, no unions, no state government. We will just have a focus on one section.’ The truth is MAIN COMMITTEE that employers and employees have an interest in a cooperative relationship when it comes to training, beyond any other policy area that you can think of. The tragedy is that, certainly in the time that I was the shadow minister for training, I had excellent relationships not just with the trade union movement but with ACCI and the Australian Industry Group. The member for Cunningham is here. I went down to the Illawarra with her and the member for Throsby and sat down with the Illawarra business community, unions, TAFE, training providers and local schools, who all had a common interest. That is the only way that this system works. Yet it is being undermined. As part of this policy announcement the government announced an industry reference group for each key trades industry. What are skills councils for? They are only just in the process of establishing them and they announce a duplication. As regards the proportion of the $18.3 million that is going to filter down-that is not going to ACCI and business organisations to create a bureaucracy-there are 20 awards for excellence valued at $10,000 each year, for three years. So $600,000 out of the $18.3 million is filtered down-to anybody. Awards are not a bad idea, but it is a pity that the government were not conscious of the way that the system was operating already. The government could not be bothered sending a representative to the world skills conference-a conference where 50,000 young people over three days in May this year went through the Brisbane Convention Centre. But, then again, during the campaign I spoke at the TAFE directors annual conference, a big national event. No government minister showed up; they sent along a parliamentary secretary. They could not be bothered during the election campaign to go along and talk to TAFE, the major provider of vocational education and training in this country. That is the heart of the system, and that is the reason why we were very committed to filling the gap, to providing extra TAFE places. Then we come to the government’s plan for ‘technical colleges’, as they call them. They cannot say where they will be, when they will be up and running, and whether or not they will charge fees. Last year, according to the ACCER, there were 415,000 senior secondary high school students in this country; 202,000 of them were doing VET in Schools. It is happening. The member for Dobell, who refused to answer a question, outlined quite well in some of his comments what is going on, on the ground, on the Central Coast of New South Wales. What is going on with schools, be they in Gladstone, Marrickville, the Central Coast of New South Wales, Salisbury in Adelaide or Alice Springs, is that they are linking up with TAFE and local industry and providing an integrated vocational education and training system. It is occurring. Why you would come up with a gimmick, when we have a serious policy issue to confront, is beyond me. The government senators’ report-the Liberal senators’ response, not the ALP’s responsefrom the Senate skills inquiry stated, on page 216: ... VET in Schools ... is already active in promoting partnerships between the three education sectors, industry and the local community. There is, in any event, limitations on the Commonwealth in facilitating and promoting these partnerships which are best handled at state level. No wonder the member for Page-who in a personal explanation today did not question the issue raised by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition-has called for the funding to go to Wollongbar TAFE, instead of having a college. I went to a TAFE college in his electorate during MAIN COMMITTEE the election campaign, and they are providing a world-class system but they are starved of funds. What does it say to the 202,000 young Australians who are currently engaged in VET in Schools? Indeed, as a result of a reference from the current minister, the member for Bradfield, to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Education and Training, we had an inquiry into VET in Schools on this very issue. Did the government report say that we should do something about that? No. What it said was that we should do something about the costs, which is why Labor committed in its Youth Guarantee to paying all TAFE fees for VET in Schools students. This commitment looked after the 202,000 people rather than creating another bureaucracy that, sometime into the future at some unknown cost, might be able to have 7,000 students. It is an absurd duplication of resources. This government stands condemned for its lack of action in addressing skills shortages. Indeed, its policies have contributed to these skills shortages which seriously undermine Australia’s potential economic growth and rob Australians of the opportunity to participate in the work force. on the nature of the Vocational Education and Training Funding Amendment Bill 2004 but also, and perhaps more importantly, to highlight what I regard as one of the most urgent economic challenges confronting Australia. It is a major issue that we have to confront in terms of working out how we attract investment for skilling, which will in turn attract investment from the private sector and create further jobs into the future. In that context I indicate at the outset that Labor supports this bill for one reason: to ensure grants to the vocational education sector for the coming year. That is pretty important. The last thing we should do is create any more barriers or difficulties for the vocational education sector at a time of major skills shortages in Australia. Having said that, it is worth noting that, whilst this bill is about funding, it in no way addresses the pressing issues in vocational education and training that need to be seriously debated in this place and in the broader community. I challenge the business sector to actually start to stand up and confront this government about its shortcomings and failings in relation to the economic challenges that confront Australia. I recall that, when Labor was in government, the business sector had a view on issues that were barriers to the future economic and social development of Australia. AllI can say is that since March 1996 there has been no leadership from the business sector in confronting Australia about its weaknesses and failings in the economic debate. All we hear about from key business representatives today is the need to make it easier to sack workers and keep their wages down. When do we really see them crying out about the fact that the Howard government has failed since March 1996, almost nine years, to do something about one of the major challenges confronting Australia, not only in the traditional trades but also in the professional area of employment-that is, how we train and skill people so that Australia continues to be competitive in a global world? I regard this as a most serious challenge to Australia. It is at a crisis point. The Howard government stands condemned for walking away from its responsibilities with respect to these fundamental issues. If we as a nation in the 21st century do not invest in education and training then we are basically failing ourselves and future generations, because we are creating barriers to investment and job creation in the future in a variety of sectors. I raise some important facts. Today there are nearly 22,000 unfilled vacancies for tradespersons in Australia. MAIN COMMITTEE",138,Vocational Education And Training Funding Amendment Bill 2004
222,Mr Martin Ferguson (Batman) (7.26 P.m.),"I rise to speak this evening not onlyThose 22,000 unfilled vacancies represent a barrier to attracting investment in Australia, both local and international. That effectively means that we are reducing employment in Australia because we do not have the skills to attract investment and give certainty to the private sector about a return on their investment. It is also estimated that skills shortages could cost the Australian economy $9 billion in lost output over the coming decade. And all we hear about from the Howard government is the agenda of creating jobs in Australia, which is not about investing in education and training but about trying to make it easier for disreputable employers to actually sack workers. That is their real agenda in confronting the economic challenges at this point in time. Having been the shadow minister for transport, infrastructure and regional development, I also note that $20 billion worth of major infrastructure and resource projects could be in jeopardy as a result of skills shortages primarily in trades and engineering areas. That speaks for itself. We also appreciate that cuts to public and private sector investment in skills formation in pursuit of productivity and efficiency gains have seriously eroded the skills base in crucial industries and occupations. That effectively means that the private sector has got to have a hard look at its own performance. Reducing investment in training and skilling is actually hindering its own future capacity to make profits. No employer in Australia should think that, by cutting expenditure on the skilling of their work force, they are doing the right thing by their shareholders in terms of maximising their economic opportunities in the future. I think that is something that the government has to have a look at. But some of our superannuation funds also have to have a look at it, because they are major investors in key projects in Australia. They have got to start speaking up about the fact that their potential investment return for workers through superannuation is being reduced by the failure of business generally to invest in the skilling which can potentially create bigger returns for their investments for the future. I also suggest to the House that, unfortunately, this skills shortage has gone unrecognised by the government, which has turned tens of thousands of young Australians away from TAFE each year. I also believe that we as a community have a problem. For far too long the community, not just the government, has had a view that the only way forward for young people is via university education. That is understandable because of the lack of opportunities for past generations, particularly for the children of the Depression-our own parents-who saw the opportunity of a university education as a step upwards. But the time has come for us to go out and, in a very positive way, promote the fact that doing an apprenticeship is no less an opportunity for young people than becoming a doctor, a lawyer, an optician or whatever. It is just as good to be an apprentice bricklayer, carpenter or chef. They are equally as important in terms of decent employment opportunities in Australia. That requires leadership at a national level. It requires us to work out a strategy in the Australian community to not only create additional TAFE places but sell the community the message that going to a TAFE and doing an apprenticeship is actually good for you as an individual, good for your family, good for your community and good for your nation. We have to confront it-we have failed ourselves-and it is equally as important as forcing the government’s hand in terms of putting real money into additional TAFE opportunities in the future. It is for that very reason that, to address the skills shortage, Labor at the last election promised to create some 36,000 new vocational education and training places each year and to pay MAIN COMMITTEE TAFE fees-and this is exceptionally important-for secondary students who want to get a vocational qualification. I want to underline the importance of not only putting additional TAFE places in place but also trying to encourage our young people to stay and complete years 11 and 12 and, in doing so, to have under their belts part completion of their apprenticeship so that they are more readily employable by employers willing to take on the responsibility of training young people in Australia. The more apprenticeships we can actually start at school to get our young people job ready and more attractive to employers so that they accept the responsibility of a full apprenticeship is very important not only to some of our suburbs, local communities and families but also to us in taking a big step forward as a community and overcoming the lack of skills in Australia. It is something we should be proud of. It is something that all state and local governments, in association with the private sector, ought to work in a cooperative and consultative way to achieve sooner rather than later. From manufacturing to science and engineering and in the health and education work forces, the availability of skilled people into the future to replace the baby boomers as they retire will fall far short of the levels required. We also have the problem with the ageing of the population. I am talking not just about the traditional trades such as bricklaying, the metal trades or whatever but also about other areas such as the service sector and aged care. The challenge will be to provide and fund training needs to actually meet growing demand and higher standards. We have heard the Treasurer bash on about the ageing of the Australian population in recent times. It is not just about how we pay for retirement but also about making sure we have the trained personnel in those aged care centres to look after the elderly citizens, who should be treated with respect and dignity in retirement. I go to the issue of technology and business processes. Changes are also driving additional training needs and new skill requirements in all areas of the work force. The Australian economy will be left behind if we fail to keep up and invest in our future. I have noted the fact that there are far fewer young people entering the work force to build a new skill base. It is well known that Australia’s productivity gains over the past two decades were stimulated by economic and labour market restructuring. They were initially put in place by the Hawke Labor government, which was elected in March 1983. When Labor came to government at that time, unemployment and inflation were both over 10 per cent, there was no economic growth and, in essence, there was an industrial war. Over the last two decades Australia has actually come off a very low base. It was what the Labor Party inherited when it was first elected in March 1983. The Australian community should not forget that. What is also accepted and perhaps less well recognised is the fact that the price we have paid as a result of reduced funding is a reduction in skills formation. According to the Productivity Commission, skills growth as a driver of productivity in Australia has dropped by 75 per cent over the last 10 years. And we talk about a nation that regards itself as being pretty productive. Our failure to invest in skills has actually reduced our productivity. In that context, I refer to the 2003 Senate report entitled Bridging the skills divide, which noted that the next wave of productivity gains will have to be founded on a new skills formation strategy. Where is that skills formation strategy? It is not in the tool box. It actually requires leadership at a senior government level. I wish it was only as easy as buying a tool box for a young person starting an apprenticeship, but it is far more complex. It actually requires the government to lead and work with state and territory governments and also to work in MAIN COMMITTEE partnership with the private sector, not the confrontationist approach that the Howard government is currently pursuing with its lack of a working relationship with the state TAFE sector and state and territory governments. To achieve that new skills strategy, I suggest to the House that we require increased public and private sector investment-that is, the government and private sector accepting responsibilities-as well as policy settings and a training delivery network that support new and more effective approaches to skills formation. Seems complex? It is not if you are actually prepared to work your way through those issues. That goes to the urgency of this issue. What is the Howard government’s answer? It was touched on by the member for Grayndler this evening. It is an approach intent on tinkering with a bureaucratic framework, not on delivering outcomes in the vocational education and training sector. I actually thought the establishment of ANTA was a historic moment for Australia. It meant actually getting the private sector, the representatives of workers, the union movement, and state and federal governments in the one room and working together with one common objective-to actually get more investment in the training of apprentices in Australia. I think the government’s proposal to abolish ANTA is short-sighted. I also believe that the proposal to establish 24 Australian technical colleges, mainly in-guess what: it sounds like the Regional Solutions Program-marginal coalition seats around the country is wrong. Let us take politics out of the issue of skilling in Australia and pursue in a very dogged way a commitment to actually do the right thing through cooperation, consultation and working together, rather than the Howard government’s desire to destroy the existing TAFE system. In that dogged pursuit of an industrial relations policy that is confrontationist, the Howard government is excluding the states and unions from any decision making about skilling in Australia, and that is also narrow-minded and short-sighted. We should not be ashamed of the VET sector. They have historically been good performers for Australia. We as a nation have prided ourselves in the past on our capacity to train people. Historically, a young tradesperson was able to go overseas and pick up a job anywhere because of the quality of the training through TAFE in Australia. Why would we destroy that? Because of the narrow ideological approach being pursued by the Howard government. You do not have to reinvent the wheel-you actually work to improve outcomes rather than destroy a proven system. I simply say that the proposal to establish a ministerial council of vocational education ignores the fact that the Commonwealth has-guess what-been unable to bring the states to the table to reach a new ANTA agreement. Why then-and this is a relevant question-if it cannot get the states to the table to work in a cooperative way and get a new ANTA agreement, would we accept that this government would be able to reach agreement through a ministerial council? It is not going to, because the government’s approach is basically: ‘Take it or leave it. We are dictating the terms. You do what you are told or you don’t get funding.’ I simply say that the proposals by the government are backward. They are not going to take us forward in our requirement to invest in training and skilling to create productivity and make Australia attractive for investment. Portability of qualifications across the nation is also important. There is no way we should destroy that. We fought too long at a national level in partnership with the private sector, unions and state governments in making some progress on the issue of portability. As we all know, it is also wrong that ANTA be re-established in the Department of Education, Science MAIN COMMITTEE and Training, where the short-term focus will be on establishing new administrative funding arrangements. This is bureaucracy and red tape gone mad. This government talks about its desire to assist small business. Frankly, all I can say is that it is going to make it far more complicated for small business. We have got good group training companies, good TAFE colleges and a desire by the Australian community to promote the apprenticeship system in Australia. The system is still attractive, but we need national leadership to reinforce more than ever to our young people as they go through years 10, 11 and 12 that there is a cooperative Commonwealth and state program aimed at attracting young people to do apprenticeships, because doing an apprenticeship is as good as training to be a doctor or a dentist. That is the message that has got to go out, in association with the addition of a national commitment to working with the state and territory system with respect to the development of TAFE. I also note that, so far as I am concerned, the Howard government’s ideological approach is going to undermine progress made at a workplace level with respect to skill related career recognition, multiskilling, a desire to reduce the number of classifications through new training arrangements and new work methods to create a more productive work force. I suggest that the Commonwealth should take a step back. The funding will go through as a result of the opposition’s support for the bill before the House, but we ought to think through some of the announcements made on the run during the election campaign and by media release with respect to the abolition of ANTA after the election-something that we did not find out about during the election campaign. There is a capacity to bring the nation together on the skilling front. State and territory governments, in association with the private sector, want to do the right thing by their local communities. I simply say that the government’s proposal to abolish ANTA and create 24 national technical colleges is not going to guarantee that young people will desire to invest years of their future in apprenticeships, because it is not a system that is based on good policy and it is not a system that has general community support. Alternatively, what the government should be doing is encouraging employers to do more in the private sector to fund and provide training for its existing work force and also attract young people who actually want to work in the skilling of apprentices. As the member for Werriwa said in this place yesterday, there is no more pressing area of government neglect than the underinvestment in TAFE and vocational education and training. We have to get this sector working effectively and efficiently. We have to properly fund our existing TAFE system and we have to get the private sector to play its part in funding and accepting its responsibility to train people. I reject the view of the government expressed yesterday that the answer to our skilling problems is migration. The answer to our skilling problems, which result from our own community failings in recent decades, is to invest in the skilling of our own work force and also to work to make apprenticeships more attractive. I therefore commend the bill to the House in terms of the additional funding and willingness to actually meet the needs of vocational education and industry in the foreseeable future, but I simply say to the government: have a rethink about your ill-thought-out agenda announced on the run-that is, the tool box solution to apprenticeship training in Australia-and think about investing within private and government sectors in the future. MAIN COMMITTEE I am also required to speak in the House very shortly. The basic context of the Vocational Education and Training Funding Amendment Bill 2004 is entirely disgraceful. If you look at the history of vocational education and training from 1996 until now it is a disgraceful effort by this government, which has no fundamental commitment to the technical and further education system in Australia. The part it should be playing, to ensure that TAFE is remodelled and extended and to ensure that what the states put in will be matched by the Commonwealth in a way that is sufficient for the purposes of the state system, has been disgracefully underdone. In fact, looking at what is before us today, the explanatory memorandum to this bill is like a short note saying, ‘Dear Teacher, I am going to be late.’ It is just a complete joke. It says: ‘We have been having a talk with the states, but we have not made an agreement with them. We have our bargaining position, so we are going to legislate our bargaining position and say cop it or else.’ We know what the basis of this position is and the people up in the Parliamentary Library know what it is. Their brief talks about what has happened. When this government came to power in 1996 they reduced the funding agreement established by Labor by five per cent. They discontinued a five per cent real growth on base recurrent funding in 1996. What did they do in 1997-98? They compounded it. They said that annual funding to the states and territories needed to be cut to provide ‘an incentive to the states to achieve efficiency gains in their VET operations’. This reduction was estimated to be $20 million in 1998. It was to be carried into subsequent years, and so it has been. This government cares nothing about the TAFE sector. It cares nothing about technical and further education. It has proved it in 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000 and then through to 2003. In 2004 they had an election, so they came up with a bright idea. They said, ‘If you have a look at what we have done, there is a bit of a problem occurring.’ There was a bit of a realisation that the traineeship program they put in place to degrade apprenticeships down to traineeships to boost the numbers and in fact to decrease the quality of the training available to young Australians was causing a bit of a problem. People were waking up to the fact that there was a significant difficulty. What did they do? They proposed to establish 24 technical high schools run by the Commonwealth under Australian Workplace Agreements. That would substitute for what they had not done in the technical and further education area. This is a national disgrace. In the last year, 250,000 people have come in from overseas to take the jobs that should be there for skilled Australians. Young people who should have access to technical and further education training that will allow them not just traineeships but to come out as fully qualified apprentices have been told effectively: ‘You need not apply. We’re not interested. What we’d rather do is get the Poms, the Irish or people from elsewhere in the world to come in, work on a four-year contract in Australia, and-guess what?-at the end of the four years, with a quarter of a million people a year added to the immigration intake, if they apply to stay in Australia we will not operate the normal immigration guidelines. What we’ll do is give them a discounted entry to Australia. They can stay here as a fully qualified plumber, carpenter or tradesman. In that way, we’ll try to fix the skills shortage.’ This government will not commit to young Australians and to their education. It has cut the recurrent funding. It has cut out any commitment to their future. It has effectively said to MAIN COMMITTEE",142,Vocational Education And Training Funding Amendment Bill 2004
223,Mr Hatton (Blaxland) (7.46 P.m.),"I will be brief, which is not my usual style, becausethem, ‘You can have a deskilled future in which you can be on the margins of society.’ It is a complete and utter disgrace. How good is it to supply 24 technical high schools to provide what the whole technical and further education system has been attempting to provide? I personally think the people who wrote the Carmichael report were right when they went to Austria and other European countries and said the education systems operative there did a better job of providing skills education, training and apprenticeships. People who went to school in Austria, Germany or Holland would come out with a comprehensive education, but also in those schools-which were full technical high schools across the entire system-with an extra year of training they would come out as fully qualified tradesmen, not just in one trade but usually in two trades. A person would come out as a fully qualified electrician, able to practise, with a certificate that indicated that they had the requisite skills from day one. They would also usually have a second qualification so that if the demand was greater in one area than another they could switch; they were completely multiskilled. The government do not understand the needs of this country when it comes to the skilling of our young people-or, worse, they do not care at all. They are willing to import people and then provide through the immigration system-effectively secretly-what they will not supply through proper funding to the states. They are not willing to grasp the nettle and say that we need a renovation of the technical and further education system. They are not willing to do the hard work and say to the state governments, ‘We need to look at a complete review of education from year 7 to year 12.’ It used to be that 38 per cent of students stayed on until year 12, but a Labor government took it to in excess of 80 per cent and we are on the way to 90 per cent. We need to look at the actual needs of all those students and determine whether or not we should have a complete recast of the system so that those Australian students who want to enter trades, who want a real apprenticeship, who want real qualifications, could be supported both by the state governments and by the Commonwealth so that they get real training, real qualifications and real jobs at the end of it. What do we have instead? We have a government that says: ‘This is what we’re putting on the table. Take it or leave it. You’ve got reduced qualifications, but what we’ll wave in front of you is 24 technical high schools.’ It is a complete and utter disgrace. It betrays the aspirations and the future lives and livelihoods of every young Australian who wants to do the right thing, to work-and work hard-and gain a qualification to take themselves through. There will be other occasions when I can return to this debate. I am required in the other place to speak on health-I am told by the deputy whip that I have got a couple of minutes, so I will run on her instructions. This is a total, complete and utter betrayal of every one of those kids who goes into school in year 7 and who in the past, before we increased the amount of time they would spend at school, would normally want to come out with some reasonable expectation of being able to devote themselves to trades. In this and the last parliament, Brendan Nelson, the Minister for Education, Science and Training, has put on a show of deeply felt concern about people who want to have a go and want to get some kind of qualification. This government is rewriting history, saying that the Labor Party is not concerned with young people and their educational concerns, that the Labor Party is not concerned with what the outcomes will be and that the coalition is the friend of the worker and the friend of the person who wants to get a trade. That is complete and utter rubbish. MAIN COMMITTEE This mob do not give a damn about the future of those people, as evidenced by what is proposed in this legislation and by their version of reduced funding to the states, reduced Commonwealth input, efficiency and productivity gains and all the rest of it. They know that traineeships are worth far less than the old apprenticeships. They know that Telstra, the state rail authorities and the other main education providers in the past have left the field. They know, or should know, that Australia is effectively deskilled and the great chance that we had to provide an education system that would allow young people to train here in Australia, have an apprenticeship and be fully qualified to work within Australia or earn income for Australia overseas in Asia is gone. This government are reprehensible in their failure to properly deal with technical and further education. They have put forward a total con job not only with regard to apprenticeships and traineeships but also with regard to technical high schools. I call on them to retract the approach they have, to have a look at secondary education Australia wide and to do the right thing by young Australians by providing them with a real future, real access to apprenticeships and real access to an education system that will provide them with a guaranteed future instead of the farce that they are presented with now. Ms HALL (Shortland) (7.57 p.m.)-The Howard government’s record when it comes to vocational education and training is absolutely abysmal. Despite its much touted New Apprenticeships scheme, this government has overseen a massive increase in skills shortage. This skills shortage is having an enormous impact on industry and Australia’s ability to compete internationally. The Vocational Education and Training Funding Amendment Bill 2004 will provide Commonwealth grants to states and territories to support them in their role as providers and administrators of VET. These grants are for capital and recurrent purposes and are passed to ANTA for allocation amongst states and territories. They ensure the grants to the vocational education sector for the following year. It is interesting to note that this legislation does not deal with administrative changes arising from the proposed abolition of ANTA. BeforeI came down here, I was looking at the percentage of GDP that this government have given to vocational education and training. That figure as a percentage of GDP is down. It is very interesting that, day after day, we listen to the government trying to convince the Australian people that they are doing a good job, that they are there to address the skills shortage and to make sure that all Australians have the appropriate skills that they need to find work and to meet the needs of industry. But, when you take a good look at the situation, you find that that is anything but the case. Over the years I have worked in the area of employment. I have appreciated the benefits of vocational training and how it has contributed to retraining and opportunities for Australians who want to either enter the work force, re-enter the work force or maintain their employment and move along the corporate ladder or move through various occupations within whatever industry they are involved. But under this government we have seen people’s options shrink and industry has become quite concerned about skills shortages. When I start evaluating and looking at why this happens and try to work out just what level of commitment the Howard government actually has to vocational education and training, I look to its first budget. One of the first actions that it undertook was to make massive cuts to TAFE-and, I must say, TAFE has never recovered from that. It is really interesting to see that, following the election, the MAIN COMMITTEE government is now thinking of setting up in opposition to TAFE. I will be watching that very carefully. I will be monitoring these new technical colleges that the government has promised the Australian people. I will be watching very carefully to see that there is no duplication of services and that they are actually delivering-delivering to the people who are undertaking training and delivering to industry. This government’s inaction over a long period of time has resulted in this enormous skills shortage. It has created an absolute crisis within industry and it has created a crisis for those people who are looking for work. I think one of the organisations that properly is fairly supportive of the Howard government generally is the Australian Industry Group. They have done a number of studies. They have undertaken some really authoritative studies in this area, looking at the skills shortage throughout the whole of Australia and in the Hunter, which is part of my electorate. I will spend a little bit of time examining those issues. The first statement they make in the report before me, World-class skills for world-class industries: accelerating reforms to vocational education and training, is: ‘World-class industries demand a world-class training system.’ Going through this document you will see that the Australian Industry Group believe that here in Australia we have anything but a world-class training system. What we have is a training system that has been run down; we have a training system that has been degraded by this government. On the other hand, we have had growth in industries, but the training system is totally fragmented, and it has become much more fragmented under this government. There is a shortage of skilled labour across Australia and industry has identified this as an emerging problem. I noticed earlier that the Chair of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment and Workplace Relations referred to an inquiry that that committee has been undertaking into workplace participation. As a member of that committee I have been privileged to take evidence throughout the whole of Australia. A common theme throughout that committee’s deliberations, submissions and hearings has been the skills shortage and the fact that on the one hand you have a skills shortage and on the other hand you have people who want to train but cannot link into the appropriate training. When you link that to the ageing of our population and some of the assumptions that have been made in that area, I think that we have a real problem unless the government truly embraces the need to address this skills shortage and the crisis that exists in Australia today. I looked through the DEWR skilled vacancy index for 2003-04 to see some of the areas where there is a skills shortage, some of the occupations where vacancies cannot be filled. It shows that there has been a 21 per cent increase in vacancies in the metal trades, a 38 per cent increase in the electrical and electronic trades, a 45 per cent increase in the printing trades and a 17.9 per cent increase in the construction trade. The sad fact is that many of these vacancies are not being filled because of a lack of people within our work force who have the appropriate skills. This is purely and simply a result of the government’s inaction in this area. It is also appropriate to put on the record that there has been an 8.9 per cent increase in vacancies in the past 12 months. In the Hunter region, 61 companies reported a total of 805 vacancies in 2004, 85 per cent of the companies surveyed were experiencing skills shortages-that is quite a considerable skills shortage-and 633 vacancies recorded were at trade level and above. What is needed is more than rhetoric. What is needed is a government that is prepared to address this issue. MAIN COMMITTEE There are also many anomalies in the training system. Constituents have visited me with their children-young people who have been unable to gain entry to appropriate training courses because the number of training courses has shrunk. In two cases that I can think of off the top of my head, parents have brought to me their sons and daughters who have undertaken training at, say, a certificate level III course. There has been a problem with an employer and, because these young people have undertaken training for a certain period of time, they have been ineligible to undertake any other apprenticeship training. This created real hardship for these young people, it created real heartache for their families, and it really limited their vocational options and their work options. It is a flaw in the system, which this government has failed to address and which I have detailed much more thoroughly in previous speeches in this House. When we are looking to address skills shortages, we have to look at them from the perspectives of the industries and of the people who would like to work in those industries. I do not think that is happening at the moment. I will focus on the Hunter for a short time. Regional industries face many challenges and opportunities in the years ahead. Traditionally, the Hunter has been a region where industries have been established because it has been seen as an area with a highly skilled work force. But, unfortunately, in recent times this has changed and the skills base of the work force has dissipated. That is very sad, because I know that there are a lot of young people in the Hunter who would be more than happy to undertake training in the trades. When I was working in that area, of all the young male students who had left at the end of year 10 or year 12 with a strong desire to undertake an apprenticeship, very few were able to obtain that much sought after apprenticeship. Similarly, for young women keen to obtain apprenticeships in areas such as hairdressing there were not the opportunities for them to undertake the training. The government needs to address this issue. As I was saying, it has been three years since there has been an emergence of a shortage of skilled labour with Hunter employers. This has impacted on their ability to tender for contracts. They would have been able to tender if there was a skilled labour force in the area. As I mentioned earlier, there are a total of 805 skilled vacancies. That is for 61 employers who currently employ 6,400 people within the Hunter region. That represents a vacancy for every eight employees in the work force. That is really significant. There are positions for electricians, boilermakers, fabricators, labourers and engineers. All these positions remain unfilled. They cannot find applicants who have the right skills, the right qualifications or the right experience to meet the needs of industry. From my perspective, that is a missed opportunity. It is a missed opportunity for the employers; a missed opportunity for the people who could be filling those vacancies; a missed opportunity for the Hunter, which concerns me very much; and a missed opportunity for Australia, which concerns me even more. It is also interesting to break up those vacancies and take it a little bit further. The skilled vacancies are higher in the smaller firms-that is, firms with 30 or fewer employees. They have a vacancy for every four members of their work force. That is really significant: four employees, one vacancy. It is very worrying. Medium sized firms have one vacancy for every six employees. Larger firms, with 100 employees or more, have one vacancy for every 10 employees. Employers are not receiving the applications. Those who do apply do not have the appropriate skill levels or the appropriate qualifications. The one thing that is constant MAIN COMMITTEE throughout this is that there is a skills gap within the existing work force. This is a real problem for industry in the Hunter region. It is also a real problem for Australia. Australia is part of a global economy. As such, if we want to succeed, if Australia really wants to embrace this global economy, we must have a highly skilled work force. We need people who can work in industry and who can perform at the highest level. Almost every firm in the Hunter is identifying gaps where they would like to employ people, gaps in training programs and gaps in their existing work force. That is of great concern to me, and I know from the deliberations of the committee that I have been a part of that the Hunter is no different from other areas within Australia. What really worries me is that all we receive from the government are platitudes. We do not receive action. We do not have the kinds of responses that will really develop benefits for all those fine industries and employers in the Hunter and throughout Australia. We also do not have the kinds of responses that will deliver jobs and outcomes to all those workers who would desperately like to work in industry. We need long-term solutions to address these skills problems. We need to encourage industry to take on more apprentices and we need to have the capacity for those apprentices to be trained. That capacity has been significantly dissipated by the government’s cuts to TAFE and to vocational education. As I have already stated, the percentage of GDP that is going to vocational training has decreased dramatically under this government. We need more apprenticeship training. We need more pre-apprenticeship training too. Employers really love pre-apprenticeship training schemes because they actually get apprentices who have got the skills to work in the workplace when they start working. We need increased financial incentives for employers, we need targeted recruitment and we need programs put in place that will allow more workplace training. What we really need, more than anything, is a government with a bit of imagination. We need a government that is committed to Australia, committed to industry and committed to providing quality training to young Australians, to Australians in the work force and to older workers. We need a government that embraces lifetime learning and puts Australia first. We need a government that puts Australian industry first and is not mean spirited but is broad minded and forward thinking. ister Assisting the Prime Minister) (8.16 p.m.)-in reply-I am delighted to follow the member for Shortland and remind her that contributions to the states and territories have risen from $777.9 million under the Australian Labor Party-her party-to $1.13 billion under this government in this calendar year. That is an increase of 45 per cent, and in real terms is an increase of 23 per cent. The Vocational Education and Training Funding Amendment Bill 2004 in fact indexes the base further to make it $1.154 billion that we are putting out to the states and territories under our vocational education funding agreement. This is about making certain that the money continues to flow. We see the contribution which is offered through this bill to the states and territories as important. We would have liked to do more. We wish we had been able to get agreement between the states and territories and the Commonwealth in 2003, because there would be many more tens of thousands of people in trade training circumstances if we had been able to get that agreement up. But without agreement the funds continue to flow-it is an undertaking that Minister Nelson and I MAIN COMMITTEE",147,Vocational Education And Training Funding Amendment Bill 2004
224,Mr Hardgrave (Moreton,"Minister for Vocational and Technical Education and Mingave to the state training and education ministers as recently as just a week and a half ago. Perhaps that news has failed to filter through, in what is an uneasy time between the federal Labor Party caucus and the rest of the Australian Labor Party around the country. Mr Deputy Speaker Wilkie, as you realise, a strong economy is driving an enormous amount of jobs growth. We have gone from a position under the previous government, where kids were looking for jobs and were going through the debilitating process of not being able to find employment, to this amazing circumstance where there are jobs looking for kids. In my own electorate of MoretonI am amazed at how many businesses are now saying: ‘Juniors required. Please apply within.’ The signs stay up, not for a day but often for weeks, waiting for someone who is actually available to take that job. That is where strong economic growth has delivered for the average Australian and the average family. As a government, we want to make sure that the workers in those circumstances are well trained and have the opportunity to get access to what is regarded as world’s best practice in the area of vocational and technical education. This underpins Australia’s ability to compete in an increasingly global market environment. It is absolutely vital to ensure our continued economic growth and the continued prosperity of this country. As a government, we are committed to vocational education and training. It is shown by the significant funding that is being provided through this bill, and I thank the opposition for its support. As well, of course, through the election campaign well over $1 billion of initiatives were announced, and they will be delivered through the budget next year. These initiatives address skills shortages and some of the particular needs of young apprentices and their employers in order not only to get them in a trade and help them with the equipment they need-the tools for that trade-but also to ensure that they stay and do not drop out of their apprenticeships as, tragically, some young people do. The drop-out rate is not as high as the one in three who leave university, but it is nevertheless a significant factor. So we want to target some of those, and we are. In 2004-05 this government will spend a total of $2.1 billion on vocational education and training, of which more than $725 million will go to supporting new apprenticeships through direct incentives to employers and through the network of 500 new apprenticeship centres, the NACs. We have also announced new measures in our election commitments with a total value of $1.06 billion over four years. This is without doubt one of the most significant boosts to vocational and technical education ever undertaken by any government. The Prime Minister’s appointment of a minister to target this particular area of vital economic importance further demonstrates the high priority that he and indeed the government place on meeting the skills needs of industry. I am greatly honoured to have the opportunity to do that and to talk to people in regions around Australia, such as the Hunter. I will be there talking to industry, because industry is contacting us. TAFE training providers, private training providers and schools are contacting us and expressing an interest in being part of the network of Australian technical colleges. I hope the member for Shortland and her colleagues on that side of the chamber encourage people to participate fully in the development of what will be centres of excellence that will say to students studying in years 11 and 12 that having a trade skill outcome from their years of education is as good as-and I would argue in fact better than-any university degree. University degrees are terrific things to achieve but we need people with trade skills in situ MAIN COMMITTEE today. Those people are in the strongest position in our economy. We need to keep investing in them. The vocational education and training sector is now in this transitional stage of national arrangements. On 22 October the Prime Minister announced the abolition of the Australian National Training Authority, ANTA, and the transfer of its functions to my department from July 2005. I want to pay tribute to ANTA. It was established in 1992 to coordinate the levels of government in setting up a truly national vocational education and training system. Of course, a dozen years later, with industry leadership, this national system is in place. It is a significant achievement of ANTA and indeed all the stakeholders in the national training system that we are now delivering industry endorsed, internationally renowned and nationally recognised qualifications that certainly are the envy of many other countries around the world. The transfer of the ANTA functions to the department acknowledges the maturity of the system that has been created. It acknowledges the achievements of the national training system to date. It does not mean that there is going to be any reduction in effort-in fact, quite the opposite. The Prime Minister has announced that a new ministerial council will be established and this will ensure the continuing harmonisation of a national system of standards, of assessment and of accreditation. This will allow a clearer focus on the critical issues which are facing our country, such as the skills shortages that all speakers in this debate have talked about. I want to stress that the government have a very clear intention. We want this national system to continue and we want industry’s central role to be maintained and indeed enhanced in what lies ahead. In recognition of industry’s role in the vocational education and training sector, the Howard government will establish the Australian Institute for Trade Skill Excellence. This institute will provide industry endorsement of qualifications provided by both private and public training providers. This institute will identify high-quality and industry relevant training. The strength of Australia’s economy has seen a strong increase in demand for skilled workers. As I said, for too long success in Australian society seems to have been measured for years 11 and 12 by getting a university degree. We want to make sure that young people making decisions about what to do next are as committed as we are to challenging the view that the new apprenticeships and vocational education are somehow second-best to university. We want to continue to provide even higher quality alternatives to the 70 per cent of Australia’s young people who do not go on to university. With the establishment of the 24 Australian technical colleges in regions all around Australia, regions which need an enhancement of the skills base, we will provide pride and excellence in the teaching and acquiring of trade and craft skills at the secondary school level. These colleges will provide tuition for up to 7,200 students in years 11 and 12 and will offer both an academic and a vocational education outcome. We want to make sure that, at the end of that year 12 experience, having attended an Australian technical college a student can still make the choices they make today. But we hope that, having been immersed in a vocational and technical education sector along the way, most, if not all, will take the path of a trade skill outcome. I want to again emphasise, as I had to in the House of Representatives chamber today-and I am happy to keep doing this until those opposite abandon the negativity in opposition for MAIN COMMITTEE opposition’s sake and adopt a more positive approach-that these Australian technical colleges are not going to bypass or duplicate existing institutions. Rather, it is all about the Australian technical colleges working with existing education and training providers, developing new opportunities for young people interested in a career in the trades. The government will also provide greater financial assistance to new apprentices in skill shortage trades by offering a Commonwealth Trade Learning Scholarship and providing tool kits. The Youth Allowance will be extended to new apprentices, and third-year apprentices living away from home will be eligible for residential assistance. I think this parliament has reason to be very proud of the excellent achievements of the Australian vocational education and training systems. Since coming to power, this government has set upon a course of reinvigorating the national training system. Those opposite should be interested to know this: the latest figures show that in 2003 there were more than 1.7 million students in vocational education and training. This represents more than 12 per cent of Australia’s working-age population. That is an increase of 35 per cent over 1995’s figures. I know those opposite want to talk it down, but the facts are getting in the way of their continuous story. The numbers for new apprenticeships have grown to around 400,000 in training-nearly three times the numbers that were in training in 1995, when the figure was about 140,000. Today new apprenticeships are available in more than 500 occupations, including emerging industries such as aeroskills, electrotechnology, information technology and telecommunications. In fact, the report by the National Centre for Vocational Education Research which was released just last Friday highlights that new apprenticeship commencements in trade and related occupations have in fact increased by 18 per cent, with an estimated 66,900 commencements in the 12 months to 30 June this year. New apprenticeships in electrotechnology are up 21 per cent; in construction they are up 15 per cent; in hairdressing they are up 23 per cent; and in the automotive retail, service and repair industry they are up 12 per cent. These are all areas of skill shortages, all areas which the government is focusing on. The Australian Industry Group described these figures as ‘some of the best news heard in this area for some time’. The Ai Group is correct in stating that this government has made addressing skill shortages ‘a major priority’. That is what is really going on, but if you listened to those opposite you would never know about it. Since 1996 the number of women in vocational education and training has grown by 33 per cent, to reach some 834,400 people. That is about 42 per cent of total new apprentices in recent years. Australians of all ages are benefiting from this government’s constant and successful vocational education and training policies. Last year more than 200,000 senior secondary students enrolled in vocational education courses, reflecting the outstanding success of the VET in Schools programs, which are now available to more than 95 per cent of Australia’s secondary schools. At the same time, older people are also very well represented in vocational education and training. In 2003, 30 per cent of all VET students were aged 40 years and over. SoI am astonished by any negativity from those opposite in the face of the statistical underpinning of the government’s argument in favour of this legislation. I am pleased to inform members that my colleague Minister Nelson has written to state ministers on behalf of the government offering them certainty of funding for the whole of 2005, which will be maintained at the real value of funding in 2004. This bill will provide that MAIN COMMITTEE certainty. Funding for the first six months of 2005 has been offered under a rollover of the current ANTA agreement and funding for the second six months of the calendar year to come will be conditional on the acceptance by the states and territories of the new Commonwealthstate funding agreement that will be developed early next year. This bill appropriates funding for the full 12 months, enabling the states and territories to plan their ongoing vocational education training and delivery. Members opposite have raised matters to do with the purchase of VET priority places. These places were initiated in 2004 when the states and territories did not sign up to the agreement for 2004-06. Through my department this funding will continue in 2005 and, of course, it can be incorporated in the new Commonwealth-state funding agreement if this decision is taken with the state and territory governments. I thank all who have contributed to this debate and I note the interest of a lot of members in this area. From the government’s point of view, we are very pleased to see the Australian Labor Party, the workers party, becoming interested again in training issues. I commend the Vocational Education and Training Funding Amendment Bill 2004 to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Message from the Governor General recommending appropriation announced. Ordered that the bill be reported to the House without amendment.
