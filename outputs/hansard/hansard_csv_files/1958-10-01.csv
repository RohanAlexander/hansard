The Public Service Board agreed in order to promote greater efficiency, to provide a number of permanent positions in place of temporary ones. These positions have now been filled by the promotion of permanent officers, many of whom, are from other departments. As a result the services of seventeen temporary employees will no longer be required. Every endeavour is being made to find positions for these employees, if possible in other departments. To give the employees to be retrenched a longer period in which to find suitable positions elsewhere, arrangements have been made for the intake of officers from other departments to be delayed for several months, and for the temporary employees to be retained for a similar period. I can assure the honourable member that the retrenchments involved are not associated with plans to curtail import quotas further and also that the number of staff required to deal with import licence applications does not vary according to the country from which the goods are imported..............................................................................................................................................................1901 Import Licensing ..........................................................................................................................................1902 Motor Vehicle Spare Parts ...........................................................................................................................1902 Tariff Board .................................................................................................................................................1902 Imports of Aircraft .......................................................................................................................................1906 Shipping.......................................................................................................................................................1906 Commonwealth Offices, Adelaide ...............................................................................................................1907 Migrants and General Election.....................................................................................................................1907 Bauxite.........................................................................................................................................................1907 Imports of Ships ...........................................................................................................................................1908 Political Telecasts ........................................................................................................................................1909 Dollar Allocations for Television .................................................................................................................1911 Wednesday, lst October, 1958. took the chair at 2.30 p.m., and read prayers. BELL BAY ALUMINIUM PLANT. honourable the Prime Minister this question: Is the Government, the Prime Minister or any other Minister either considering or negotiating the sale or disposal to outside private interests of the Australian Aluminium Production Commission's enterprise at Bell Bay, or any part of it? or nine years I have heard suggestions made, sometimes from here and sometimes from the Government of Tasmania, about introducing outside capital into Bell Bay. So far, Sir, there has been no specific proposal made from any source. Health tell the House whether the Government has received from the Royal Flying Doctor Service of Australia a request for increased financial assistance? If so, has the request been considered, and has a decision been made on the matter? Flying Doctor Service has made recent approaches to the Government for increased financial assistance, and representatives of the service met representatives of the Government and discussed the matter. As a result, the Government has agreed to increase the capital grant to the service from £15,000 to £27,500 a year and the grant for operating expenses from £25,000 to £40,000 a year. This arrangement will have a currency of four years. I should like to say that the Government recognizes the unique and splendid service that is being given by this organization in the development of the country, and has a very high regard for the competence and the disinterestedness of the directors of the service and, in fact, of all the people working in it. of the acting Treasurer. Is the right honprovision that small holders of bonds, up to orable gentleman aware that the Commona value of £5,000, may obtain the face wealth Trading Bank is acting as one of the agents for Waltons-Sears Limited respecting an appeal for subscriptions to a £1,000,000 loan offering a rate of interest as high as 7i per cent.? Is not the fact that the Commonwealth Trading Bank publicly exhibits a prospectus for this loan and accepts subscriptions for it, thus giving the impression of a bank guarantee of the loan, likely to prejudice greatly the possibility of the Commonwealth Bank successfully securing public support for Commonwealth loans at 4$ per cent, to 5 per cent, interest? Does not the situation become all the more serious when it is realized that the Government faces in this financial year a commitment of £337,000,000 in respect of either the repayment, or the conversion, of maturing loans? able friend's interest in this matter, because it is quite important. I am not aware of the matters to which he refers, but I will make inquiries at once. Defence whether he will give urgent consideration to sending to Australian New Guinea and Papua either some components, or the whole of the remaining elements, of the brigade group now in Australia for an extensive training period under active service conditions in territory where, at some stage in the future, they might be called upon to operate. honourable member that only recently a statement was made by my colleague, the Minister for the Army, that the brigade group would engage in an operational training expedition in northern Queensland. That is to take place in May or June of next year. As to any future training site, that will' be considered at a later stage, and the suggestions made by the honourable member will then be taken into consideration. directed to the Prime Minister in his capacity as acting Treasurer, relates to loans",7,Setup

10,Mr Thompson,"My question,value of their bonds after twelve months. I should like to state that I highly approve of that very wise move on the part of the Government. I ask the Prime Minister whether it is possible for the Government to make arrangements to enable small holders of 3 i per cent, bonds, who have been very hard hit by their low selling value, and are suffering hardship, to surrender their bonds at their face value. I do not know whether the Prime Minister has considered this matter, or whether it could be considered. ber, who takes a keen and lively interest in these matters will, of course, realize that he has raised a rather difficult question. It may affect a very great number of bond holdings. But since he has raised the matter I will have it looked into. I will discuss it with the Treasury and will communicate with him whatever ideas I may evolve as a result of that discussion. extremely low prices being recovered from the sale of butter overseas, I ask the Minister for Primary Industry whether the Government has given any consideration to underwriting the final equalization payment in order to ensure that the interim payment will be more closely related to the final returns. member, in common with most other honourable members, will be aware that the Government keeps under constant review all the problems of the butter industry. I am very glad to be able to tell the honourable member that the Government will underwrite the return on total production of butter and cheese for the 1958-59 season, which will enable the average factory to pay to producers 40d. per lb. commercial butter basis when the equalization pool for the year is finalized. I am glad the honourable member has given me the opportunity to present this information to the House, as it will be very useful when the debate on the research and sales promotion scheme is continued. aware that under the policy of the Postal crisis in butter marketing. Department of converting exclusive telephone services to duplex services, as many services are being converted to duplex as there are new exclusive services being installed? Is this to be a permanent feature of telephone services in the future? should say that the statement of the honourable member for Banks that as many services are being installed on a duplex basis now as on the exclusive basis is not correct. However, I will check it and let him know definitely. The honourable member knows that ail exclusive services are now installed in homes on the basis that the department may transfer them to the duplex system if it is necessary to do so in order to provide a service to an additional residence. Anyone taking a service does so with the knowledge that it could be duplexed, if necessary. However, in implementing this provision, the department takes care to ensure that no service with a calling rate of more than about two calls a day is duplexed. Only those services with a very low calling rate are transferred to the duplex system. As the honourable member knows, the duplex system gives complete privacy -in the use of the telephone; a different call signal is provided for each phone and the accounting system keeps separate the accounts of both services. It is a system which enables the department to provide many more services than could be provided if all telephones were exclusive. Minister for Primary Industry is supplementary to that asked by the honourable member for Gippsland. In order to give heart and confidence to the dairying industry, will the Government continue to underwrite the declarations of the equalization committee referred to by the Minister when he answered the question of the honourable member for Gippsland? By way of further explanation, I should like to say that the honourable member for Wannon and all other members of the Government Members Food and Agriculture Committee have undertaken to continue discussions with the dairying industry to ensure that the industry will be assisted on to a sound basis.",12,Government Loans And Finance

16,Mr Jeff Bate,"My question to theit clear to the House that, as far as the workings of the equalization scheme are concerned, it is not the intention of the Government in any way to make suggestions to or to interfere with the work of the committee. It is an independent authority and will continue to work independently. But I should like to make this additional statement to the House, because I omitted to mention it to the honourable member for Gippsland: For the remaining period of the present five-year stabilization scheme, the Government will be prepared to consider applying the same principles of underwriting a final equalization figure by guaranteeing a final return on total production of butter and cheese at a level determined by it after examination of all the relevant facts. For the benefit of the honourable member for Macarthur, I add that the long-term prospects have been considered by the Government, quite frankly, not once or twice but on several occasions. Some aspects will also be considered by the Australian Agricultural Council at its next meeting in Melbourne next week. whether, in view of the need to train technicians, he will consider providing scholarships at technical colleges on the same basis as scholarships are provided at universities. enough to do anything. as I am by the observation of the honourable member for East Sydney, if I am here after the election, I will have a look at the suggestion of the honourable member for Darling. fence had an opportunity to investigate a report, which was published in Australia recently, that the United Kingdom was supplying a fleet of approximately 100 ships of about 5,000 tons each to the Communist Government of China and that the ships would be used as troop transports? If the Minister has had an opportunity to investiSUPPLEMENTARY RENT PENSIONS. gate this report, will he inform the House of the results"" of his investigation? F.5890/58 -R -[68 ] mentioned by the honourable member, and I considered it of such importance that I had inquiries made. I am now able to say that the report was incorrect. The position is that over the past two years Communist China has been chartering ships from a number of countries. Our information is that it has chartered, in all, about 100 ships in Europe, of which between ten and twenty were from the United Kingdom. The primary purpose of the chartering has been to keep the transport of cargoes in Chinese hands. Our information is that the rate of chartering has not been accelerated recently. Social Services: Does a pensioner cease to be regarded as being entirely dependent on his or her pension if other income exceeds 10s. a week? Is a pensioner paying rent or board and lodging to the extent of less than 10s. a week deemed to be ineligible for the 10s. supplementary payment? What amount of assets is a pensioner entitled to have before he or she is deemed not to be entirely dependent on the pension? leave of the House to make a brief explanatory statement on the question of supplementary assistance. That statement will cover the points raised by the honourable member. Primary Industry yet received a recommendation from the Australian Wheat Board regarding the amount of the first payment on the 1958-59 wheat crop? If he has not, will he be able to give such a recommendation quick consideration when it is received? received any recommendation with regard to the first payment for the current season's wheat crop. As to the honourable member's second question, after a recommendation is received it will require only a matter of hours for discussion between the Prime Minister, as acting Treasurer, and myself to reach a final decision.

What information will be contained in the letters forwarded to applicants whose claims have been rejected? Will pensioners be given detailed reasons for the rejection of their applications for supplementary assistance? will be answered in the course of the statement which I hope the House will give me leave to make. Postmaster-General informed me, to the great satisfaction of Corio constituents, that a school for technicians-in-training would be commenced in Geelong. I have received many inquiries since that announcement, and it would be very much appreciated by all if the Minister would indicate when this important undertaking will begin operations. some time ago, in the early part of the year, the honourable member for Corio directed several personal inquiries, and, I think, a question in the House, to me on this subject. I then informed him that the department intended to establish several schools for technicians-in-training in centres outside the main metropolitan areas, and that Geelong was one of the places contemplated. I regret to have to inform the honourable member that it has not been possible so far because of a lack of suitable accommodation, to commence the school at Geelong. However, as soon as suitable accommodation is availableand a search is now in progress-the department will give effect to its announced intention. the Minister representing the Minister for Customs and Excise. Is it a fact that the Government proposes to abolish normal customs control and supervision of the storage and use of dutiable and excisable oil products on which import duty and excise duty have not been paid? If this is so, does it mean that, in future, the oil companies or their agents will determine the total amount of duty and excise that they will pay? Finally, is it a fact that under this proposed system, the administration costs of the Department of Customs and Excise will increase in New South Wales by about £8,000? part of a general review of customs procedures which has been going on for several years and has been pursued vigorously by my colleague in the Senate, some long-standing practices of the Department of Customs and Excise have been reexamined with a view to avoiding inconvenience to the commercial community and reducing the cost of administration. I understand that, as part of that general review, alterations are being put into effect in the method of supervising the collection and payment of duty on petroleum products, but to say, as the honourable member did in his question, that normal customs procedures will be abolished is quite wrong. The procedures are likely to be altered. As the object of the exercise is to save administrative costs both to the department and to the commercial community, it seems to me very unlikely that the alterations could result in higher administrative costs, as the honourable member has suggested. Minister for Supply concerns the interest of a United States gypsum company in the establishment of large-scale works at Carnarvon. Has the Minister any reply concerning submissions from America in connection with this matter? ber for Perth came to me with this problem about a week ago. I was quite interested in it, because the industry means a big investment in Western Australia, in which the honourable member is particularly interested. I sent a cable to the Australian Embassy in Washington asking our ambassador there to get into touch with the Minister for Trade, who was then in the United States of America, and ask him to call on representatives of the company and discuss the matter with them further.

Minister for Labour and National Service relates to the decision of the Government that has already been announced that Commonwealth Hostels Limited will take over the control of hostels in Canberra which are at present conducted by the Department of the Interior and the Department of Works, including the Hotel Kurrajong, where most members of Parliament reside while the Parliament is in session. Does the Minister know that the decision can have serious effects on the conditions of work for Minister investigate this report with a view employees at present on the staffs of the hostels? As Commonwealth Hostels Limited is not an authority of the Commonwealth, would it be correct to say that present employees, including more than 300 members of the Liquor and Allied Trades Union, will lose the benefits of long service read in aviation publications, however, that leave provisions under the Commonwealth Employees' Furlough Act?

Mr Calwell.^I read it in my favourite newspaper. honourable member's secret service is better informed than usual on this particular matter. As an outcome of the operations of the Cabinet committee which has been examining a wide range of functions of government in the interests of efficiency, it has been decided, following the conspicuous success which Commonwealth Hostels Limited, an instrumentality set up by the Government, has achieved in dealing with hostels throughout the Commonwealth, that the company should include in its operations certain other hostels located in Canmerged publication is losing money? What berra. T am very conscious of and, indeed. sensitive to, the situation of honourable members who normally live in the Hotel Kurrajong, and I hope that they will have no cause for complaint as a consequence of the change that is being made. As to the rights of certain employees mentioned by the honourable member, I have not had occasion to examine that aspect of the matter. I will certainly arrange for it to be looked into promptly. It would not be the object of the Government to prejudice people who, by their normal service, have been in the process of acquiring rights in accordance with normal government policy.

Whether this proposal has gone beyond the stage of speculation I do not know. In any event, if the proposal were proceeded with, such an aircraft would not come into operation for a number of years. In the meantime, the Lockheed Neptunes with which one of our maritime squadrons is equipped remain first-class, front-line maritime reconnaissance aircraft.

Broadcasting Commission, under the relevant act, has the authority to conduct such operations as those to which the honourable member has referred. In some cases, it is necessary to refer the matter to the responsible Minister, the Postmaster-General, particularly with regard to the financing of any such project. The A.B.C. has followed that practice properly in this instance. It is true that the A.B.C. has established a journal known as "" T.V. News"" for the purpose of advertising its television programmes/ This publication is in an experimental stage, and after it has been going for three or four months it is my intention to look at its operations, particularly from the financial point of view, to see whether it should be continued. for Primary Industry a question without notice. By way of explanation, I point out that the price paid for butter on the United Kingdom market is directly influenced by seasonal conditions in the United Kingdom and Europe. For example, the low price recently paid was largely due to bountiful seasons last spring and summer. Has the Minister received any definite reports of unfavorable conditions at present existing in Europe and in the United Kingdom, which would necessarily hamper the production of all dairy produce, especially butter? favorable climatic conditions in the United Kingdom and western Europe have been received. It is, therefore, probable that the production of butter in those areas will be reduced. I should also like to state for the benefit of the House that the United Kingdom has already agreed to reduce by 40,000 tons per annum the quantity of butter imported. I think that this, together with the probable reduction of output in the United Kingdom and western Europe, should mean that prices will be somewhat better, or perhaps substantially better, than they would be if climatic conditions were normal. EGGS. Minister for Primary Industry: Is it a fact that the various egg boards have become egg-bound and are now unable to find a suitable outlet for their surplus eggs? Is it a fact that this is due to the action of many egg producers in insisting upon selling their eggs interstate? cause. I think it is probably due to the fact that the hens will keep on laying. Labour and National Service a question. In view of the serious nature of the report and recommendations made by the Senate Select Committee on indemnity payments received by maritime unions-the payments that were received for allowing ships sold to foreign buyers to be manned by non-Australian crews-doe s the Government propose to take any early action in the matter? that the committee of the Senate has done a conscientious and painstaking job of work in relation to this matter. But having regard to other matters before the Government during the last 24 hours or so, I have not yet had an opportunity to do more than skim through the concluding pages of the report. However, I have already arranged for my own department to begin a close examination of it. I shall take the first opportunity to do so myself, and I have no doubt that it is being examined also by my colleague, the Attorney-General, and by such Government departments as may be concerned. When this matter was before the Government earlier, I arranged for such facts as were in the possession of my department to be submitted to the Attorney-General for advice as to whether there was ground for legal action by way of prosecution under Commonwealth law. My department was advised by the Attorney-General at that time that no ground of action on which a successful prosecution could be based had been disclosed.

There is no requirement to that effect. On the other hand, the New Zealand immigration authorities do require naturalized Australian citizens who travel to New Zealand, intending to stay for a period of over three months, to produce an entry permit. This has to be obtained before they leave Australia. Representations were repeatedly made by my predecessors to the New Zealand Government in this respect, and the New Zealand authorities did go some way towards meeting our objections in October, 1957. I think the honourable gentleman will realize from his wide experience, however, that these matters are thoroughly within the purview of the New Zealand Government itself, although we, on our part, are most anxious that there should be no discrimination whatsoever between naturalized Australians and those born here. Nonetheless, whatever our own wishes, we have to abide by the final decree of the New Zealand Government. Social Services) -by leave-The act providing for supplementary assistance to pensioners will be proclaimed to commence on Wednesday, 15th October, and supplementary assistance will be paid on the first pension pay days following this proclamation. This means that qualifying age and invalid pensioners will be able to receive their first payment of supplementary assistance on Thursday, 23rd October, and qualifying widow pensioners on Tuesday, 28th October. Service pensioners qualifying for supplementary assistance under the Repatriation Act will be able to receive their first payment of supplementary assistance on Thursday, 16th October. The Government, in fixing the date of proclamation, necessarily took into account the administrative task involved in making payments, and I am pleased to say, Mr Speaker, has been able to bring that date forward to 15th October, which is earlier than that originally expected. Last week and to-day, a number of questions were put to me regarding the qualifications for supplementary assistance. These questions showed that considerable confusion exists in the minds of honourable members regarding the qualifications for, and the disqualifications from, the receipt of supplementary assistance, which, of course, is an entirely new form of social service benefit. In order to make the position quite clear I would like to refer to the provisions of the act, and to the principles under which 1 the Director-General will exercise the discretionary powers vested in him by this Parliament under the act. In the first place an age, invalid or widow pensioner may qualify for supplementary assistance only if the Director-General"" is satisfied that he requires supplementary assistance by reason of the fact that he pays rent and is entirely dependent on his pension "". Before the question of eligibility can arise, there must be two elements presentFirst, the pensioner must pay rent; secondly, he must be entirely dependent on bis pension. When these two elements are present it is for the Director-General to satisfy himself that the pensioner requires supplementary assistance because of them. Quite clearly, there will be cases of pensioners paying nominal rents. In such cases, though the two elements were present, it would be open to the Director-General to decide that the pensioner did not require supplementary assistance. Some discussion has occurred on the meaning of the element "" entirely dependent on his pension"". This is exclusively covered in the act-and I quote from the act"". . . . the Director-General may treat a pensioner as being entirely dependent on his pension if that pensioner is dependent on his pension to such an extent that the Director-General considers it just to do so "".",19,Passports

Where the pensioner has little means other than his pension, it would obviously be just to treat that pensioner as being entirely dependent upon his pension, and the Director-Genera] will do so. The working rule he will apply is that a single pensioner with up to 10s. a week will be considered entirely dependent on his pension. In the case of a married couple, one a pensioner, they may have up to £1 a week between them, and the pensioner will still be regarded as entirely dependent upon his pension. To clarify the position further, I might add that where a pensioner has sufficient property to cause, on the application of the means test, a reduction in the maximum rate of pension, he will not then be regarded as entirely dependent upon his pension. There may be other circumstances. It is not possible to foresee and decide, as hypothetical cases, all the combinations of a pensioner's arrangements. As already pointed out to the House by the Treasurer ( Sir Arthur Fadden) in the Budget speech and by me in my second reading speech, supplementary assistance will be payable to qualified single pensioners and to qualified married persons where only one of the couple is in receipt of a pension and the other is not in receipt of an allowance. The purpose of supplementary assistance is to relieve hardship and improve the circumstances of those who qualify. This, I am sure-and the Parliament has agreedit will do.

Air) [3.33] I move That the bill be now read a second time. The object of this short bill is to clarify the authority of chaplains to solemnize marriages under the Marriage (Overseas) Act 1955. Honourable members will recall that this act authorizes certain marriages to be performed in overseas countries that do not form part of the Queen's dominions. So far as marriages of servicemen are concerned, the act enables a marriage between parties of whom one at least is a member of the Defence Force to be solemnized in an overseas country by a chaplain. The act also validates certain marriages purported to be solemnized by chaplains in overseas countries between 3rd September, 1939, that is, the date of commencement of World War II . , and lst July, 1957, the date of commencement of Part III . of the act. "" Chaplain"" is at present defined by sec"" chaplain "" in a way which will avoid diffition 4 as"" a minister of religion who, at the time material tion and has our full support. for the purposes of this Act(a) is or was authorized by or under the law of a State or Territory of the Commonwealth to celebrate marriages in from committee without amendment or that State or Territory; and (b) is or was a member of the Defence debate; report adopted. Force "". [Quorum formed.] It has been brought to notice that this definition may be defective, as in some States and Territories a minister of religion registered as an authorized celebrant, upon ceasing to reside in the particular State or (vide page 1751), on motion by Mr. Territory, is deregistered, and is therefore McMahonno longer a person "" authorized to celebrate marriages "". It is possible that some ministers of religion who enlisted as chaplains Speaker and who left their State or Territory in the course of service duties were deregistered in this way. A doubt therefore arises whether the marriages purported to be validated by section 16 have in fact all been validated, as some of the chaplains may not have been authorized to celebrate marriages at the relevant time. The same doubt may arise in the future with regard to marriages solemnized by chaplains pursuant to section 1.4 of the Marriage (Overseas) Act. This bill inserts a new and more appropriate definition of "" chaplain "", which will avoid the difficulties referred to. The authority of a chaplain to perform functions under the act will, under this definition, be dependent solely upon his appointment as a chaplain in the defence forces. Provisions have been included in the bill to validate marriages already performed by chaplains both in the 1939-57 period and in the period between the date of commencement of Part III . of the principal act and the date of commencement of this bill. There is nothing contentious in this measure; it is designed purely to remove the doubts referred to. I commend the bill to honourable members.

However, the Minister for Primary Indusexplanatory second-reading speech. I concede that the industry to which this bill applies is an important one and justifies a lengthy explanation of what is intended by legislation that is presented to the House. However, shortly, the purpose of the bill is to give effect to a desire of the dairy farmers to pay a levy into a fund, which will be under the administration of an authority and which will be expended on research work relating to the dairying industry and on promoting the sale of butter and cheese in Australia. No one can quarrel with those objectives. Indeed, the situation to-day is such that research work in any industry is always justified. One could say that possibly all governments, if they could manage it, would like to see more money spent on research work. In this instance, the Government is not committed to very much. It will make no contribution to the money that will be spent on research, but, in regard to that portion of the total levy receipts, estimated at £250,000, which on a recommendation of the Australian Dairy Produce Board is to be devoted to sales promotion, the Government has made a verbal commitment that it will contribute on a £l-for-£l basis. No one can take exception to those proposals. However, in a situation in which the dairymen in every part of the Commonwealth are working under serious economic disabilities and are clamouring for additional assistance, this mere contribution from the Government of an amount not to exceed £1 for every £1 spent on sales promotion is exceedingly meagre and inadequate. In fact, it is paltry. If we are to take the Goit. With that end in view, I announced in vernment at its word from time to time over the years, its objective has been to ensure that dairymen would not receive a total income less than that related to the general standard of living and approved by the people generally in Australia. But no steps are taken to ensure that happy state of affairs. I have a particular interest in this industry. For years, I worked in it. For years, I was the victim of the lack of such consideration by governments as would enable dairymen to obtain an income related to the contribution that they made to the food requirements of the community and to the earning of export income in order to assist Australia to pay for essential imports. I well recollect the depressed state of the industry in the years preceding World War II. Conditions were deplorable, especially for a seven-days-a-week industry. They were deplorable for a variety of reasons. Not the least was the fact that at that period of our history there were still in Australia about 240,000 persons officially recorded as unemployed. Their purchasing power was quite inadequate to provide everything needed for themselves and their families. any one doubts thefiguresthat I cite, let me say that I took them from a report of a statement made by the Prime Minister in the Melbourne Town Hall shortly after war broke out. In war-time, of course, governments were compelled to realize that the dairying industry was essential to Australia's war effort. As the war progressed, the industry became more important than ever, and it was able to make a magnificent contribution to the United Kingdom food supplies. It was because of this fact, and a realization that those who make a contribution to the economic welfare of the country should be adequately rewarded, that during the period when the Labour government held the reins of office steps were taken to ensure that the producing elements in the community were more adequately rewarded But with peace in sight, it was determined that in the post-war period this industry should be established on a stabilized basis, and that an adequate return for their labours should be guaranteed to workers in this Parliament on about 22nd November, 1946, that the Labour government had appointed a committee empowered to inquire into and ascertain the cost of production of butter in Australia.

Its chairman, was no less distinguished an individual than the chairman of the Bureau of Agricultural Economics, Mr Crawford, who is now, of course, the Secretary of the Department of Trade. The committee included representatives of the dairying industry. In addition, there were representatives of the Treasury, the then Prices Branch and the Department of Commerce and Agriculture. By July of 1947 the committee was able to supply to the Bureau of Agricultural Economics figures collected from dairy farms all over Australia, and on those figures the bureau was able to work out a cost of production on the average, reasonably efficient dairy farm. for management? ber for Richmond asks how much we allowed for management. That is quite a fair question. Let me say, first, that before this investigation took place nothing at. all was allowed for management. Awards in the industry were completely unknown, either for management, for the workers or for anybody else concerned. The committee's report with respect to the allowance for management was unanimous, and, as I said, the personnel of the committee included representatives of the industry itself. The basis that the committee recommended for the computation of management allowance was the dairying industry award, an. award fixed by a competent authority. Let it not be forgotten that costs of production and award rates of pay in any industry were then substantially lower than they are now. The recommendation was that the management allowance should be equivalent to the rate fixed in the award for a leading hand. Whatever criticism may be offered as to the inadequacy of that allowance-and I think it would be widely agreed that it was not as generous as it should have been-a t least it was a marked improvement on anything hitherto known in this industry.. If honourable members would like to know the circumstances of this industry prior to World War II., let me quote, first, from an article which appeared in the Melbourne ""Argus"" on 12th July, 1944The dairying industry began the war with a. bad was when the recommendation was made reputation, for low and unstable prices, which made by the dairying industry costing authority. it the agricultural ""Cinderella"" and were the cause of bad wages, and long hours. The late Mr Anthony made a statement in this Parliament in 1938 which was one of the most damning indictments of pre-war governments, or any governments, with regard to neglect and lack of consideration for this most essential industry. He saidOut of 12,275 dairy-farmers in Queensland, only 99 had taxable incomes last year in excess of £250. The late Mr Anthony said that he had received his information from the Queensland taxation commissioner. So, in answering the question by the honourable member for Richmond as to how much the farmers were allowed for management, let me say that this was the first time in history that any step of this kind was taken-to make some allowance for the management of a dairy farm. It is quite true that when this measure was re-enacted in 1952, or, in fact, before that, the government which succeeded the Labour government made some increases in the managerial allowance used in computing the cost of production of butter-and righdy so. Those changes had the ardent support of honourable members on this side of the House. When honourable members are inclined to criticize the fixing of an award wage as a basis for managerial allowance, let it never be forgotten that the dairying industry had accepted that award. Probably those engaged in the industry had given evidence before the authority which fixed the award, and no doubt they considered it adequate and said that it was good enough. Probably, therefore, what was sauce fbr the goose was sauce for the gander, so I do not think there is much to be. gained by arguing about the amount allowed for management, expenses. Costs in the industry have skyrocketed in the last ten years,, and the £1,035 allowed at present for management allowance when computing the cost of production of butter is not so very much more generous than the allowance in those early years. I agree that it is no more than enough. days? leading hand's rate under the dairying industry award. I think it was about £300odd.

I know that honourable gentlemen sitting in the corner, after exercising power for more than a quarter of a century and, in many cases, participating in coalition governments, are green with envy because a Labour goverament was the first to introduce a plan guaranteeing the dairying industry of Australia a price for its products. It did so not only on the product produced, sold and consumed in Australia but on the whole of our dairy products that were exported. sound it. But I do not know that that is a very sound argument. I am simply stating a fact. Time went on. Pledges had been made by representatives of the Australian Country party and the coalition government that when the Labour government's plan expired, they would renew it. They did so. A bill was introduced into this House in 1952. The Government drafted a measure guaranteeing to the farmers a return based on cost of production, but there was one vital difference. Those who had been critical, as they still are, about the allowance made in computing' the cost of producing a pound of butter, and those who had something to say about other factors in the computation were confronted with the fact that the Government had made a vital alteration in the 1952 legislation which was supposed to be based on most of the principles intromarket at any price they could get and at duced by the Labour government. The Menzies Government proposed to guarantee to the industry the found cost of production price on all butter and cheese consumed in Australia, and on one-fifth of that quantity that might be exported. The end result of that is to be found in government guaranteed whatever the the situation which confronted Australia last year and will confront it again: The availability for export to London of a very great tonnage of butter and cheese which is absolutely unguaranteed as to price. I have made a rough calculation, and I ' believe that, in the last butter yeaT, about 3.i;,00.0 tons of butter was exported overseas without, guarantee, and we: had to take that time, exports did not represent 20 per whatever the. overseas price happened to be. In the forthcoming year-if the season turns out as we anticipate and Australia produces 220,000 tons of butter-it i i likely that 76,000 tons of butter could be landed on the London market absolutely without guarantee. That is after allowing for the 20 per cent, as a guaranteed export portion of our production. Those 76,000 tons might be sold at a price around 2s. per lb. when the cost of production in Australia, according to accepted figures, is about 4s. 3d. per lb. Is it any wonder that, for the first time, the corner party which has supported this present Governmenta government that has been, so niggardly in renewing the plan and quibbled over the computation for managerial allowance and similar calculations:-is embarrassed. Members of the Australian Country party now know that, because of the inability of the Government to guarantee the found cost of production price for all butter and cheese produced in Australia, the dairymen are now landed with a> fall in the London butter price and are in an. uneconomic position. pared to subsidize butter exports? about that in the proper time. You members of the Australian Country party are supporters of this Government. You are the people who twice-in 1952 and 1957 -tolerate d a situation in which the people you allegedly represent, including great numbers of dairy-farmers, were faced with the sale of tons of butter on the London a return far below the cost of production in Australia. under a Labour government. returns were in London, India or China, for the whole of the butter and cheese produced in Australia.

They have exceeded 20 per cent, of the portion consumed locally at various periods. Anyhow, there is no justification for this Government not providing against that eventuality. It arose before the introduction of the 1957 re-enactment of the plan. Now, the Government is confronted with people who are very angry indeed and realize that they have been deceived. What do we find now? The members of the Australian Country party have been embarrassed and have recently brought pressure on their colleagues in the Menzies Government. The Minister for Primary Honourable gentlemen in the Australian Country party corner have been upset. It was announced in the press to-day that they had obtained what is allegedly a concession. If it can be so described, it is a miserable concession, but those who do not there is a difference of opinion between the understand the situation could very well be honourable member for Macarthur ( Mr Jeff deceived.

103,Mr Pollard,"I am glad to see thatwhich, ultimately, they would have got in any case. There is nothing wrong with the plan, but if the dairy-farmers imagine that they will get any more for their butter than they would have got without the Government's action they have another think coming. Very few people know how this price is assessed. I know that Australian Country party members who are interjecting are uncomfortable about this matter because the dairy-farmers are not going to get any more. The Australian Dairy Produce Board has said that they will get 40d. per lb. anyhow. All that will happen is that they will get 3d. per lb. a few months before they would have got it in any case. The only risk that the Government takes is of a catastrophe happening and the London market deteriorating further from what is probably an alltime low. It is a mighty poor government that would not be prepared to take that risk. Mr Jeff BateI agree with that. payment of that 3d. per lb. in advance of the time at which the farmers would get it, anyhow. But I want to dispel the idea that is prevalent in the minds of some people that it will be an extra payment in the final wash-up. The position of the industry remains as critical and as chronic as it was prior to this action being taken. The industry has been disgracefully treated. It has not been treated in line with the promises that have been made to it. The present Minister for Trade and Commerce-whe n introducing a measure to put the 1952 plan into operation, saidThere have been talks of dear food policy and representing Western Australia, South Auscheap food policy. This Government embraces tralia and Tasmania. neither objective. Its policy is to ensure, for an industry which comes within its jurisdiction, a return for the producers designed to give them the same standards of living as are enjoyed by the rest of the community, believing that in this way only will expanded production be assured. I am sure that those workers who expect to have their wages automatically adjusted in accordBranch, supported a cost recommendation ance with movements of cost of living and the genera] national trends and those merchants who expect to be able to adjust the selling price of their products in accordance with their costs of production, will in neither case wish to deny to dairy farmers an adjustment of their return related to a realistic calculation of the cost of efficient production. That is what this measure is designed to assure. In the same speech, the Minister announced that the guarantee would only cover a proportion of the production of butter and cheese in Australia and that the situation would be left as it remains to-day. Last year about 30,000 tons of butter were left to the hazards of the world market. This year it could be 60,000 tons. It is no use Country party members talking to me about it. They supported the Government which, in 1952, was responsible for the departure from Labour's policy. That policy, if still in operation, would have ensured that the dairy-farmers had the living standards to which the then Minister for Trade and Commerce said, in 1952, that they were entitled. found cost in 1947? information for the honourable member, although he knows it as well as I do. He will quibble about halfpennies when today's problem is one of millions. Let us have the facts, clean and straight. The chairman of the Joint Dairy Industry Advisory Committee in 1947 was Mr J. G. Crawford, and nobody could ever accuse Mr Crawford of being other than impartial. He represented the Bureau of Agricultural Economics. The committee also included Mr C. Sheehy, Controller of Dairy Products; Mr W. S. Kelly, Commonwealth Prices Branch; Mr P. W. Nette, Department of the Treasury; Mr A. Spencer, Department of Commerce and Agriculture; Mr G. C.

109,Mr Pollard,"We are all in agreealong very well. The minority report recommended a price of 2s. per lb. Let us analyse the facts. First of all, the four people who were associated with government departments had no personal vested interest in the industry whatsoever. Mr Howey, Mr Plunkett, Mr Sheehy and Mr Norton had a personal interest, if not a vested interest, in the industry, and, no doubt, felt that they could go for the higher figure. The government accepted the recommendation of 2s. per lb. and the industry was mighty happy about it. Mr Howey, who was president of the Victorian Dairymen's Association and chairman of the Australian Dairy Produce Board, notwithstanding the fact that he had recommended a price of 2s. l i d . , said this when the new price was put into operationI have never seen the dairying industry with a brighter future. That statement was reported in the "" V i c torian Dairy Farmer"" of November, 1947. Mr R. C. Gibson, president of the New Union, in 1948. when the plan was operating, saidDairy farmers can now look ahead and plan for the future, secure in the knowledge that their returns will be related to their production costs. In.other words, everybody was happy. I could quote numerous statements and refer to numerous letters in glowing terms which I received at that period expressing great satisfaction with that great scheme which has set the standard ever since. But the scheme has been shamefully departed from since 1952. At this critical stage in the industry's history the Government is proposing to increase the interim payment by 3d. The honourable member for Macarthur ( Mr Jeff Bate) is interjecting that the Customs Tariff Amendment (No. 7); Customs Tariff Amendment (No. 8); Customs Tariff (New Zealand Preference) Amendment (No. 4); Customs Tariff (Papua and New Guinea Preference) Amendment (No. 2). In Committee of Ways and Means: [Customs Tariff Amendment (No. 7).] 1.

Apparently this bill has been introduced as a sop to provide for research and sales propaganda. The Opposition favours this move, but the Government is only playing with the problems confronting the industry. Under existing circumstances the more the farmers produce, the greater will be their losses. The more they export, the lower will be their returns. Sales promotion should bring some assistance to the industry. If a vigorous campaign, handled by the right people, increased the consumption of butter in Australia by 2 lb., 3 lb., or 4 lb. per head, the problem would be largely solved. I concede that. That is something in which I believe. If it pays to advertise all sorts of quack medicines on the radio and on television, it should pay the dairying industry to advertise butter. The Government is amply justified in supporting such sales propaganda. The situation confronting the dairying South Wales Primary Producers industry to-day would not have been as bad as it is if the cost of living had not been spiralling over the last ten years, as has been emphasized in the last few years by the unemployment position. To some degree the problem can be alleviated by increasing the purchasing power of the people and by encouraging the sale of butter instead of margarine and other products. The Opposition supports the bill. I express the ardent hope that, to the extent that it is possible to help the industry at present, the proposals that have been outlined by the Minister will be successful.

Mr Chairman, the Customs Tariff Proposals which I have just introduced propose to amend the schedules to the Customs Tariff 1933-1958, to the Customs Tariff (New Zealand Preference) 1933-1958 and to the Customs Tariff (Papua and New Guinea Preference) 1936-1958. The new provisions will come into operation at 9 o'clock to-morrow morning. In the main, the alterations are based on recommendations made by the Tariff Board in its reports on fresh vegetables, on cotton sheeting and on thioglycollic acid and its salts. I shall at a later hour table the relevant reports of the board. A sliding-scale duty is proposed on fresh frozen peas and beans. Duty will be imposed only when the free on board price is below ls. lOid. per lb. and the amount of duty payable will increase as the price of the vegetables decreases below that figure. Another amendment proposed relates to synthetic, are being reduced from 4d. to 2d. cotton sheeting of the type ordinarily used per lb. regardless of the origin of the goods. in the manufacture of bed sheets and pillow A by-law item is also proposed so as to cases. The Tariff Board has recommended permit duty free entry of rubber and rubber increased rates of duty on plain or matt latex subject to satisfactory arrangements woven sheeting and on twill sheeting.

Before the board's admitted duty free. findings on cotton sheeting can be implemented in full, it will be necessary for Auscompounded rubber and compounded tralia to negotiate with certain overseas rubber latexfixesthe rates on these products countries.

Rate of Duty. 330 Rubber including latex, natural, to which sub-item (A) of item . . . . . . . Free"" give effect in the main to the Tariff Board's findings. On thioglycollic acid and its salts, the Tariff Board has recommended protective duties of 10 per cent. British Preferential Tariff and 22i per cent, otherwise. The board has pointed out that the local industry is worthy of assistance and that the new duties, if adopted, should have little effect on prices to the consumer. Honourable members may recall that on 17th October, last, I tabled in this chamber Tariff Proposals relating to duties on natural and synthetic rubber and rubber latex. I stated at the time that the Tariff Board had recommended a greater reduction in the rates of duty on these goods than was actually adopted by the Government. The Government feels that the full reduction can now be made and the duties on rubber and rubber latex, whether natural or The amendment proposed in respect of torawrubber and rubber latex. The new duties are 2id. per lb. under the substantive tariff item and i d . per lb. when the goods are admissible at by-law rates. The action now being taken in respect of rubber is in accordance with the terms of the recent trade agreement between Australia and the Federation of Malaya. The remaining amendments proposed by Customs Tariff Proposals No. 7 are made primarily for administrative reasons. It is proposed to reduce the Intermediate Tariff and General Tariff rates, on smaller capacity cream separators from 12i per cent, to 7 i per cent, ad valorem, which is the rate now applicable to centrifugal separators as -used in the clarifying of oils, varnish and other liquids. This action will simplify the tariff structure. Another administrative amendment provides by-law items enabling the Minister to approve admission at by-law rates of duty of certain drugs and chemicals which are imported packed for retail sale. These items would be applied to certain medical preparations which are of a type not commercially packed .or manufactured in this country. Customs -Tariff (New Zealand Preference) Proposals No. 4 is complementary to Customs Tariff Proposals No. 7 and provides for the admission of fresh frozen peas and fresh frozen beans which are the agreed toproduce of New Zealand at the same rates as are proposed under the British PreferenactThat tial Tariff. Customs Tariff Proposals No. 8 applies the British Preferential Tariff rates to goods of Australian origin which are exported and returned to this country. Generally, returned Australian goods which comply Air) [4.28].;-by leave I movewith certain prescribed conditions are admissible free of duty under Item 401 (A).

Hewitt, First Assistant Secretary, Budget and Accounting Branch, Department of the Treasury, the honourable member for Warringah ( Mr adopted in the previous financial year. It Bland), who is chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, and Mr R. C. Davey, secretary of the Public Accounts Committee. The relative merits of the five standard sizes, from foolscap folio to royal octavo, have been discussed at length by the committee, and the further the investigation progressed the more evident became the need for a thorough investigation of the problems involved. That is a very short summary, Sir, of the such a serious drop. Just as the labourer work done by the committee during the year. It included, among other things-, a visit to the Government Printing Office, and the formation of several sub-committees, which interviewed the Government Printer on occasions other than those that I have just mentioned. The committee has reached : general agreement on the need for standardization of parliamentary papers and official reports, and recommends that in the new Parliament an investigation should be made as to what size or sizes should Question resolved in the affirmative. Second Reading. Debate resumed (vide page 1834). Mr Deputy Speaker, those honourable members who represent dairying constituencies are a little more pleased than was the honourable member for Lalor( Mr Pollard) at the Government's announcement that the prices paid to dairy-farmers for butter and cheese will be increased. The circumstances leading to this increase were that, last year, although the cost of production, as worked out by a body called the Dairy Industry Investigation Committee, taking into account all other rising costs, was found to be 51d. per lb., or something of that order, the averaging of the low export returns and that figure resulted in the farmer receiving a return of 44d., or 86 per cent, of the found cost of production. In July, at the beginning of the current financial year, the Commonwealth Dairy Produce Equalization Committee Limited, as the honourable member for Lalor has pointed out, adopted the rate of 37d a rate much lower than the one that it had is well known, Sir, to all of us who have anything to do with dairying, and to the honourable member for Lalor, that the unit of time taken-on e year-create s a most embarrassing situation at the beginning of a new financial year, because the equalization committee has to be most conservative. I think the honourable member for Lalor will agree that it is becoming apparent that some mechanism ought to be found to avoid is worthy of his hire, so the farmer is worthy of the money he receives, and it ought to be fairly evenly distributed throughout the year. At the beginning of last year, the farmers received a price of about 41d. At the end of three months, it",34,Customs Tariff Validation

115,Mr Dean (Robertson),by leave I,35,Dairy Produce Research And Sales Promotion Bill 1958
116,Mr Jeff Bate (Macarthur) [4.33],"was found possible to increase that price. This year, because of the competition which was referred to quite accurately by the honourable member for Lalor, the interim price was 37d. Immediately after that was fixed, the price in London rose, due to action which was taken by the United Kingdom Government, particularly in the interests of New Zealand, and which will have a pretty permanent effect. The price in England rose by 3d. per lb. On 30th September it was discovered that production in Australia will not be as high as 220,000 tons, or 16,000 tons above the record production, as was forecast by the equalization committee. There are not as many cows, the season started indifferently, and even where there has been good rain and there is good feed, production is not as high as was expected. After the first three months of the financial year, it is now thought that production will be only 200.000 tons, so that not so much will have to be exported at the low price. We have therefore decided that the farmer should benefit from the confidence we feel by receiving immediately a price of 40d., which is still 4d. below last year's price. It was thought that he ought to be protected against the rise and fall. Eventually he will probably receive a little more. The yield ought to be about 4Id. I think the honourable member for Lalor, in his calmer moments, would agree with that contention, although he began to express a little irritation because we had thought of it first and had taken action. In a critical vein, he said, "" They have indemocracy that rugged independence which creased the price by 3d."". He was trying to engender a little heat into the debate, but he could not, and I am glad of that. I am sorry that he later used these words, "" The industry is in a critical and chronic state and has been treated disgracefully"". I do not think that that comment is deserved. As a matter of fact, everybody in Parliament and everywhere else has been saying that we have been fortunate in that we have been having a good time in Australia. It could not last. It had to finish; and it has finished now. The price in London fell at the beginning of this financial year from over 400s. per cwt. to 205s. per cwt. Now it has recovered slighdy to 234s. We are face to face with a butter crisis, not only in Australia but throughout the world. Everybody has stressed the importance of this industry; there is no need to labour that aspect. We know that it has an enormous purchasing power. The people who depend on it number 600,000. An amount of £700,000,000 is invested in it, plus £50,000,000 in the factories. It is one of the most important industries in Australia, and therefore it becomes most important politically. One cannot ignore a part of the social fabric in which such a great number of families are involved. It is an industry in which there is a great number of modest land holdersa condition which I have always understood to be most desirable in any community. They are men who do their own work in healthy and magnificent places in which to raise young Australians. Statistics show that two-thirds of the natural increase in our population come from the country area, and one-third from the cities. The country area accepts double its responsibility for peopling the country, and the cities accept half of their responsibility. Half of the people of Australia are in the cities, but two-thirds of the future reservoir of people come from the country. They are magnificent, well-nourished, healthy young people raised on small or modest pieces of land. All the philosophers who have contemplated a society have said that the small or modest land holder is one of the best members of the community. As the honourable member for Robertson ( Mr Dean) so aptly says, the yeomanry of England has given England and British is so important. They are men who are devoted to their country, who are sane and capable of keeping the same government that we enjoy in a British democracy. I think that the modest land holder makes a greater contribution to the political stability of a country than does any other group of people. A second important point is that the labour component of the price that is being given for butter is high. It is nearly 50 per cent., and sometimes it is just over 50 per cent. If the trade unionists quite rightly go to the arbitration court and demand a wage of £13 or £14 a week, with an average wage of £20 a week, it is not too much to ask that the dairy-farmer also should get a reasonable price. What we have done is to ensure to the dairy-farmer that the price, now set at 37d., will reach 40d., which will at least give him confidence and heart to go on. He has to continue in a crucial atmosphere, but not a "" chronic "" atmosphere. That word, which was used by the honourable member for Lalor, is not accurate, because the industry has been prosperous for the last few months. This is a period in which some quick steps have had to be taken, and they have been taken. The Government has taken them at the correct moment in bringing forward this bill for sales promotion and research in the dairying industry. Some people criticize very vigorous research by saying that there will be overproduction. I put it to the House that production will be not greater, but more efficient. If we can grow more grass on the same area with the aid of irrigation and the research of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization, and particularly of the phytotron, the carrying capacity of many farms will be doubled. When that is achieved, the farmers will have the ability to diversify. They can go over to beef production. The honourable member for Eden-Monaro( Mr Allan Fraser) will probably recollect from driving along the Bega valley that in that area are quite a number of beef herds. The larger properties are able to swing over tp beef very quickly. Those men who do some dealing can buy beef stock instead of dairy stock. So, almost immediately there can be a swing-over if we are forced to export butter at the price which we are now realizing in London. Nobody on this side of the House, I hope-certainl y not I-wil l say that we are over-producing, but it would be wrong at this stage for any enthusiastic State to push on with closer settlement which involved a large number of dairy farms. I can quite understand the dilemma of the Premier of Victoria, who believes that his State is a great dairying State and finds that settlement on dairy farms at £20,000 a unit is cheaper than settiement on other types products of the dairying industry. of farms which are capitalized at about £30,000. The dairy-farmers, and all other intelligent people in Victoria, are impressing on the Premier that if he increases the number of dairy-farmers, he will endanger the future not only of the men he settles, but also of all other dairy-farmers in Australia, While we are speaking of Victoria, let me say it is quite wrong to think that, because a State is favoured, as Victoria is favoured, in climate and soil, it should be the only dairying State. The industry throughout Australia has a tremendous task. First, there is the duty of providing whole milk for citizens, and particularly for young people, including that which is supplied under the free milk scheme which operates through the bounty of this Government. One could not contemplate conveying milk from Victoria to Western Australia or northern Queensland. There has to be a dairying industry in position at all the great consuming points to provide whole milk. I think that 20 per cent, of the total production goes into whole milk. Anxiety is felt because of a new departure called filled milk, which, I understand, is made from dried milk or skim milk powder, with the addition of some vegetable oils. This has become quite a competitor with whole milk, but only in such countries as the Philippines and India, where people are short of food and where there is no dairying industry. Athletes from those countries who came to the Olympic village in Victoria drank huge quantities of whole milk whenever they could get it. We have had word from London that people who have taken one mouthful of filled milk will not touch it again if they can get whole milk, because whole milk is so much superior. teurized milk, as delivered in the ordinary way to people in suburban areas. I refer to the whole milk trade as opposed to manufactured products like cheese, butter and ice cream. Whole milk and the rest of the products of the dairying industry have contributed in no small way to the vigour and stamina of this community, and all of us are proud that our athletes have done so well because they are well nourished and have had the advantage of the nutritious I happen to be secretary of a body known as the Government Members Food and Agricultural Committee. It consists of about 40 members of this Parliament of whom nineteen meet regularly to examine",35,Dairy Produce Research And Sales Promotion Bill 1958
117,Mr Coutts,What is whole milk?,37,Dairy Produce Research And Sales Promotion Bill 1958
118,Mr Jeff Bate,"It is fresh or pasconditions in the rural industries. We have given close attention to the crisis in which the dairying industry finds itself through no fault of its own. A t the request of the honourable member for Barker( Mr Forbes) who is an enthusiastic member of the committee, I shall read some of the proposals put to us which are concurrent with, and parallel to, those laid down by the Minister in his speech, and which are quite exciting for people interested in the research side of the industry. These things are important now, although they have not been important up to the last few months, because up till then we were selling our products freely. The time of crisis had not arrived. We had not had to face the barrier as we have to now. At a conference between members of the committee and representatives of the dairying industry, Mr Eric Roberts, president of the Australian Dairy Farmers Federation, put four points which the committee adopted. They were1. Action by the States to review land developearlier because we had not run up against ment policies which would enable new settlers to go in for fat lambs, wool or beef rather than dairying. 2. Action through the Australian Agricultural Council to effectively control the sale of margarine in competition with butter. 3. No reduction, at least, in the dairy industry subsidy until the financial position of dairy farmers improves. That subsidy amounts to £13,500,000 this year, no small contribution by the Government, and very much greater than came from the government in which the honourable member for Lalor was Minister for Commerce and Agriculture. The cash costs of butter, which are about ls. 3d. per Ib., are paid in half by the Government, which contributes 7 i d . per lb. computed on last year's figures. The fourth point put by Mr Roberts was4. Industry action to develop new and better dairy products, and a national dairy products sales promotion campaign. There is, of course, the intention to conduct research into the industry. It is quite obvious that the people who market margarine have been intensely advertising their product, and have been able to increase consumption very substantially. Against that, there has been little advertising of butter and dairy products except in Victoria. In other words, the substitute for butter is being advertised, and I think the margarine people have gone pretty close to the point of infringing the ethics of advertising, because usually the substitute is pictured as coming from Jersey cows feeding on very good pastures as if to say to people, "" Here you are getting something that is a product of the dairying industry"". As a general rule, however, only a very small part of the product derives from the dairying industry, Most of it comes from vegetable oil and animal fats. SoI think that that kind of advertising is very unfair. However, that fact does not take away from the dairying industry its responsibility to advertise its product. I am glad to see that this bill authorizes the imposition on all butter and cheese manufactured in Australia of a statutory levy of a maximum of f \ d . per lb. on butter and & d . per lb. on cheese to finance the promotion of sales of these great natural foods and of any other dairy products coming within the purview of the proposal. This may not have been important the problems we have met in the last few months due to the great fall in the demand for our products on the London market. We now realize, as we have been told so many times before, that the home market is the valuable market-the market where people are sure to buy at least 110,000 tons of butter a year, and a market that ought to be increased. The New Zealand Government has always tried to encourage butter consumption by paying a very heavy subsidy. The price of butter there has been 2s. 6d. per lb. and consumption has been 42 lb. a head. During the war, butter rationing brought Australian consumption of butter down to 24 lb. per head. When the present beneficent Government lifted rationing as soon as it took office in 1950, consumption rose to 32 lb. per head. It is now down, however, to 26 lb. per head. Probably our community is ageing, and older people do not require butter so much as young people do. The consumption of margarine is, I think, about 8.4 lb. per head. The money raised under the legislation, and the committee to administer the promotion and research scheme proposed in the measure, will be used to make certain that people are aware of the value of that great natural food, butter, and its importance in the diet. It will also help to do away with some of the silly notions going around that butter is harmful. After all, the countries which are the greatest consumers of butter are the countries with the healthiest populations. Germany and Denmark both found during the last war that nauonai morale was most terribly damaged as a result of an insufficiency of fats in the diet of the population. As a matter of fact, that insufficiency of fats may have been an important cause of the collapse of Germany. A deficiency of butter in the diet, the Germans found, caused night blindness and bad eyesight generally, but the most important effect was the drop in the morale of the people. Now those countries are trying to reap the benefit of the lesson they learned during the war. Consumption of butter in West Germany is 18 lb. per head and of margarine 28 lb. per head. Consumption of fats in Denmark is 60 lb. per head. Those two countries, which learned of the dangers inherent in a reduced consumption of fats, increased their fat consumption immediately they were able to do so. For our people to be vigorous and healthy there must be a high consumption of fats. We are very pleased, indeed, with the proposals in the bill for a promotion and research scheme for the dairying industry. There is no need for me to deal at length with the Minister's speech. The plan covers work in four main directions. As stated by the Minister, these areA research programme, providing a continuing study of the efTorts to get better markets and of consumer buying habits and product improvement. We notice that in Canberra butter is called a "" loss leader "" in the shops. Some Canberra shops are charging 3s. l l i d . per lb. for butter in order to entice the housewife to come into the shop in the hope that she will buy other articles while she is there buying her butter. So butter is a most important part of even the sales programme of retail stores. The second feature mentioned by the Minister wasA public relations programme using magazines, articles, and television and providing material to sections of the community able to influ[4.57] -The Australian dairy-farmers have ence others on the wisdom, economy and pleasure served this country very well both in peace afforded by dairy foods in the diet. Mr Coombs, the Queensland manager of the community and greatly added to its of Butter Board Proprietary Limited, has a economic strength. But except for the school which teaches women how to use butter in cooking. That school is tremendously popular, and is, I believe, playing a big part in sales promotion. The fourth point in the plan mentioned by the Minister isAn advertising programme to give inducement to the public to take action to buy the products of the industry as supplied to the retailer, and finally a merchandising programme to get greater buying and selling action where the product is sold. The honourable member for Lalor says that even if we consumed only five more pounds of butter per head per year that would take up the slack. That would be a magnificent result. the slack. enough of the slack to get us out of trouble. Once a surplus was built up through the industry, should a dry season hit us, we would be able to provide sufficient butter for the whole community without having to import any. The whole industry is happy with what the Government has done, as announced by the Minister to-day. It has a feeling that this proposal will provide something solid and substantial. Once again on behalf of the Government members' food and agriculture committee, I give an assurance that we will do everything possible to assist the industry to get on a sound basis. Undoubtedly, a call for greater production will come with the expansion of population. It was the Government's intention to provide £7,000,000 for this purpose through the proposed Development Bank. but. unfortunately, the legislation to establish that bank was blocked by the Opposition in the Senate. However, after 30th June next year, when the Government regains control of the Senate, that plan will be put into operation. But before then there will be a tremendous amount of discussion with the industry so that we can bring in these new diversifications which will be in keeping with the dairy production that we want so much and which is so important to this community. and in war.

121,Mr Allan Fraser (Eden,"Monaro)-period in which the honourable member for Lalor( Mr Pollard) was Minister for Commerce and Agriculture, the dairy-farmers have never received justice from the Australian community. That is due, very largely, to the fact that, traditionally, they have given their political loyalty to the nonas it now seems in retrospect, quite Labour parties. In Victoria they have supported the Country party, and in New South Wales, chiefly the Liberal party. Although those parties have accepted the support of the dairv-farmers, never, at any time, have any of them taken any practical step to improve the position of the dairying industry. The result has been that whilst all other sections of the Australian community had their standards advanced, the dairy-farmers remained completely unprotected and unassisted. In their industry they had to work seven days a week; wife and child labour was essential in order to make ends meet and, unfortunately, according to the oftquoted statement of the former member for Richmond, practically none of them had a taxable income equal to the basic wage of those days. I think the figures quoted by the former honourable member for Richmond showed that in the year 1938, of 12.000 dairy-farmers in Queensland, fewer than 100 had a taxable income of £250 a year. It was not until the advent of the Federal Labour government in which the honourable member for Lalor was Minister for Commerce and Agricultrue, that the dairying industry, for the first time, began to get justice and a fair deal from the Australian community. Labour Minister for Commerce and Agriculture. honourable member for that correction. The honourable member for Lalor was preceded in that office by the former honourable member for Gwydir. The Labour government applied to the dairying industry the same concepts of justice for which, as a political organization, it had striven over the years for those who were its own particular supporters. So, the dairying industry obtained its own arbitration system and an improvement in conditions so remarkable that for the first time dairy-farmers, in common with all other sections of the Australian community, were guaranteed that they would receive at least the cost of their work and effort in the production of the butter and cheese so urgently required both by this nation and by our allies in the war at that time. It is quite true that there were minor and, quibbling objections raised concerning the amount of the guarantee price for the farmer, whether it should have been 2s. or 2s. Oid., and as to the amount of the managerial allowance in the calculation of the cost of production on a farm. There might have been some merit in the contentions of that kind advanced, but the fact is that, compared with a period of complete injustice extending over many years in which the industry was so depressed that those dependent upon it had only a bare existence, well below the Australian standard of living, it received for the first time at least a substantial measure of justice and, in general terms, the costs of production were guaranteed. That happy state of affairs continued until the ill-starred return in 1949 of the Menzies Fadden Government, which destroyed the basis of the scheme of protection established for the industry by the Curtin and Chifley Labour governments. That came about in 1952 with the restriction of the export price guarantees to a quantity of dairy produce equal to only 20 per cent, of the sales upon the home market. From that day onwards, although the dairying industry may have enjoyed a period of prosperity and reasonably good prices, it has never had a secure basis of justice. The Government of that day took away from it the great prop which had formerly been given to it by the Labour government. From that time onwards the dairying industry was once again separated from the organized Australian working community in that it, and it alone in the organized working community of Australia, was denied the assurance of an Australian standard of living and of a return equal to the work and effort involved in its production. price guaranteed to it in its overseas trade department.

I thought the honourable member for Macarthur ( Mr Jeff Bate) was quite fair and reasonable in his explanation of the factors governing the increase of 3d. per lb. in the interim payment for butter, which was announced today. But the position as stated by the honourable member for Macarthur is quite different from the impression given in .the publicity accorded to the governmental decision. It indicated quite clearly that this represented an additional 3d. per lb. for the producers of butter, whereas, of course, as the honourable member for Lalor pointed out, and as the honourable member for Macarthur clearly recognizes, it means nothing of the sort. It does not mean an extra farthing a pound for the producer of butter; all that it means is that he will get an extra 3d. per lb. a little earlier than he otherwise would have got it. But no difference whatever is likely to be made to the final price that he receives. down or consumption drops, the price could be affected. say, remote contingency opinion. I think this price is fixed conservatively and with a general recognition that it will be no less than the final price able to be paid for the season. penny is the .conservative price. less one or an unfair one? Sir Earle Page -No, they will get more than that. right honourable member for Cowper says, it will be more, and you will have to accept that position. Sir Earle Page -It does it every year; it has been doing it for 30 or 40 years. -Order! The honourable member should direct his remarks to the Chair. honourable member for Cowper said, this is .nothing new. All that is happening is that it is being paid a Utde earlier than previously. To make political capital out of it, or to deceive the farmer into believing -that he is now by this means receiving a real increase in the price he would otherwise receive for his product, is' entirely wrong. One of the most important ways in which the Government could help the dairying industry, and in which I am sure the government elected after 22nd November will assist it, is by providing higher purchasing power for the families of Australia. The decline in the per capita consumption of butter must surely be due in some way to the fact that child endowment has in effect been halved in Australia during the last nine years. As there has been no increase whatever in the rate of child endowment of 10s. for the second and subsequent children fixed in 1948 and the rate of 5s. for the first child fixed in 1950-51, the value of child endowment payments received by mothers has been effectively halved. When the mother who wishes to buy butter and dairy products for her young family finds that the amount she specially receives to assist her in that task is halved, obviously she is required to cut correspondingly the amount of money that she spends on dairy products. So, by the betrayal of the promise to maintain the value of child endowment, a great injury has been done not only to the families of Australia, but also to the dairying industry. Considerable help will be given to the industry when the child endowment payments are restored to their former purchasing power. The honourable member for Lalor has pointed out that an increase of 1 lb. a year in the consumption of butter would absorb an additional 5,000 tons. We can be perfectly sure that if the mothers of this country had the means in their hands to buy more butter for their families, they would not let their children go short of butter and would not buy cheap and inferior substitutes as they are frequently required to do to-day.

So, although he may claim that he was influential in forcing the Labour government to do it, his comrades will find it difficult to of an active immigration policy. The believe him when in all the years he was in office he did nothing to bring it about. The fact is that the subsidy system, for which the right honourable member for Cowper claims credit for the present Government, was established by the Labour government. The fact is, also that the subsidy provided by the Labour government for the dairying industry was far greater than the subsidy now being provided by this Government. I think the rate of subsidy to-day is about £13,000,000 or £14,000,000-it is about 7id. per lb. anyhow-wherea s the subsidy provided by the Labour government was up to ls. per lb. per lb. those days was worth at least 2s. now. one year. able member for Lalor said quite rightly, the subsidy provided by our government reached a total of £16,000,000 in one year, which would be more than £30,000,000 to-day. So, even if we count it in terms of subsidy, the present Government, far from helping the dairying industry, has reduced very considerably the amount of assistance formerly available to it. that in those days there was a war and there was no possibility of the industry exporting all the butter it had available? point made by the honourable member for Gippsland is a very reasonable one, but the assistance given by the Labour government continued long after the war. It continued until the Labour government was defeated at the end of 1949 and, if the Labour government had not then been defeated, the assistance would have continued throughout the subsequent years. Indeed, the undertaking to provide that assistance was a feature of Labour policy speeches in recent elections. The other way, of course, in which the dairying industry will eventually receive considerable assistance is by the pursuance figures supplied to me indicate that, even on the present restricted basis of butter purchase, every increase of 1,000,000 in the Australian population means an increase of 13,500 tons of butter consumed on the home market-and , obviously, the home market is by far the best market for the dairy-farmer, for the simple reason that the application of Labour policies over the year9 Ms given a guaranteed standard of living and a guaranteed income to the body",41,Dairy Produce Research And Sales Promotion Bill 1958

148,Mr Allan Fraser,"I think theof workers who constitute the overwhelming proportion of Australian purchasers of butter. Justice requires that the dairying industry should again be placed on an equal footing with all other industries in this country. To me it is a most extraordinary thing that workers and those in executive positions alike-it is not confined to any one section of the community-whil e prepared to fight and work most positively for a guaranteed living standard for all other sections of the community, accept no such responsibility in respect of the dairying industry. Instead, they appear to feel that butter is a commodity that ought to be supplied cheaply, even under sweated labour conditions, so as to-enable the cost of living of city workers to be kept down. This, of course, is completely unfair and unreasonable. The position of the dairying industry will not be safeguarded until the Australian people as a whole realize that it is essential to Australia's well-being, and that it must enjoy conditions comparable with those available to all other industries. While the dairying industry faces its present severe crisis, much greater assistance than that which is being given by the present Government is justified. There is an obligation upon the Government to give increased assistance to the industry, and it is failing in its task and ih its duty in not giving the required measure of assistance. The present bill, while a useful measure, does not involve the Government in any heavyfinancialcommitment. The need for a sales promotion campaign for butter and cheese is recognized by everybody. The need for research into the problems of the dairying industry is also a ground for common agreement. The attractive and misleading advertising engaged in by the margarine industry must have been substantially responsible for inducing people to switch who found the price of butter difficult to meet. This is the time when it is important that the dairying industry should recognize the need to make a determined fight to regain a higher proportion of the home market and to institute a concerted publicity and advertising campaign. Having listened to the two speeches made on behalf of the Opposition, it is evident that there is nothing for me to answer. I do, however, wish to refer to one statement made by the honourable member for Lalor( Mr Pollard), who said that in one year Labour paid subsidies to the extent of £16,000,000. In order to refresh the honourable member's memory, I shall cite the amounts of subsidy paid by Labour in the various years. Thefiguresare as follows:Year. Amount. £ 194243 .. 1,500,000 194344 .. 7,300,000 194445 . .. 6,800,000 194546 .. 6,400,000 194647 .. 5,200,000 194748 .. 9,000,000 194849 .. 4,800,000 amount of subsidy reached l i d . per lb. me quote some remarks of the honourable member for Lalor made on 27th October, 1949, and reported at page 2188 of volume 205 of "" Hansard "". These remarks refer to the year 1948-49. The honourable member saidWithout the subsidy, those prices would necessarily have been higher by 6d. per lb. for butter and 3d. per lb. for cheese. Labour is making a new approach if it suggests that the Labour government paid ls. per lb. subsidy when the average price for butter was 2s. 4id. per lb., and the export price was, in most cases, higher than the guaranteed price. I believe that Opposition supporters should reconsider their position in regard to this matter. Let me also remind the House that the quantity guaranteed by Labour, in almost every year, did not exceed the 20 per cent, that we now guarantee in excess of home consumption. I want to emphasize that point particularly. Let me also tell the House that at that time, because of food shortages, Great Britain was prepared to contract on a government-to-government basis. I repeat also that export prices were at times higher than the guaranteed prices, and the growers did not receive the excess, except in the sense that it went into a stabilization trust fund. consent and at their request.

153,Mr Deputy Speaker ( Mr,"another, Mr Deputy Speaker. think the honourable member for Fisher needs any help. under the present Government is entirely different. Three years ago the Government, on the basis of calculated risk, decided that member is that the standard to-day is far there was an excess of £2,000,000, and we let the growers have it. The honourable member for Lalor. when he was Minister for Commerce, did not do this. The guaranteed price under the Labour government was computed according to a much lower standard. For instance, in arriving at the cost of production of butter the managerial allowance was set at only 25s. a week above the basic wage. Very low interest rates were allowed on capital investment. Other concessions that have since been given by this Government were not included when the calculation was being made in the time of the Labour government. The approach made to the problem by the honourable member for Lalor, when he was Minister, is one that I cannot accept. The honourable member said, "" It is undeniable that if the remuneration of the dairy farmer becomes too great, it may have a tendency to depress rather than increase production "". paid by the British Government under conHe said also, "" If a dairy farmer can obtain a sufficient income by milking 40 cows, why should he milk 50?""

Minister said, "" It is undeniable "", and he finding of the Cost Investigation Committhen went on with the statements I have tee. It accepted a minority report and already quoted. In those statements he deprived the dairymen of l i d . per lb. which admitted in effect, that there was no incenwas their due according to that committee. tive to production on the part of the dairyIn the second year, the Labour government, farmers because of the high rates of taxation did accept it, and paid that amount imposed by his Government. That was one accordingly. In the third year, although of the features of his remarks at that time. the Labour government had that finding I cannot accept the honourable member's by May, there was still no satisfaction conlogic. I submit that if a diary-farmer gets cerning it on 22nd October, when the a good remuneration he spends it and so improves his property and helps the industry to better itself. The honourable member for Eden Monaro( Mr Allan Fraser) stated that the standards enjoyed by dairy-farmers to-day would not enable them to purchase butter for themselves. The answer I give to the honourable better than it was under a Labour government with all its excessive taxes and the shortages that existed at that time. Generally, they are happier with the present scheme. 1 am a believer in stabilization. I have proved that by working under co-operative stabilization schemes throughout my life. Irrespective of whence a scheme comes, if it is a co-operative approach and not a socialist or nationalistic one, I am prepared to support it. But the approach of the Labour government gave us a start. We have sought to build on that and to help the dairying industry. The prices we guaranteed gave the producers an incentive to expand. Dairymen have been able to increase production and have had better net returns, but to-day they have reached the stage where, on present world standards, prices are even lower than those tract with the Australian Government when Labour was in office. So, if the honourable member for Lalor or the honourable member for Eden-Monaro suggests that this is a creation of the present Government, they are not making a fair approach to the matter. It is interesting to make a comparison Labour government at that time. A Labour government was in office for half of the first that they introduced.

They had never had a sympathetic approach to the dairying industry, and they do not have that approach to it now. In fact, in Queensland, we had an act put on the statute-book which provided that unless dairymen were prepared to deliver butter at the prices set by the Labour government, it would confiscate that butter. That is the stand and deliver act that the Government now in office in Queensland has had to delete from the statute-book. I know that the honourable member for Lalor, when he was Minister for Commerce, did have difficulty in finalizing the arrangement, although just how serious he was, I do not know. He had the recommendations in May and did not have the matter finalized by October. That shows that, after all, the Labour government did have doubts about the whole thing, because when it gave a guarantee, the guarantee was for six months instead of twelve months. The honourable member for Lalor at that time made a statement that unless he could .get a satisfactory understanding with the State governments it would be futile to keep the Cost Investigation Committee going. There might have been some merit in it, but there was quite a lot of doubt in the approach of the Labour government to its own scheme half way through the five years for which the stabilization scheme was to operate. Dr. Evatt -B e fair. with that? My statement is correct, and the Leader of the Opposition knows it. We gave a guarantee during the election campaign that if we became the government, the obligation to the dairymen accordand not necessarily a final report-wil l ing to the cost finding of the 1949-50 year would be honoured; and it was honoured within a few days of our election to office. Moreover, we have honoured all the recommendations since. As to the dairying industry and its welcritical period because of unpayable overseas prices. So, there are two approaches that we need to make; and we have made them. The first is the short-term, approach in which we need to do something immediately; and it must be disappointing to the Opposition to know that the Government has acted to underwrite payments to the dairymen at present. When speakers on the Opposition side suggest that 3d. per lb. is of no consequence, my reply is that it will be of consequence at a time when it is most needed, and that is in the case of excess production. If there is an excess quantity for export, it might mean that the dairymen will not receive 3s. 4d. That is where the guarantee comes in. It will not be required if production is low. If a lesser quantity is going overseas, obviously dairymen will not only receive the 3s. 4d., but an amount in addition according to realization. I ask for leave to continue m,y remarks at a later stage. Leave granted; debate adjourned.

That is, of course, very important in all rn^tters of constitutional change. No doubt there have been compromises, but there has also been a very high degree of unanimity. Perhaps that is a rather dubious expression. I look at the honourable member for Werriwa( Mr Whitlam) and I see that he is saying to himself, "" What is a high degree of unanimity?

I am sure that all honourable members will, and I hope that what the committee has said will receive the widest publicity in Australia. It is not entirely to our credit that, over so many years, we should have devoted so little attention to the chief instrument of government in the country and have voted upon it, when we have been called to do so, in a rather rash fashion. This report represents a very long period of work by a committee drawn from all sides of politics. For myself, I would like to say that I believe the report is of outstanding value. I shall read it with great care and, I hope, with great advantage. I hope, too, that as a result of the investigation that has been made, much good will come to this country and that progressive and positive proposals will emerge in this Parliament. Opposition) [5.37] -I , also, would like to say a few Words. I congratulate the members of the Constitution Review Committee, representing all parties and both Houses, for the constructive job that they have done in their study of the existing F.5890/58 -Jt -[69 ] Constitution and on their proposals for the improvement of the Constitution. It is really a unique event in parliamentary history that so important a work should be continued over a long periodI think nearly two years. The time taken was certainly not too long. The problems that the committee had to face were extremely difficult. They were problems affecting the people of Australia that had baffled the legal profession and the High Court judiciary. I have had great interest, pleasure and excitement in reading the report. I was not able to take a day-to-day interest in the proceedings of the committee, but my colleagues on the Opposition benches in both Houses have treated this mission that they have carried out as a very important one. The committee has discussed section 92 of the Constitution and the need for further powers, or the qualification of powers, for the protection of the States and the development of new StatesAll these great questions have become the subject of table discussion and gossip in the precincts of the House. I know what a great job the members of the committee have done. I pay that tribute, not only to Opposition representatives on the committee, but to the representatives of both parties supporting the Government. I want to emphasize that the job to which they have devoted themselves is, in itself, a job of extreme difficulty. The elements of these great constitutional problems are really philosophical questions involving the basis of political philosophy, the structure of thc States, and of the federal system. They are subjects to which great minds have devoted themselves for many years. I think this report is a very important contribution to the solution of those problems, and I would like to congratulate all concerned. I agree with the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) that those who advised the committee have been most helpful. I support the motion that the report be printed. It will be the basis for action in the future, I have not the slightest doubt, in quite a few respects. The powers that have been delimited and recommended, and the careful qualifications which have been put upon them in cases requiring democratic procedures of a special character are all very important.

In order to clarify the matter, I should like to quote the following remarks which were made by the Minister for Primary Industry in his second-reading speech:In the circumstances, the Commonwealth has agreed to contribute one-half of tbe costs incurred on projects included in the' programme of research that are endorsed by the board and approved by the Minister, with a maximum contribution of £1 for £1 against funds raised by way of levy that are allocated to and used for research. The sales promotion proposals will be financed by the industry itself without any assistance from the Government. As I have said, the honourable member for Lalor may have left the impression in the minds of some honourable members that the Government was entering into no real commitment. I suggest that the honourable member should read the bill again. Clause7 (1.) providesThere shall be paid into the Research Account(b) subject .to the next succeeding sub-section, provides for a levy for research in the amounts equal to one-half of the amounts from time to time payable out of the Research Account in accordance with this Part; Paragraph (3.) refers to drawings from Consolidated Revenue for payment to the Dairy Produce Research Trust Account for the purpose of financing research. I think that that should set the minds of Opposition members at rest on this matter. The Minister referred also to the many activities in which this Government was helping the dairying industry as a whole. I should like to mention particularly one passage in the Minister's second-reading speech, in which he mentioned the need to co-ordinate the activities of the various bodies that are conducting this kind of research, which is undertaken by State bodies and universities, for example. In addition, for some time, extension services have been bringing that research to the notice of the farmers. I think that the Australian Dairy Produce Board, which will be the controlling authority under the terms of this bill, should make certam that all these activities are linked together in order that a sense of direction shall not be lost and in order that money shall not be wasted by the duplication of activities. In conclusion, Sir, I should like to say that this measure will be as it were, a refreshing breeze to stimulate the industry as a whole. The Government's decision to underwrite to the extent of 3s. 4d. per lb. the interim price for butter will be a great encouragement to the industry, because the farmers will no longer have to wait until the end of the dairying year for a large deferred pay. Although it is obvious that, unless something unforeseen happens and the calculations turn out to be wrong, the dairy-farmer himself will not get any more money out of that underwriting, he will at least get his money earlier. That is particularly important at this stage, when the industry is passing through a period of transition in which prices are declining. This presents big problems. I commend the bill to the House. I am sure that it will have the support of all honourable members. Sitting suspended from 5.59 to 8 p.m. Mr Speaker, I welcome this bill, which dairying industry, and I should like to congratulate the Minister for Primary Industry he has handled this matter. I thank him especially for having seen fit to make a statement in regard to the speeding up of the payments of the equalization committee and for assuring us that in future the Government will underwrite those payments so that they may be given to farmers much earlier than they were given in the past. I should like also, while I am on my feetI do not often speak in this House nowto congratulate the Minister on the enthusiasm which he always brings to measures of this kind and to all of his actions in connection with primary industry. The demand for this bill came, in the first place, not from the Government but from the dairying industry as a whole. The industry asked for permission to place a levy upon the proceeds of its products in order to ensure better publicity and more research to assist the industry in its fight against substitutes. This action is characteristic of the attitude of the dairying industry since its very beginning. It will be remembered by the older members, especially by the honourable member for Bonython( Mr Makin), who was here in",48,Dairy Produce Research And Thing For Itself In Seeking To Sell Its Products Sales Promotion Bill 1958

173,Sir Earle Page,"The industry is from butter, Peters's ice cream, for instance,hour of the day. It is necessary, therefore, that the production of milk for making the purest ice cream should be continuous over the whole year. That will never be achieved until we have some other method of dealing with our problems. I believe that the report brought down by the Constitution Review Committee, which has done such excellent work, opens the way. We should adopt the suggestion that control of navigation be made an absolute power of the Commonwealth instead of being, as at present, only partially a matter try was in then. A royal commission was for the Commonwealth. We must insist that the people of Australia are fed with Australian products of high quality at a reasonable price. If we can produce continuously, making two blades of grass grow where one grew before, producing two gallons of milk where we produce one now, we shall be able to meet the threat offered by the cheapoperations in the Australian wheat industry. ness of margarine, and so to protect the health of the Australian people. It is interkind of action now. We must have an esting to note that the federation of dairying organizations of the world has recently stated that we must safeguard health by bridging the gap in production, and that we must engage in more publicity activities. The important thing is to make certain that we get the continuous supplies that are necessary. If we obtain continuous supplies, we shall help not only the dairying industry but also all other industries in country towns, .where goods for farming communities are bought and sold, and city industries, which produce machines that farmers use. We shall enlarge the opportunities for work for every one throughout the lensth and breadth of Australia. The policv that the dairying industry is pursuing is, therefore, not in any way a selfish one. There is something else that we have to do. We have to enable the farmer to make full use of the water that may be made available. There must be lons-term loans at low rates of interest to allow farmers to buy the irrigation machinery and other equipment which will enable them to increase production. If that is done, it should be possible to develop many local industries. By increasing local population through the establishment of industries we shall increase the consumption of milk in the area in which it is produced. Instead of great quantities of milk having to be carted long distances to a big city, as is the case now, the milk will be sent to small cities handy to the sources of supply. This will lead to increased production of milk and lower retail prices. In order to implement the suggestions I have made we should take the kind of action that we took in the 1930's. Honourable members who were in the Parliament at that time, and possibly all people who were living as adults in Australia then, will recall the great difficulties the wheat indusappointed to inquire into the industry. Its membership did not consist entirely of men connected with the wheat industry, but included also men with first-class brains who came from various sections of the community. That commission produced a very complete report, and the recommendations contained in it are still the basis of I am convinced that we must take the same organization that will enable us to deal with the dairying industry on the widest possible terms. I have seen the report of the Constitution Review Committee, and there is no doubt that the Interstate Commission, the reconstitution of which the committee recommends, would be able to keep under continual review the basic principles that affect our primary industries. It would keep the same kind of watchful eye on our primary exporting and interstate industries as the Tariff Board keeps on our secondary industries. I am glad that this legislation has been introduced at this particular time, because in the near future it may be of great assistance to us. I hope that we shall have an opportunity, as a result of a referendum, to secure the position by an amendment of the Constitution which might easily help us to make this a great nation, able' to defend itself by reason of its population and its essential strengtha nation of which the whole world will be envious. to support the bill because it is a small part of a long-range effort to assist the dairying industry which, at the present time, is in urgent need of some short-term assistance. It is also in urgent need of a long-range plan designed to reconstruct the whole of the industry.",50,Dairy Produce Research And Thing For Itself In Seeking To Sell Its Products Sales Promotion Bill 1958
174,Mr Freeth (Forrest) [8.13],"I rise1 cannot let pass this opportunity without mentioning the somewhat strange flights of fancy in which the honourable member for Eden-Monaro( Mr Allan Fraser) indulged. He suggested that this Government had taken no practical steps, since it has been in office, to assist the dairying industry. Of course, that suggestion is entirely fantastic. In 1948-49. the whole of the dairying industry was so incensed at the persistent refusal of the Labour government to improve the conditions of the people engaged in it that, almost to a man, dairy-farmers turned to the support of the parties now in office. In those days, the economic return to the dairy-farmer-the guaranteed price-wa s calculated at a low rate of interest, which the dairy-farmer himself could not accept as being fair. The land of the farmers was pegged at its pre-war value. The return to an owner-manager was only a small fraction of the return under the stabilization are in difficulties because their customers plan introduced by this Government. Whilst it is true that the then Labour government did give a guarantee in relation to the whole of the dairy-farmer's production of butter, the plain fact is that it paid the subsidy only in order to keep the home-consumption price down. During the whole of the period of its guarantee the home-consumption price was lower than the export price. The ability of the Labour government to give the price guarantee to the farmers was due entirely to the fact that the government knew in advance how much butter would be consumed locally, because butter was then rationed, and also knew in advance what the minimum export price would be, because Australia could have exported at that time all the butter it produced. The export price, as I have said, was higher than the home-consumption price and the guaranteed price. The home-consumption price was deliberately kept low, not for the purpose of increasing the consumption of butter in Australia, but for the purpose of keeping wages down. In those days, there were automatic wage adjustments, and the subsidy paid was not a subsidy to assist the dairy-farmer but a subsidy to help the consumer. To-day we face a very different state of affairs. The Government has no control over the quantity of butter that is available for export. It has no control over the price that can be obtained for our butter overseas. In those circumstances we find that, when export prices are low, the more butter that is produced in Australia the greater is the loss to the dairy-farmer. So we must not only give some immediate aid to the dairy-farmer, but also take some long-term steps to place the dairying industry on a sound basis. Dairy farms in Western Australia, the State from which I come, are high-cost dairy farms. If the dairy-farmers in Victoria and New South Wales have cause to complain about their difficulties, I can assure the House that the dairy-farmers in Western Australia have even more cause to complain, because they are in a far more desperate position. In fact, the position in the dairying areas in Western Australia is reminiscent of the position in the days of the depression. Storekeepers in those areas cannot pay their accounts. Garage proprietors are in difficulties because they have large book debts which cannot be collected, and they have had to refuse further credit. We have not seen such conditions in any primary industry in Western Australia since the 1930's. I can assure the House that the position is indeed desperate in some areas in Western Australia. That is not to suggest, however, that things are hopeless, because the dairying industry in Western Australia is still a developing industry. Compared with its counterparts in other States, the Western Australian dairying industry has been in existence for only a short time. When it is realized that about half of the Western Australian dairy farms which produce butter fat are carrying only nineteen cows or less, it is easy to understand that the dairy-farmers there are really up against it. During the last few years, although the efficiency of the industry has increased, the total production of butter in Western Australia has remained static because the number of dairy farms has decreased. That fact does not bode well for a State which has literally millions of acres of fertile land with high rainfall on which a high carrying capacity for stock can be achieved if the land is developed. One of the long-range problems we have to face is to get the industry in Western Australia up to a higher state of efficiency by developmental processes. the farms? they are short of capital for development. The best land in Western Australia for dairying is quite equal to Victorian land provided that it is developed and put under pasture and modern methods are applied. But, as I have pointed out, 50 per cent, of the dairy farms there are carrying nineteen cows or fewer, the dairy-farmers cannot get further capital, and consequently they cannot obtain sufficient returns from the industry. The average dairy-farmer is too fully occupied looking after his small herd of cattle to do much developmental work for himself. AlthoughI agree with the right honourable member who preceded me that something must be done and that a royal commission might be one way of inquiring into the industry, it is not necessary to have that sort of investigation in Western Australia. The position there is known. A most exhaustive cost-of-production survey was carried out by this Government in 1953 which established, quite conclusively, that the only hindrance to the dairying industry in Western Australia was the lack of development. It found that all the highcost farms were the under-developed farms and that the efficient farms were those which carried larger numbers of cattle and had been in existence for some years. The Western Australian Government has proved that proposition, because it has carried out a programme of farm reconstruction and development by making available, from its own financial resources, low-interest loans to the farmers. This has been done purely to enable the owners of existing dairy farms to extend their pastures, to clean up their old pastures and to clear new land. The results have been entirely satisfactory. But it is a long-term process in view of will be extracted at the factory. That seems the small amount of money that the State to me to be the kind of mechanization which Government has seen fit to make available will eventually come to the industry. Plants to the industry. I believe that the Commay be used to produce powdered milk or monwealth Government could very well powdered butter so that these commodities make available to Western Australia, as may be reconstituted separately at a later has been requested, a sum of money to stage. If we are to have in Western Auscomplete that developmental programme. tralia that degree of closer settlement which There is a very excellent precedent for that, will allow that kind of development to be as we were reminded by the right honourable achieved in the industry then we must be member for Cowper, in the Wheat Industry allowed to produce more butter and place Assistance Act 1938 under which marginal our dairy farms on a paying basis in the wheat farms in Western Australia were near future. made productive. They were brought back to a state of efficiency largely through the help provided under that legislation. One of the difficulties in the dairying industry is that if cash payments to dairy farmers are increased, production is increased. Victoria is, admittedly, the lowest production cost State in Australia. I do not want to decry the efficiency of the Victorian dairying industry, nor do I envy the Victorians their good fortune; but quite frankly, the low prices being received by the farmers to-day are due to the high degree of production in Victoria. This is proving an embarrassment to such States as Western Australia and Queensland. We have the problem of opening up new areas of Iand which can best be brought into production through dairying. But the prospects of success are not very bright owing to the fact that there seems to be an excessive surplus of butter for export. I am somewhat doubtful whether the proposals to open up further dairy farms in the Heytesbury or Yanakie areas in Victoria will be of great value to Australia as a whole, because, as I have said, the more butter produced there, the greater will be the loss to all the dairy-farmers all over Australia. Although the Victorians may say, "" We have to develop our land "", the plain truth is that Western Australia cannot yet produce enough butter to supply its own consumption needs. I am quite satisfied that it could do so at an economical price if the industry were given a chance to develop there. In the long term, I believe that most dairy farms in Western Australia and, possibly, all over Australia, as settlement becomes closer, will develop a new technique in handling their products. They will go on to a whole milk basis, and any necessary fats to be extracted from the milk",51,Dairy Produce Research And Thing For Itself In Seeking To Sell Its Products Sales Promotion Bill 1958
175,Mr Duthie,Wby have the farmers left,53,Dairy Produce Research And Thing For Itself In Seeking To Sell Its Products Sales Promotion Bill 1958
176,Mr Freeth,"As I said before, becauseThe Government is faced with an immediate proposition of giving some assistance to the dairying industry, and I am particularly pleased that to-day the Minister was able to announce that the Government is underwriting the risk which the Commonwealth Dairy Produce Equalization Committee Limited was apparently not willing to underwrite and to restore the recent cut which it made. The farmers, as a result, are assured, at least for this year and future years in which the present scheme operates, that they will be given, right from the beginning of the season, a practical and realistic assessment of what their product is worth for that year, instead of waiting with some trepidation until the end of the year and relying on some further distribution, when the equalization committee discovers that it has been too conservative in its estimate. This scheme will give some heart to the industry, but I do plead with the Government to give some special consideration to the particular problems which exist in Western Australia. I have made this plea for a good many years, and I suppose that if we go on long enough we may eventually get some special consideration for what is, after all, a very important national development problem. I ' rise to support this bill because I think it is very important to the dairying industry. Some six months ago I asked the Minister for Primary Industry( Mr noticed particularly this year. As soon as McMahon) a question in the House about establishing a national promotion scheme for dairy products. He answered my question by saying that he was giving consideration to the matter, and that plans were being drawn up for a national promotion scheme. At this juncture, I should like to congratulate the Minister for managing to get this bill before the House, because that has not been as easy as it might seem. Before this national promotion scheme came into being the States had the right to promote their own sales of dairy products. Queensland had the Queensland Butter Marketing Board, New South Wales had the New South Wales Sales and Promotion Organization, Victoria had a Dairy Industry Bureau, but in the other States there was no organization whatever to foster an increase in the sales of butter. Under this bill, the Commonwealth Government will stimulate the sales of butter and cheese in this country. These products will also be given the maximum amount of publicity. The dairying industry faces many problems, and not one single factor will solve all the present difficulties of the farmers. However, this bill will help to solve quite a few of the problems. It will help to prevent margarine from gaining increased sales at the expense of butter consumption. It will enable farmers outside milk zones to get products into the milk zones in competition with milk, and the competition between milk and other products will eventually enable the price of milk to the public to be reduced. The bill will help to overcome the problems of declining or low fertility in certain parts of the country. This decline of fertility is causing concern to many dairy-farmers. The bill will enable the butter industry to carry out research into new types of products for sale to the public, and will permit the Australian housewife to be encouraged to buy these new products. I shall deal now with margarine. Under our stabilization scheme at present, as the cost of production rises, the producer must pass the increase on to the consumer if he is to receive a higher return for his product. If he passes the price on to the consumer, he is met with fiercer competition from the margarine firms. That trend was we increased the price of butter, the margarine people started on a gigantic sales promotion scheme. The butter industry was not organized on a national basis and could not counter the advertising compaign of the margarine firms. As soon as the price of butter was increased, the margarine firms inserted big advertisements in all the newspapers and advertised over the radio and television. What was the butter industry doing? Nothing whatever, because it could not do anything. There was no legislation to permit the butter industry to do anything; only isolated States had the necessary legislation. In this new and more modern world, we find a tendency towards self-service. If the butter industry is to hold its place with self-service, we must keep up to date. 1 shall read a comment from a journal called",53,Dairy Produce Research And Thing For Itself In Seeking To Sell Its Products Sales Promotion Bill 1958

The article readsThis leads me to the butter-margarine set-up. I first-grade butter. For the last 20 or 30 believe the current drop in butter consumption is years there has been a price differential largely due to the fact that no-one makes any between choicest grade and first grade effort to sell butter. That is because we have no national or 2d. per lb., and that is not enough. organization to promote the sale of butter. As a consequence, a large part of the butter The article continuesCertainly there is a big ticket in the window, but inside the store there is no promotion at all. first-grade butter all the time. Retailers couldn't care less about selling it. And this is one reason why margarine is giving butter a hiding. The first thing the butter industry has got to do is to get some profit back into the product for the retailer. The promotion organization envisaged in this legislation could perhaps look into that aspect. 1 do not know how more profit could be given to the retailer, but we will have to look into that if we want increased sales of butter in this country. The article goes onWhile the butter people have been idle, the margarine firms have been active. They have made margarine a much more profitable line to the trade. They have given it much more promotion at every level-righ t down to the point of sale. Retailers have made the promotion doubly effective by giving margarine increased display and by using the point-of-sale material at the expense of butter. After all, the size of the cabinet is still the same. That is a reference to the cabinet in the retail store. A customer entering the store looks in the cabinet and can see what is there. There is only a set amount of space for these perishable products, and we find that the self-service stores are concentrating on the most profitable lines. Butter is just a minor item. The stores are concentrating on the various types of margarine. The article continuesAfter all, the size of the cabinet is still the same. That means every brand of margarine that goes into the standard size cabinet is ar. the expense of butter. We cannot afford to allow that state of affairs to continue. The butter industry must determine the grades of butter much more strictly than it has in the past. Many butter factories have sold to the Australian public lower grades of butter than they should sell, and this is detrimental to the industry. The new promotion organization should ensure that all butter is of choicest grade quality if it is branded first grade The farmer must be encouraged to produce butter, but it has been only a matter of Id. produced is second grade. That is not good for the industry; we must try to produce I want to return now to the question of milk zones. I have not much time tonight, so I shall try to cover all these points quickly. We all know that the price of milk is too high. In Queensland, it is 9d. a pint; in New South Wales. l H d . a pint, and in Victoria, 9Jd. a pint. I cannot see any reason why it should be so high in New South Wales. An increase of 1 pint a week per head in local consumption of milk would mean taking 12.000 tons of butter off the export market, and would bring us into line with consumption of milk in European countries. Our consumption of milk per head is lower than that of European countries. Increased local consumption of milk would mean that the butter producer would receive 3d. per lb. extra. That alone would be of considerable help to him. Honourable members may ask how we can increase the consumption of milk. I do not think that we can do anything about lowering the price under our present system. We have milk zones in the various States, and they are very well controlled. Naturally, producers inside the milk zones do not want them broken down. However, as this bill will provide finance for research into various types of products, I suggest that research should be done into substitutes for milk in manufactured forms. The first product I have in mind is sterilized milk. This could be produced outside the milk zone. It is a product that keeps indefinitely once it is sealed in a bottle. For instance, it would be kept for a year. It is becoming very popular in European countries and 80 per cent, of the milk sold in Wales is sterilized milk. The housewife does not need to worry about a daily supply of milk; she can get a month's supply at the one time. Research into that product would be helpful. Another substitute is instant milk. We now have a oowdere.fl milk that dissolves instantly when mixed with water, without forming any lumps. It is almost as good as milk and it can be sold more cheaply than milk. We also have powdered cream, which could be sold at half the price of fresh cream. They are just a few ideas. I turn now to the question of declining fertility. The electorate that I represent was once probably the most fertile area not only in Australia but indeed in the world. It was a jungle, but when the scrub was cleared, the soil was rich in humus. It would grow anything. In fact, the early settlers had to climb the trees to find the cows amongst the grass. Over the years the fertility has decreased, and we do not now get the production that we used to get. We must carry out more research into the problem of declining fertility. We recognize the problem in the Richmond electorate. In fact, local organizations have collected £26,000 during the last six years, and they are endeavouring to undertake research into the problem. I also think that the dairying industry should carry out more research in connection with new kinds of products, particularly those suitable for our export markets. When I mention export markets I think mainly of the Far East. We should pay more attention to reconstituted milk. If we could arrange sales of milk in far eastern countries, we could send to them concentrated milk powders, from which milk could be manufactured and sold. We could also try to sell concentrated butter in those markets. This is a butter that contains no moisture and very little salt. The beauty of it is that when you pack it in tins there is no breakdown of the moisture and fat. It remains as a pretty solid product. Hot weather does not affect it to nearly the same extent as ordinary butter is affected, and refrigeration is not required. It is the moisture content that causes ordinary butter to become rancid. Let me say most emphatically to those in control of the milk industry in the zone areas: You had better watch out for yourselves, because after further research is carlism should consider their own behaviour ried out we are going to move into the milk zones with our products. One of the things that this legislation makes sure of is that there will be no milkmen in the organization that directs the way in which the research is to be carried out, because the men already appointed to the Australian Dairy Produce Board are men who manufacture butter and cheese. I hope that when a decision is made on how the research will be carried out, it will be that the research shall be done in such a way as to develop products that we can sell in competition with milk, in the hope of bringing down the price of milk in the various capital cities, and, by so doing, increase the consumption of milk. As I have said, if we can increase the consumption of milk by one pint a head per week, we shall sell 12,000 tons less of butter on low-price export markets, which, of course, will mean an extra 3d. a lb. immediately for the butter producer. I commend this bill to the House, and have very much pleasure in supporting it. that Government supporters have failed during this debate to sustain some of the criticism that they have offered during the last few years. The honourable member for Richmond( Mr Anthony) indicated that he has been lighting for some measure like this for several years, but it is not until the Government is faced with a federal election that it is prepared to bring down a measure to assist an industry that has been crying out for assistance for the last five years. honourable member for Macquarie, says, it is a death-bed repentance-and there may be more truth in that statement than is immediately apparent. Interestingly enough, farmers throughout the worldand there is no exception to this statement -lik e to socialize their losses and individualize their gains. ThoughI am a farmer's son and spent years on a wheat farm in Victoria, and though I represent a huge rural electorate in Tasmania, I still feel that this statement is correct. I am not saying that there .is anything wrong with that attitude. AllI say is that those farmers who scream protests against sociaoccasionally, and realize how many times they come to a government for assistance when they get into trouble.

179,Mr Luchetti,A death-bed repentance!,56,Dairy Produce Research And Thing For Itself In Seeking To Sell Its Products Sales Promotion Bill 1958
180,Mr Duthie,"As my friend, theagainst it when everything is going well. They socialize their losses by approaching governments for aid when in trouble, and they individualize their gains in good times, saying to the government, "" Go jump in the lake as far as we are concerned. We are all right."" I would like farmers to be more consistent in this regard, particularly those who sit on the Government side of the House. This bill seeks to inject a spot of sociaproducer, the small farmer is the salt of the lism into the dairying industry. The call for government aid is widespread in the dairying industry in every State. It is a legitimate call. however, refuse to recognize this measure as a spot of socialism, and they approach this discussion, therefore, in a hypocritical fashion. The main purposes of the bill before us are fourfold, and I shall again remind the House what it proposes to do. First, it seeks to plan a research programme, providing a continuing study of the effort to obtainbetter markets, of consumer buying habits and product improvement. Secondly, it envisages a public relations programme, using magazines, articles and televisionwhich is an excellent fieldof advertising,, especially with regard to consumers in the cities-and providing material to sections of the community able to influence others as to the wisdom, economy and pleasure afforded by the inclusion of dairy products in the diet. Thirdly, it seeks to make possible an advertising programme, to induce the public to buy the products of the industry as supplied to the retailers. Fourthly, it provides for a merchandizing programme to achieve greater buying and selling action where the product is sold. It proposes to give merchandizing aids to the retailer. This, of course, is an excellent not Labour party policy. I explained that place to start, because many retailers are still in the last century when it comes to selling butter and dairy products. Those are the four main purposes of the bill. A levy is to be struck at the rate of so much a pound of butter and of cheese. This levy will bring in £250,000 a year, which will be spent by a special committee to be set up by the Australian Dairy Produce Board. This committee will consist of nine members, who will administer the research and promotion programme. We on this side of the House agree entirely with this scheme, although it should have been instituted four years ago rather than at this time. We should have four years' experience of it behind us, instead of just starting this scheme. Mr Speaker, the dairying industry is, to my mind, a basic industry in Australia. It is a small man's industry, and it is the small fanner that we on this side of the House want to encourage. As a primary earth. Despite all the big men with their large sheep stations and other big farms, the small potato-growers or the proGovernment members, ducers of maize, fruit, hops, sugar, dairy products, oats, barley and the like are the salt of the earth of primary production, and anything that can be done to help them increase their production or improve the quality of their products should be done by this Government or any government. In fact, the dairying industry is the fortress of the small farmer, who is the greatest decentralizing influence in country areas. Where you find thriving dairying industries you will find many small towns. You will find great congregations of people, a very strong business community and a lot of goodwill. The capital invested in the dairying industry amounts to £700,000,000. More than 600,000 persons are directly engaged in the dairying industry in farms and factories. nationalize it? able member for East Sydney wants to nationalize it? to the Parliament the other night, and I deliberately and calculatedly described what the honourable member for East Sydney meant to say. At no time has it been in our policy, or is it likely to be in our policy,, that we will nationalize all small farms. We are opposed to big estates not being put in full production. The scope of this industry shows its growth. In 1956-57, milk production was 1,356,000,000 gallons, of which 66 per cent, went to butter and 7 per cent, to cheese. The number of dairy cowsin the industry in Australia in 1935-39 averaged 3,232,981. Last year",56,Dairy Produce Research And Thing For Itself In Seeking To Sell Its Products Sales Promotion Bill 1958

184,Mr Duthie,"Whateve r he thinks, it is that number had increased to only 3,451,469. In other words, in a period of eighteen years the number of dairy cows increased by only 218,488. The story of dairy production is interestThat was excusable in the terrible financial ing. The average for the 1935-39 period was 1,149,697,000 gallons. In 1956-57, it was 1,362,583,000 gallons, or a very small increase of roughly 200,000,000 gallons in nineteen years. In the average milk production per cow we find the secret to the present rate of production of dairy products. This is primarily where research comes into the picture. Everything that we spend in the industry to increase production goes right back to the dairy cow. If the production of each cow can be increased, there will be increased production throughout the country.

The blame probably lies with financial institutions, including government financial institutions. The men to whom the honourable member for Forrest referred could not get sufficient finance to enable them to carry on. I have found the same problem in Tasmania.

Those dairy-farmers cannot produce a good quality product by outof-date methods. The third point I want to mention is poor management. In the dairy industry we have not sufficient dairy-farmers who study the management of farms, especially among those who have only a few cows. I do not believe that sufficient emphasis has repeated every year since then. been placed on the importance of management in successful dairy-farming. My fourth point is the lack of business methods on the farm. The modern farmer cannot afford to be out of touch with modern business methods. He must be a businessman as well as a farmer. most of them are. I am talking of a section of primary producers who are not businessmen and do not intend to become businessmen. They go along hoping for the best. They do not organize on a business basis. Their sons may think differently. 1 hope they will. But some of the older men have not learnt that yet. There is a refusal having music in the dairy. So there is the to learn new ideas. The farmer is the hardest man to convince about anything new. The point is that the people amongst whom Australian Country party members move are all well-established, rich farmers. They refuse to believe me when I say that the farmer is the last man to accept new ideas. I will give an illustration. My grandfather was a wheat-farmer in the 1890's in the western district of Victoria. He was the first man to put a seat on a plough, and the people of the district said that he was the laziest man they had ever heard of. I could give illustration after illustration to show how hard it is to get farmers to accept new ideas. But when the farmer does accept a new idea he will use it to the best of his ability, day in and impression, although I would not be sure. day out. at the next election. his own good. I do not want Government supporters to give the impression to the country that they are the only ones who have thought about the dairy industry. The did a great job when he was Minister for Agriculture in the Labour Government between 1947 and 1949. We have many things to be proud of. The amount of £280,000 which the Minister for Primary Industry mentioned at the end of his speech has been given each year. It represents the extension grant which was introduced by the Labour government. That has been able member for Grey( Mr Russell) has asked me whether I know anything about cows. AllI can say is that those who have had the misfortune to listen to the remarks of the honourable member for Wilmot( Mr Duthie) must agree, to use a pure Australian colloquialism, that it was a fair cow to have to listen to such rubbish. We are dealing with a bill for the purpose of providing for research into lhe dairying industry. IfT understood the honourable member for Wilmot correctly, one of the things that the research council should inquire into is the pop tune that will get most milk from cows in Tasmania. He said that milk production had been increased by answer to the problem in Tasmania. I do not know whether it is the answer to the problem throughout Australia; but apparently it is part of the answer. The honourable member for Wilmot confirms my remarks. Therefore, I suggest to the Minister for the Army( Mr Cramer), who is at the table, that it might be appropriate to spend a few pounds in inquiring into which tune will produce the extra drop of milk from the cow. The honourable member for Wilmot has revealed, so I understand, his lack of knowledge of the dairying industry. He mentioned ""A.I.S."" I am sure that he believes that "" A.I.S."" means Australian Illawarra shorthorn.

It is a pilot scheme, one that has been endorsed by the dairy-farmers' organization as offering a solution to the long-term problems associated with the dairying industry. Individual dairy-farmers who have approached me and other members of the Australian Country party have agreed that this scheme will solve the industry's problems. The scheme is being operated by the Rural and Industries Bank of Western Australia. 1 understand that reports on the operation of the scheme over the past few years have been submitted to the Minister. He is fully informed on the matter. I have seen some documents concerning the scheme, and they give a clear picture of what it involves. I suggest that the Minister might present to the Australian Agricultural Council all the information that has been made available to him from Western Australia-probabl y from the Rural and Industries Bank. The council might consider that information, together with reports from officers of the Department of Primary Industry who have investigated the scheme.

197,Mr Lucock (Lyne) [9.16],"As theThe industry asked for this legislation, and the election. There, we see the tragic reit took a certain amount of time to decide what levy would be placed on the industry and what assistance would be given by the Government. Consultations with various people were necessary so that the legislation, when presented, would have the approval of the interests concerned. The honourable member for Grayndler ( Mr Daly) said that he did not think any member of the Australian Country party had ever seen a cow. In my opinion, members of the Australian Country party have heard an awful lot of bull from members of the Labour party dver a considerable period of time. I am surprised that honourable members opposite on a number of occasions have accused the Australan Country party of running the Government. They have said that the Australian Country party forces the Government to do this and to do that. On other occasions, Labour supporters say that honourable members of the Australian Country party are not doing enough. It must be apparent to any thinking person that the accusations made by honourable members opposite are made purely and simply to suit the occasion. It is rather amusing to find the Labour party suddenly becoming the friend of the farmer. The right honourable member for Barton-the prospective honourable member for Hunter-ha s been going around setting himself up as the farmers' friend, and the Government-and the Australian Country party-hav e been accused of bringing this and other legislation forward because an election is pending. A suggestion of that kind does not carry a great deal of weight when one considers the record of the Opposition. One has only to consider the record of State Labour governments to see this. The previous Labour government in Queensland and the present Labour Government in New South Wales, by their attitude towards margarine, dealt a blow at the dairying industry. Yet, when an election is in prospect, we suddenly find that Opposition members in this House set themselves up as the friends of the farmers. I remind Opposition members, the public, and especially persons in the dairying industry, this industry, we take into account the posof what happened in New Zealand, where the Labour party repudiated, when it took office, a pro:r.i:c that it had made before sults of the people believing in a promise made to them by the New Zealand Labour party in its attempts to gain office as a government. The results of its election to office have been tragic for people engaged in the dairying industry and for many other sections of the community in New Zealand. The honourable member for Lalor suggested that the Australian Labour party, as part of its election policy, will certainly promise an increase in subsidy. the honourable member say that the dairy farmers deserve an increased subsidy, but I would warn the industry and the people of Australia of the danger of an unlimited subsidy on an unkown volume of production. No government would be wise to commit itself to an unknown amount by way of an unrestricted subsidy. I remind the dairying industry particularly that if the United States of America, where there is a tremendous surplus of dairy products, were, metaphorically, to open the door and allow those products to go onto the world's markets, the Australian market could be swamped. I congratulate the Government on the introduction of this measure, which provides for thefinancingof research by means of a levy on dairy products. It will encourage the dairying industry. In consultation with leaders of the industry, we have made suggestions for a long-term plan. There is no need for me to labour this matter, Mr Speaker. It has been pointed out by my colleagues on the Government benches this evening that this long-term plan will give the industry hope for the future. This measure will give immediate encouragement to the industry and will enable it to look forward to that long-term planning with confidence and hope. I deplore the statements made in a number of quarters about a recession facing the dairying industry. If we are realistic, we must appreciate the fact that, in certain areas, particularly, the industry needs assistance, but if, in considering the future of sible increase in the population of Australia, which was mentioned by my colleague, the right honourable member for Cowper( Sir",61,Dairy Produce Research And Thing For Itself In Seeking To Sell Its Products Sales Promotion Bill 1958

We need to give the industry a stimulus in order that it may have a stable future. The introduction of this measure, and the announcement by the Minister for Primary Industry that the Government will underwrite the returns to the farmers, will give the dairying industry much-needed encouragement, and the long range planning that will follow will assure the industry of a promising future -wh o ought to be the last man to make In conclusion, I congratulate the Government, and commend the bill to honorindustry among State Labour governments? able members.

Does anybody refute that? If that is so, how can it be true, as has been alleged by the honourable member for Lyne( Mr Lucock) false accusations-that there is no sympathy and no support for the dairying It requires only one of those governments to say that the people in the State governed by it shall not be charged the cost-of-production figure, for the whole scheme as it at present works to collapse.

Honourable members will reHasluckThat the bill be now read a second time. This bill sets out to approve the agreement made between the Commonwealth of Australia and the Dominion of New Zealand in relation to the rights which they hold jointly in regard to the exploitation of the phosphate deposits on Christmas Island. The agreement, as the Minister for Territories ( Mr Hasluck) said when introducing the measure, is attached to the bill. The agreement which this legislation proposes to ratify will replace one made in 1949. The alteration is necessary, I understand, because sovereignty over Christmas Island has been transferred from the United Kingdom to the Commonwealth of Australia. I remember the legislation which was enacted by this Parliament approving the transfer from the United Kingdom of sovereign rights over this territory some little time ago. I believe that the new agreement comes into operation from to-day. The authority which this bill will confer upon the Commonwealth will enable us to have a guarantee that for the next 40 years phosphate from this island will be available to help agriculture and other industries in Australia. Because there is all benefit in the bill and nothing detrimental will occur to the Commonwealth because of its passage, we approve of the bill and wish it a speedy passage.

Statenient of Expenditure. In committee: Statement-by leave-take n as a whole. to the Parliament. I think it ought to be indicated at this intelligible appreciation of the various stage that this is the first occasion on which this matter has been considered by the Parliament in this form. The new presentation is due to a submission made by that very important body, the Public Accounts member that on previous occasions when the Budget was presented it was usual for an omnibus figure, usually in the region of £15,000,000, to be added at the end, with an indication that it was to cover contingencies or expenditures which it was envisaged would be incurred during the year because of unusual circumstances which could not be anticipated at the beginning of the year. These days, the Australian Budget covers an expenditure of about £1,200,000,000 or £1,300,000,000. Therefore, it is impossible to budget exactly for contingencies that will occur, under any system, during the year. We may have a drought in the course of the year, or a flood, which would necessitate the expenditure of perhaps £500,000 or £1,000,000. It was usual for a block amount to be included in the Budget statement with a note that if an expenditure were subsequently incurred it would be covered by supplementary estimates or some other kind of financial enactment. Some years ago the Public Accounts Committee, in considering the various financial measures which come before the Parliament, pointed to the need for a new approach to the handling of these matters. A submission was made that amounts which came under the specific appropriation, Advance to the Treasurer, should be brought before the Parliament in a particular appropriation measure and considered in that form. I notice that the chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, the honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Bland), is in his seat at the moment. He has been the chairman for the six year?, since the committee was resuscitated, and I think it is a tribute to him that the committee has come to be a valuable part of the financial mechanism of the Australian economy. He and the other members of the committee have given a great deal of study to the method by which these various .financial statements ought to be presented Sometimes it is difncult to obtain an",63,Dairy Produce Research And Thing For Itself In Seeking To Sell Its Products Sales Promotion Bill 1958
201,Mr Calwell (Melbourne) [9.35],,64,Advance To The Treasurer
202,Mr Crean (Melbourne Ports) [9.39].,"financial mechanisms by which appropriations are made for the purpose of government. Although technically no £1 of expenditure in Australia can be incurred without parliamentary sanction of some kind or another, there are various expenditures which become necessary during the course of the year which are not anticipated at the beginning of the year, and generally provision to approve of them is rushed through in the dying hour of the session. It was urged that a new approach should be made so far as expenditure under the Advance to the Treasurer was concerned. I think I am right in saying that this is the first occasion on which the items coming under that particular head have been presented to the House in this form. On the occasion of the report of the Public Accounts Committee recommending that this change be made, the chairman of the committee made some reference to the reason for the change. I have no doubt that he is gratified to see that, in this connew measure to cover the appropriation of nexion at any rate, the recommendations of the committee have been followed. I think it would be interesting some time to tabulate the various rather unspectacular alterations of procedure that have been made as a result of the recommendations of the Public Accounts Committee. They are unspectacular matters, because they are matters of mechanics, matters of administrative detail. They may not amount to a great deal in terms of the system of government as a whole, but they are nevertheless matters whose adjustment from time to time makes for greater efficiency in financial control and also for better control by the Parliament as a whole of the financial appropriations. These are sometimes matters which to the layman do not seem important but, in terms of parliamentary procedure, they are important. I think that to those of us who sometimes give a little consideration to the machinery of the Parliament, it is difficult to know why something done in 1858 in a certain way should continue to be done in 1958 in the identical way. Sometimes there is a very good reason for following tradition, and occasionally there are reasons for not following tradition. I think that we have before us an item in relation to which there is a good reason for changing the practice which has been followed since 1901. I pay tribute to the Public Accounts Committee, to the chairman and its members, for being vigilant, and I am glad that the chairman is in the chamber to hear that tribute. I do not wish to debate the statement before us, but I commend it to the House for speedy acceptance, and repeat my tribute to the Public Accounts Committee for the zealous work it does in what is sometimes a very unspectacular field. not wish to detain the committee very long. I merely want to say that the honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Crean) has quite adequately explained the position. This is a new method of presenting the Supplementary Estimates-that is to say, the Estimates dealing with money that has been spent on different items out of the £16,000,000 Advance to the Treasurer. Previously the Public Accounts Committee thought it would be necessary to provide a these supplementaries, but it was decided after inquiry that that would not achieve any legal advantage and was quite unnecessary. However, the Public Accounts Committee felt that the Parliament ought to know on what specific items the money had been spent. This committee is. therefore, now considering a statement showing the various items of expenditure which have been met from the Advance to the Treasurer of £16,000,000, and so has adequate information before it as to what was done with the money. This is a way of facilitating parliamentary control of the finances. It is a machinery measure which, as the honourable member for Melbourne Ports says, although not very spectacular, is very important. If you look at this matter from the point of view of mere mechanics, it is not important, but if you look at it from the point of view of the principle that no money ought to be spent without parliamentary approval, then it is of primary importance. I commend the statement to the committee, assuring honourable members that this is one way to help the Parliament to control the expenditure of the money which was voted in a lump sum of £16,000,000 as the Advance to the Treasurer. able gentlemen opposite may say "" A w "" ,",64,Advance To The Treasurer

204,Mr Leslie (Moore) [9.49],"Honorwhen I rise to speak, but I remind them that they have a responsibihty to tbe electors as members of this chamber. I put it to the committee that there is no greater responsibility than that of guarding the finances of the country. I want to tell the committee that there is a report by the Public Accounts Committee on the contents of this statement. Members of this Parliament may sometimes ask themselves why the Public Accounts Committee has devoted so much of its attention to inquiring into underspending of votes. The reason is that very often under-spending is related to overestimating in other departments. If honourable members care to study the 41st report of the Public Accounts Committee, they will see that that fact is dealt with there. I am concerned about this one question of reliable estimating in connection with the presentation of the annual Budget. Irrespective of what government is in office, the amount of taxation which it will be called upon to impose is dependent upon the volume of expenditure which heads of departments and the Treasury submit to the Government as being the minimum required to carry on the affairs of the country. The Government must be guided by its advisers and calculate the amount of revenue which it must raise by way of taxation to meet the expenditure represented by those estimates. All the money must come from the pockets of the taxpayers. That is an important fact to remember. If there is over-estimating, obviously the taxpayers will be called upon to pay far more than is reasonable. On the other hand, if there is under-estimating, although for the moment it might relieve the necessity for raising a large amount of taxation, some departments will hope that other departments will underspend their estimate so that they can make up their deficiency, under the appropriate section of the Audit Act, or else meet it from the Treasurer's Advance. Accurate estimating is the basis of good government. Recently, during a debate on the Public Accounts Committee, the honourable member for the Australian Capital Territory ( Mr J. R. Fraser) suggested that the Public Accounts Committee could only attempt to do something with the horse after it had escaped from the stable. I replied to the honourable member that that committee did manage to close the stable doors to prevent other horses from escaping. It is the responsibility of Parliament to make sure that the horses do not escape from the stables in the first place. This can be done by ensuring that the rate of taxation is' reasonable because the rate of spending is reasonable and that estimates are reliable. On previous occasions the honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Bland) has pointed out that some honourable members want to turn a discussion on the Estimates into a sort of second-reading debate. If it is not possible for us to depart from that practice then Parliament should seek to make some arrangement by which the financial operations of this country are satisfactorily safeguarded. Australia is a young country and our parliamentary operations are in their infancy compared with those of the Mother Country. We can easily apply remedial measures. The problem which is facing us to-day is not peculiar to this country; it is found in the United Kingdom also. I should like honourable members to read a magazine published in the United Kingdom entitled ""The Statist"". In its issue dated 22nd August last, an article appeared under the heading ""Tiptoe Through the Estimates "". Several members of the Opposition, including the honourable member for Watson( Mr Cope), seem to be displaying an attitude of irresponsibility. The honourable member for Watson has been a most valuable member of the Public Accounts Committee, and I should have thought that he and his colleagues wquld have had a sense of deep responsibility in this important matter. no sense of humour. able member for Melbourne Ports is that the subject of government finance is one in which honourable members can hardly find the opportunity to exercise a sense of humour. This article in ""The Statist"" refers to the sixth report from the Select Committee on Estimates of the United Kingdom Parliament. This is a joint, all party conimittee of 36 members which examines the Estimates, apart from the Public Accounts Committee, before they are passed by the Parliament. In its report it made some very caustic comments.",65,Advance To The Treasurer

206,Mr Leslie,"My reply to the honorAccording to this article in the "" Statist"", the sixth report of that select committeeshould raise public misgivings and ensure some action towards a rational system of national bookkeeping. That was a comment on the procedure of a parliament which is centuries old. It might be difficult for the United Kingdom Parliament to effect remedies in its system of dealing with Estimates, but it should not be difncult for a young country like Australia to do so. This article goes on to sayIn the "" Statist"" we have often criticized the system of estimating which renders the Budget no more than an essay in guess work. That has been characteristic of the Estimates in this country over the last 40 or 50 years. Instead of estimating, it has been guess work. I think that the honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr of refined copper a year. On the ClonCrean), who also has been a valuable member of the Public Accounts Committee, can take his mind back to inquiries into estimating when it was found that the so-called Estimates could more aptly be described as "" guesstimates "". Statement agreed to. Motion (by Mr Harold Holt) agreed toThat the following resolution be reported to the House:That the committee agrees with the stateis denied the bounty because he produces, ment for the year 1957-58 of Heads of Expenditure and the Amounts charged thereto pursuant to section 36A of the Audit Act 1901-1957. Resolution reported; report adopted. Second Reading. Debate resumed from 25th September (vide page 1673), on motion by Mr OsborneThat the bill be now read a second time. Opposition agrees to the passage of this bill. It provides for the payment of a bounty of £45 a ton on copper produced and sold in Australia for a period of two years from 19th May, 1958. In other words, the effect of the bill will be retrospective. The introduction of this measure follows a Tariff Board inquiry held last year. Representatives of the producers made submissions to the board and the board furnished the Government with a report in which it recommended that something should be done for the industry. The Government has decided to adopt this course. I do not object to the payment of a bounty to the small producers. In Queensland, in 1956, Mount Isa Mines Limited produced 28,199 tons, Mount Morgan Limited produced 7,388 tons, small producers in the Cloncurry district produced 1,392 tons and production in the rest of the State was 46 tons. The bill precludes payment of the bounty where the profit of the company is more than 10 per cent. That means that Mount Isa Mines Limited is excluded from participation in the bounty payments. In his second-reading speech, the Minister for A i r ( Mr Osborne), who introduced the bill, said that small producers would be regarded as mines producing up to 50 tons curry field, where the small mines operate, the ores run somewhere from 8 per cent, to 9.5 per cent, copper content. On that basis, to produce 50 tons of copper, a man need only produce 600 tons of copper ore. These men do not work alone; they work in parties of two or three, or a one-man show may employ two men. If they produce more than 50 tons of refined copper in a yeaT, they can be excluded from participation in the bounty. If a small producer say, 60 or 70 tons of copper, he is placed in the same category as Mount Isa Mines Limited and Mount Morgan Limited, which produce thousands of tons a year! It is true that a line must be drawn somewhere, but the line should not be drawn so far down the list. If the small man is to be encouraged, the limit of 50 tons should be lifted. It is all very well for the Government to say, "" But compare this bounty with the bounty paid on gold production "", and so on. That has nothing to do with it. We are dealing with the production of copper alone. I come now to the cost of producing a ton of refined copper. The small man naturally has to meet certain charges. They include the cost of explosives and the freight on them, steel that he will use, dieselene for his various machines, insurance, pay-roll tax, and depreciation on compressors, hoists and other mining equipment. He also has other overhead expenses. In addition, he must meet cartage",66,Advance To The Treasurer

All these costs must be taken into consideration. The point I make is that the limit of 50 expansion. We should not have restrictions tons is too low. I would not say definitely placed here and there. It may be as well, what it should be, but I suggest that it with regard to this matter of copper, to should be about 150 tons.

If there is a small party of two or three men operating a mine, or Honourable members may be interested in Mt. Isa Mines copper and lead production day. Mt. Isa treated 84,900 tons of copper ore slightly to 2,288 tons from 2,458 tons. In other words, Mount Isa is pushing on and achieving the production that we have talked about. But let us have a little more production, anyhow, and let us assist those men wbo go out into these isolated places, over rough bush tracks, to search for minerals. It is true that the State government renders great assistance by hiring equipment to the small operators. It is true that the 50 tons limit may suit a gouger, and, after all, the very foundations of the copper industry were laid by the gougers, as they are called, or the prospectors. It is not the large companies that find great mineral deposits; it is the prospectors, or the gougers. Incidentally, I might tell honorciently managed and mined. The Peko able members that officers of Mount Isa Mines, in association with Consolidated Zinc and the Bureau of Mineral Resources, have been prospecting in and around the Cloncurry area. As to these gougers, it is true that the 50 tons limit may refinery, which is presently under construcsuit them. I am concerned, however, with the man who employs two or three others, or the party of two or three who work together. They may produce up to the limit of 50 tons, but their costs are so high that if they are to carry on the Umit must be increased considerably, and I suggest that it be made 150 tons. I think the House will be deUghted at the measure of assistance that will be given to the copper mining industiy by means of this bill. The position of the industry has been deteriorating for quite a long time. One or two of our mines, certainly, do not stand in need of assistance, but others do, and, indeed, with them it is a matter of life and death. It is not my intention to take up too much of the time of the House, but I should like to recount the history of the copper-mining industry over the last year or two, so that I may tell honourable members the background to the action proposed in this bill. The Tariff Board was invited to examine the position with relation to copper back in 1954. However, world prices of copper quickly recovered at that time, and no Tariff Board recommendation was proceeded with. But the Government agreed at that time to refer the matter back to the Tariff Board if the price declined seriously in the future. Since then vast changes have occurred in the industry. Tremendous new ore bodies have been proved and developed. Mount Isa mines have been expanding their workings considerably. I and other honourable members on this side of the House were in Mount Isa recendy. I was interested to hear what the honourable member for Kennedy( Mr Riordan) had to say about this great mine. One of the most staggering facts about the mine is that the underground railway lines carry a greater tonnage than the whole of the Queensland railways. Mine at Tennant Creek has pushed ahead with a sound expansion programme, and very considerable ore bodies have been discovered. Mount Isa mines has proceeded with the establishment of a magnificent tion at Townsville. During the period since 1954, great fluctuations have occurred in the world price of copper. In 1954, when the Tariff Board first examined the situation at the request of the Government, the price was, I think, £300 a ton, which was dangerously low for our copper-mining industry. However, by August of 1956 it had increased to £500 a ton. Thereafter the price fell constantly until it reached £330 a ton late last year. This was the danger level for some of our biggest and marginal mines. Producers and users then got together and agreed to hold the Australian price at £330 a ton, in order to keep our marginal mines in production. The world price continued to fall, until, in February-March of this year, it had reached the very low figure of £200 a ton. The falling off in price to the drastically low level of £200 a ton was due mainly to the cessation of stock-piling by the United States of America. There was a considerable drop in domestic consumption in the United States of America because of the recession which that country has been experiencing, and from which it is only now emerging. The great difference between the world price and the Australian price presented great problems for copper users and fabricators in Australia. Our manufacturers, making their goods from expensive Australian copper, had to compete with",67,Copper Bounty Bill 1958
208,Mr Timson (Higinbotham) [10.14],,69,Mount Isa Ore Figures Up
209,Mr Riordan,It is a very efficient mine.,69,Mount Isa Ore Figures Up
210,Mr Timson,"Indeed it is very effisimilar goods from overseas made from copper bought at the much lower world price. Therefore, the Tariff Board was faced with a most difficult problem, made difficult by many complex problems quite dissociated from the main issue of protection. The industry is characterized by wide diversity of conditions and costs of production as between the various mines, which are spread throughout the continent. The Mount Lyell mine and the Mount Morgan mine are what we would call extremely marginal mines, and any great fluctuation of price, such as I have mentioned, can be extremely dangerous to their future. Mount Isa, on the other hand, is in a different category. It has rich ore and plenty of it, and, as the honourable member for Kennedy said, it is most efficiently mined. Perhaps it is not worried about the application. In the light of all the information available to it, the Tariff Board concluded that assistance was warranted, and that the most appropriate method of providing that assistance would be a tariff which would enable the Australian price to be stabilized at its present level of £330 a ton. The Government decided to assist the industry to the extent found necessary by the Tariff Board, but to provide that assistance, not wholly by a tariff as recommended by the board, but partly by tariff and partly by bounty. The Government considered that there were aspects which could greatly alter the position in the fairly near future such as the coming into operation of the Townsville refinery to which I have referred. As the Minister for Air( Mr Osborne) stated in his second-reading speechThe Government did not, however, accept the view that the tariff was the most appropriate or mittee has given it a great deal of attenthe only effective method of assisting the major tion. As the honourable member said, we producers. Indeed, the Government was concerned about the implications for the Australian economy of a difference of £110 a ton between the Australian and world prices of such a basic raw material as copper. Accordingly, it decided to assist the industry partly through the tariff mining committee had a conference with and partly by bounty. One statement by the Minister in introducing the bill appealed to me. He statedBy this means the gap between the Australian price and tbe overseas price has been narrowed, leading to a considerable saving to the economy generally. At the same time, the mines on which several isolated communities depend will be assured of reasonable returns. The lowering of the Australian price should also increase the local demand for copper. Mr Deputy Speaker, the present world price of copper is rising and is now approaching the level which will be maintained by the tariff. Australian manufacturers, therefore, are not put to any great disadvantage with overseas fabricators. The Government's proposals provide for a tariif when the overseas price is less than £275 per ton, which raises the Australian price to the equivalent of £275 which, with a freight component and a maximum bounty of £45 per ton, would return £330 per ton to the marginal producers. The bounty is designed to return to our marginal mines a profit of not more than 10 per cent. This profit limitation conforms to the normal application of most of our bounty legislation. It is hoped that the world price of copper will continue to rise to the point where no bounty will be payable, and the mines for whose assistance this legislation is designed will be able to stand on their own feet again in world competition. The price at the moment stands at roughly £212 English currency, which is the equivalent of £265 Australian. I should like to pay a tribute to Mount Isa in respect of this proposal. It has been very helpful to the copper industry for years. It has co-operated generously in rationalizing the Australian market. The honourable member for Kennedy( Mr Riordan) pleaded the case for those we call the gougers-the small producers of copper. I should like the honourable member to know that this matter of providing for the gougers, excluding them over a certain tonnage, has been most carefully examined. The Government members' mining comhave to draw the line somewhere. I know that he wants to draw it at 150 tons, which will provide for all those in the Cloncurry area. Indeed, only a few months ago, our those gougers at Mount Isa. We are fully aware of the problems which confront them over this bounty, but the bounty must, in some way, be related to the gold bounty. Under that bounty, small producers or gougers of gold, are able to produce up to 500 ounces of gold and still attract the bounty of £2 a ton. If they are over that quantity, they are classified as major producers. The small producer or the gouger normally keeps meagre records, if he keeps any at all. With gold-mining, that does not matter because he does not have to keep records or to pay income tax; but the small gouger of copper must keep some records because he is subject to income tax. So, the line was drawn at 50 tons. On a value basis, 37i tons of copper is the equivalent of 500 ounces of gold. I know, as the honourable member for Kennedy knows, that there would be only four or five gougers in the area around Cloncurry and Mount Isa producing in excess of 50 tons. all of them? sorts of problems. I think the limitation occur when the scheme is completed. Altoof 50 tons is a very good one. I hope the House understands that small producers of Murrumbidgee. Some 248 000 acre feet of copper up to 50 tons attract the full bounty without presenting any records at all relating to profit. I consider the bill is highly Snowy via the Eucumbene into the Murdesirable and I know that it will be welcomed by the mining community of via the Murray, making a total of 948,000 Australia.

But power between you, South Australia, at just so that it can go on the record that least, ought to be given her share of the the Premier of South Australia, Sir Thomas additional water that is made available and Playford, is not the wizard of negotiation which she so badly needs"". If this fair that he pretends he is in South Australia, share were to be divided correctly, South and that at long last he has met his match Australia should have the amount which, in the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies), I under the agreement, she is entitled to have think it should be repeated here that Soutb Australia has been deprived of a share of the water that it should have got had it been given its just share of the water that is to be diverted. I do not know whether Sir Thomas Playford does not realize this, or whether he realizes it and pretends that he does not in order to save face. I have a feeling that he does know he has been cheated, but rather than admit that he has been beaten, he is pretending that this is a wonderful agreement. Let me explain why the South Australian people are being deprived of their fair share of the diverted water. In order to understand this scheme one has to keep in mind three rivers, the Tooma, the Eucumbene and the Snowy. Those three rivers play a part in the diversions that will gether, 300,000 acre feet of water per year will be diverted through the Tooma into the ; water per year will be distributed from the rumbidgee. Some 400,000 acre feet of water will be diverted from the Snowy itself acre feet of water per year. It is important to remember that the cost the people of Australia on a population basis. If it were physically possible for all buted towards the cost of the diversions to share equally in the benefits of the diverpossible for more than two of the States to share in the benefits of the additional hydro-electric power, and those two States Even though we might say to the States",69,Mount Isa Ore Figures Up

212,Mr Timson,That would create all,71,River Murray Waters Bill 19s8 The People Of Australia Who Have Contri
213,Mr Clyde Cameron (Hindmarsh),"in drought times, which is three-thirteenths of the water that flows through the Hume dam at Albury. Victoria is entitled to fivethirteenths of that water and New South Wales is entitled to five-thirteenths of it. As 648.000 acre feet of water which previously flowed into the Pacific Ocean at Orbost is now being diverted into the interior through the Murrumbidgee and the Murray, we can see that South Australia's fair share of that additional water is threethirteenths. But what is South Australia to get? The Tooma water, amounting to 300,000 acre feet per year, is being diverted from the Murray into the Murrumbidgee and is to be divided equally between Victoria and New South Wales. South Australia will lose its three-thirteenths share of that diversion. However, the Government has said, "" We will apply justice in this case by setting aside from the Snowy diversion an amount of water equal to the diversion from the Tooma and the surplus will be divided between the States on the basis of fivethirteenths to Victoria, five-thirteenths to New South Wales, and three-thirteenths to South Australia "". The Government claims that, in this way, South Australia will get its just share. It suits the Government to overlook the fact that the diversion of 248,000 acre feet via the Eucumbene, TooTia and, ultimately, the Murrumbidgee, al' in New South Wales, has not been taken '-to account, and that none of it is shared by Victoria or South Australia. The Government still refuses to face up to the fact that the diversion from the Snowy itself has, first of all, clipped from it the 300.000 acre feet which is taken from the Murray and diverted into the Murrumbidgee via the Tooma River. This is a very important diversion to South Australia. We are not very much concerned about our share of the water from the Murray in ordinary normal times; our chief concern is in time of drought because it is in time of drought that all the States need the water most of all. So, to all intents and purposes, we can say that this agreement hinges upon South Australia's share of water in time of drought. In time of drought, the snow-fed river is ever so much more valuable than the water of the river which is fed by ordinary rainfall, and the Tooma River happens to be one of the best snow-fed rivers of the continent. It is strange but true that very often in years of drought, there are heavy falls of snow. Sir Philip McBride -Who told you that? that the Minister for Defence( Sir Philip McBride) is now awake. I have read the reports that have been published by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization. I am influenced, also, by a statement made by Sir Thomas Playford himself who told me that that information had been given to him by reputable authorities. Sir Philip McBride -He had incorrect information. think he had. He told me that it is generally accepted that in time of drought the strange phenomenon of additional snowfalls does, in fact, occur. I am prepared to accept the statement by the Premier in that respect. I will admit that the Premier, when he found himself confronted with a more skilful negotiator, seemed to lose all interest in the great advantage of snow-fed tributaries and was prepared to accept in their place, rain-fed tributaries which will be of no benefit when there is no rain. I find in this bill a deal with which I agree. It is true that this agreement has cleared up the question which was never previously quite clear of what constitutes the waters of the Murray-d o they include the water actually in the stream itself, the water that is dammed up in the locks, and iso forth? This agreement clarifies that point. South Australia's rights are now clear, and to that extent we must commend the proposals. Now we know that the whole of the water left in the river Murray itself is to be shared in the manner that I have just mentioned. Originally South Australia objected to the proposed diversion of the Tooma River on the grounds that it was being made by the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Authority and not by the States of New South Wales and Victoria. But the Minister for Supply has stated that South Australia did not press this point once agreement was reached on what the Minister is pleased to call the major question of the manner in which the Murray waters are to",71,River Murray Waters Bill 19s8 The People Of Australia Who Have Contri
214,Mr Clyde Cameron,I am pleased,72,River Murray Waters Bill 19s8 The People Of Australia Who Have Contri
215,Mr Clyde Cameron,"I do not be shared in time of drought. That is the first sell-out by the Premier of South Australia who had so much to say in the press about how he was going to fight for the rights of South Australia. Almost every day, at one time, one would read in the newspapers how the wicked Federal Government had deprived South Australia of its share of the river Murray waters. The Premier of South Australia did not wake up to what was going on until it was too late. He did nothing about this matter until some time in 1957. For nearly eight years, he was asleep and took no steps whatever to protect the water rights of South Australia as a consequence of the diversion. In 1948 or 1949, Sir Thomas Playford knew that there was to be a diversion from the Snowy into the Murray and through the tributaries of the Murrumbidgee. That was when the Premier should have moved in, at a time when the Commonwealth Government had not been committed, a9 it now is, to a tremendous expenditure of public revenue. That was when the Commonwealth Government could have brought some pressure to bear on Victoria and New South Wales. The Commonwealth could have said to those States: "" If you do not agree to let South Australia have a fair share, as far as we are concerned the scheme can stop "". Victoria and New South Wales, realizing how much they stood to lose by way of additional hydro-electric power and water, would have been compelled to talk common sense and accept a just settlement of the scheme. What happened? Sir Thomas Playford, after sleeping soundly for eight years, suddenly woke up that there was a Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Authority diverting water, which every schoolchild in Australia knew about from the third grade upwards. Only after the Commonwealth had spent more than £100,000,000 did he come to light and ask for his share. At that stage, New South Wales and Victoria decided that they would stand pat because the Commonwealth had spent £100,000,000 and if the agreement was not finalized, the Commonwealth probably would be pushed out by the High Court on the ground that it had no constitutional right to be there, thus relinquishing ownership of works that had already cost £100,000,000 of public money. The Minister in his second-reading speech went on to say something with which I cannot agree. He saidThe claim of South Australia to share in drought time in the diverted waters of the Snowy was clearly a matter of concern only to the States of New South Wales and Victoria. It was not a matter upon which the Commonwealth could be expected or indeed had any right to adjudicate. I disagree with the Minister. I say that the Commonwealth did have a right to adjudicate. It had a right at the very beginning. Perhaps the Government that commenced the scheme was at fault in not calling together the three States and saying, ""Before we embark on this £200,000,000 scheme we want you to reach agreement as to our constitutional rights to carry on the scheme and control the distribution of electricity and so on"". South Australian being vitally interested in the project, it would have been brought into the scheme at that point before New South Wales and Victoria could blackmail the Commonwealth, and to a lesser extent South Australia, by saying, "" If you do not agree to what we want, you will be ousted because the Commonwealth has no constitutional right to be there "". At that time, the Commonwealth probably would have been able to obtain an agreement. It is true that the Government which started the scheme perhaps did not have time to complete those negotiations, but at any rate the succeeding government early in 1950 could have done so before too much money had been spent. But it was not done. That was the great mistake of the whole project. Another concession which the South Australian Government makes is that, in a period of restrictions, New South Wales and Victoria will be permitted to use the water from the river Murray in excess of the quantity to which they are otherwise entitled and to replace that excess from any tributary of the Murray below Albury in such a way that the rights of the other States are not prejudiced. The Minister saidThe significance of this requirement is that New South Wales and Victoria may take water out of the main stream of the Murray, where they need it, and replace it from tributaries. That represents another sell-out by South Australia, because the way the agreement previously operated, South Australia had 3/13ths of the water that was released from Albury, plus any water not used by New South Wales and Victoria which flowed into the Murray below Albury. But under this proposal New South Wales and Victoria can use more than their 5/13ths shares of the Hume dam and compensate South Australia by counting the water that they cannot use from the Darling, the Lachlan and the Murrumbidgee as being water to compensate for the water that is released from the Hume dam. But has not been altered-that is, the original agreement to which the Opposition took exception when it came before Parliament in May this year. At that time the Opposition complained that South Australia was being forced to allow the water that is diverted from the Tooma to be carved up in equal parts between Victoria and New South Wales. South Australia would thus lose her 3/13ths of the water, representing some 70,000 acre feet per annum. That part of the agreement is still unaltered. I compliment the Prime Minister( Mr initiative and have a period of restriction Menzies) on his skill at being able to put it over this smart Premier of South Australia. I do not know how he did it, but the fact is that he did it. Sir Thomas Playford has gone back to South Australia and has not said one word about the way he has been chiselled out of his share of the Tooma waters. He thinks he has had a victory. He thinks he has beaten Menzies, Cahill, and that clown Bolte-that is the word he used, and I think he is probably right there. He tells the people of South Australia that he has three scalps on his belt. But when we have a good look at this matter, we find that Sir Thomas Playfordls scalp is on their belts, because what he regards as a victory simply amounts to this: The Government says, "" We will pinch from you 70,000 acre feet of water and then we will give back to you 70,000 acre feet of water that you are entided to anyhow, and what is left over we will let you share in on the basis of 3/13ths of the total "". That, to Sir Thomas, is the wonderful proposition. I do not think it is wonderful. I think it is just an example of the Premier being soundly asleep for eight years while South Australia's rights were being stolen-no t only the rights of the present generation .addition ,of subrclause .(3.) (b) of clause 45 which but the rights of future generations. The provides that no State shall .receive less water ,bg agreement ;that we are ratifying tto-night Teason of the Tooma diversion than it would will be used for generations, or indeed centuries, to come, to deprive the people of South Australia of their just share of the waters of the river Murray. If ever a man was soundly defeated it was Sir Thomas Playford with respect to this matter. The more one examines this agreement, the more loopholes one discovers. It will be seen from the Minister's speech that New South Wales and Victoria required as a condition to their meeting the this part of the agreement South Australian claim that the River Murray Waters Agreement should be amended to make it mandatory upon the River Murray Commission to declare a period of restriction when the water stored in the Hume reservoir and Lake Victoria falls to 1,000,000 acre feet. That means that if there is 2,000,000 acre feet at Albury and none at Lake Victoria, the commission could theoretically fail to declare a period of restriction. The result would be that South Australia would be in a position where New South Wales and Victoria, if it suited them, could take the declared, but South Australia, if the tables were turned, could not do so. Sir Wilfrid Kent Hughes -If there were 2,000,000 acre feet of water at Albury it would be running over the spillway. minded that the Hume dam is to be enlarged so that it will hold more than 2,000,000 acre feet-2,500,00 0 acre feet I think the honourable member for Chisholm suggests. I remind honourable members that South Australia pays its share of the cost of raising the wall of the Hume dam. South Australia pays its share of the cost of all the other locks and arrangements on the river to control the flow of fhe water. Anybody would think that South Australia paid absolutely nothing towards the cost of control of the river waters. Anybody would think that South Australia paid nothing towards the cost of the diversion of the Snowy waters into the river Murray and Murrumbidgee River. Now we come to another of the Minister's statements about the agreement. He saidIt does this for periods >of restriction by the : fhave .received'had'that-diversion not been made.",72,River Murray Waters Bill 19s8 The People Of Australia Who Have Contri
216,Mr Clyde Cameron,"I am reWhat <a wonderful concession! That is marvellous! We are not to receive any less! But we expected to get more, as we are justly entitled to do, since 648,000 acre feet of additional water is to be diverted into the Murray. One of the great .points in the Minister's speech is that the -agreement guarantees that we shall not get less! As I have said, what a wonderful -concession that is! The agreement should provide, not that we shall not get less, but that we shall get more. When one takes into account the diversion of extra water -into the Murray, South Australia should be .guaranteed more. Summed up, one can say that, out of all the diversions that are to be made. New South Wales will get 433,000 acre feet more than before; Victoria will get about 180,000 acre feet more than before; and South Australia will get a miserable pittance of about 35,000 acre feet more. As a South Australian, I do not regard that as a good proposition. I think that, having regard to the fact that New South Wales and Victoria are to share between them the whole of the hydro-electric power, which will be provided at a much cheaper cost than that at which South Australia will ever be able to generate -thermal power, South Australia should receive a greater share of the additional water -even than its three-thirteenths of the total volume of water provided by diversions, '-including the diversions of the Tooma, Eucumbene and Snowy Rivers.

I should like the Prime Minister, if he intends to honour the House by participating in this debate, to tell us whether that means that the water diverted into the river Murray by way of the Murrumbidgee and other tributaries is to be included in the whole of the amount to be divided between South Australia, Victoria and New South Wales. If it is, and the right honourable gentleman says so, he will defeat the whole of my opposition in one fell swoop. But I have a very strong suspicion that it is not so, although the Minister for Supply-pro bably in ignorance of the facts-ha s stated that it is so. I have a nasty feeling that the water diverted into the Murrumbidgee by way of the Eucumbene will not be included when South Australia's entitlement to river Murray water is ultimately determined in times of drought. The House has been very patient, Mr Speaker, and I thank honourable members for their courtesy in listening to me on this highly important, though rather involved, matter without interjection or interruption. The Opposition supports the bill, reluctantly, and for two reasons only. First, it gives South Australia a little more than would have been the case under the agreement that we ratified last May. Secondly, from the national point of view, it finally paves the way for settling beyond doubt once and for all the Commonwealth's right to construct works of the kind being undertaken by the great Snowy Mountains Hydroelectric Authority, and to control and generally superintend that authority.

It will eliminate trans-shipment costs, and a more effective use of locomotives and rolling stock will be possible. It will enable higher speeds to be maintained and there will be fewer delays. The Minister said that on a conservative estimate the saving each year would be £1,700,000. That simply means that this project will have paid for itself within less than six years, which I think is a very important matter to consider. This also provides a very sound argument why the other two projects should be proceeded with as urgent matters. The Port PirieBroken Hill and the Kalgoorlie-Fremantle links could be commenced at once, and they likewise would pay for themselves in a very short time. When the two parliamentary committees, one from each side of the House, recommended these two projects, the Western Australian Premier asked that the Kalgoorlie-Fremantle link be given a high priority. He raised the matter again only last week in the Legislative Assembly, saying that he had asked the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) to agree to commence work on that section before the end of March, 1959. The committee of Government supporters, when presenting its report to the Parliament, emphasized the importance of this link, not only in itself but also as a means of relieving unemployment in Western Australia. The unemployment position there is worse than it was when these reports were made two years ago. That is an added reason why that project should be proceeded with as an urgent measure. We know, of course, that the link that is being undertaken will save the States quite a lot of money now expended in transferring goods at the break of gauge. The abolition of the transfer point at Kalgoorlie would also save the Commonwealth and the States quite a considerable amount of money. Transfer costs at that point average about £75,000 annually. If we could obtain that link, fast, efficient freight trains would reI am very glad to support this bill, and duce costs within Western Australia and gain more traffic for the railways, just as the completion of the Wodonga-Melbourne link will bring more traffic. The journey from Perth to Sydney, which now takes 89 hours and involves five changes of train would take 48 hours without a change. The trip from Perth to Adelaide, which now takes 48 hours, would be reduced to 36 hours without changing trains. The journey from Perth to Brisbane, which now takes 117 hours, and involves six changes, could be reduced to 63 hours without change. An important point about the Western Australian link is that it would absorb quite a number of unskilled workers who comprise the major part of the work force on such projects. As a consequence, other workers would also get employment. The timber mills would be working again to a greater capacity and other industries would be stimulated. Men and materials are available for this work. Finance and initiative are all that is lacking. The State wants to proceed; we are just waiting for the Commonwealth to do something about it. The completion of both of those projects would mean that we would have a standard gauge link right across Australia joining the State capitals. One of the most important points which I think needs emphasizing, and which is mentioned in the bill, is the relationship to Australia's defence and development of those projects. During the last war troop movements were delayed at break-of-gauge points. In addition, rolling stock could not be moved from the 4-ft. 8i-in. gauge in New South Wales to the Trans-Australian and Centralian lines. That defect will be removed by the completion of the two projects. 1 do not want to keep the House any longer in regard to this very important matter, except to emphasize that the Opposition supports the measure. However, we ask the Government to consider immediately going on with the other projects, particularly the Kalgoorlie-Fremantle link, work on which tbe Premier of Western Australia, in a letter to the Prime Minister, has asked to be considered immediately by the Commonwealth. Of course, so far, the Prime Minister has not replied to that letter. I am sure that the House will give it not only unanimous, but enthusiastic support, because I believe that the project covered by the bill is a really great thing, not only in itself, but as the precursor of fuller standardization throughout Australia.

219,Mr Wentworth (Mackellar) [11.11].,"members rail standardization committee uncompleted work. 1 believe that the time put forward this new concept of trying to has now come for us to be thinking about standardize trunk lines first and thereby our second step. That second step is the producing, I believe, a workable scheme link from Broken Hill down to Port Pirie for getting some immediate benefit from with a standard-gauge connection into standardization. There are just three points Adelaide. This involves the reballasting of that I want to make. First, I believe that the line from Parkes, in New South Wales, this bill gives expression to the correct to Broken Hilla work which, I believe, priority, and that the Government has made can be undertaken at reasonably short the correct decision. Secondly, I believe that notice. There is still some surveying to be the thing should not stop here. In fact, done south-westwards from Broken HillI have no doubt that the Government in before work could be started on an adequate due course, and in accordance with a scale. HereI think we should not be proper programme, will proceed with delaying the survey. The House will further works of standardization. Thirdly, remember that the Premier of SouthI should like to say something about the Australia is already making fuller proposals operation of the new line to be put down in this regard, and has submitted a proposiunder this measure. Of all the lines to be done, this is the which the Government had already adopted, one which will give us the highest immeand which it has in fact observed in relation diate return. I think it is the line which to the line from Albury into Melbourne. has the greatest practical and immediate importance; but I do not feel it is the only line. The Government members rail standardization committee said that, in its Pirie section to be pushed forward. There opinion, two lines were of equal priority. is already a 5 ft. 3 in. line from Port Pirie They were the Melbourne to Albury line into Adelaide, as honourable members know. and the Broken Hill-Port Pirie-Adelaide It is important that, in putting in a standard line. The committee recommended that the line, we do not in any way disrupt the line to be started first should be the line internal pattern of traffic on the South in respect of which the State concerned Australian railways. Some years ago, a first expressed its willingness to make the proposal was put forward, and recognized requisite arrangements with the Commonas technically practicable, by the then Comwealth. As it happened, that State was missioner for Railways in South Australia. Victoria. If we had done the other line, That proposal was for the laying of a third there would have been further delays. The rail at least along part of the 135-mile work would have taken longer to start. stretch from Port Pirie to Adelaide. This, For that reason alone I believe we have if it is practicable, would be the cheapest made the correct decision. The next thing to do, surely, is to get on main marshalling yards, and certainly over with the link from Broken Hill to Port the last bit of the line into Adelaide itself. Pirie and through to Adelaide. I am very glad to remind the House that the Premier construction of this line, which will start of South Australia, Sir Thomas Playford, the flow of traffic right through from the is now fully in accord with the immediate Trans-Continental 4-ft. 8i-in. gauge, which construction of this line, and it is the next runs from Kalgoorlie to Port Pirie and from on the programme. One of the principles that we suggested 4-ft. 8i-in. system in the rest of Australia, in our report was that we should endeavour and will remove the isolation of the Transto concentrate our resources on one line at Continental line. There are really great a time, not necessarily delaying the start of advantages in pushing this forward, and I the next line until the first had been comam sure that the members of the committee, pleted, but doing it in some kind of reasonindividually and collectively, will agree that able priority so that we could be getting action on it will be fully justified. returns from our investment and not have too much idle money lying around in itself to be the first government, since the F.5890/58 -R -[70 ] 1 tion for a preliminary survey to cost, I think, about £50,000. This is a principle It seems to me that the time is now ripe for the survey on the Broken Hill to Port way to do it, but it would be necessary to segregate the traffic at the junctions and the There will be great advantages from the Port Augusta to Marree, on to the main I believe that the Government has shown Bruce-Page Government which put in the standard line from the north coast of New South Wales to Brisbane, that has made any real practical move towards standardization. I am sure that the Government will follow up the excellent work that it has started in connection with the project that we are now ratifying in this bill. 1 feel a very great confidence that the Government will go forward in the future as it has done in the past, and will do the thing in a practical way instead of just talking about it. Here we have something concrete. Already the work is in progress. Only a few weeks ago I took an opportunity to inspect the work which is being done on the section of line between Wodonga and Melbourne, and to look at the plans which are being made for the completion of that excellent job. It is heartening to know, even before this bill is ratified, that, in line with the arrangeof bogie stock in its place, by the installaments that the Government made, actual work is appearing on the ground. The next step, as I have said, must be the Broken Hill to Port Pirie and Adelaide line. But that is not the end. We must get to work on the Kalgoorlie-Perth-Fremantle link. Here again some sort of survey appears to be justified, and I hope that the necessary surveying work will be put in hand without delay. I am hoping that the Western Australian Premier will show in this matter the same vigour that is already being shown by the South Australian Premier. I know, because I was over there with the committee, that there were at one time divided opinions in the Western Australian Government as to the desirability of this line. I hope that those these matters in more detail and at greater doubts have now been resolved. I believe that they will be, if they have not already been resolved. But the first thing is for the Premier of Western Australia to do what the Premier of South Australia has done and start in on a survey of the work. It may be that if there is any unused labour or resources in Western Australia this project can be started out of its turn, and so employ labour and resources which would otherwise be unemployed to do some of the work. That is a matter of priority which I think should most properly be decided by the Western Australian authorities themselves. But the first thing required is a more vigorous and practical approach. I have already referred to the line taken by* the Premier of Victoria in the first place,, followed by the Premier of South Australia, and I hope that the Premier of Western) Australia will follow in the same excellent tradition. Finally, I hope that this line from Wodonga to Melbourne will not be just one more railway line. I hope that it will provide an example of new ways of running the railways and that it will import into Australia a new efficiency in railway practice. One of the most heartening features of it is that the operators of the railway systems concerned are talking in terms of proper terminals where interstate traffic can be properly and economically handled to the advantage of all concerned. By the adoption of dieselization and proper rolling stock, by the elimination of the four-wheeler stock from the through runs and the putting tion of proper containers and piggy back systems we have the opportunity of importing into the Australian railway system an example of how efficiently a railway can be run. If this is done I have no fears for the competitive position of the railways in their proper sphere. It is true that the future of the railways in the long-distance field lies in goods rather than passenger traffic, but I hope that passenger traffic will not be neglected on this run. I hope that proper, comfortable sleeping cars will be provided to attract the travelling public. This will help to make this line the paying bonanza which I am sure that it will be. Mr Speaker, I should like to traverse length, but at this hour of the night there is no need to emphasize the obvious or repeat what has been said in the reports which have been presented to this House. This project is now being proceeded with. We, on the Government side, know that this is not the end; we know that the plan will be carried through, and that we will get our trunk lines standardized and then we can think of the next stage. [11.24] -It is refreshing to find real unanimity between members on the Government side and members of the Opposition concerning something which is happening in the last stages of the Government's life.",77,Railway Standardization New Jump In And Try To Have The Broken Hill South Wales And Victoria Agreement Bill 1958
220,Mr E. James Harrison (Blaxland),"If the Government or the Prime Minister{ Mr Menzies) had given effect to proposals which the Opposition put forward quite early in the life of this Government and appointed an all-party committee on transport, probably a standard-gauge railway would have been in operation much earlier. My purpose in rising is to point to one or two features which should be uppermost in the minds of those most concerned with the change in the transport system which is taking place in Australia. It is a fact that when this Government came into office in 1949 the question of standardization of railway gauges had been very capably dealt with and reported upon by the Government then going out of office. During the life of this Government transportation costs in Australia have risen to a level which is nigh to breaking the back of our economy. When we think of the standardization of railway gauges in this year, 1958, we do not think in terms of new railways being constructed as they were constructed ten years ago; we think in terms of new lines such as that constructed between Marree and Stirling North. As a result of the new form of diesel-electric traction, 5,500 tons can be hauled at high, speed over that line at a cost reduced to a figure never before contemplated in this or any other country. When I was in Brisbane to-day, I heard This would be an enormous advantage if some comment about the proposal to spend a diesel-electric service were put into £25,000,000 to restore the 3-ft. 6-in. gauge ooeration between Mount Isa and the coast. line between Mount Isa and the coast. I could not help but think that would be a waste of public money when diesel-electric speech, played on the fact that there would transport was available. That £25,000,000 he great soeed on the service between would go a long way towards providing a Sydney and Melbourne. On that we agree, transport system between Mount Isa and because it is essential. It is the case with the coast similar to that operating between the service operating now between Sydney Marree and Stirling North. One important and Brisbane. But because of diesel advantage would be that all the iron ore electrification, the economy of towns at Mount Isa, right down to the last ounce, between Svdnev and Brisbane, such as Taree could be carried and utilized. At the and Grafton, has received a setback. We present time, ore with 4 per cent, or less find that as many as 50 or 60 families are iron content is left in the ground because no longer required in those places because the cost of transporting it would be too high. of this new form of transport. Despite the Our whole economy rests upon the capacity great increase in the haulage of freight in of this Government, or whatever government follows it on 22nd November, to reall parts of the country, the membership organize successfully the whole transport of the union to which I have the honour system of Australia. The honourable member for Mackellar Australia for three years. If we give effect ( Mr Wentworth) said that he hoped there to the suggestion of the honourable member would be a re-orientation of our thinking for Mackellar ( Mr Wentworth), over the on railway transport systems. Because the New South Wales Labour Government has adopted, over the last five years, the system of railway transport which the honourable member mentioned to-night, that system is now able to compete with any form of transport between the city and the country. This month the Victorian Railways will begin to operate a diesel-electric system from the fruit-growing areas to Melbourne which will leave highway transport for dead. In the border press this week there have been accusations of cut-throat methods in transport competition. The very things that have been spoken about to-night are already in operation. The Commonwealth Railways to-day provide a classic example of what can be done in modern rail transport such as is possible with diesel-electric locomotives. According to the report on Commonwealth Railways operations for the year 1957-58, earnings increased during the year by £384,243, whereas working expenses during that period increased by only £14,067. That is the story running through the Commonwealth Railways ever since diesel-electric traction became available to the service. One great advantage is that there is no need now for watering places, and the crossing stations that were necessary in the old days have been eliminated. The Minister, in his second-reading to belong is falling at the rate of 250 a year, and that has been going on throughout next five years the New South Wales railway system will require 6,000 or 7,000 fewer employees. This Government and other governments of the day must keep in mind that we are obliged to ensure that our economy is stretched so that men who are displaced as a consequence of more modern transport will not be left on the scrapheap. We must find some way to train them for other work. I make the plea now for this to be done to help those who have been displaced and who will be displaced. This modern form of transport will give a tremendous fillip to the Australian economy. It will reduce considerably the cost of transport, which now represents 32 per cent, or 33 per cent, of the total cost Railways Commissioner for this year shows of goods. We must understand that what is happening now between Albury and Melbourne is only the start of a great forward move in the re-organization of Australia's rail transport system. Rail transport over long hauls will always defeat any other form of transport, provided it is given a proper basis on which to operate. One point that disturbs me is that the States again will be required to pay interest on their share of the money needed to build these new railways. The States are already overloaded with interest rates. New South Wales is now paying interest to the tune of £14,000,000 or £15,000,000 a year on money used for railways that were constructed before I was born and in subsequent years. This state of affairs cannot continue. In re-organizing the railway system throughout Australia we must remember that half our population is to be found in the capital cities, some of which are 3,000 miles apart. Let me again make the point that those now engaged in rail transport will be severely affected by the new methods. However, railway men will not be the only ones affected. A great change can be expected in the road transport system. Only recently, I discussed this matter with some of those who are concerned with road transport. As I say, the press to-day is crying out that the railways are entering into cut throat competition. However, the railways in their approach to the problem to-day will outstrip road transport in the future on long-distance hauls, and that will be a good thing. In extending diesel electrification, we should be careful to ensure that at all times we have a sufficient quantity of oil to meet our needs. We should provide for the possibility of a reduction in the quantity of oil available to us. However, let me say that on long hauls such as we have between Marree and Stirling North, between Mount Isa and the coast, and between our capital cities, diesel electrification will completely transform rail transportation. The honourable member for Mackellar suggested that the next step should be the standardization of the line from Adelaide to Broken Hill. Despite the reports of the Government committee and the Opposition committee, my inclination at this stage is to standardize the line from Kalgoorlie to Perth. The report of the Commonwealth the tremendous increase that is taking place in haulage on Commonwealth lines from east to west. With the tremendous increase that can be expected in tbe volume of freight, I think that the next most economic stage would be from Kalgoorlie to Perth. At the moment, it costs more to haul a loaded truck from Kalgoorlie to Port Pirie than it would to haul the same amount of freight from Sydney to Perth, if we had a through run. Once we get rid of the break at Albury, the break at Kalgoorlie will be the most costly spot in the rail transport system in Australia. A close analysis of what is happening will show that the delay there is costing a vast sum of money. I should like to put the case of the men who will operate, as a national service, this new form of rail transport mentioned by the honourable member for Mackellar. They will run a fast service in a way that will bring great benefits to the community and to the country generally. They are en1 titled to some return for the effort they will put into this service. Throughout the world to-day, a different system of payment to that generally accepted in Australia is adopted for those who operate rail services. I am pleased that the Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Harold Holt) is in the chamber, because I put it to him that the time has arrived when the system accepted in Germany, Great Britain and America for the payment of those who operate fast services in the national interest should be adopted by the arbitral system of this country. At present we have standing in our way the fact that there is a belief on the part of the arbitration system that anything other than an eight-hour day or a 40-hour week is an interference with the standard working week. That principle is not accepted in any other part of the free world for those who work these fast services. I am sure that if the honourable member for Mackellar examined this point he would agree with me that the men who run the services should receive some recognition for their efforts in the national interests. I ask the Government not to delay any longer in exploiting our capacity to expand. Valuable assets are available to us and we should lay the rails that are necessary to give to this country a railway system that will substantially reduce the impact of transwhen the total mileage of tracks in this port costs on our economy of transport. intention to take up the time of the House at this hour, but I want to take the opportunity of complimenting the Minister for Supply( Mr Townley) on achieving what so many other Ministers have failed to achieve. In saying that I do not wish to reflect on the trains at Albury and goods have had to be capabilities of previous Ministers. The whole history of attempts to standardize the rail gauges throughout Australia is one of frustrations. Numerous conferences have been held over a period of more than 70 years, but parochial interests and the failure Railways in New South Wales, a Mr Eddy, to face up to the task involved have resulted in a series of pigeon-holed reports. This bill is the first step towards linking Australia's capital cities with standard gauge railway lines. I hope that it will be the beginning of a plan to convert, ultimately, the whole of the railway system to standard gauge. This problem, which has faced Australia since the first line was laid between Melbourne and Sandridge in 1854, is not one which has been peculiar to this country. As late as 1871 railways were operating in the United States of America on 23 different gauges, from three feet to six feet. At that time, I believe, the United States had more miles of railway track than we have to-day. Even though the railways in that country were owned privately, it was realized that, in the interests both of the companies and of the country, it was essential that standardization be achieved. At a conference of the presidents of the different railway companies, which was held in 1885, it was decided to pursue a policy of standardization. Within two years all the railways in the United States were operating on standard gauge. Experience in the United Kingdom was not very much different. There were so many gauges in operation in 1846 that a royal commission on railway gauges reported that it was imperative that a wider spread of the evil should be prevented. At that time rail gauges in the United Kingdom varied between two feet and seven feet. By 1892 the whole of the railway system had been converted to standard gauge. There is no need for me to repeat the story of how Australia came to be burdened with so many different gauges. The first move for standardization was made in 1857, country was less than 200, and before any of the 3-ft. 6-in. gauge lines had been laid. Since that date, many committees have been appointed to inquire into the break-of-gauge problem. They have all delivered their reports and made recommendations but very little action has been taken. Since 1883, 75 years ago, passengers have had to change trans-shipped there. It is estimated that the cost of trans-shipping goods at Albury is now in the vicinity of £800,000 a year. In 1889, the Chief Commissioner for directed the attention of the then Premier, Sir Henry Parkes, to the urgent need for standardization. In 1897 the Railway Commissioners of Australia passed a resolution concerning the necessity for a uniform gauge. At that time the total length of track in Victoria, New South Wales and South Australia was less than 8,000 miles, and the total cost of providing a uniform system was little more than £2,000,000. In 1911 standardization was recommended as a defence aid by the war railway council. In 1913 a committee of the leading railway engineers of the Commonwealth and the States recommended the adoption of a standard gauge. At that time the cost of conversion had increased to more than £37,000,000. In 1921 a royal commission reported to a conference of State Premiers and the Prime Minister, and it was resolved "" That the adoption of a uniform gauge is, in the opinion of this conference, essential to the",79,Railway Standardization New Jump In And Try To Have The Broken Hill South Wales And Victoria Agreement Bill 1958
221,Mr Fox (Henty) [11.39],"It is not mydevelopment and safety of the Commonwealth "". The estimated cost of the complete conversion was then more than £93,000,000. Again no action was taken. In 1945 the Clapp report was tabled. Although this report also recommended standardization, negotiations between the States and Commonwealth broke down. At that time the estimated cost of conversion to standard gauge was nearly £120,000,000. The bill now before us is the first move of any consequence towards bringing about a standardized Australian railway system. Although it provides for the conversion only of the section of line between Albury and Melbourne, at a cost of a litde more than £10,000,000, when the work has been completed there will be a standard-gauge line from Brisbane to Melbourne. Not only will this add to the comfort and convenience of passengers; it should also result in lower freight rates on this section of line, with a consequent increase in business for both the New South Wales and Victorian railways, and it should be a positive step towards enabling the railway systems of both States to operate eventually at a profit, instead of being continual drains on the pockets of the taxpayers. At the same time, it should divert to the railways quite a lot of the heavy traffic which is at present causing a great deal of damage to our interstate highways. I wish to take the opportunity to congratulate the Minister on the work he has done in order to bring this bill before the House, and I confidently look forward to the future presentation of other bills for the linking of Broken Hill with Port Pirie, and Kalgoorlie with Fremantle, using standard-gauge lines. Mr Deputy Speaker, this bill proves two things: First, that there would be no standardization of gauges, ancl, equally and Port Pirie, carries probably heavier important, of railway equipment in Ausfreight traffic than any other line in Australia, if it were not for the initiative of the tralia. It is a line that was crying out for Commonwealth Government. Secondly, it standardization for years. One has only proves that the Commonwealth would not to refer to the reports of the South Aushave taken this initiative if it were not for tralian Railways Commissioner to see the the vigilance and pressure of private disparity between the volume of traffic on members on both sides of this chamber. the two sections of line. I refer to the The bill is a result of separate, but entirely latest report of the Commissioner for the contemporaneous and similar reports year ended 30th June, 1957. The freight presented two years ago by Government passing from South Australia to Victoria members and Opposition members. I believe through the Mount Gambier section that it is necessary to maintain this continuing vigilance with regard to rail standardization for two reasons. The first is our experience with the 1949 standardization agreement between the Commonwealth and South Australia. The second reason is the continuing unawareness at the top levels of government of the continuing need for standardization, as revealed yesterday by the answers of the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) to questions asked by the honourable member for Stirling( Mr Webb) and by me. First, I shall refer to what has happened under the 1949 standardization agreement. The proposal was that two sections of the South Australian railways should be converted to standard gauge-first , that between Port Pirie and Cockburn-and thence, of course, from Cockburn to Broken Hilland, secondly, the south-eastern section between Adelaide and the Victorian border, through Mount Gambier. It was quite obvious that, in any responsible sense of economic priority or strategic prioritybecause strategic factors are most important in considering standardization of gauges and equipment-the former section was overwhelmingly more important. Nevertheless, this Government has allowed the South Australian Government to spend Commonwealth money in converting the latter section. This year we see the completion of the conversion to 5 feet 3 inches gauge of the whole of the railways between Adelaide and the Victorian border, via Mount Gambier, South Australia undertaking at its own expense, at some subsequent time, to bring the gauge back to 4 feet 8 i inches. We paid the full amount required for that work-abou t £5,000,000-and it was of very little economic and no stategic consequence in this country. The other section, between Broken Hill",82,Railway Standardization New Jump In And Try To Have The Broken Hill South Wales And Victoria Agreement Bill 1958
222,Mr Whitlam (Werriwa) [11.46],"amounted to 32,813 tons and from Victoria to South Australia 17,775 tons. But the tonnage going from Port Pirie to Broken Hill was 146,369 tons and from Broken HiU to Port Pirie 850,059 tons. That was 20 times as great a tonnage on the northern section as on the southern section. It is plain that the Broken Hill-Port Pirie line should have been done first and a government which had a proper sense of responsibility in economic and strategic matters would have done it and would not have delayed all this time before even coming to a decision on the standardization of this very important section. The Commonwealth Railways Commissioner, in every one of the annual reports he has presented since he was appointed ten years ago, has pointed out that that section is of prime importance not only to his railway but also to most other railways in Australia. Secondly, I come to the unawareness in high places of what is going on in rail standardization. My colleague, the honourable member for Stirling( Mr Webb) asked the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) yesterday whether he had received a request from the Premier of Western AustraJia asking that the Commonwealth Government consider the standardization of the railway between Kalgoorlie and Fremantle. The honourable member askedIf such a request has been received, will the right honourable gentleman please explain the attitude of the Government to it? The right honourable gendeman replied to the questionI shall find out whether there is such a request and I shall advise the honourable member. I was not a little astonished to hear the reply, because I had received a month ago, on 28th August, from the Minister for Supply( Mr Townley), representing the Minister for Shipping and Transport (Senator Paltridge), an answer to a question as to what stage had been reached in any negotiations which the Commonwealth had had with South Australia and Western Australia for the standardization of the section of the line I have mentioned. I asked when negotiations had last taken place or when communications had last passed between the parties. It emerged from the Minister's reply that discussions had taken place between the Commonwealth Railways Commissioner and the Silverton Tramway Company which runs the section between Cockburn and Broken Hill in 1952 and had not been pursued. But the Premier of South Australia wrote to the Prime Minister on 12th June indicating that his Government was now willing to undertake standardization of the northern narrow gauge system in his State, and requested the provision of Commonwealth funds for preliminary work. The Prime Minister informed the Premier of South Australia on l l t h July, 1958, that the Commonwealth was willing to give his proposals "" careful and prompt attention as soon as details are worked out "". The reply given to me by the Minister for Supply continuedThe Premier of Western Australia wrote to the Prime Minister on 23rd June, 19S8, asking that work on standardizing the Perth-Kalgoorlie line be put in hand during 1958-59. This submission will be considered having regard to rail standardization policy and current commitments in respect thereto. After hearing the Prime Minister's reply to the honourable member for Stirling, I asked him whether he remembered this correspondence and whether he had yet repUed to the Premier of Western Australia in the fourteen weeks which had since elapsed. The right honourable gentleman repliedAs the honourable member appears to be well informed on the date I shall accept his statement, of course, that there was a letter on 23rd June. I myself do not remember the date or the circumstances. As to whether there has been an answer, I should think that there has been no answer, in point of substance at any rate, as yet. I am surprised that the Prime Minister should have forgotten correspondence he had from the Premiers of South AustraUa and Western Australia; that he should have forgotten the reply that he sent to the Premier of South Australia; that he should have forgotten to reply to the Premier of Western Australia; and that his oversight should have persisted over a period of three months. Since the right honourable gentleman has the courtesy to be sitting at the table at this moment, I hope that his oversight might be admitted and deplored by him because, as he knows, the transport costs of Australia are at least three times as high as those in any other country. We are spending a third of our national income on transport, and no other country is spending more than one-tenth of its national income in that way. That is the greatest challenge to the reduction of the cost of living or the improvement of the standing of living in Australia. I would hope that even before this Parliament rises in a few hours early in the morning, we would not be left without some decision as to what the Premiers of South Australia and Western Australia might plan for the current financial year in accordance with the correspondence they have initiated with the Prime Minister and which he so far has overlooked. put the record straight in connection with the standardization of railways and the request which has been submitted by the Premier of Western Australia to the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies). I do this in view of the remarks that have been made by the honourable member for Werriwa( Mr achieve the standardization of railways if it Whitlam) who apparently is unaware of current events. He has accused the Prime Minister of having forgotten a reply that he made to the Premier of Western Australia or the correspondence which has passed between them. I wish to quote from the record of proceedings in the Legislative Assembly of Western Australia of Thursday, 25th September-onl y a week ago-whe n Mr Watts, Leader of the Country party, asked the Premier of Western Australia, Mr Hawke, this questionWhat were the terms of the proposal forwarded ment, can decide whether they are reasonby the Premier to the Prime Minister on 23rd June, 19S8, relating to standardization of the Kalgoorlie-Perth railway which were referred to Australia put forward a definite proposal by the Minister for Transport in the House of Representatives on 28th August last? I ask the honourable member for Werriwa to listen carefully as I repeat that the questioner asked "" what were the terms of the proposal "". The Premier repliedMy letter of 23rd June asked the right honorinformation, but how current is it? I was able the Prime Minister that the Commonwealth Government consider putting the KalgoorlieFremantle railway gauge proposals in hand by 31st March, 1959, for the purpose of creating employment. In reply, the Prime Minister, whilst Perth railway were put forward by the not holding out any promise of any action, requested whatever detailed information may be available. The position, therefore, must rest there at present. This relates to last week and the Prime Minister is obviously now awaiting information from Western Australia. This has become a general practice in all States. supplied. of the proceedings of the Parliament of be unjust to the State. Western Australia. The information was not supplied up to 25 th September, which was last Thursday. This is in accordance with what happens concerning Labour governments in the States and has been happening over a number of years. They put up proposals in nebulous terms and suggest that the Commonwealth Government should accept those proposals and do something about them. It is not reasonable to expect a responsible government automatically to say that it will accede to a request without getting down to fundamental terms and conditions. This is characteristic of what has been going on all the time. I am anxious to see something done to assist Western Australia. Let us will assist unemployment. But I am not prepared, as a responsible member of this Parliament, to start something without having a basis on which it will rest. Every Western Australian member in this House is anxious to see assistance given to Western Australia, but, at least, the State Government should state what is necessary. It should put forward concrete proposals which should include terms and conditions which will be acceptable to it so that this Government and, ultimately, this Parliaable or not.

The Leader of the Country Party in Western Australia asked the Premier what were the terms of the proposal.

There is no State which is more jealous of its rights than Western Australia. What is the secret which the Premier will not reveal? That was the only information that was asked for and the Premier did not give it. The only reasonable assumption, thereby the honourable member for East Sydney fore, is that the Premier has put forward when he was a Minister. a suggestion without saying exactly what Western Australia wants, and has left it entirely in the hands of this Government to do something.

It will not help Western Australia directly if the line is standardized, but it will be a great facility to the traders in the eastern States. Because of that, those States or this Government should bear a bigger proportion of the cost of standardizing the line than was suggested Thursday, 2nd October, 1958.

228,Mr Coutts (Griffith) [12.6 A.m.],"Iraised in this House. In the mine-fields of New South Wales we have seen the introduction of mechanization and the displacement of miners from industry. A result of the proposal before this House will be a great displacement of workers from their normal caiiings. When the proposal is carried into effect Albury will cease to be one of the principal railway towns of Australia and will become just another station through which the Melbourne express will pass. Thegreatest single factor contributing to theprosperity of the City of Albury is the transhipment business. A Government supporter has just reminded the House that it costs £800,000 per year to tranship goods at Albury. That means that £800,000 is spent each year in Albury to pay the wages of the men who are engaged in this most important transhipping industry. Under this new proposal, that money will be lost to the city of Albury. Several hundred men who are now engaged in that transhipment of goods will lose their jobs. Like the honourable member for Blaxland( Mr E. James Harrison), I , too, am interested in what will happen to those men. We know that it is proposed that this undertaking shall be completed within four years. That means that in four years' time hundreds of employees at Albury will lose their jobs. We all know how the Government deals with matters piecemeal. It does not deal with them in an overall manner, and I am now reminding the Government that these men will lose their jobs. What will be done? I make a plea for something to be done to ensure that these men will be suitably placed in employment and not left completely abandoned, as the miners on the northern coal-fields of New South Wales have been left. I am informed by the Premier of Vicand faster running. toria, who is my authority in this regard, that a considerable amount of work has already been undertaken on the Albury to Government in this place offered to the Melbourne line and that it was undertaken mainland States a proposal which in effect to relieve unemployment caused by the would have provided for the standardizadismissal of employees from the Victorian tion of the railways of Australia.

Because of speakers,, is absolutely worn out and in the increased speed and efficiency which order to meet the increased production of dieselization will bring to the industry, there the northern mining fields it is necessary to will be a considerable reduction in the number of running staff engaged in the railways. The honourable member for Blaxland has told us that within a few years, owing to dieselization and modernization, the number of employees in the New South Wales Government Railways will be reduced by about 6,000 men. A similar reduction will occur proportionately throughout all the States because of the programme of modernization in the various railway systems. This is something that we should worry about. Unemployment is growing in Australia and this modernization proposal, which we all support, will tend to increase the number of unemployed in Australia because not so many men will be required to dothe jobs. That is no argument for not proceeding with the proposal, but the onus is on this Government to make provision for those who will be displaced from their employment. They must be absorbed into other suitable employment. I do not think we should become overenthusiastic or completely irresponsible in our outlook in relation to the ability of the railways to handle all. the. freight that will be available to be carried between Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane merely because the Melbourne-Albury secdon is being converted to standard gauge. For some years there has been a standard gauge from Sydney to Brisbane; but the railways have been unable to attract all the goods traffic that moves between these cities. Already the roads from Sydney to Brisbane are almost over-taxed by the semi-trailers, and heavily laden trucks that are moving goods. If the: railways are to compete successfuUy with road transport, charges to consumers will need to be reduced drastically, and that can only be done by increased efficiency Some years ago a progressiveLabour rehabilitate or rebuild that line. Tne Commonwealth is financing rail standardization in Victoria, but if there is to be a railway constructed in Queensland, th-.: Commonwealth will not finance it, owing, I beheve, to the refusal of the Queensland Government to agree to the proposals submitted by the Labour Government in 1949. Mr agreement between the three States of South Speaker, that state of affairs could not happen again with the Labour party in control in Queensland, because the policy of the Labour party, is that there must be standardization of railways. If the government of the day had accepted the proposition of the Commonwealth, we would not be begging the position regarding the construction of a railway from Mount Isa to Townsville. I know that honourable members are enthusiastically applauding my remarks and I feel that they wish me to continue and use up the whole of my time in this important debate, but, out of consideration for them, J do not propose to do so. In fairness to the Parliament, I would say that during my short period of service to the nation this is the second attempt to convert to standard gauge two important railways in Australia-the line from Stirling North to Marree, and the line from Albury to Melbourne. I hope that I shall be spared to continue to play my part in this Parliament towards bringing about complete standardization of railway gauges in this country. certainly would not have risen at this late hour if the honourable member for Werriwa( Mr Whitlam) had not had the temerity to suggest in his speech earlier in this debate that the broadening from intermediate to standard gauge of the line that runs through my electorate in the south-east of South Australia should not have been undertaken, or that a line that ran through somebody else's electorate should have been undertaken first. The honourable member even suggested that the money expended in broadening this railway line was spent to no useful purpose. It seems to me, Mr barley has risen three and a half times; Speaker, that that statement ignored two factors. The first is that South Australia had already commenced the broadening of this railway line in the south-east of the State on its own account before the Commonwealth ever came into the picture. Secondly, in all the standardization agreements that were negotiated when the honorF.5890/58 -R -[72 ] able member for East Sydney( Mr Ward) was Minister for Transport the south-eastern division of South Australia was specifically accepted by the Commonwealth as having priority insofar as those agreements concerned that State. An agreement between the six States was replaced by an Australia, New South Wales and Victoria, and, finally, by a bilateral agreement between the Commonwealth and South Australia. The earlier agreements, if I may say so. lapsed because of the tardiness of every State except South Australia, ln each ot these successive agreements, the south-eastern railway in South Australia was specifically mentioned as an integral part of the standardization programme. So the suggestion made by the honourable member for Werriwa that this Government has departed from the spirit and intention of the agreement negotiated by the government that preceded it is, I believe, absolute nonsense, Mr Speaker. Likewise, it is nonsense to suggest that the south-eastern railway in South Australia serves no useful purpose except to channel to Adelaide trade that might otherwise have gone to Victoria. Perhaps the critics do not know that the south-east of South Australia contains a large proportion of the State's assuredrainfall country, and that its production potential is as great as, if not greater than, that of any similar area in Australia. Perhaps the honourable member for Werriwa does not know that, apart from the high natural rainfall, it has a vast underground basin of water capable of irrigating 1,500,000 acres, and that water may be obtained only 40 or 50 feet below the surface. Perhaps the honourable member does not know that, in the last ten years, the number of sheep carried in this area of South Australia has doubled; the size of the wool clip has increased two and a half times; the number of cattle has increased by 200 per cent.; the area of sown grasses has increased five times; thc production of and the output of logs from the softwood mills has increased from 54,000,000 super, feet Order!

One of the very good things about this Parliament, and one of the very great things about democracy, is that we fight valiantly against our opponents and that they fight valiantiy against us, but that we meet them, when we are not on duty, as friends and as colleagues. I am sure that everybody would want me to say that you cannot live, work and have your being in this House without developing a certain strange affection even for the men who do their best to defeat you. That, I think, is one of the great things about democracy that the authoritarian countries have never understood. You, Sir, referred to the fact that the Clerk, Mr Tregear, is leaving us. I do not want to embarrass him by saying too much, because, being the Clerk of the House, he cannot, beyond reading out those dull lists of papers that are to be filed, speak for himself. He can neither praise himself nor defend himself. But I hope I shall be allowed to say that Mr Tregear has brought to his office all the great qualities that one expects-complet e integrity, complete capacity in his job, and complete impartiality. There cannot be a member of this chamber who is not indebted to him. Through you, Sir, we say to Mr Tregear, who can neither acknowledge this nor do anything else about it: Thank you very much indeed for your work. You have contributed great service to the Parliament, and added much to the history of this counenough to see most of the prophecies falsified, most of the attacks defeated and most of the forecasts proved wrong. As an onlooker you have seen most of the game. We all want to say "" Thank you "". To all honourable members. I . as Prime Minister, would like to say, "" Thank you "". This has been a notable Parliament. We shall, before we are much older, I fear, be out denouncing each other on the public platforms. We shall be having an election campaign-the kind of thing which everybody enjoys except the man who is in it. When the people have cast their votes we shall be in or out and the Opposition will be in or out. But I believe that when some seriously minded student of history gets to work on these things and looks back over the great crises of various kinds that have arisen in the last three years, the last six years, or the last nine years, he will, at any rate, be proud of the fact that the Parliament of Australia has performed its duty with honesty, with intelligence, and with courage. So to all honourable members, whether they are so good as to support me and my colleagues-as so many of them do-o r whether they are so good as to afford a powerful opposition to my colleagues and myself. I should like to offer my personal goodwill and my gratitude for the work that has been done in this Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia. Mr Speaker, I thank you. I thank the Chairman of Committees and I thank the temporary chairmen of committees, who have really produced the most versatile talents, some being violent, and some being peaceful, but all doing their work in order that the business of this House might go on properly. I have referred to Mr Tregear. I should like to refer to the other officers of the House, all the staffs of Parliament who look after our needs. I should like to sayand I shall say it quite slowly so that it may be taken down with comforta word of thanks to "" Hansard "". I should even go so far as to offer a word of thanks to the broadcasters, though the broadcasters, mind you, repeat through the miracle of their science all the things that we say, while fhe "" Hansard"" writers take them down, improve them, and present us to posterity in a very respectable form; so we are delighted with them. I should like to say "" Thank you"" to our hereditary enemies in the press gallery, who sometimes think little of us and who sometimes have that sentiment warmly reciprocated. But after all, it must be acknowledged that what goes on here in the Federal Capital, what is said here and what is done here, would be unknown to most people if it were not for the great organs of publicity which translate them and convey them to the people. Public opinion is the whole essence of democracy, and public opinion depends upon the honest and zealous performance of duties by the people who interpret Parliament to the resi of the country. I should like to say on your behalf, Sir, and on behalf of honourable members, ""Thank you"" to all the members of the staffs, including the diningto pay my tribute to the members who are room staff and the other people who look after our various affairs. I say to all of them, "" Thank you very much "". We are now at the end of a Parliament. When we meet again-if I am here and if you are here-w e will begin a new Parliament in the history of the very great country which we have the honour to serve, and which the members of the new Parliament will, I hope, serve with the same zeal and the same integrity as we have endeavoured to bring to its service. Opposition) [12.41 a.m.] I join with the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) in his remarks', and I should like to advert to a few of them. First of all, I should like to thank you, Mr Speaker, for your felicitous references to Alan Tregear, the Clerk of the House, who occupies a very important position, perhaps the key position, in the Parliament. He has been a friend to all of us and a comfort and aid in all our difficulties. Mr Tregear's career as long .as the blows that are given in parhas been a magnificent one, and most of us feel great regret that he has seen fit to leave his position at this time. Equally we know the extent to which we are indebted to Mr Tregear's colleagues and to the staff of the Parliament generally. I should like to refer next to you, Mr Speaker. I think it has been an outstanding feature of your occupancy of your high office during this Parliament that, whatever differences of opinion may have arisen from time to time in connection with the Standing Orders, all of us have felt completely comfortable under your chairmanship. We feel certain that every ruling you have given has been given with complete impartiality -and impartiality is the first and greatest quality that can be shown by the Speaker of this great House. You have exemplified it to a very great degree. When I say that, I am sure that I am speaking for all of us. It is wonderful for us to be able to feel that the work that we do in this Parliament is so well understood by the Speaker, and I make special reference to that. I have often discussed this with honourable members. It is a great spirit to have in the House of Representatives. I say that with complete sincerity. Then, with the Prime Minister, I wish not seeking re-election, among them being many very dear friends of all of us-friend s irrespective of party politics, because one gets a special form of comradeship in the struggles that take place in the Parliament. The hard battles and the good humour with which a few of them are from time to time waged are always most interesting. I thank "" Hansard "". Coming back to the general remarks made by the Prime Minister, we could not carry on in the Parliament were it not for those who assist us by providing the various services that are required. I thank the library staff, the refreshment room staff and others, to whom happy reference has been made by the Prime Minister. I agree with the Prime Minister in his summing up of the aims of the Parliament. The system is a system of discipline in the House, a system of good comradeship and friendship as well a9 of open opposition. As long as the opposition is open and known, liamentary contests are hard, clean and not foul, then parliamentary democracy will remain. I think that that is the essence of it.",89,Adjournment
238,Dr. Evatt (Barton,"Leade r of the 1 feel that in a sense the breaking-up of a Parliament is hke the breaking-up of a school at the end of the school year, the only difference being that instead of going off on holiday we are now going to an even grimmer school-the school of discipline exercised by the people of this country. I am sure, Mr Speaker, that I have not referred to everything that is in the hearts of honourable members. This is an important occasion, and I think that we do well always to retain this valedictory as a feature of the end of a Parliament. In this Parliament many things have happened of great importance to the people of Australia, but I thing that our opinions on that must not be given more fully at the present time. General) [12.47 a.m.] -May I crave that indulgence for which you are noted, Mr bute should be paid to them because of the Speaker, to make a few remarks associating the members of the Australian Country party with the expressions of the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) and the Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt) in the concluding hours of this Parliament. I do so, Mr he deserves special mention. The refreshSpeaker, in the absence of our Leader, Mr ment room staff also deserve our best John McEwen, who, as every one knows, is absent overseas on important national business. Sir, it i,s a privilege to be associated with sard "" staff. How often when we read the expressions of thanks and goodwill that have been voiced by the two right honourable gentlemen. I feel that it will be agreed on all sides that during the life of this Parliament we have passed through, under your guidance and that of those who serve the House with you, a period of constructive debate from which has flowed sound legislation. I am glad to associate the members of the Australian Country party with the thanks expressed to you for that impartiality and that sound knowledge of procedure and of the Standing Orders which have enabled you to conduct the debates in this House in a way which has helped towards the establishment of the high standing of this Parliament in Australia. You have had the assistance, in performing your task, of Deputy Speakers. The chairman of committees and the temporary chairmen of committees have acted in their particular sphere. All of us owe thanks F.5890/58 -R -[73 ] to them for the service they have given, not only to the House but to honourable members in the conduct of the debates. Tributes have already been paid to the Clerk of the House, Mr Tregear. I assure you, Mr Speaker, and, through you, I assure the Clerk, that we of the Australian Country party re-echo those tributes with great sincerity, and express the desire that Mr Tregear will continue in good health and that from time to time we shall see him again and be able to continue that pleasant association which has developed in the years during which he has served in this House. We thank also the Clerks-Assistant and all those officers of the House who do so much in a quiet, unobtrusive way to help us carry out our particular duties. For example, the service which the Librarian and his staff offer to honourable members cannot properly be assessed in a few short words. I feel that a special trivalue of the information which they place at our disposal when we are preparing to debate a particular bill or subject. The Parliamentary Draftsman plays an important part in the life of this Parliament, and thanks. And last, but by no means least, as the Prime Minister said, we come to the "" Han"" Hansard"" after we have delivered a speech do we say to ourselves, "" What a splendid speech I made. I did not know it was so good "". All of us have said that and, consequently, on an occasion like this we say to the "" Hansard"" staff, "" Thank you very very much indeed "". This is a time when we do admit our debt to the members of that staff and express our thanks. Shortly this Parliament will cease to exist and we shall go out on to the hustings. We all expect to be back again, so I shall simply say that I , personally, have enjoyed exceedingly the associations which it has been my privilege to have with all members on both sides of the House. I sincerely hope that we shall all be in a position to enjoy a continuance of that association early in the new year. So, Sir, I say to you again, ""Thank you very much indeed""; and I associate members of the Australian Country party",91,Adjournment

I know that it is time that all good menshould be home in bed, but I hope that honourable members will bear with me for a' few moments. I have a few "" Thank you's "" to say on the eve of my retirement. I would like you to know that it is not my wish to retire from public life but that medical advice has obliged me to do so. I am going to miss political life. I am going to miss the many friends I have made here over the years, and I am going to miss giving the service which I hope I have been able to give to the people. ln parting, Sir, it may be remembered that the name of Watkins has been associated with the Commonwealth Parliament since federation. My late respected father and I , between us, have served Newcastle in this Parliament for approximately 58 .years. Our total service in State and Federal parliaments has extended over approximately 64 years, my late father having entered the State Parliament ot New South'Wales in 1.894. It is probably a .unique record that we have both represented the one party and, in effect,, the one. constituency, in the State and Federal Parliaments, for so long a period. When I look around this chamber I see now: only a few of the faces that were here when I entered this Parhament in L935. Tc^night is a sad night for me. When1 look around the chamber I have memories --hallowe d memories-of great men who served their country through this Parliament for many years. Those, men are now not withus. Fleeting visions of their faces one of those who believe that not only Auscome before me; and remembering their characteristics, I can almost see them sitting in their old places in this chambei. I recall the respect and friendship that existed between us. Mr Speaker, I should like to thank you for the many courtesies extended to me not only since you have been Speaker but also prior to your appointment. To you, Mr Prime Minister also, and to members of your Ministry may I say, "" Thank you very much for your friendship and kindness over the years to my own leader, deputy leader and memonly the adjournment permits a private bers of my own party, "" Thank you very years and particularly for your tolerance during my extended illness"". To the parliamentary staffs, from the highest official to those on the lowest rung of the ladder, I should also like to say, "" Thank you for your many acts of kindness over the years"". I should like to thank the gentlemen of the press also for their many acts of kindness. I wish to convey to the Public Service generally my personal appreciation of that fine body of men and women, sometimes so much maligned, for the help and advice they have given me on many occasions when I have had to deal with the heads of different departments and others on behalf of my constituents. I think I have mentioned all the people with whom I have been associated in Canberra. IfI have forgotten anybody to whom I am indebted, I am sorry. I should like to say to the Australian Labour party organization in Newcasde and to the electors of Newcastle that I am particularly sorry I have to leave them as their representative. I hope that in some way over the years I have warranted the confidence they have reposed in me. Finally, Mr Speaker, I would like to say this: You honourable members will shortly be going out to meet the people. You will be working with all your heart and soul for your own return and the return of the parties whichyou represent. To those of you who return to this Parliament after thc election may I suggest that you bring your hearts and souls back into this Parliament, because a parliament without a soul cannot successfully function. Apropos of remarks made by the Prime Minister earlier, I am tralia but also democracies generally and democratic institutions are continually threatened. I do not think we can be beaten in the continual struggle for freedom. We can lose only by default. We can lose only through apathy and sectional and selfish interests. So, let us have in this country at all times-governmen t of the people, by the people, for the people. May I just convey to you all my very best wishes -and now, good-bye.

Watkins), but at the same time. I should like to remember a number of our colleagues Who, as the Prime Minister has said, will not be with us in the next Parliament, if we are here ourselves. Sir, I direct these remarks to the honourable member for Newcastle because I come from an adjoining electorate and from a different side of the House. Throughout my years as a member of the Parliament and for a long time before I became a member of the Parliament, I had the privilege of knowing the former member for Newcastle and the present member for Newcastle, who is still known as "" young Dave "". I should like the House to know of the high respect accorded to the name "" Watkins"" in the Newcastle district. I should like the honourable member to know that he has the good wishes of us all in the Parliament, now that he is going into retireHouse the strange story of one of Australia's ment, and I ask him to convey our good wishes to his wife, also. I hope that with the ease of not being the member for Newcastle his health will improve and we will have the happy experience of his coming back here and seeing us on a number of occasions. MrI . R. FRASER (Australian Capital Territory) [1.2 a.m.] I will be very brief indeed, Mr Speaker, if you will permit me to say that I reiterate the good wishes expressed by every one on both sides of the House. I shall miss all the faces and the personalities of all honourable members assembled here, but I shall endeavour to keep an eye on the building from day to day and keep it safe for them when they all come back. express my gratitude for all the kind remarks that have been made. On behalf of the staff, who cannot speak for themselves, I say how grateful they are for the support that you have offered to them and the kind comments you have made about them. Naturally enough, As far as the staff is concerned, I want to say that, from my own point of view, "" Tulloch"" has been carrying a great deal of weight, and he has done a grand job. I am very grateful for the loyalty and cooperation I have received and, from my own observations and from yours I think we can all say that those who have been trained by Mr Tregear will see that the dignity and prestige of the Parliament will I have offered my explanation to the House for speaking on an entirely different subject, but' I have not had the opportunity to raise this matter before. I take this opportunity as the only avenue open to a private member to express his views on a matter wbich has exercised his mind. I am encouraged by the remarks of the honourable member for Newcastle (MT. Watkins), who said that 1 one strives and must strive to do his best in the interests of what he believes. I realize that this may be somewhat of an anticlimax after the expressions of good will marking the end of the session and farewells toa departing Clerk. As I have already said, I have had no previous opportunity to raise this matter. I have tb bring before the notice of the principal centres for the dissemination of hatredI hesitate to use the word in this atmosphere-hatre d of democracy, of Australia and of our allies, Britain and America. This is the Waterside Workers Federation building at 60-66 Sussex-street, Sydney. This building is a principal centre for propaganda in praise of the Soviet and of communism. This is done from a site worth many thousands of pounds, provided almost rent free to the wealthy Waterside Workers Federation by the New South Wales Labour Government. I produce here a copy of the leasea remarkable document signed by one John Joseph Cahill, now Premier of New South Wales granting the area for the trustees of the Communist-controlled Sydney branch of the Waterside Workers Federation for ten years from September, 1947, at a rental of £1 a year. The lease covers land with a frontage of approximately 60 feet to Sussexstreet in: the heart of Sydney's shipping quarter, with frontages also at the side and rear' of Sussex-lane. On it is a very substantial three-story brick building. I note",93,Adjournment

243,Mr Speaker,"On my own behalf, I",94,Adjournment
244,Mr Wheeler (Mitchell) [1.3 A.m.],"that the lease actually expired in September of last year, but a little matter like that is nothing between friends. The Communists are still in occupation and no doubt amicable discussions are now going on with Mr Cahill about renewal. In effect, this New South Wales Labour Government, which is continually complaining about having no money and which has starved its schools and hospitals, still has money for what in effect is a subsidy on a Communist propaganda centre. Very possibly, the lease granted in 1947 was a renewal. I think the federation has been in possession for quite a long time. However, it is only in recent years that it has engaged so extensively in these vicious anti-democratic and pro-Communist propaganda campaigns. The Waterside Workers Federation is, of course, a very wealthy body. The Sydney branch has an income of over £40,000 a year and should be able to pay whatever is the fair rental for premises it uses. Whatever may have been the reasons for granting it rent-free possession originally of this very should not be placed rent free at the disvaluable site, the conduct of its officials in the last two decades has stamped them as enemies of Australia, and no government which claims to be democratic or anti-Communist can possibly excuse this privileged treatment. Some of the conditions of the lease are very interesting. Clause7 says that the premises shall be used for the purposes of recreation and as a reading room by members of the Waterside Workers Institute as at present constituted and for no other purpose whatever. Apparendy, the showing of Communist films and plays is the Waterside Workers Federation's idea of recreation and Mr Cahill must agree with this view, because if he did not, he has the power to terminate the lease immediately. Clause 12 gives him this power if the said premises are used otherwise than in accordance with clause 7. On the premises are also established the head-quarters of the Sydney branch of the federation with extensive offices. How Mr Cahill can consider this to be within the definition of recreation is puzzling. Last week-end, to my knowledge, the building was the venue for an all-ports conference of delegates. It is very nice indeed for this wealthy union to have rent-free premises for such meetings, at which some of our most damaging strike plots are hatched. It is probable that since the new multistory building in Phillip-street has been completed. by the Waterside Workers Federation parent body with its up-to-date equipment for the display of propaganda films, there has been less activity in this department in Sussex-street. However, the policy of producing class-warfare plays is still being pursued vigorously. Every Saturday and Sunday night, until fairly recently, the hall was used for public presentations of a propagandist effort by left-wing writer, Frank Hardy, who has recently returned from Moscow. Another opus which had its world premiere at the Sussexstreet hall was "" November Victory"", a lurid caricature of the waterfront strike of 1954, which was so violently anti-democratic in character that it won high praise and, I believe, an award at a film festival held behind the iron curtain. Even if the premises were not being used as a centre for the distribution of Communist propaganda, this extremely valuable property posal of the Waterside Workers Federation, ln effect, the Labour government has made this Communist-controlled organization a privileged beneficiary of the taxpayer while unions which support the Australian Labour party are required to provide their own premises at the expense of their members. Possession of these premises without the obligation to pay rent has released large sums of money from the funds of the federation that have been misused to the detriment of the Australian community. The Waterside Workers Federation is able to publish and distribute scurrilous broadsheets which, by misrepresentation, rouse its members to such a pitch of ill feeling that the officials are in a position to call on constant illegal strikes. They have thus been able to disrupt the lives of ordinary citizens and, at the same time, raise considerably the Australian cost of living. No person or body in the Commonwealth is less worthy of this privilege of free accommodation than the Waterside Workers Federation. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 1.11 a.m. (Thursday), to a date and hour to be fixed by Mr Speaker. The following answers to questions were circulated:Department of Trade. honourable member for Hughes( Mr L. R. Johnson) asked the following question, without notice:Is the acting Minister for Trade able to confirm reports that large-scale retrenchments are contemplated with respect to the Sydney office of the Department of Trade? Since over twenty Commonwealth temporary clerks are already said to be involved in such retrenchments including men with over twenty years' service, I ask the Minister whether he can indicate the reason for and the extent of the proposed staff reduction. Are these retrenchments associated with plans further to curtail import quotas or, alternatively, does the Minister consider that a stimulated trade policy with China will require less staff engaged in the business of rejecting import licence applications? The pressure of work in the Import Licensing Branch, Sydney, over the past eighteen months has shown that, to cope with the large number of applications being received, the staff must be stabilized by increasing the number of permanent officers. The Public Service Board agreed in order to promote greater efficiency, to provide a number of permanent positions in place of temporary ones. These positions have now been filled by the promotion of permanent officers, many of whom, are from other departments. As a result the services of seventeen temporary employees will no longer be required. Every endeavour is being made to find positions for these employees, if possible in other departments. To give the employees to be retrenched a longer period in which to find suitable positions elsewhere, arrangements have been made for the intake of officers from other departments to be delayed for several months, and for the temporary employees to be retained for a similar period. I can assure the honourable member that the retrenchments involved are not associated with plans to curtail import quotas further and also that the number of staff required to deal with import licence applications does not vary according to the country from which the goods are imported. Mr Ward asked the acting Minister for Trade, upon notice1. When was the Department of Trade established? 2. How many employees has the department had in each year since its inception? 3. What are the precise functions of this department? 4. Has the Department of Primary Industry any responsibility in the marketing of rural production? 5. If so, in what way do these functions differ from those performed in this field by the Department of Trade? honourable member's questions are as follows:1. l l t h January, 1956. 2. When the Departments of Trade and Primary Industry were created the whole of the staff of the old Department of Commerce and Agriculture was transferred to the Department of Trade. Subsequently a number of positions were transferred from Trade to Primary Industry. The total staff employed on 30th June, 1956, was 690. By 31st December, 1956. as a result of transfers to the Department of Primary Industry, the staff had been reduced to 612, but by 30th June, 1957, it had risen to 661, and by 30th June, 1958, to 706. The increases were due mainly to the filling of vacancies in the new organization and to reorganizations in the Import Licensing Branch and Tariff Board. 3. The functions of the Department of Trade areOverseas trade relations. Export trade promotion including overseas trade missions, trade publicity and trade exhibitions. Trade Commissioner Service. Protection of primary and secondary industries including tariff protection. Secondary industry development. External trade policy, including the negotiation of trade treaties and international commodity agreements. Import licensing policy. Shipping matters affecting overseas trade. The Minister for Trade is also responsible for the administration of the Tariff Board and the Export Payments Insurance Corporation. 4. Yes. 5. The Department of Trade is responsible for promoting export trade and the conduct and management of Australia's external trade relations, and trade policy, including the negotiation of trade treaties and international commodity arrangements. The functions of the Department of Primary Industry in respect of marketing of rural production include such items as(a) Marketing and stabilization policy. (b) Co-operation with industry and statutory organizations in the marketing of export surpluses.

Import Licensing. MrW a r d asked the acting Ministerf o r Trade, upon notice1. What classes of persons are eligible to receive Trade, upon noticeimport licences? 2. How are import quotas determined? 3. How many employees are engaged in this branch of the Department of Trade? 4. What is the annual cost of maintaining the Import Licensing Branch? able member's questions are as follows:1. Import licences are granted only to residents of Australia. Subject to this general condition, the eligibility of any person to receive an import hcence depends upon the policy applied to the commodity concerned at the time the application is made. 2. As a general rule, individual import quotas for goods subject to quota licensing are established by reference to the value of imports of those goods by the particular person or firm in a previous "" base "" period. Where a rigid adherence to this principle has led to anomalies in the licensing system, individual applications for import quotas have been considered on their merits, in accordance with the policy applicable to the particular commodity at the time. 3. There are 296 employees engaged on import licensing in the Department of Trade. 4. During 1957-58 the administrative costs of import licensing incurred by the Department of Trade amounted to £367,000. Motor Vehicle Spare Parts. Mr Ward asked the acting Minister for Trade, upon noticeWhat action has been taken by the Government to deal with excessive prices charged by the motor trade for spare parts, representing, in some instances, over 500 per cent, of the landed cost, to which the Tariff Board directed attention in a report submitted some months ago? able member is aware that early this year, when the tariff amendments associated with the motor vehicle tariff items were under consideration in this chamber, and in another place, considerable discussion took place on the particular issue he has revived. Although it invited attention to the matter, the Tariff Board made no recommendaTrade, upon notice:tion thereon. However, I suggest that the absence of a recommendation by the Tariff appointed Board could be accounted for on the to continue and is not near normal retiring age? grounds that the matter was obviously not one which lent itself to tariff action. The honourable member might consider that the question could be dealt with by price control but, as he is aware, price control is a matter for the State governments. Travelling Expenses as Tax Deductions. Mr Bryant asked the acting Minister for 1. How many copies of "" Income Tax for the Manufacturer "" have been printed and distributed, and at what cost? 2. Why, on page 10 of this publication, in the paragraph headed "" Allowable Deductions"", was the term "" travelling and entertainment expenses actually incurred in gaining or producing assessable income"" not explained so that the public might know on what principles and to what extent such deductions are allowed? 3. Is it possible for a taxpayer to go overseas accompanied by his wife and have their fares and accommodation charges deducted partly or fully for taxation purposes; if so, what limits in money terms are applied in such cases? 4. Approximately how much revenue is lost annually because of the advantage taken by businessmen and others travelling abroad, with or without their wives, of this allowable deduction? honourable member's questions are as follows:1. Twenty-five thousand copies at a cost of £1,312. 2. The words referred to by the honourable member follow closely the terms of the income tax law under which deductions are allowable for outgoings "" incurred in gaining or producing assessable income. It is a question of fact whether an expense is incurred in gaining or producing assessable income. Each case requires consideration in the light of its own facts and it was not practicable in the publication to refer to the many factors associated with travelling and entertainment expenses incurred in a variety of circumstances. 3. A deduction is allowable for fares and accommodation incurred in gaining or producing assessable income but expenses of a private, domestic or capital nature are not deductible. The amount, if any, deductible is not limited to any particular amount of money but is determined by a consideration of the facts of each case in conjunction with the tests imposed by the law. 4. The information is not available. Tariff Board. Mr Cairns asked the acting Minister for 1. Is it a fact that Mr A. Date will not be reto the Tariff Board although he desires 2.

Hire-car Service at Kingsford-Sinith Airport. Mr Daly asked the Minister representing the Minister for Civil Aviation, upon notice1. What are the terms of the concession granted to Hughes Motor Services Limited for the operation of a hire-car service at Kingsford-Smith airport? 2. What consideration is paid or payable for the granting of the concession? 3. Does this concession purport to confer an exclusive right to carry on a hire-car service at the airport? 4. Has another hire-car operator, Mr W. J. Aitkenhead, carrying on business as Kingsford Smith Airport Hire Car Service, carried on a hire-car service at the airport for many years? 5. Has the Civil Aviation Department placed any restrictions upon that operator in the conduct of his business at the airport? 6. Is it a fact that this operator is not permitted to stand his cars at the airport terminals while waiting for bookings, but is required to enter parking lots away from the terminals for which parking fees are charged? 7. Does this operator hold a number of licences from the State Transport Authority for the operation of a hire-car service at the airport? 8. Has any compensation been paid, or is it intended to pay compensation, to this operator for any -interference with the conduct of his business resulting from the granting of the concession to Hughes Motor Services Limited? 9. Are the streets in the airport public roads? 10. Has the Minister expressed the intention of his department to bring pressure to bear upon the airline companies to discontinue their agreements or arrangements with Kingsford-Smith Airport Hire Car Service for the transport of airline passengers and staff, and to channel this work to Hughes Motor Service Limited? 11. If so, is this interference with the operations of a private company an unjustified and unprecedented policy on the part of a government department? Aviation has replied as follows:1. The terms of the concession grant to the Hughes Motor Service the use of part of a building which the company uses as an office, a The term is for two years. 2. The concession fee offered by the Hughes company and accepted by the Department of Civil Aviation is £2,400 per annum. 3. No. In my correspondence with parties who have raised this question in the past I have made this point abundantly clear. No mention of exclusive rights was made in the public tender relating to the concession and I have done everything possible to dispel any misunderstandings in this regard. 4. The honourable member for Grayndler should be well aware that the Kingsford-Smith Hire Car Service has operated at the airport for a number of years. His colleague, the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith has on many occasions harangued this House with allegations of overcharging and racketeering by the Kingsford-Smith Hire Car Service and pressed for termination of the so-called monopoly under which it operated at the airport. 5. The only restrictions imposed on the Kingsford-Smith Hire Car Service are those imposed by the regulations of the New South Wales Department of Road Transport and are equally applicable to all hire-car operators in the Sydney area. Under the terms of these regulations, disengaged hire cars are not permitted to stand in ranks, or solicit business on the streets, except immediately adjacent to their registered premises. Hence, the only disengaged hire cars which are permitted to remain on the airport are those of the authorized concessionaire whose registered premises are located on the airport. However, there is no restriction on hire cars which have previously been engaged by telephone entering the airport and waiting in the appropriate parking area for the arrival of their passengers. 6. As I have just said, the cars of the Kingsford-Smith Hire Car Service are not permitted under the regulations of the New South Wales Department of Road Transport to stand anywhere on the airport awaiting bookings. All bookings must be made through their registered office. The space available for hire cars on the roadways outside the terminal building is very limited. The available space forms part of the facilities for which the hire car concessionaire pays his fee.",99,Answers To Questions

Approved dollar expenditure by television stations from the inception of television to the middle of August, 1958, amounted to approximately £1.25 million. It is not the practice to disclose detailed figures in respect of individual stations. 2. Information is not available to show how much of this amount was in respect of feature films and how much was in respect of programme material. 3. A quota system is not in operation. Under the present policy television stations are provided with whatever overseas currencies are required for the purchase of their reasonable needs for imported programme material. The"" reasonable needs"" do not include the acquisition of unnecessarily large stocks of imported material.",104,Australian Labour Party
