Mr J. H . CATTS I desire to know, Mr Speaker, whether you have seen a report of the Prime Minister's statement that legislation was passed through this House last session only by straining the Standing Orders, and putting them to uses to which they were never put before; and, further, whether such remarks are not a gross reflection on yourself, and whether you will require the Prime Minister to apologize. able member that notice has already been given of a question bearing on this matter. So far as it relates to myself, I have seen references published in the papers to such a report, but I am not in a position to say whether or not it is correct, or what was in the Prime Minister's mind at the time. I do not propose to take any further notice unless the matter is brought before the House in a more definite way.

The previous speaker has been asked why he did not deal with that paragraph 3. I am quite prepared to deal with it , and * say what I believe it means. The function of .a Legislature is ,to put into concrete law the will' .of .the dominant political factor of the day. When the previous Admin istration were in power, they brought in We on this side a law which put the people' of Australia in an entirely new political .position. No doubt, they thought they were doing that work as representing the dominant political factor of the day, but there are two things to be. considered when dealing with a question of this kind. TheI t appears first is-ha s the dominant political factor actually expressed itself at the ballot box; the second is-r-is the party in power able to construe properly the will"" of the dominant political factor? Thp position that has arisen in the Commonwealth is If it were possible to have that the previous Administration, when in power, brought into operation a law altogether new to Australia, and one I think I which was directly opposed to the principles of the British Empire and honest Britisli fair play. law? tive act they gave preference to unionists. Legislature is two-fold administrative and legislative-and , to my mind, the administrative is the more important. I have often heard it said, "" Let me The honourable memwrite the songs of the people, and I care not who makes the laws."" From our earliest childhood, we have seen the effects of administration. In the United States of America, the Courts are overriding the Legislature .every day,' showing that an administrative act is always of more i m portance than legislation. However, what I wish to arrive at is this: Paragraph 3 of the Governor General's Speech has a deep and significant meaning, not only for the House, but for all Australia, because it touches on the primary principles of the British Empire. The paragraph stands for British liberty and fair play. We on this side are striving for equality of the people in the eyes of the law, the fundamental principle on which British liberty is based; but it that I am quite lay with the past Administration to deny to the people of Australia the operation of that fundamental principle. Another meaning in paragraph 3 is that we believe in equality of opportunity at the ballot-box. In fact, we believe in these two great forms of equality -equalit y in the eyes of the law, .and .equality of pjppprtunity at the",26,Governor General S Speech Address In Reply

Never in the history of the world has there been social revolution of any moment where the people have had free expression of opinion at the ballot-box, and where they have been treated equally before the law; and we on this side of the chamber stand all the time for liberty in those two respects. That is the meaning of paragraph 3; and when we go before the people, I at least shall be prepared to go on the platform and fight it from beginning to end. There are two other very important matters in the Speech; one is the handling of our facilities, using mention of the Post and Telegraph Dethe term in the broadest possible sense, as they exist to-day. There'can be no doubt that the Prime Minister, at the recent Conference of the Premiers of the States, went far towards putting us in a position to use to the very best advantage the facilities as they exist in Australia to-day. yond that. deal with the development of our resources, it seems to me that any one who is in earnest need only look through the Speech of the Governor General and see in three paragraphstake paragraphs 9, 15, and 16-that there has emanated from the present Administration what might truly be called a big Australian policy. If we look merely at the way in which the Government are prepared to handle the Commonwealth Bank, we see the difference between the present Administration and the previous. The previous Administration put up a skeleton with no life in it ; but the present Prime Minister went to the Premiers' Conference and breathed life into the figure; so that all that now remains is to put it properly to workthe life is in it . We have done away with the pettifogging ideas of the previous Administration. The proposal now is to deal with the National Bank in a broad national manner, on a basis which is just and generous and vigorous, as should be the policy of a National Bank. Why need the National Bank of Australia go pettifogging round with savings which were well handled, and have been well handled for many years, by the States? Instead of that, the Prime Minister launched out and offered a vigorous .policy, which the Premiers of the States, ilfr.

Honourable members opposite always offer things new, but never get there; whereas we do the new thingswe arrive. That is the fundamental difference between the two parties. I do not wish to delay too long in this matter, but it seems to me that there are a couple of striking omissions from the Speech. There is no mention 'of our interests in the Pacific, and there is no partment. I sincerely hope that the Postal Department will be pushed on for all it is worth, because there is no matter of greater importance to country dwellers and those in the far-distant parts of the Commonwealth than the proper development of the post and telegraph system. When we come to national! said, but that is no reason why I should turn my back on the main principles that have made the British Empire possible. That is why I strongly support, to the best of my ability, the Speech of the Governor General; because it puts forward a comprehensive policy for Australiawhat we might call a big Australian policy; and it goes further, and gets down to the fundamental principles. We are going to stand for equality for all people in the eyes of the law, and equality of opportunity at the ballot-box, and upon these principles we are prepared to stand or fall. journed. posedThat the House, at its rising, adjourn until to-morrow at half-past 2 o'clock p.m. In fixing the sessional orders in relation to the sittings of the House, has the Prime.

I wish to inform the House, and through the House the Minister, of the exact position. already been landed in Australia from South Africa, the bags being branded, I understand, "" Maize, sound, clean, and good, from SouthA f r i c a . "" A large portion of the shipments was landed in Sydney without any difficulty, and immediately went into consumption, but a portion of both shipments went to Brisbane, and in both cases the maize was condemned. The Minister has said that a few bags were condemned; but I think my information is correct-that the whole of the Brisbane shipment, amounting to over 1,000 bags, was condemned. It is futile for the Minister to say that a few bags only were found infested with corn moth. I saw three sacks landed which were simply infested with the cocoon unhatched of the moth, while I have testi' mony to the effect that on the wharf where the maize was landed the hot, moist, humid weather was hatching, out the moths by hundreds. These moths were finding their way all over the country. It is not a question of every precaution having been taken. The fact is that the maize has been landed in Sydney, while the very same shipment was condemned in Brisbane out of the same ship. the maize would be infested in Brisbane, and not equally infested in'Sydney. Of course, they might not hatch out so quickly in Sydney, but the fact remains that there has now been landed in Sydney several thousand bags of South African maize infested with one of the most dangerous pests that can possibly affect the farmers of this country. friends now ? would be somewhat humorous if it had not its serious aspect, because the party who are admitting this maize into the country are the farmers' party, who OF SITTING . pose before the community as tbe sincere and particular friends of the farmers; yet here, through their officers in Sydney particularly, they are allowing this pest to come in .

No other Legislature in the world attempts to sit for the same length of time, and the against it are many. if Ministers are occupied with their duties in the House for four days a week, the control of administrative pass from their hands into the hands of the officials, and it. is clearly the duty of Parliament to prevent this, whatever side is in power. If Ministers' time is taken up with administrative not be occupied at the same time with the legislative matters that have to be attended to while the House is sitting. the House sitting for four days in the week affairs are frequently at a high tension, and this is very trying for the health of members. died last session, and probably the length of sittings had something to do with the fact. When we have been wrangling for a long time, the strain of the week's, work is too great upon members, and the only relief that they are able to get is by going out of the chamber and staying out during a large part of the debates. again, is not in the best interests of parliamentary government, because men ought to be able to sit here for the whole time.

Mr Conroy. with regard to the This House might well take note of the The fact, and revert to a sane procedure. If four days per we sit too long, the effect is to delay in stead of hasten legislation. A feeling of irritation is set up in the minds of men.. reasons rendering them incapable of taking t h a t In the first place, sound and calm judgment of matters that certainly should be brought to bear on legislative work. I think I am well matters must within the mark in saying that practically two-thirds of the members on both sides of the House are thoroughly agreed that the House now sits too long. To adopt the usual hours w i ll cause no delay inmatters, they canlegislation, but will distinctly encourage a quicker procedure. It will be to the advantage of every man in the House-, With and of the country, if the days of sitting are limited to three. I would ask tbe Government to take the matter into their early and serious consideration. [4.47] I agree with the honourable member for Werriwa with regard to the House sitting only three days a week. I desire to discuss with the Prime Minister a littl e matter affecting Tasmania. I cannot see why that State should be deprived of itsfive Divisional Returning Omcers simply That, because it is small. Napoleon was a l it t l e man, and yet he conquered Europe. Some of the greatest minds that Australia ever produced came from Tasmania. Tasmania is the mother of Australia, and why should it not get five Divisional Returning Officers?

As regards Sydney, inquiries were made, and the information we have received from the State omcers there was that in no instance were these importations affected by the disease. out of one shipment. tioned-the Sumatra and the Java. The honourable member can take the assurance that the Department, generally speaking, from a central administrative point of view, is eager to keep but of Australia any pest likely to be injurious. I do not know whether he has any other information than what he has already given to the House. If he has, I shall be very glad if he will supply it to me, and shall immediately get the whole matter reported on, and, if necessary, additional inquiries made. MrM c DONALD (Kennedy) [4.52] If what the Minister has just said is true, we are up against oue of the most serious things that could happen to those who grow maize in Australia. The honourable member has told the House that the bags were examined, and that in all the bags the corn moth was discovered. covered in every sack. all the cases in which it was discovered it wus immediately dealt with, according to the report, so as to prevent the possibility of the introduction of the pest. relation to the sacks, and not in relation to the maize. and the moths were not found in it . MrM c DONALD l t would not be possible to examine every grain of maize, or even to make any thorough general We must not give the big States examination. The discovery of the moths in the bags is a very serious matter, and the whole of the shipment should have been destroyed. We are suffering in Australia from the introduction of pests in the past, and any Minister, whether Labour or Liberal, should be most careful, and even drastic, in deal? ing with these matters. There is not a pest in Australia to-day that cannot be traced to some particular importation, and laxity ou the part of those who are administering matters at the time has permitted these pests to cause considerable damage to the whole of the farming community. The whole of the potato crop of Australia has been in certain years practically destroyed through the introduction of a disease. The same remarks apply to the fruit-fly, and to a number of. other pests that have come in from time to time. The most drastic measures should be taken to prevent the introduction of this new pest, even though the destruction of forty shipments of maize might be necessary. Should the pest get a footing in the country, it would seriously affect the locally-grown maize, and at the present time we have to go to a great deal of expense to keep down the weevil pest. I d i d not know that maize was imported into this country. Certainly no other crop growsmore luxuriantly here, and enormous yields of maize have been obtained in almost every part of the Commonwealth. Every endeavour should be made to prevent the introduction of pests, and in fected shipments should be destroyed. The pest in question is very minute, and could not easily be detected by the examination of a few samples of grain. Coming to another matter referred to by thw honourable member for Werriwa, the suggestion that we should sit fewer days, I did not say it was disper week, I would point out that. this. I said that in Parliament sits more hours a day, and more days a week, than any other in Australia.

Further, the sittings of Parliament being extended over four days, Ministers have not the opportunities which they should have for administrative work, and there is a danger that they may be forced into becoming mere automata for the approval of the decisions of the permanent heads of the Departments. It would be better for the work of the House, as well as the administration of the Departments, if we sat only three days a week. There is a general impression abroad that a member's work is confined to attending the sittings of the House; but, as a matter of fact,five-sixthsof it is done out of the Chamber. There is nothing more tiring and exhausting than the examination of documents and statistics to obtain the information with which members have to prime themselves to do justice to the work of Parliament. In addition, they have an enormous correspondence to attend to, some of them having to deal with more than 100 letters a week on the average. In the interests of good government, and of the health of members, we should sit only three days a week. -The attention of the Minister having been drawn to the danger of the importation of pests from South Africa, I hope that he will take immediate action to provide proper preventive measures. There are in South Africa a number of pests which are not yet established in Australia, 'one of them affecting wattle bark, which is imported here. We have suffered a great deal from the introduction of pests, unwittingly or innocently. Rabbits, foxes, and other animals have done a great deal of mischief, and there are in addition all the insect and other pests which have been brought here. I hope that the Ministry will carefully consider how the introduction of pests can best be prevented, and will give special consideration to the pests likely to be introduced by the importation of wattle bark. We have been informed by the Minister of Trade and Customs that of a shipment of maize half that -was landed at Sydney -was found to be free from corn moth, and the other half, which was landed at Brisbane, was found to be infected. I take it that the inspection in Sydney was lax. That reveals a very serious position. laxity in the examination of one importation can be proved, it may obtain generally, and under a lax system we do not know what pests may not be introduced. It is not likely that only that portion of the maize which was landed in Brisbane was affected by the corn moth. The chances are that the whole shipment was infected, but that the pest was not discovered in Sydney because the examination there was lax. The officials who have been guilty of laxity should be brought to book by the Minister. The farmers of Australia have already enough to do to make ends meet, and we do not want to add to their burden. The honourable member for Gippsland laughs at that, although, in his district, there are very large growers of maize, and they are much interested in this matter. It is no laughing matter to the farmers about places like Orbost. They are anxious that there should be the most thorough examination of all importations. It surprises me that maize is imported into Australia, seeing how much we produce. I trust that the Minister will not rest content with the explanations that he has received from his oflicials, and that he will order a further investigation to ascertain who is to blame. As to the suggestion that we should sit only three days a week, I would say that were we sitting in a chamber that was properly ventilated we might, perhaps, well sit four days. time to deal with our correspondence properly. difficulty with some members; as a Victorian, living near home, I have not so much travelling to do as have the representatives from other States. Probably Victorians have more time than they to deal with their correspondence. I trust that the Prime Minister, when framing the sessional orders, will give consideration to the request that has come from both sides that we shall sit on only three da^a a week.

I have no sympathy with laxity of inspection, but, at the same time, I think it only fair and honest to say that inspectors who are trying 'to do their best, according to their lights, should not be charged with negligence in respect of matters of which they are not supposed to have any special knowledge. The complaint may be capable of ready explanation, if a report ibe called for, and I have no doubt that the Minister of Trade and Customs, will request the Minister of Agriculture in New South Wales to ascertain whether any explanation is forthcoming. I speak as a member of the farming community, and as a representative of a division in New South Wales in which a very large quantity of maize is produced. Tumut maize is recognised throughout Australia as being the least subject to pests, but I should be loth_, as a farmer, to say that even Tumut maize, under certain conditions, would not be subject to any pest. I hope that the Minister will not be misled by arguments used by honourable members opposite who have no expert knowledge, and who have advanced statements arising largely from ignorance. -The statement just made by the honourable member for Hume that the State inspectors could not reasonably be expected to detect the presence of microbes or the existence of certain pests or diseases in grain has occasioned me a good deal of surprise. If it is the honortoo much to expect of these officers then why are they employed? If there is any country whose exports of produce and live stock should be subject to the closest scrutiny, it is South Africa, and the very fact that this maize had come from South Africa should have induced the oflicers concerned to make a most minute inspection of it. We have in this instance another illustration of the way in which the Labour party, which is said to be a menace to the farmer, is prepared to' come to his rescue, while those who claim specially to represent him, remain"" silent. I wish now to refer to the presence of microbes in this chamber. I complained on numerous occasions last session of the want of proper ventilation, and whether we meet two days or four days a week it is high time that the ventilation of tlie chamber was improved.

Surely if a hole were knocked in it the ventilation would be improved. I have been fairly regular' in my attendance, and always desire to hear the debates, but I have made up my mind that, unless the ventilation of the chamber is improved, much of my parliamentary work shall be done outside. Is it to be said that we have not in Australia engineers capable of improving the ventilation of the building? I think that the vitiated atmosphere has a good deal to do with the bad temper that is sometimes displayed. Anything that would tend to improve the health of honourable members would be a step in the right direction. I understand that you, Mr Speaker, have charge of this matter, and I hope that efforts will be made at once to deal effectively with it. Prime Minister and Minister of Home Affairs) [5.22] --The question which has been raised In regard to the importation of maize infected with corn moth is one of the greatest gravity. Every precaution should certainly be taken to keep any new pests from Australia, for, it is beyond .cavil that any pest which exists elsewhere will certainly flourish here. I should like, however, to ask my honourable friend who has raised this question what else the Government could have done. The moment the discovery was reported to the Minister he issued instructions that every precaution should be taken, and the most complete efforts made to deal with it. slow. was provided, I think, by the honourable member for Yarra-the ex-Minister of Trade and Customs-and I am sure that he did the very best he could in the circumstances. successor has kept the -system on shows that it must be » good one. could be done. so; and I am glad to know that the best has been done to meet difficulties of the kind.

We shall consider any suggestions made, and, if practicable, put them into operation ab the earliest possible moment. In this case, apparently, the best has been done in the circumstances; and the officers concerned, who for this purpose are our officers, were thought the best men who could be put in control by the predecessors of the present Ministry.
