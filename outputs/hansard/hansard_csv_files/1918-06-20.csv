The members of the miners' executive are indignant at the efforts being made to induce men from other parts of the Commonwealth, notably from Victoria, to come to this district. They have in tbeir possession affidavits from men who bave been induced to come to Newcastle in complete ignorance of the conditions here prevailing. entirely misled,"" said the executive yesterday, ""and the conditions operating on the Maitland field misrepresented. everything possible to make widely known the position of the coal trade in this district, where there are a number of good, practical miners out of employment. It is to be regretted that the New South Wales Government, which has a branch of the Department of Labour and Industry in Newcastle, and registers employment from time to time, should permit any firm to bring men from one State to another.'' One of the men concerned, named Daniel Perry, a returned soldier, stated that fares were advanced the prospective employees, who were expected to refund the amounts later on. A representative engaged the men, who were accompanied from Victoria to Hexham by a second representative. alleged, was said about coal mining. Applicants were invited to apply to an address in Melbourne, and were informed that ""they w,ere just the class of men wanted,"" and that "" they could earn £7 per week with practically nothing to do."" Mr Perry, who is a married man with a wife and two children' dependent on him, was engaged to do pick and shovel work, and the circumstances, he states, were as follows :-On 2nd September there appeared nn advertisement in a Melbourne paper, "" Wanted, youths and men; wages. £3 10s. to £7 a week."" After making application re work, and inquiring if there was any industrial trouble, 1 was told there was none, and accepted a position. O ii arrival at HexhamI was taken out of the Commissioner's train, placed in a coal train, and conveyed to Richmond-Main Colliery. T found the place under police protection. found out that the Federatiun members lnd refused to work with the loyalists, and in consequence there was trquble. I immediately quitted the work. I complain of the injustice of bringing men from Victoria without first acquainting tliem with f u l l knowledge of existing local conditions. In my case nothing was said of the dispute existing, and the first knowledge I got of this was when I arrived at Richmond-Main Colliery. There was no work suitPacific Co., Goodwin able for me in Newcastle, and I had no alternative but to return to Victoria. Apply between .10 a.m. and 12 Firms in Victoria are permitted to advertise for men to go to New South Wales without stating the true facts, and they are inducing them to go to the adjoining advertisement State only to find when they arrive there that they have been misled. This practice has been going on for a considerable time past, and I have had occasion to draw attention to it on several previous occasions. When I spoke of it before there was industrial trouble in the mining disI t is as f o l l o w s: tricts, and when the point was raised whether the unionists would be prepared to work with the loyalists who were engaged to take their places during that' 'trouble, I gave the assurance that they would do so. They' have done so, but I am sorry to say that, although the Recruit"" The men have been ing Conference convened by the Governor General recommended that everything possible should be done to create harmony We are doing by reinstating men who had lost thenpositions during the trouble, there are many men in my district who still remain idle. They have been unemployed for fully twelve months. They have beeu victimized, and have had to be supported by their fellow men who have been working alongside loyalists. Is it not strange that there should be a recurrence of the position? The same Mr John Brown who has a contract with the Victorian State Government has trouble again with his workmen, through seeking to compel them Nothing, he to fill two skips at the same time, which many of them have refused to do. The point is whether the Commonwealth Government are justified in permitting misleading statements being made to workmen in Victoria in order to induce them to go to another State to work. Many returned soldiers have gone to New South Wales thinking that they would get work there. I would like the Acting Prime Minister( Mr Watt) to ask the Minister for Repatriation whether an application has been made by any of these people to the Department for Repatriation for the services of returned soldiers. On making inquiries, T I am sure that neither Senator Millen",26,Adjournment Formal Employment Of Victorian Labour I N
75,Mr Charlton (Hunter) [11.40],"nor his Department -would permit of this practice if it were known to them. Possibly this agency has made no application to the Repatriation Department, but we should ascertain whether it has or not. It is curious to find the same manMr celled in any other part of Australia. John Brown-and the same following cropping up again and again in cases of this kind. Is it not remarkable that Mr like myself, have advocated recruiting Brown, although one of the wealthiest men in Australia, is constantly in trouble with his employees? I have no desire to be personal, but it would be interesting to learn exactly what he has done to assist in the prosecution of the war. ""When we find that, as the result of action on the part of this man, disruption is being caused in the community to such, an extent as to interfere with recruiting, I think we are entitled to ascerknow the character of this agency, but I tain exactly what he has done with his wealth, and what assistance he is giving Australia in the prosecution of the war. The position ought to be inquired into. I do not say that Mr Brown is connected with the advertisement to which I have referred, but it is singular that the men have to go to this colliery in his private train. This action is being acquiesced in by the State Government. The colliery to which I have referred is working as before, and the Abermain colliery has also, I think, settled its grievance. I want to know whether the Commonwealth Government, which is charged with the duty of looking after the interests of Austhis deception is allowed to continue it tralia in this time of crisis, intends to assert itself? The Commonwealth Government is paramount. Every State Government is subordinate to it, and it is charged with the duty of doing everything possible to promote harmony in the community, and so to encourage recruiting. I ask. honourable members to consider what is likely to be the effect of incidents of this kind in my electorate, as well as in the electorates of Newcastle, from the door. But while this is going Macquarie, and Illawarra? This sort of thing is going on all the time. occurred at Broken Hill. are constantly being sent from other States to the New South ""Wales coal mining districts under promise of profitable employment, only to find on arrival that they are expected to work against trade unionists who throughout this war have been most loyal. The Newcastle and Maitland miners, in proportion to their numbers, have responded to the call for recruits in a way that has not been exIncidents of this kind, however, must do an immense amount of harm. Men who, from the beginning, are placed in a most invidious position when the Government allow returned soldiers and others to he treated in this way. I and others, who. have entered heartily into the work of recruiting, are not given a fair show to . assist the Empire in this hour of trial. The Commonwealth Government should not permit any individual or State to indulge in practices of this kind. I do not take it that it must be connected with the gentleman to whom I have referred. If men who respond to these advertisements were told the whole of the facts on making application, the position would be different. It must not be forgotten that a large percentage of those who have gone to the Front are trade unionists, and that consequently there are many trade unionists among our returned soldiers. Are they to be deceived in this way? Are they to be sent from one State to another, and to be asked on reaching their destination, to take the bread and butter out of the mouths of fellow unionists? If will make it impossible for us to go on the recruiting platform. Everybody knows what, the Commonwealth Government is doing at the present moment"" in order to enable many of the workers in the districts I haye named to get a crust. As the result of action taken by the Government many men in the Newcastle district are being employed for three days a week, so that they may keep the wolf on, we find agencies advertising for men in Victoria, and sending them over to Newcastle in the belief that they will be able to earn up to £7 per week if they accept employment there. They are naturally attracted by .such offers, and they go over only to find that they have been deceived. The Government should probe this matter to the bottom, ascertain who are the",27,Loyali St Labour

I saw a newspaper paragraph recently, stating that many returned soldiers from Victoria were stranded in New South Wales, whither they had gone in response to advertisements of this kind. In such cases either the Colliery Employees Federation or some other charitable body has supplied the men with money to enable them to return to their homes. Is that a fair position in which to place any man who has fought and suffered for his country? No honourable member will say that it is, and yet this sort of thing is going on continually, the sole purpose being, it seems to me, to suit the convenience of one vindictive individual. I make that statement deliberately, and think it a pity that he should own a coal mine. terned. anything he has done to forward the interests of the country. In this time of crisis we are constantly having turmoil created by him in regard to comparatively unimportant matters. The Acting Prime Minister( Mr Watt) will probably reply that this is essentially a State question. My answer to that contention is that at the present juncture, in all matters affecting national interests, the to which he has referred. I am unable State authorities sink into insignificance, and that the Commonwealth Government is paramount, and should take action. The Government should require any firm or individual who advertises for labour to he employed in another State to give the fullest information as to the district and the conditions under which that labour is to be employed. Above all things, the Government should see that no deception is practised. I have taken this means of bringing this question before the House"" so that it may be brought prominently before the working men of Victoria. I tell the working men of this State that in Newcastle and Maitland to-day there is not sufficient work to employ the men already there, and that action has to be taken by charitable organizations to prevent some of them from starving. It is idle to talk of promoting harmony in the community, with the object of encouraging recruiting, while at the same time the Government allow individuals to eat out the very vitals of the nation. This company has been in trouble from the 'first, although other companies are working. Why should Mr Brown be always in trouble with his employees? He has a number of collieries, and while he may be working one or two the others are shut down. After the recent industrial trouble had been settled, and the men had returned to work, he changed the working conditions. I ask .the Acting Prime Minister to take hold of this matter, to have a thorough inquiry made, and to sift it to the bottom. I ask him to ascertain who constitute this agency, what information they give a man who applies for employment, how many men have been sent over, how many have accepted employment on reaching the district, why many have refused to work on getting there, and what happened to them, and especially to the returned soldiers, who, in consequence of this advertisement, went to New South Wales and were stranded there. Minister and Treasurer) [11.52] I have listened with interest to the remarks of the honourable member for Hunter( Mr Charlton), who has presented his case, as he usually does, temperately ancl reasonably. I have to say at once that I have no acquaintance whatever with the facts even to speculate as to who . is responsible for the condition of affairs to which he alludes, or as to what cure should be applied to it . I certainly think the honourable member has made outa case for Government inquiry, and I make myself responsible for that statement. I do not know whether the State Government or any one in Victoria is responsible for what has occurred, but I shall ascertain the full facts, and inform the honourable member of the results of my inquiry. I shall probably take steps, if I find it necessary or advisable, to cure the defect to which he has referred. -The matter brought forward by the ton) involves an important principle. Although the illustration used by him is purely local, and applies particularly to the mining districts, there are still wider principles involved. Two main points",28,Loyali St Labour

82,Honourable Member For Hunter ( Mr Charl,"have to he dealt with. ""We have first oi all a misleading advertisement inducing men to accept an offer of employment without being acquainted with the conditions prevailing in the district to which they.are to be sent. Such advertisements are generally so worded as to attract men seeking' work, and at the same time to conceal from them the actual facts in regard to the employment to which they are to be sent. A t the opening of this Parliament, the Ministerial statement put forward included the announcement that a Minister for Labour was likely to be appointed, to whom matters of this kind might properly be referred. I do not know whether the Government have given any further attention to that proposal, but it seen long lists of men of various trades, is evident that drastic action is necessary to prevent workmen being placed at a serious disadvantage. This kind of thing is not confined to any one State; it is in operation in all the States. For reasons that are not obvious, but can only be guessed at, men are being invited to travel from one State to another by specious promises of comfortable positions. As in the case of this particular advertisement, men are promised billets where they will earn from £3 10s. to £7 per week, with practically nothing to do. ""We are not such fools as not to be aware that billets at even £3 10s. a week, with practically nothing to do, are not obtainable. Honest men do not want such jobs. They are willing to give an honest day's work for an honest payment, and the promises eontained in these advertisements on the very face of them are meant to be misleading. Obviously they cannot be substantiated in fact. Unfortunately, many who are attracted by such advertisements bave to leave their homes and families, and in some cases to travel from 300 to 500 miles . in search of one of these fancy jobs, only to discover, on reaching their destination, that they have been deceived.' They are thus left stranded, with no work in prospect, and no means of returning to their homes. I suggest to the Acting Prime Minister( Mr ""Watt) that the Government should give early consideration to their promise to put. a Department of Labour into active operation. If that promise were redeemed questions of this kind could be speedily dealt with. Mr Finlayson. I wish now to refer briefly to the matter as it affects the returned soldier. I am sure honourable members on both sides are unanimous in the opinion that whoever else deserves protection and assistance, the returned soldier certainly does. It is a reflection on our organization as a community, and on our recognition of the services rendered by our returned men, that any of them should be deprived to any extent of an opportunity to earn their own living. The repatriation proposal are meant to some extent to get over the difficulty, but, unfortunately, day after day, we see in the public newspapers advertisements announcing that the Repatriation Department has on its books many men seeking employment. I have and with certain technical abilities for whom the Repatriation Department is seeking to find employment. The Brisbane newspapers the other day set out a list of something like 200 men on the books of the Returned Soldiers Repatriation Department, who were awaiting employment. That is so in all the States. The honourable member for Hunter( Mr Charlton) certainly does not exaggerate the unfortunate results of these advertisements, and of men finding themselves unable to earn a living. Returned soldiers are either the best or the worse argument for recruiting; they provide to those who are eligible for enlistment either an argument in favour of enlisting or an argument against; and it is a most regrettable fact that returned soldiers' statements and experiences have not been conducive to recruiting. Returned soldiers in the mass have not been able to say that their experiences justify them in honestly and strongly recommending their comrades to enlist. This is very unsatisfactory. Even from, the point of view of relieving the returned soldier from any difficulty in inducing his comrades to enlist-if only as a means of encouraging recruiting-the Government ought to take special care that he gets the utmost consideration in regard ""to opportunities for earning his living. To have returned soldiers going about the streets of the cities vainly seeking for work, although willing and anxious to give a fair day's return for a fair day's pay, is an argument against recruiting that is very hard to get over. No amount of talking from the platform, no amount of enthusiasm with brass bands and flag napping, is going to provide a sufficient argument for recruiting when set against the actual experience of the returned' soldier. ought to give very serious consideration to the question that has been raised this morning, and I hope that the rather short reply of the Acting Prime Minister( Mr matter of urgent public importance, Watt) does not indicate any lack of appreciation of the seriousness) of the facts or of the necessity for some action at a very early date. desire to approach this question from the point of .view of the employment of returned soldiers. When the honourable member for Hunter( Mr Charlton) was speaking I interjected that the practice to which he referred was being followed at BrokenH ill , in the treatment of unionists, who having returned from the war, are now seeking employment. of 23rd July last, there appeared the following:At the meeting of the B.D.A.P.L.L. held last night, Mr E. M. Horsington (secretary of the F.E.D. and F.A.) wrote as follows :"" Enclosed is a copy of a letter we have forwarded to the Repatriation Department. The letter explains itself. We think it is a matter (hat the P.L.L. could take up."" The enclosure stated :The Officer in Charge, Department of Repatriation, South Australia.

"" A case that came under our notice is J. W. Corbett, a returned soldier, who was offered a job through your Department at engine-cleaning, &c, at the Zinc Corporation, Broken Hill, on conditions that only made the company liable to 40 per cent, of his wages, the balance to be made up out of bis pension and the Repatriation Fund. This we think is ..very unfair both to the returned soldiers and to the Government, inasmuch as Corbett is quite able to do all the work required, and for which other men are paid lis. 3d. per day. "" The only one who would benefit under this proposal would be the Zinc Corporation, who would be getting the man's labour for 60 per cent, less owing to his being a returned soldier. Johnson) I am afraid that the honourable member is going beyond the terms of the motion, which refers to certain statements made by a firm in Victoria. transgress, but I understand that we are discussing generally the provision of work for returned soldiers. the scope of the motion: The motion for the adjournment of the House is moved for the purpose of discussing a definite namely, misleading statements made by a firm in Victoria for the purpose of in ducing men to proceed to New South Wales for mining purposes submit that I am in order, because the firm of which I speak has its head office in Collins-street, Melbourne. In response to a letter received from the secretary of the Political Labour Leaguei n connection with this matter, I wrote to the Repatriation Department on the 21st of August as follows: Enclosed please find letter received from the In the Barrier Daily Truth Barrier District Assembly Political Labour League, enclosing copy of communication re ceived from Keswick Barracks, Adelaide, and signed by Lieutenant Napier. Also an extract from Barrier Daily Truth newspaper of the issue of the 23rd of July, 1918. As you will see by the correspondence and clipping, it is alleged that a returned soldier by name J. W. Corbett was offered employment as an engine-cleaner at the Zinc Corporation. Broken Hill, through the Repatriation Department, on conditions that made the Zinc Corporation only liable for 40 per cent, of his wages, the ' balance of GO' per cent, to be made up by his pension and the repatriation funds.

When the subject was referred -by the Government to the Inter-State Commission in August last year, what happened after the whole matter had been fixed by the Government? Butchers advertised that they were selling more cheaply than the Government prices. But the people who had the meat to sell, namely, the graziers and the stock agents, took good care that those butchers could not get the meat. They closed down the tory of Victoria, the Newmarket sales were abandoned. Not one sheep came in. They stopped the stock on the road. Cattle which had been put on trucks were sent back. Those men deliberately organized a strike in connection with the food supply of the people.

255,,"Mr TUDOR -But I am speaking ofhigh cost of living, so they should gaol some of those who are keeping up the high cost of living. Like other honorahle members, I received a letter some time ago from Mr a profit of £10,823 on a capital of £11,837, Hall informing me that he had been instructed by the executive of his union to ask honourable members to protest against the fixation of prices in regard to meat. I need not go into the details of the case for the producers. I am willing that every person in this country should receive a fair thing, but I am entirely opposed to the manner in which the middlemen and stock agents are increasing the prices for the handling of our stock. In my reply to Mr Hall, I told him I would not act as he suggested, and move in the House for the disallowance of the regulation, as I had heen agitating on behalf of the people who were being exploited. when you were in power, and prices were 40 per cent, higher then. When I was in power I stopped them sending their stuff away, and when the New South Wales Government, in defiance of the Commonwealth regulations, said they intended to put butter on board ship for export, I said, "" All right, go ahead; but I shall see that no ship gets a clearance from Australia so long as that produce is on board."" I stopped butter from being sent away from Australia in order to create an artificial shortage, and I remind honourable members that «in April or May of this year the Assistant Minister promised that when the production in Yictoria had increased the prices here would be lowered to 149.4s. per cwt. Production in Victoria has increased, but now the Government say that there can be no reduction in the price of butter until the Australian production has reached its maximum, with the result that, although Victoria is producing 500 tons per week, butter to-day is at its higher level in values. Let me quote some sworn evidence given before the InterState Commission in regard to this matter. Mr J"". N . Williams, the secretary of the Grocers Association of Victoria, who is not a Labour man, gave evidence that the Gippsland and Northern Co-operative Selling Company last year made a profit of £12,786 on a capital of £66,969, or 19 per cent.; the Western District Co-operative Company a profit of £7,163 on a capital of £22,045, a net profit of 32 per cent.; while the Victorian Butter Pactories Limited made or a net profit of 91.4 per cent. Those are the people that are making the profits. If a. man puts his money into the war loan it will take him twenty years to get that return, but if he puts it into a butter company he will get 91 per cent, in one year. Yet people wonder why the price of butter is going so high. the returns for three or four years ? the sworn evidence of the secretary of an association that does not support us, but that puts its money in to support honourable members on the other side. I read a statement made by a gentleman in Sydney the other day to the effect that when they put their money in to support the Nationalist candidates at the last election, they did not expect the Nationalists to bring forward the war-time profits tax. I said here when we last met that men can insure against anything in this country, and that a lot of people insured against taxation and price fixing by putting their money in to support honourable members opposite. Prices have not been fixed recently, and are not being fixed to-day, by the Price-fixing Commissioners, in accordance with the facts before them, but are being fixed in accordance with the result of the election on 5th May of last year. They know that honourable members opposite do not care a snap of the fingers how high prices go for those who have to pay. I should be lacking in my duty if I did not protest here against the way the public are being fleeced at the present time. The Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) put the matter well when he wrote that referendum pamphlet in 1915, fourteen months after the war started. . He said thenWe all know how the cost of living has increased, so that it is .with the utmost difficulty that the bulk of the community are able with the greatest economy to make both ends meet; and, making every allowance for the effects of the draught, there can be no doubt whatever that this is due very largely to manipulation of the market by unscrupulous persons at the expense of the community. These persons frequently pose as patriots.",42,Prices Of Meats In July 1914 To 1918 Victoria

There is nothing of the Pharisee about me. I do not pose at all. I am here to point out what the Ministry have failed to do. They have failed to see, after prices have been fixed, that the stuff was got to the market for the people. They have beeu humbugging over this question for-twelve months. To-day, when I asked if it was a fact that the squatters and graziers went to the Ministry and said, "" You have to increase prices,"" and whether there were any consumers on the deputation, I was' told to postpone my question until Wednesday. By that date I shall have spoken, and will have no opportunity of dealing with the answer when it is given. I regret that there is no time to deal with a number of other matters. I wished to refer to one or two connected Avith the Defence Department. One woman received word that her son had been killed. Three months afterwards she was notified by the Defence Department that he had been sentenced for something, and that his pay had been reduced to 2s. 6d. per week. When we wrote to the Defence Department about this, they replied that they were sorry the mistake had occurred.

It is very easy for city dwellers, who climb the Post Office tower and look around and think they see Australia, to cavil at the man ' on the land, and denounce him for increased price -.. When the policy of fixing the prices for beef and mutton was adopted, these people seemed to think there was only one aide to the question-the consumers' side. Let me tell the honourable member for Yarra( Mr Tudor) that there is also the producers' side. The producer has had a very bad time, and is complaining as bitterly as the consumer. It is easy for the those to talk who do not understand country conditions. I condemn price fixing entirely, because we are going altogether on the wrong basis. Before we start to fix the price of stock or beef' and mutton, we must fix wages, and fix the seasons. As the honourable member for Wakefield ( Mr Foster) interjects, we must also fix the amount of work to be done for the money.

275,Mr Austin Chapman (Eden,"prepared to pay high, wages. The honoraud no one has had more experience on the land than he has-know s that the man on tiie land objects to pay wages to men who want the work given out at the same time. The trouble in this country is that the man on the land cannot get the men to do the work for him. I do not view the Ministerial statement with any degree of satisfaction. It is not so much what is in it as what ought to be in it, and is not, that we should cavil at. The idea seems to be flogged to death in this country that when the revenue does not equal the expenditure, we must keep on taxing until it does. We all know that in war-time very large sums of money have to be expended and that we are obliged to find the necesGovernment instead of seven, and one sary funds. But I wish to complain, not about the war expenditure, but about the general expenditure of government. Without being a carping critic, I wish to know from Ministers why, .some effort is not being made now to curtail expenditure. Is no effort to be made to cut it down? What are we going to do with the Public Service? Everybody in this House is aware that the Public Service is a great deal too big for this country. It is well known that there are lots of men in the Public Service who are overpaid and underworked, and that many of them are doing practically nothing but writing minutes to each other. the high cost of living. If you are not careful, you will lose your twelve quid a week, because they all have votes. risk the loss. I will speak my mind here, no matter whom it offends. I do not denounce all public servants. There are many good public servants, on the other hand, who are overworked and underpaid. They themselves object to the present system, but the fact remains that the real bosses of this country are the public servants, and the honourable member for Hume puts his finger on the spot when he says that they all have votes. They have lots of relatives and friends, and can influence numbers of votes. Therefore, what I am saying now is not likely to be very popular. But we must have a different system, whereby the public servants will not run the country, but the country shall run the public servants, and tell them what they have to do. The Minister sitting at the table ( Mr Poynton) knows that we have been promised for the last year or two that there shall be only one Taxation Department in this country instead of seven. I believe I heard the Minister raise his voice in protest against the continued existence of six State and one Commonwealth taxing departments. agree to have only one. States will not agree to it, if we get a strong Government in this country they will say, ""We want not only one taxing department instead of seven, but only one Parliament and one Governor General."" What do we want with seven Parliaments, and seven Governors, and fourteen Houses of Parliament? It is time we looked carefully into that question. I am strongly in favour of Unification. This country cannot be governed under the present system without taxing the people to death. people will agree to Unification, we shall have to show a better example under Pederal administration. people in the country districts can manage their local affairs perfectly well. All the brains and wisdom are not centred in the big cities. With a proper system of local government we do not want fourteen Houses' of Parliament and seven printing offices and seven Governors. If we persist in retaining the present system,-the natural corollary is heavy taxation. Honourable members may. squeal, but it is no' good criticising the Government unless one can show a way out. Why cannot we in this country adopt the system now followed in little Tasmania, where there is only one electoral roll and one set of electoral officials for State and Commonwealth ? ment are going to do that. sick of listening to Ministers who are always going to do things.

284,Mr Austin Chapman,"I amof the boot"" to them, and that is what they need. We are drifting into a bad position, because we are getting Executive government only, and Parliament has no say. I shall be told to-night and to-morrow that I have no right to criticise a Government of which I am a supporter, but I refuse to adopt the conception of government that is being pushed on us now, or to bow down to the members who sit on the front bench of the Opposition and think that everything they say is right. We want a live Opposition, conducted on intelligent lines, and not on carping party lines. At a time like this we might well dispense with party cries, and try to forget party divisions. I am looking forward to the time when the soldiers who have been fighting so well for us come back here, and with a long arm drag a lot of people out of this Chamber and take control of this country. I hope they do, because they could not mismanage it more than we have mismanaged it. The cost of government is far too high. It is said that the Puiblic Service commands a lot of votes; but changes are necessary there, and the Government should be strong enough to bring them ahout. I shall give my support to any proper proposal, from whatever quarter, to that end. It ill-becomes honourable members opposite to complain of. the expenditure on elections. money is found for their candidates than for any others. This is the twentyeighth year that I have been in Parliament, and during the whole of that time no one has contributed a £5-note towards my expenses There are many other honourable members on this side who can say the same -tfhing. All credit to the supporters of -Labour candidates if , knowing that their representatives require money to fight their battles, they provide it. Tens to build up. of thousands of pounds have been spent by the unions on political campaigns. No one knows better than bhe 'honourable member for Maranoa that what I am saying is true. plead guilty to that. heard the honourable member say that an election costs him less than £5. honourable member is cheap at the price. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Tudor) referred to the war-time profits tax. lionaire, was man enough to say that it does not touch him. as at present levied, is preventing new industries from being established, while many who are -making money out of the war are contributing nothing to the revenue. The Government will not be worlfh its salt if it does not amend the law so as to catch these gentlemen. No one should be allowed to make money out of the war; as money is being made by those connected with shipping and other big concerns. What is the reason for the increase in the prices of articles of local consumption? Is it not evidence that there is profiteering? The Government should impose penalties which will prevent this. But it is useless to increase taxation unless, at the same time, economy is observed in the administration of public affairs. Taxation is never palatable; but the poorest man will be prepared to pay his share if the wealthy is hit hard. The Government should hit the wealthy man hard. They should impose 'heavy taxation on the profiteers. But I protest against bhe complaint that We know that more has been made about the producers. One might think that the consumers alone are to be considered. Tbe consumers, of course, must be protected; but it is the middleman who makes the profits, and the Government should, prevent the making of undue middle profits. Great mistakes have occurred in connection with price fixing, in regard to which matters seem to -be going from bad to worse. Of course, it is easy to criticise, but difficult I ask the Government to say what it proposes to do in regard to the administration of the Public Service, and also dn regard to the standardizing of electoral legislation and taxation returns. In my district, some -men pay two or three times as much to bave their returns made up as their taxation comes to.

But since the beginning of the war, we, in this Parliament, have talked economy and have practised extravagance. The Government and Parliament have yet to prove by action that they aresincere in their professions of economy. I am not to 'be led aside because this involves the construction of only 7 miles of railway, and a comparatively small expenditure, because for a very long time, as honourable members are wellaware, I have done all I possibly could to secure economies, and -though many promises have been made that economy would be practised, none of them has been kept. member is referring to the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta railway. urged economy in connection with every public expenditure, as the honourable member knows.

One rises to discuss a. motion of this character with considerable-diffidence, because one realizes that, altogether apart from its merits, it is essential that the members of the Public Works Committee should be afforded an opportunity of educating themselves still further upon this subject.

[229]2 the Works Committee are treating the House with proper respect. Here they have an opportunity of showing how inadvisable it is for us to entrust them with the determination of this question, and .yet they . absent themselves from the chamber! In regard to the proposed establishment of the Arsenal in the Pederal Territory I have a feeling that this matter has been controlled by persons outside this House, who are animated with the idea that, for some vague strategic reason, it is necessary for this parWe know that to-day we are ticular activity to be centred in Commonwealth territory. During my brief and inglorious career at the Works Department, I had an opportunity of studying the business disqualifications of the Federal Capital area, and subsequently I had an opportunity of ascertaining the quantity of coal that was being expended upon the production of rifles at the Lithgow Small Arms Factory. The figures which I obtained in this connection are worthy of our attention. I found that at Lithgow roughly about 5 cwt. of coal> in addition to a certain quantity of coal Presuming gas, was required to produce every rifle. I ascertained that the difference between the price of coal at Lithgow and its price at the Federal Capital, would mean that if we commenced the manufacture, of rifles at the latter place, and expended upon their production the same quantity of coal as is used at the former, each riflewould cost an additional 5s. or 6s. say that the difference would amount to only 4£d. per rifle. anything. But I have never yet heard of a Royal Commission investigating the work of those experts which has not recommended that something, should' be done which was entirely contrary to their views. But, in addition to the factor of the coal shortage within the Federal Capital area, there is another vital consideration, namely, that of shortage of labour. If we were running an Arsenal at the Federal Capital, and one man absented himself from a gang of employees,the whole gang would be upset. We.

365,Mr Kelly,"The experts will sayI can find no justification for the proposal to establish this Commonwealth activity within Pederal territory except that which is embodied in the idea that every Commonwealth concern ought to be located in Commonwealth territory. Years ago one used to hear these things vaguely spoken of by certain public servants, whose .zeal in this direction has been chiefly responsible for the proposal to locate the Arsenal at the Federal' Capital. Their idea is that it would be unsafe to locate any Commonwealth industry in State territory because the .State might seize it, and the Federal activity would thus come to an end! This idea, which is the product of the very excellent antagonism that has been witnessed between Federal and State public servants, is not likely to appeal to honourable members. of the history of this matter, we find, first, that a Minister, who at the time was in control of the Department of Home Affairs, started out to consider the establishment of an Arsenal. Not knowing very much about the matter himself, he sent an oflicer to India'in order to acquire information upon it. After his visit to that country this officer discovered that water was a very vital essential in connection with the activities of such an enterprise, and entered very largely into the question of economy of production. As a result, he came back and modified his first proposal by abandoning the site which he had previously recommended in favour of a site 10 miles away on the side of the Murrumbidgee. A new. Committee was deputed to investigate the matter. This Committee has a very strong personnel from a business point of view. But the places that were referred to it as likely to constitute suitable' sites were not places which would ordinarily be referred to such a Committee. completely excluded from its investigations. nnd some other places that were far removed from any centre where labour was available. production would be enormous. consideration. tory would locate it in a place where he for Batman, and I fail to see any reason could get plenty of labour. Mr Kelly. accessibility to a labour market, and the ability to get raw materials cheaply, are the two essentials in connection with any such enterprise. Now, the present Committee has not been given, a fair chance. It has not been asked where it would locate this Arsenal. It has been told, that the Arsenal must be located so many miles from the coast. Who decided this matter? It has been laid down clearly -enough by all experts that the efficient defence of Australia depends upon our command of the seas. that? any scheme for the adequate defence of Australia, including Kitchener's proSpeaking broadly posal, has been based upon the essential condition that we retain the command of the seas. So long as we do that, we shall be able to defend ourselves against anything but raids and raids from the air. Viewed from this stand-point, a stronglydefended Newcastle would probably be the best site for the establishment of an -Arsenal. Defence considerations have changed considerably in the past four years. The aim of this country should be to defend itself adequately in conjunction with the rest of the Empire, and to concentrate its danger points in as few places as possible-becaus e we have to defend ourselves from the air nowadays as well as from the land and from the sea. The defence question in this regard has never yet been considered by a competent authority. So far as the location of this Arsenal is concerned, we have been merely ' told that it is necessary to have it so many . miles inland. .We know, on the other hand, that its establishment there will become a permanent load upon the community ; and I would hesitate to acquiesce in the expending of any money in that direction unless I could feel that such exNewcastle, for example, was penditure was absolutely essential.

371,Mr Kelly,"I am interested in thei f that remark of his is a real reflex of his mind. This House generally, I feel sure, hopes that if the present wave of advance in favour of the Allies is brought to success, we shall secure such a disarmament among the nations as will enable us to remove the bulk of the load represented by arsenals, naval sites, and the like from the taxpayers' shoulders, and to devote all the energies wrapt up in matters of . that nature to the peaceful development of mankind. Even while we are talking here of the construction of an Arsenal, where it cannot be economically operated, we are deciding tbe great issue upon the battlefield. That consideration alone should weigh with honourable members when talking of the establishment of an industry which can only be really completely equipped and established after the war. reasons, I am compelled to vote against the reference. The same viewpoint applies also to the matter of naval bases. There is waste of money going on all over Australia. It is impossible to say what will be the distribution of naval forces after the war is over, and it is sheer lunacy to be pouring money into the sands at the Naval Bases around Australia's southern coasts until the war shall have been ended, when we may know where we stand. tantly compelled to oppose the reference in what I consider to be the public in terest. During last session it was decided that the Arsenal should be established at Tuggeranong, and nearly a quarter of a million of money was voted towards the construction. expended. been passed, and it is now in process of being expended. this reference has passed. money is being spent now. W it h a view to practising economy in the construction of the Arsenali t is proposed to build a r a i l w ay to save cartage. A ny man who looks at the map must see that the Government w ill make a saving by building the line. . When the Lithgow Small Arms Factory was being built, after carting all the material from the nearest railway . point by traction engines and the like, it was concluded that had those in charge constructed a small line of railway thousands of pounds would have been saved. The Department is now realizing that the first and most essential step is to put down this short line of 8£ miles into the heart of the site where the works are to be carried on. Another point is that the honourable member for Brisbane( Mr Finlayson), in giving a description of the country which it is proposed to serve, stated that it would not cater for any population. I point out that it w i ll serve a large population of the employees in the Arsenal, since there will be a township in the neighbourhood. It has nothing to do with the line from the Federal Capital to Yass JuncFor .these tion. That is another proposition. shown on the plan is to be about 2 miles from the Arsenal. assist in the development of the township.

The whole business should be pushed on with at once to bring about a greater saving of public money. cording to the plans as laid on the table, there is -only one course provided, and that would pin down the Public Works Committee to that particular course.

381,Mr Charlton (Hunter) [ 4 . 4 ],"Ialtogether, bring about world disarma-: ment, shall we be justified in spending money upon the erection of an Arsenal in Australia? This matter can well afford to stand over until we know where we are and what the outcome of the war will he. We might find the whole situation so changed that there will be no necessity whatever for the expenditure of a huge sum of money on the Arsenal. the Committee may make a-recommendation to that effect. might do that; but, as far as I am concerned, I can see no urgency in this matter at all. I may say, further, that, when this question was under discussion before, I understood the Minister for the Navy( Sir Joseph Cook), who is now in England,, to say that the Factory at Lithgow would not be removed; yet we have now heard from the honourable member for Eden-Monaro( Mr Austin Chapman) that it is to he shifted. cide that. A statement was made tliat work would be continued at Lithgow, although the parent factory would be established at Canberra. vernment attempt to move the Factory from Lithgow, they will receive my most strenuous opposition, because I am satisfied that it-will lead to an increased expenditure in tlie cost of rifles. I have had occasion to visit the Lithgow Factory, and I found.that at first the rifles were costing a large sum' of money, principally owing to the inexperienced labour then employed upon their production, and .because at the time the Factory was not then equipped with up-to-date machinery. the rifles when they are made? vernment have purchased up-to-date machinery, and have duplicated some of the plant at the Factory, which is now in good working order, and there is a hope that the cost of production will be still further reduced. I ask honourable members what would be the result if the Government dismantled this Factory and took the machinery up to the Capital site? 1 am satisfied that the majority of the experienced workmen now employed at the Lithgow Factory will not go to Canberra. They will not go up to that cold country and away from the centre of civilization, but will obtain employment in Sydney and other populous centres. ously state that men would rather live at Lithgow than up at Canberra? of my own experience. I would prefer Lithgow every time as against Canberra. I was up at the Capital site during one Christmas season, and the weather was so cold that I could hardly live there. I repeat that, we have reduced the cost of production of rifles at Lithgow, and that, if the Government dismantle the machinery and take it up to Canberra, the n^anagement will be faced with the' same dim-' culties again, with the result that there will be a big increase in the cost of rifle production. As far as the Capital itself is concerned, I shall always be prepared to give it reasonable support; but, as to> this particular matter, I do not see that we would be justified in spending a large sum df money until we are quite sure that it will be necessary. If there is to be a division on this motion, I shall oppose it . think the time is inopportune for the Government to set about the establishment of a great Arsenal at Canberra. Everyone who has studied war problems knows. that the instruments of destruction now used are vastly different from those that were employed at the commencement of the war; and, therefore, the Government, in my opinion, would not be justified in going on with this work, because we do not know what instruments of destruction will be required to meet the needs of tbe army in the future. As for the Small Arms Factory, I have some doubt concerning the wisdom of shifting it from Lithgow. I agree with the honourable member for-Hun ter ( Mr Charlton) that the successful management of a small arms factory depends upon a regular supply of skilled mechanics and apprentices, and,, therefore, that the Factory should be as near as possible to the large centres of population, so that the labour employed may be supplemented as required. In the older countries of the world all such establishments are so situated that plenty of labour may be readily obtained to cope with the periods of rush' work.",57,Chapman S O They Word Of This Parliament We Should Not

390,Mr West (East Sydney) [4.10],"II think it is better that honourable members should vote against the motion today. We shall lose nothing by delay, and' it might be in the interests of the people to postpone this work. If the Government are so flush of money that they can go on with a scheme like this, they should first see if they can reduce taxation, and so make it easier for the people to contribute to any further loans that, may be necessary. We must bear in mind that the soldier at the Front has no opportunity of investing money in 5 per cent, loans. Only those who are left behind-'the people who are benefiting by increased profits-are . able to do this. As the House wishes to go to a vote on the motion, I shall not say any more just now. would not have risen to speak on this matter but for the fact,that I intend to oppose the motion, and I do not think I should give a silent vote. I am quite in accord with the reasons that have ibeen UTged against the proposal. I see no urgency at all in regard to this subject, and I never have. I think it would be more business-like, and possibly lead to greater efficiency, if we delayed the proposed reference. I shall oppose the motion for the reasons that have been given already. . But there are other reasons., I do not think a proposal of this nature should come before the House until we have had the Budget, and until we know what are the taxation proposals of the .Government, what retrenchment is possible, and have full information on the financial position generally. I hope that the motion will not be carried. Every one who has read war history, even in the most cursory way, must know that the whole military business and methods of warfare generally are absolutely in the melting pot I hope the recommendations of tbe We have no assurance that if the Arsenal is . started now it will not be obsolete before it is completed. The House should set its face resolutely against passing a vote for a single £1 unless the expenditure is absolutely essenployers and employees in the printing tial. If the motion is not postponed until after the Budget, I hope it will be rejected, and that not ls. of expenditure will be undertaken by the House until we know the taxes the Government propose to put on the people, and particularly the amount of retrenchment they propose to undertake. The matter of retrenchment is the most urgent question before the House and the country, and before the House knows how far the Government intend to reduce their expenditure, we should not vote a single ls. in this direction.
