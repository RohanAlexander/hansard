Let it be said on In that respect, it is particularly unfortunate record that I, amongst others, have raised this that President Chirac has seen fit to refuse a with the Americans. I have been assured that visit to the Swedish Prime Minister and the they have made offers to the French, even Austrian Chancellor.

Certainly when they have are concerned, there is little doubt that he has already had nearly 200 tests of their own you little communication with his own ministers. would think they would have the fundamental As has been said, the discussions with each of information. To my mind, the fact that the his ministers-the Minister for Defence, the Americans were prepared to give them the Minister for Development Cooperation and additional information totally destroys the the Minister for Overseas Territories-were validity of their calibration requirements in exactly the reverse of the statements he made future testing.

It being 6 p.m.,Thursday, 28 September 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 2027 Thursday, 28 September 1995 Banking, Finance and Public Administration Committee Report Debate resumed from 27 September, on motion by Mr Simmons: That the House take note of the report. of Representatives Standing Committee on Banking, Finance and Public Administration affords me the opportunity of looking at bank closures throughout Australia in recent years. The committee has considered this issue, and it is one of particular importance to rural communities. I note that page 25 of the report says that the committee has had discussions with the Reserve Bank and also the Australian Bankers Association regarding what they believe has been a major concern-and I want to reinforce that concern-that consumers in rural areas are feeling the impact and effect of bank closures right throughout Australia. It has been particularly evident in Victoria, where the Commonwealth Bank, when it took over the former State Bank of Victoria, has been one of the signal offenders in this matter. The Commonwealth Bank has closed many hundreds of small branches throughout country and rural areas, and of course this action has caused a great deal of concern amongst those communities. I particularly note that the committee has said that it is interested to monitor the progress of this approach to servicing small business. The committee's concern was whether small businesses and the farming community would be serviced, with the loss of banks from this particular rural and country environment, and the committee is going to monitor the progress of the new approach to servicing small business, particular in regional Australia. I commend the committee for pursuing that issue, because it is important to people throughout rural Australia that they still have access to business and also to private banking facilities. The question of branch closures and the introduction of new technology has been an emotional issue, and will continue to be an emotional issue for a lot of people, because one seems to link hand in hand with the other in terms of job losses and closure of branches. The committee found that the arguments put forward by the Reserve Bank of Australia and the banks appear to be quite rational, but it believes that there is a need for a more comprehensive picture of what is happening with regard to branch closures and the strategies for the future in terms of new forms of access to banking services, and it is also going to pursue that matter. I raise this issue because we have recently had a branch of the Westpac bank close in Inglewood, a small town in my electorate, and the closure caused a great deal of concern because it left that community without any formal banking facilities. People there do have access to some other banking facilities, but not in terms of loan approvals and applications or in terms of the general commercial activities that a bank might normally be expected to provide. The closure caused a great deal of concern in the community, so I am pleased that the committee is going to continue to pursue that matter. I will be watching the progress of the committee deliberations on that matter because it is a very important issue for rural communities.",112,First Corporate Law To Take Account Of Simplification Bill 1995 A The Number Of Creditors And Potential

300,Mr Reid (Bendigo) (10.11 A.m.),"The opportunity to speak on the report from the HouseMC 2028 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 28 September 1995 I also wish to refer to the section of the committee's report, on page 27, which looked at the financial institutions duty and the debits tax which used to be known as the BAD tax-the bank account debits tax. I note that the Australian Bankers Association raised the issue of the FID and the debits tax with the committee, recommending that they should be abolished as they are 'distortive, regressive and inefficient'. These taxes, they note, are levied by state governments. In these days of perusal and concern about the banking industry's activities about charges, here is an element that certainly requires much more investigation. I know that states are dependent upon these taxes for their revenue raising, but I was interested to read that the ABA, and the committee, found that there was a distortive, regressive and inefficient element of these particular taxes. The committee obviously will be following that issue up. I note that it has requested additional material from the Australian Bankers Association on the impact of these taxes, the compliance costs and the total value of deposits into the banking system which relate to these specific taxes. The committee has noted that it will further examine the concerns raised by the Australian Bankers Association. People are becoming much more aware of taxes and charges to do with banking. It is certainly under the microscope at the moment and it will obviously generate a lot more interest when the committee examines the concerns. One would hope that it might have public hearings on this where the community could come and give evidence on the impact of these taxes on their businesses and the way their businesses operate, so that the committee can be fully informed of the impact of those two taxes-the financial institutions duty and the debits tax. The question of derivatives is also tackled by the committee. I had the opportunity to go to the Australian Stock Exchange in Sydney last Friday to receive a briefing on not only the activities of the derivatives market but also the activities of the Australian Stock Exchange. I must say that they put on a very impressive briefing session for the members of my committee who were there. I found that they certainly are world leaders in technology and in efficiency in the management and operation of the Australian Stock Exchange, and that they were taking a very innovative and entrepreneurial approach with the regulation of the Australian market. We were also briefed on the Australian derivatives market. Derivatives are an important aspect of financial management, particularly in risk management, and it is important that people understand how they operate and how they can be used as risk management instruments. I note that the committee's conclusion, on page 16, states: Derivatives are risk management instruments and are an essential tool in the financial services industry. The responsibility of the Reserve Bank, and other financial supervisors, is to ensure that the risks associated with derivatives are properly managed. However, they did not go on to say that people should be educated to understand how the derivatives market works. I think there is a bit of a gap in the knowledge of people in the community on how these derivatives work and the risks that are attached-and there are risks, but it is a matter of how you can properly manage those risks. You cannot manage those risks without having the knowledge of how that derivatives market works. There is a task for not only the Australian Stock Exchange but also the brokers to educate the public on how these derivatives work and how they can be used as risk management instruments. There is a task ahead of them there. I think that they are aware of that and that they need to do more in terms of informing people of just how they can be used as a risk management product. Thursday, 28 September 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 2029 The other issue that I want to address in the report is on page 5 and it refers to lending for housing. Lending for housing is a very important issue in Australia because there are many thousands of people trying to get into the housing market. You might recall that in the lead-up to the 1993 election the Keating government promised the Australian public that it would allow access to superannuation funds for use as housing loans. That promise was never fulfilled. It was quickly forgotten after the 1993 election. There were many thousands of people, and young people in particular, who were paying into superannuation schemes and who were hopeful of having access to their superannuation funds so that they could finance a home. The government let them down extremely badly on this issue. Here was an opportunity for people to gain access to some of their superannuation funds and use the funds as a deposit on a home. However, that promise was not fulfilled. That is an important issue. Australians want to have their own home. They see that as one of the best financial investments that they can make during their lifetime. They want to have a home of their own for they see it as a major asset and they are prepared to pay it off during their lifetime. The government made that promise but after the election it made no effort whatsoever to enable people to access some of those superannuation funds. I mentioned young people in particular but it was not confined to young people. It was intended that anyone who was paying into a superannuation fund and who was under 55 could gain access to their superannuation funds, which they could then put towards a home. But that opportunity has been lost. The government made no effort to fulfil that promise that it made to the Australian community. I want to mention now the changes that are going on in the housing finance m2.rket and the changes that are going on in the banking industry. In Bendigo we had probably one of the most successful building societies in the state. The Bendigo Building Society was one of the largest home lenders in the state. It concentrated principally on home lending, with 80 per cent of its funding going to that sector. It has been very successful. It survived the crash of Pyramid and the trauma that occurred in Victoria as a result of that crash. The Bendigo Building Society survived because of its prudent financial management and its concentration on the main game, providing funding for housing. It has gone from strength to strength and has recently been converted into a bank known as the Bendigo Bank. It has just had a successful launch and it is doing particularly well. However, there are a number of changes occurring throughout Australia in the financial world at the moment. There is a heavy emphasis on the big banks with them eyeing off with predatory eyes a lot of these regional banks. Time will tell what eventuates but we have seen some changes in Western Australia with the bank of Western Australia being taken over recently by a Scottish bank, and there will be more and more changes. I hope that the role of lending for housing is not lost in these takeovers of regional banks. This facility is still a very important element of housing finance in Australia, in providing support for people who are requiring finance for the construction or purchase of a home. I will be watching the further reviews that will be carried out by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Banking, Finance and Public Administration. Debate (on motion by Mr Allan Morris) adjourned. MC 2030 MAIN COMMI'ITEE Thursday, 28 September 1995 Second Reading Debate resumed from 27 September. to see you in the chair for a debate of this nature, knowing your wide experience of commercial matters, particularly of futures markets and the like. You would be very adept at passing a stem eye over the objectives of the Trade Marks Bill 1995. I will restrict my comments as much as possible, as the opposition considers this bill to be essentially non-controversial, and we do not oppose the introduction of the new measures. This bill represents the end of the line of a long process of overhauling Australian trademarks legislation. That process began in 1989 when the then Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business authorised the Registrar of Trade Marks to set up a working party to review existing legislation. That working party was chaired by the Registrar of Trade Marks and it included a mixed representation from the Trade Marks Office, the Law Council of Australia and the Institute of Patents Attorneys of Australia. After working through a complicated process, including an initial phase of public consultation, the working party eventually produced its final report to the then minister in July 1992. The working party's report proposed the repeal of the Trade Marks Act 1995 and its replacement with a new act, incorporating several major changes. Although there was a consensus within the working party on the majority of the report's recommendations, there was a small number of important issues on which the views of the Trade Marks Office representatives differed from those of the private sector representatives. Initially there was to be a further period of public consultation before new legislation would be drafted. However, in September 1992, a full four months before the proposed closing date for receipt of submissions, the then minister decided that he could not wait for public comments, but would proceed with new draft legislation forthwith. The minister indicated that the legislation would follow the recommendations of the working party, except in areas where there had been disagreement between the representatives of the Trade Marks Office and the private sector representatives. In those areas the legislation would follow the recommendations of the Trade Marks Office's representatives, who were the minority on the committee. Early last year, the minister released an exposure draft of the 1994 bill. On the cover of that exposure draft it was said that the bill was in draft form and was not finally settled, and that one of the purposes of releasing it was to test it for errors and omissions. The original working party apparently had no involvement in drafting the bill. Although members of the working party received a copy prior to its release, there was no time to correct even the most obvious errors. On 27 July last year, the minister issued a press release stating that the government would enact the 1994 bill without awaiting the results of the process of public consultation, the reason being that, under the agreement to establish the World Trade Organisation, Australia had to enact legislation consistent with the TRIPS agreement. Accordingly, the 1994 bill was debated and passed as part of a legislative package designed to ensure that Australia met its obligations under the agreement to establish the WTO. At the time however, the minister acknowledged",113,Representatives Main Committee
301,Mr Moore (Ryan) (10.26 A.m.},"Mr Deputy Speaker Jenkins, I could not be more pleasedThursday, 28 September 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 2031 the requirement to take account of public submissions on this issue and pledged to complete the process of consultation, before introducing amendments at the earliest possible opportunity. The bill that we are debating today is the outcome of that stretched process. It is largely a rewrite of the Trade Marks Act 1994, which has not yet come into effect. It makes a number of technical changes to the 1994 act to overcome drafting errors, but there are also a number of areas of substantial difference. In addition, there are a number of noteworthy areas of common ground between this bill and the 1994 act. I will make a few brief comments on those. One area that is worthy of comment is the expanded definition of a trademark provided in this bill. Under existing law, registrable trademarks have been largely confined to signs consisting of words, letters, numerals, figurative elements or a combination of one or more of these. The 1994 act provides for an expanded definition of a trademark and this bill goes slightly further. It is now proposed that a trademark may extend to include such things as an aspect of packaging, a shape, a colour, sound or scent. The 1992 working party report commented that, given recent developments in marketing and technology, there is a need for Australian legislation to cater for a wider range of signs than had previously been considered capable of functioning as a trademark. It must be noted that a broader definition is consistent with the direction of the TRIPS agreement and with recent changes in legislation in a number of industrialised nations. However, some aspects of the broader definition have raised concern that the scope of the new trademarks may now be too wide and that this could encroach on other areas of intellectual property. I note that one of the minor parties in the Senate put forward an amendment to restrict the definition of a trademark to a more conventional scope. They argued that by broadening the definition we would simply open the gates to legal challenge. According to their argument: Many manufacturers are already lining up to legally 'try on' trademarks such as scents for perfume, or the fragrance of wine. While the current trademark regulators would exclude this, who knows what the future will bring or what the courts may decide? ... This bill involves the reversal of the onus of proof, so that now the regulators must prove why a trademark should not be issued. This is of great significance in light of the inevitability of legal challenge on sensory labelling. It will result in substantial litigation costs. If trademarks referred to only conventional labels, however, the reversal would be quite appropriate in regulation of logos, names and so on. The opposition notes these concerns. However, in this instance we have decided not to tamper with the legislation. We accept the government's argument that there is sufficient international precedent to justify such a widening of the definition. Furthermore, we are satisfied that the provisions relating to the grounds for rejecting an application and the provisions relating to the grounds for opposing registration of a trademark provide sufficient safeguards against misuse of the expanded definition. In particular, I think that the requirement that a sign constituting a trademark must be able to be represented graphically is likely to severely constrain the scope of certain sounds or scents to be incorporated in such a registrable trademark. Finally, we do not believe that advances in marketing and technology should be unnecessarily constrained by government legislation. However, we will monitor the situation and look forward to industry feedback on the operation of the expanded scope of trademarks. Should it prove unworkable or lead to excessive litigation, an incoming coalition government will certainly be prepared to re-examine the issue. MC 2032 MAIN COMMITIEE Thursday, 28 September 1995 One of the most significant features of this bill is the reversal of the onus of registrability which appears in section 33. According to the second reading speech: The bill is expressed in terms that make it clear that there is to be a presumption of registrability when an application is being examined by the Registrar of Trade Marks. This means that, if there is any doubt about whether a trademark should be registered, that doubt will be resolved in favour of the applicant rather than against the applicant as is now the case. There should be considerable advantages in terms of minimising the cost to the applicant of complying with the requirements for registration and minimising the risks of wrongful rejection. The onus is placed squarely on the Registrar of Trade Marks to establish why a given trademark should not be registered. However, it is worth noting that the provisions dealing with the grounds for rejection of an application, sections 39 to 44, still leave the registrar with a considerable discretion. Moreover, the process of appeal is neither simple nor costless. In my comments during last year's debate I indicated that a number of concerns with the original bill had been raised with me by practising patent and trademark attorneys. One of these related to the proposal to scrap the existing part B of the register of trademarks. The 1992 working party examined this issue and was of a divided opinion. Those members of the working party from the Law Council and the Institute of Patent Attorneys felt there were strong grounds for the retention of a divided register. They apparently based the view on the perceived significant advantages presently accorded part A registrations, the benefit of which should be accorded only to the proprietors of distinctive marks. In contrast, the Trade Marks Office members of the working party felt that the advantages of retaining a divided register were largely illusory. Instead, they argued that there would be significant advantages in terms of cost and efficiency for both regulators and trademark users by streamlining the register into a single entity. While the Law Council and the institute members acknowledged that a single register would reduce the administrative workload of the Trade Marks Office, they still felt that this was insufficient justification for extending monopoly rights and for changing a system which, on the face of it, had served Australia well for many years. Moreover, they argued that the GATT of a divided register would not be inconsistent with Australia's international obligations. The opposition acknowledges that there are divided opinions on this issue. However, we accept that the historical reasons for maintaining a divided register probably no longer apply and that, on balance, the benefits of increased efficiency and reduced cost of administering an undivided register should outweigh any cost in terms of re-weighting of the rights of the trademark owners currently in different parts of the register. Another issue that was raised in relation to the 1994 act was a proposal to streamline the provisions relating to associated trademarks, these being trademarks used by a business which are substantially identical or similar and are used in relation to similar goods and services. The new bill goes even further. It scraps the concept of associated trademarks altogether. I note that this is a departure from the majority recommendation of the working report. In that report the Law Council and the institute members recommended the retention of the existing provisions for association-defined under the Trade Marks Act of 1955. Indeed, the Law Council and institute members of the working party argued that the association system provides important information to trademark proprietors, enabling them to Thursday, 28 September 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 2033 ascertain whether or not a set of trademarks can validly be transferred to another proprietor. They suggested that to repeal these provisions would upset the balance presently achieved between ensuring the validity of registrations and the efficiency of examination procedures. While the Trade Marks Office members of the working party agreed with the principle underlying the existing association provisions, they argued that existing provisions were cumbersome and resource intensive to administer and, further, that most other industrialised countries-including USA-have no association provisions in their legislation. The government justifies its decision to do away with associated trademarks altogether on the grounds that, firstly, it is consistent with international practice and, secondly, such action was supported by a majority of submissions received during the process of public consultation. The opposition can see merit in the protection of the existing system of association. However, it is accepted that the costs of administering the system are probably disproportionate to consumer benefit on the grounds that there are other safeguards within the bill that offer protection against deception or confusion as a result of the change in ownership of the existing mark. As a final point I would like to comment briefly on the issue of registered users. Part II of the Trade Marks Act 1994 made provision for owners of trademarks to authorise use of their marks by registered users. This bill omits any provision for registered users. The second reading speech states: The bill provides that where owners of trade marks exercise control over use of their trade marks by other persons, that use can be taken to be use by the new owner ... The WTO agreement does not require use under the control of the owner of the trade mark to be registered. Consequently, there is little benefit in retaining additional provisions for the registration of users. The new provisions relating to authorised users appear to provide similar rights to those provided in the 1994 act for registered users, but without the same administrative costs and complexities. Under the new system, a greater weight of responsibility is placed on the registered owner and this may pose some potential problems if the owner is less than diligent in ensuring the appropriate use of trademarks under their control. The entire field of intellectual property is a complex one, and one which yields a range of competing interests. Consequently, trademark legislation, if it is to be in the best interests of Australian people, must seek to achieve a fair, equitable and efficient balancing of these competing interests. This bill has been through an extensive process of public consultation. It is to be hoped that, as a result, the opinions of all interested parties have at least been given adequate consideration. I trust this bill will give us a modem, workable system of trademarks. It is essential that we develop a system of trademarks which is responsive to the changing requirements of Australian industry, but which also pays heed to the interests of the consumer. I am not convinced that this bill is without potential problems. However, I can give an assurance that, in government, the coalition will be responsive to the best interests of trademark users and will certainly be prepared to amend any aspects of this legislation which prove to be defective in practice. honourable member for Ryan( Mr Moore). I was in the chair at the commencement of his speech and he quite adventurously tried to inveigle me into the debate in that position.

302,Mr Jenkins (Scullin) (L0.43 A.m.),"I am pleased to enter this debate and to follow theMC 2034 MAIN COMMITIEE Thursday, 28 September 1995 his ideological bent-and he has failed in that regard-I am indebted for small gems that he has taught me, such as the value of the Wall Street Journal, because it was always important that one should read publications like that-if only to know what influences your political enemies. Having said that, I think this piece of legislation is interesting. It is an important aspect of commercial law. It is important not only for the protections that it gives to business but also, as has been said by both speakers so far in this debate today, for the protection that it can give to consumers. If we really want to understand the protections that are offered by trademarks it is important to have some understanding of the history surrounding them in our law and in the world of commerce. The Labor Party has played a significant role in the introduction of appropriate legislation throughout the history of the federation. When Alfred Deakin became Prime Minister for the second time in July 1905, it was with the support of the Australian Labor Party that the original legislation concerning the regulation of trademarks was passed. More generally, the Labor movement has consistently recognised the importance of protecting symbols which distinguish the products and work of individuals and groups of people from those of other individuals and groups, and their use in informing consumers. The Brewery Employees Union of New South Wales registered its own union label in 1906. The purpose of this union mark was to indicate that a particular good had been manufactured through the services of members of that union. The establishment of that time took a somewhat dim view of this practice and sought to stop it on the basis that the union mark was not a legitimate trademark. It is easy to see why the manufacturers at the time did not like these marks. With them, unions were able to demonstrate clearly to the consumers which goods and services had been produced with unionised labour. Trade union orientated consumers could then make their purchasing decisions based on the union label. At the time, the High Court held that the Commonwealth did not have the power constitutionally to make laws for marks used to identify the suppliers of services. Thus the union label was unable to be registered and was unprotected, and its intended purpose was stymied. Time altered this view, and it became generally accepted that subsequent legal decisions did not substantiate the original decision. It is interesting to contemplate how things might have evolved differently had the High Court ruled in favour of the brewery employees back in the early 1900s. When the Trade Marks Office opened in Melbourne in 1906, the first day of trading saw 750 applications lodged: a strong indication that, even back then, Australians were a creative and resourceful lot. An interesting aspect of trademark legislation is that the Australian colonies implemented trademark protection some 10 years before Britain did, exemplifying that we are often ahead on legal reforms, too. Some of the earliest registered trademarks reflected the new status of the Commonwealth of Australia, which had been united and federated only five years earlier. The trademark images presented the new awareness of the national identity that Australians had discovered. Many trademarks consisted of maps and animal images common to all Australians, or of the Southern Cross or the Eureka flag. Indeed, looking through the trademark register provides a unique opportunity to closely examine Australian history since Federation. Economic circumstances are mirrored in the numbers and types of trademarks registered, and trends and images of the times are always represented. During World War1 and World War 11, registrations dipped dramatically and Thursday, 28 September 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 2035 were followed by huge postwar increases as trade again flourished. Likewise, the pages are lean around the time of the Great Depression. This legislation moves to make our notion of trademarks even more contemporary. In this instance, it now includes sound, smell and aspects of packaging. Also of interest is the way in which people thought that they could perhaps market a product. One of the more interesting developments of a trademark and name was of course the naming of the product that we now all know as Vegemite. The merchant who tried to launch this vegetable extract back in 1923 decided that he would call the product 'Parwill'. This product was, of course, to oppose the successful English spread-of that time and now-Marmite. The merchant chose the name 'Parwill' because he was going to market it under the slogan, 'Marmite, but Parwill.' Given even that there was perhaps a subtle difference in the sense of humour of the time, that pun failed to really take off, so it was decided to have a competition to name the new product, and that is the way that the Vegemite trademark and name came about. Often, when people speak of the value of trademarks, they emphasise only the protection of the intellectual property aspects involved in the creation of the trademark and the protection of the rights of the owners of the trademark. However, the importance of a trademark needs to be recognised in terms not only of a name or image that it affords but also of the protection that the trademark offers to consumers. I believe that this aspect of trademarks legislation has been sadly neglected in the past, but I am pleased to see that the protection now offered to consumers was improved not only in the 1994 act but also in the bill now before the House. It is important that Minister Lee, in his second reading speech, said that Australian trademark laws served two complementary objectives: firstly, identification and protection of a business's products, and, secondly, protection of the consumer. In pamphlets and booklets that Ausindustry and AIPO publish, the value to the producers of trademarks is thus described: Your trade mark should distinguish your goods and services from your competitors by symbolising a certain image, quality and reputation that you want to create with the public. It is a two-way street. The producer, manufacturer or supplier wants to identify something as its product; and, by having the trademark on a legislated basis, protection is given to consumers. Trademarks allow the consumer to know precisely what they are purchasing, thus preventing them from being deceived by false products and allowing them to make an informed judgment about what they will purchase. Of course, that outcome can be achieved only if we have a properly legislated and administered system-and, indeed, the policing that might flow from that. We know all too well of products that are sold either in the weekend markets of the cities and towns of Australia or even more predominantly in the street bazaars of countries overseas where the wrongful and deceitful use of well-known trademarks abounds. It is only through proper policing that the manufacturer is protected and the consumer has the protection of knowing that they are getting the proper goods that they believe they are purchasing. While it is obviously not, and should never be, the sole protector of consumer rights, legislation allowing protected naming rights to one company forms part of the legislative arrangements which protect consumers. For example, this bill proposes to provide registration protection not only to the goods and services themselves but also to closely related or similar items. The Trade Practices Commission will, under this bill, assess whether the registration of certification would be to the public detriment. This means that certifications according to MC 2036 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 28 September 1995 quality will not be open to misuse. Involvement of the TPC offers consumer protection in this aspect as well. On balance, and taking on board some of the comments and criticisms that the shadow minister put on behalf of the coalition, I think that, in the same way that this legislation was developed, there will be a continuing review of the implementation of this bill from I January next year. That is always important. Another important aspect that has been mentioned in the debate is that this legislation continues to make contemporary the notion of a trademark, in the sense that we changed the notion of things that can be considered trademarks and of things that can be attached to goods and services. The bill is also contemporary because it acknowledges that now, in the world of commerce, Australia-through a whole host of measures, including its inclusion in the World Trade Organisation and the obligations that flow from that-must also have international considerations which would not only give protection to Australian products overseas but would likewise ensure that, when a product from overseas is brought into Australia, we can have a reasonable understanding that it is of a quality that goes with the trademark and associated symbols and identifications that the product has. With those short remarks, I am pleased to be able to speak in support of this bill. I am sure that, through the understanding that is developing, especially by consumers about their rights, this trademarks legislation will in its own small way assist consumers to make proper purchasing choices. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. That the bill be reported to the House without amendment. Consideration resumed from 28 June. Second Reading and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Public Service Matters) (10.56 a.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. This bill proposes a number of amendments to the Merit Protection (Australian Government Employees) Act 1984 and the Public Service Act 1922 to implement the decision announced in the 1995-96 budget to amalgamate the Public Service Commission and the Merit Protection and Review Agency. Details of the amendments are set out in the explanatory memorandum which accompanies the bill. While the integration of the MPRA and the Public Service Commission will generate only modest savings of approximately $200,000 in 1996-97 and subsequent years, the government considers that significant benefits will result from the arrangements proposed in this bill. By drawing on the collective experience of both organisations and rationalising their corporate resources, the amalgamated body, which will be known as the Public Service and Merit Protection Commission, will be better placed to develop innovative personnel management and service delivery arrangements.

304,Mr Johns (Petrie,"Special Minister of State, Assistant Minister for Industrial RelationsThursday, 28 September 1995 MAIN COMMITIEE MC 2037 Merit Protection Commission will bring together two vital streams of people management in the public sector and create an environment in which systemic issues which are brought to light in the grievance and appeals handling process can more effectively inform and improve the policy perspectives of the Public Service Commission. Similarly, integration with the Public Service Commission will provide staff of the agency with a better appreciation of the policy issues relevant to their casework activities. By drawing together the Public Service Commission's work on best practice and the MPRA's experience in merit protection and grievance resolution, the new commission's ability to contribute to the delivery of quality service to the Australian public will be greater than the sum of its individual parts. The government remains committed to the principles on which the MPRA was established and which are articulated in its legislation-fairness, equity, sound personnel management practices, efficiency and good staff relations. The MPRA has an important role in preserving key values in Australian government employment and, in particular, in preserving the merit system. In the first 11 years, the MPRA has developed an enviable reputation for probity and independence. In developing this legislation, the government has been careful to ensure that the Public Service Commissioner and the Director of the MPRA, who will in future be known as Merit Protection Commissioner, will continue to exercise their statutory powers independently of each other. The powers of the MPRA in relation to the investigation of grievances and the resolution of disputes will be unaffected by these amendments, and it will be just as vigorous in protecting public servants' rights as it has always been. The government's intention is that the two commissioners should have a close and cooperative relationship, but that neither will be able to interfere in the other's statutory role. One necessary consequence of the amalgamation of the staff of the Public Service Commission and the MPRA, however, is that the Merit Protection Commissioner will no longer have the powers of a secretary in relation to the staff of the MPRA. Those powers will rest with the Public Service Commissioner, but the government expects the Public Service Commissioner to delegate his personnel management powers in relation to the staff of the commission who are required for the purposes of the Merit Protection Act to the Merit Protection Commissioner. This will guarantee the continued independence of the MPRA from the Public Service Commission and ensure that there will be no diminution in the rights of public servants to independent appeal and grievance mechanisms as a result of this bill. Finally, the bill makes a number of other minor changes to the act. Members of the Merit Protection and Review Agency will continue to be appointed by the Governor General in Council, on ministerial advice. However, the bill will require wider consultation on these appointments than is currently the case. In addition, the bill provides that only the Merit Protection Commissioner will be able to be appointed onÂ·a full-time basis. This in fact has been the situation since the MPRA was established in 1984 and the amendment does no more than reflect the reality of the current practice. I commend this bill to the House. I think the explanatory memorandum has already been presented. before the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Public Service Matters( Mr Johns), but the Public Service Legislation Amendment Bill has been listed and withdrawn so many times, I did not want to miss it.

305,Mr Moore (Ryan) (11.01 A.m.),"Mr Deputy Speaker, I am sorry that I rose to speakMC 2038 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 28 September 1995 opposition supports the legislation but we have a number of caveats in relation to some of its functioning. I was listening to the minister expound the virtues of putting together the Merit Protection and Review Agency and the Public Service Commission. He said that there would be modest savings and I certainly agree with that. In expounding those virtues, he has reflected on the goodwill that will be required by the two commissioners to get on under the same roof. I note that one has somewhat lesser powers than the other and, because of the very nature of the beast, inevitably, one will dominate the proceedings, no matter what happens. We will be waiting to see how this particular exercise and that relationship pans out. We are aware that the report of the Public Service Act review group-the McLeod reportwhich was released in January, did not recommend this merger with the Merit Protection and Review Agency. Whether the goodwill that the minister was talking about prevails or whether the interests of the Public Service are downgraded is something that will only be seen in time. The McLeod review recommended that the merit agency remain separate. The agency itself, by its nature, is a joint union and management body, whereas the Public Service Commission is all about management structure. While the two are somewhat complementary, they are, of themselves, very different. They are there to look at the way in which a public servant can achieve some rectification of his complaint, which, in essence, would be about the administration of the Public Service Commission. The argument that would follow from that is that, if they are housed in the same area and with perhaps no goodwill between the two commissioners, that might lead to a situation where the public servant is not appropriately looked after. When we are in government, we would certainly monitor the progress of this and note its outcome. If it is not acting in the best interests of the Public Service, quite clearly, we would revisit the McLeod review recommendations and see what could best be done in that area. While the opposition supports the legislation, there are a couple of issues that I would like to raise as it relates to the Public Service. This particular issue was raised by my colleague Senator Minchin at a Senate estimates committee hearing on 26 May. Ms Forward, the director of the MPRA, was being asked about this change that is coming and about the government's intention to merge the MPRA with the Public Service Commission. Senator Minchin said: Were you given the opportunity for consultations about the advantages or disadvantages of this prior to a decision being made or was it something you read about in the newspaper? Ms Forward responded: Neither of these reflects the facts of the matter. That quite clearly indicates that she did not have much of an input into what was going to happen. Despite the fact that the McLeod review made a recommendation one way, the head of the commission obviously was not consulted, by the comments that she made to the Senate committee. I assume it was a straight government situation. Clearly the MPRA or its principal officers feel a greater degree of consultation was required before the decision on the agency's future was taken. That this consultation did not occur is a reflection on this government's commitment to both the principles and the practices of open government. If the government is unwilling to enter into consultations with its own employees, it is little wonder that the general public is somewhat cynical of its advocacy of open government. Thursday, 28 September 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 2039 Ms Forward was hardly enthusiastic about the proposal when she was asked by Senator Bell what this move would achieve. In response to Senator Bell's claim that this bill returned the situation to that which applied before the agency was established in 1984, Ms Forward simply stated that would achieve savings of $214,000 in the year after next. This is far from enthusiastic endorsement of the bill from the most senior public servant in that area. That this response was forthcoming is hardly surprising. In the 1993-94 annual report of the MPRA, warnings against the loss of independence were made. The report says: ... the continued availability of independent extemal review is pivotal to the effect of merit protection. With devolution of responsibility away from the central agencies and central offices ... the need for independent external review becomes more important, both to protect the employment rights of employees and to ensure accountability for personal management decisions and actions. The report further states: As the Auditor-General provides independent external review of financial management, and the Ombudsman and various tribunals provide similar functions in respect of decisions affecting citizens, so too an independent body to review the personnel management of the Commonwealth's employees is needed to provide the Parliament and other stakeholders with the assurances of fairness, equity and merit in public employment. Clearly the agency is wary of attempts by the government to compromise its independence. In supporting this legislation, this parliament has an obligation to ensure it serves the interests of both Commonwealth employees and those who fund its operations-that is, the Australian taxpayer. I am aware of the view that the MPRA, as part of the Public Service Commission, will be required to adjudicate on grievances arising from rules determined by the Public Service Commission itself and that this will have potential conflict of interest implications. This is a situation which the MPRA, the PSC and the government should seek to avoid. A second concern relates to the level of resources that will be available to the MPRA in its new form. This legislation relies in part on the view that the implementation of the McLeod proposals will result in a decline of the agency's workload and a consequent decline in the levels of required resources. While this may be true, the detail of legislation to give effect to these reforms has yet to be disclosed. Even though the minister has spoken in general terms of the government's intentions for the Public Service Act, this legislation is not available. Until this occurs, we await the specific details to ensure the commitment to resources will be met. In assessing the future of the MPRA it would be remiss of me not to examine one of the most contentious issues to emerge in recent years in the area of public sector employment. The MPRA has been the subject of criticism as a result of its investigation into allegations of workplace harassment at the Australian War Memorial. The subjects of that inquiry-the former director and the former deputy director-are seeking a Federal Court ruling to prevent the minister from considering the MPRA report on these allegations. While I have no intention of canvassing the details of that case, it should be noted that both the former executives claim that the MPRA exceeded its authority, and that they were denied natural justice and procedural fairness. On3 August, less than seven weeks ago, the Australian carried a story headed 'Public servants lose bid for harassment challenge funding'. That report quoted Mr Kelson. He drew a very clear distinction between the government's approach in that case and its approach in the case of the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence), who is gaining financial support in the Marks royal commission, when he said: MC 2040 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 28 September 1995 From my perspective I can't help but look at the treatment of someone like Carmen Lawrence where the Commonwealth bends over backwards to do everything that can make sure that she doesn't have to pay her costs in a matter that doesn't even relate to the performance of her federal responsibilities. Here are two officers who were forced into litigation to protect their interests in the course of doing their jobs as federal employees and they are told that the cost is not a hardship. It is somewhat ironic that three weeks after that story appeared the government revealed that it had reconsidered its position. The more cynical amongst us could be excused for thinking that this change of mind had more to do with the government's reaction to the Lawrence case than it had to do with ensuring a fair hearing for the executives. However, now that this matter appears to be resolved and a decision is awaited, a number of questions relating to the MPRA need to be resolved. It must be explained whether or not the MPRA simply went trawling through the Australian War Memorial to justify bringing a case against the executives. The minister has a responsibility to advise whether or not the agency approached him seeking an invitation to conduct the inquiry into the War Memorial and when this occurred. If this was not the case, the minister must explain the conditions under which he requested the agency to investigate the relevant matters. Did he make any approaches to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, his department or the Australian War Memorial before a decision was taken to hold the inquiry? Irrespective of the outcome of any court proceedings, this information ought to be provided. Of even greater long-term importance and central to the MPRA's role within the Public Service are the standards to be followed by the agency in fulfilling its obligations. In effect, what standard does the MPRA follow in determining whether workplace harassment has occurred? Is it the standard set by the minister when he said that harassment must not be confused with legitimate comment and advice, including relevant negative comment or feedback, or is it the standard set out by the agency in an article appearing in the Weekend Australian of 11 and 12 March 1995 which referred to 'any type of behaviour that can reasonably be expected to cause a person to feel threatened, uncomfortable or unable to cope with their work environment'? Clearly, this matter needs to be resolved so the agency and the public servants who are supposed to assist know precisely where they stand. I urge the minister to advise the committee of the correct position. To fail to do so can only be regarded as a dereliction of duty. If this determination depends on the outcome of the current legal action, I would urge the minister to consider any necessary legislative changes at the time of the redrafting of the Public Service Act. . In conclusion, the coalition supports the bill, but we call upon the minister to answer the comments that I have made about the War Memorial case and to be aware that the coalition will monitor progress of the new arrangements as outlined in the bill. Amendment Bill 1995 which is before the Main Committee today. This is an area of considerable importance for members of parliament because of the way in which it affects the whole mechanism and operation of the government of Australia. The Australian Public Service has always played a very valuable role in impartially, competently and professionally administering the programs of Australian governments since the time of Federation. Australia has been particularly fortunate in the history of its public service. We have always been favoured with a public service which has acted in the most competent and professional",123,Representatives Main Committee
306,Mr Martyn Evans (Bonython) (11.14 P.m.),"I support the Public Service LegislationThursday, 28 September 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 2041 manner and, therefore, the Australian public have justifiably had a great deal of confidence in that professionalism. They have come to rely on it in a way which is almost invisible. It is a very effective mechanism in this country which we inherited from the Westminster process of the United Kingdom and which has served this country particularly well. Therefore, it is very important, whenever we are examining potential changes to that framework, that we should give it the closest scrutiny. I know it is the government's intention that any aspect of this legislation should operate so as to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the Public Service and not in any way to derogate that. I think it is quite vital that, as members of parliament, whatever our political persuasion, we are mindful of the need to ensure accountability and openness in the public service and enhance the professionalism of that service. However, because of the size of Australia and the Australian government's operations, it is a very large and complex service and, because of the way in which government business is undertaken these days, that is necessarily the case. The Public Service has evolved considerably from the early days of its operation and, of course, it would not be practical to continue with the kinds of structures, policies and philosophies which underlay the Public Service at the time of Federation-or, indeed, which were inherited from the United Kingdom prior to that-into the 1990s, given the very dramatic and sweeping changes which have occurred to the administration of government since that time. Part of that process has also got to be directed towards an internal review of the mechanisms of the Public Service itself and a constant reassessment that those legislative frameworks are appropriate to the Public Service that we have today and the objectives which we would want to set as a government and as a parliament for that Public Service, as distinct from those which have pertained in the past and which, while they may have been relevant in those days, may well be less relevant today. Indeed, I think it is very instructive to look back at some of the comments which have been made about the Public Service over the years. On an historical basis, of course, the public has not always been kind to the Public Service in general, but I think that understates the contribution which that service makes and the manner in which it is required to do it. The Public Service has traditionally been required to act in a background mode, if you like, and not take an up-front role in a public sense. It is not meant to be part of a media campaign. It is meant to be a Public Service providing efficient and effective advice behind the scenes to governments in a way which will not detract from the operation of our democracy and that is quite a vital part of that process. If we examine the role of the public service over that period, commentators, even as far back as 1872, when dealing with the British public service of the day, could be quoted in lines such as 'it is an inevitable defect that bureaucrats will care more for routine than for results'. Now, that kind of thing may have been true in the past, but it is something which we have to guarantee is not true in the current context. A similar commentator at that time observed: ... in the world of civil service plunging into action is the arch crime ... the civil servant's duty is not to achieve desirable results; it is to follow the correct procedure. It is that kind of mentality, of over 100 years ago, which I think has often underlain public appreciation in recent decades for the Public Service. It is an image which the Public Service has successfully shaken off in recent times and one which I think this legislation will go some way towards enhancing, as will the review of the Public Service Act, which the Minister MC 2042 MAIN COMMITIEE Thursday, 28 September 1995 Assisting the Prime Minister for Public Service Matters( Mr Johns) has commissioned and which is under way now. The latest version of that bill, when it becomes available, will incorporate many of the kinds of changes which we would see as desirable. So how has the model of the Public Service changed since the days of those earlier quotations? Those models have had to adapt to changes in society and to our expectations of government and government service. Government now is much more democratic. The public is somewhat better educated than was the case a century or more ago when those quotations were applicable and, of course, people have much greater expectations of what the government will do. Much of that flows from the increased role of government, because the more government does, the more people will continue to expect from it. The greater availability of the mass media in promoting and explaining to the pUblic, particularly at election times, the commitments that people make about the Public Service is very relevant to that process. It creates a climate of expectation, which obviously the public will expect to see reflected in the Public Service and the kinds of services it produces for it. In that period the public has come to expect that we will have a modern public service in which democracy, efficiency and equity are the kinds of underlying principles. They were the values of the late Dr Peter Wilenski, a very noted and prominent public servant in this country, who gave many years of service to his nation and is honoured in the Wilenski memorial lectures, which often revolve around Public Service oriented management topics. That is the kind of public service that he would have supported and did support in his time. I believe it is one which encapsulates the kinds of values which we would expect for our Public Service today. What we have also seen change over that period of time is the way in which program objectives and guidelines are much more clearly defined for the Public Service than they were in the past. In days when the role of the Public Service and that of the government were somewhat less than they are now, the programs were far less complex and public servants' areas of discretion would have been much reduced. Ministers were able to be accountable for the total range of actions of their public servants because the programs in contemplation were far less wide-ranging and far less complex, and the legislation which underpinned them was far more capable of comprehension than, sadly, it often is today. The situation that prevails in the 1990s is that, with the best will in the world, legislation is still very complex; it covers a wide variety of contingencies because of the potential of people to seek to evade some of its terms and the need to explain its terms in great detail. That has led to a situation where public servants are often placed in a position of having to take discretionary decisions, and the public of course has come to see them in some cases as decision makers rather than necessarily just decision takers from a minister who is actually accountable for the program. If we are able in the modern context to much more comprehensively set out program objectives and guidelines for the Public Service, we will to some extent reduce the uncertainty which public servants have in administering those programs and ensure that their personal preferences and priorities do not unnecessarily and unhelpfully intrude into that decision making process. It is essential that ministers decide and advisers advise, and that the way in which they do that is based on a very comprehensive outline of precisely what the policy is that the government would have them implement. It is also essential that the public understands Thursday, 28 September 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 2043 that process to be one which is firmly based in efficiency, democracy and equity, as I said before. However, given the complexity of modem management, I do not think it is possible for us to expect that public servants will always be seen in a totally non-partisan light unfortunately, because many of the decisions which they need to make are often translated into political and community decision making processes. If one looks at simple issues such as the opening times of a library, for example, that is often a decision taken by a public servant-be that at the local, state or federal level. Those issues about opening hours, simple service delivery questions, often become very political. Anyone who has served as I have in local government will know that issues like the opening times of libraries or the opening times of rubbish collection facilities and so on, all of those kinds of what we would see as very technical and public service management matters, can often take on a very political characteristic. It is one which now cannot be avoided, given the drive for efficiency and accountability in these processes. We should not allow that to sidetrack us from the need for efficiency and effectiveness. The House of Representatives expenditure committee-and I now have the honour to serve on the Standing Committee on Banking, Finance and Public Administration which has succeeded the expenditure committee-when it was looking at these kinds of issues as far back as 1979, said that there seemed to be little point in having efficiently run programs which fail to effectively achieve the end results or the outputs that are desired. Even though the committee wrote about this as far back as 1979, it is a very timely reminder of the way in which we have to ensure that the purpose of government intervention in some aspects of the community's affairs is reflected not only in the legislation and in the program guidelines and models which government approves for the operation of the Public Service but also in the outcomes of the Public Service program-and in a way so that the public can appreciate, at the end of the day, that the outcome is a response to the drive for efficiency and democracy in their programs. Of course, one also has to include in the 1990s process the recognition of the need for an assessment of equity, because equity is something that we are all very conscious of now. In terms of the Public Service, though, when it was developed in the last century equity was seen only to mean a reference to treating all people equally: all before the law were equal and one did not favour one person over another in any way, shape or form. The Public Service has cultivated this ethic extremely well over the last 100 years and has done so almost to a fault, because, of course, ultimately society has come to recognise the need to ensure that equity goes beyond simply equal treatment. It means far more than this and, unless it means more than this, many of the objectives of government programs-the outputs about which I spoke a moment ago-will not be properly achieved. One has to relate very closely the outcomes that one seeks to achieve from a program to the equity objectives of the program because, while you can offer all programs identically to all people, the purpose of the government's intervention in the first place will not necessarily be achieved unless the focus is on the equity objectives of the program. The modem interpretation of equity, of course, is to ensure that the approach which is administered by the program treats the needs and requirements of people equally so that those who have differing needs, requirements and abilities to benefit from programs receive the kind of assistance under the program that they need to benefit equally with others in that program. MC 2044 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 28 September 1995 This is quite a different approach because it may not simply be the case that all members of the public can take advantage of a particular legal right that they may have without in some cases being given the benefit, for example, of legal aid in order to gain advantage from the program. The program will not achieve its equity objectives and its output objectives unless we have recourse to additional assistance for some members of the public to properly allow them to take part in the program. Unless we address this need we will not achieve the kinds of outcomes which we need for the Public Service. Along with the relatively minor changes which we are making to Public Service Legislation Amendment Bill 1995 today-but in contemplation of the other changes which will be made in the broader context of the Public Service review-we have to look at all these approaches. Given the extent of the Public Service in the modem climate, it is also very appropriate that we should examine the way in which the Public Service deals with equity on an internal basis as well as on an external basis. Indeed, this is a particular focus of some of the amendments which are before us today. The taxpayers, of course, are demanding greater value from government these days and they are expecting it to achieve its internal processes in a much more efficient manner so that the public itself can benefit more from the available resources rather than see these at least partly consumed by internal processes. This is the kind of logic and ethic which has driven the efficiency dividend in recent years and it is one which will continue for some time to come. It is the need for internal efficiency and equity which drives the changes which we have before us today. Indeed, the bill which we are currently examining gives effect to the government's decision, announced in the 1995-1996 budget, to amalgamate the Merit Protection and Review Agency and the Public Service Commission to form the Public Service and Merit Protection Commission. The decision is based on a wider series of examinations of the Public Service as a whole, some of which are reflected in this legislation, some of which are reflected in the announced intention of government policy and some which will come forward in the review of the Public Service Act which the minister commissioned last year and which, of course, is presently being conducted. The Public Service Merit Review and Protection Agency has been in existence for some time. It has 56 full-time staff positions and a running cost budget for 1995-96 of approximately $6.5 million. This is a very substantial agency by any determination, and one which plays a vital role in ensuring that internal Public Service processes are seen to be equitable and fair. But in the pursuit of that goal, it is essential that we do not sacrifice too much of the effectiveness and efficiency processes which a modem public service also demands. The McLeod review, on which these recommendations are based, quite properly took account of the need to balance those competing requirements and to produce an outcome which will be internally consistent and fair to the Public Service, and to the officers who are committed to serving the government of the day-whatever government that may be-and the public of Australia in an equitable and appropriate manner. The combined agency, with the changed guidelines under which it operates, will certainly be in a better position to do that. There can be no greater commitment to the public service than to the internal fairness of its operations. Merit selection is at the heart of the whole basis of our Public Service; that government employment practices are fair, open and subject to Thursday, 28 September 1995 MAIN COMMI1TEE MC 2045 review is something which is quite inescapable in a modem democracy. Any hint that we are departing from that process of merit selection and indulging in nepotism or favouritism of any kind would reflect very badly on the Public Service. It is essential that we ensure the highest standards of accountability within the Public Service as well as without. This legislation is very relevant to that topic, as will be the broader review of the Public Service Act presently under way. It is essential that we see these measures as part of an overall package; otherwise we will not appreciate the full flavour of the government's policy. Those fundamental criteriafairness, openness and review processes-will be preserved by this legislation. But they will be enacted in a form which is more internally consistent and ensures internal efficiencies of operation. Programs are required to move quickly and speedily these days. It is not possible to have protracted reviews where these are not serving the public interest. The legislation will seek to ensure that the public interest is protected while, at the same time, guaranteeing that Public Service appointments, promotions and reviews, higher duties, appeals and the like, are all examined in a full, fair and open light. There will be accountability and independence, in a way which ensures that the process itself is accountable and efficient. Although it is never an easy process to balance those kinds of criteria, this legislation seeks to do so, and I believe it does so appropriately. occupation, and I benefited from the MPRA in that I had an appeal overturned. The MPRA in its operation issupports the Public Service Legislation Amendment Bill 1995, which combines the Merit Protection and Review Agency and the Public Service Commission to form the Public Service and Merit Protection Commission. One of the reasons that we support this legislation is that the turning of the recommendations of the McLeod report into legislation is the precursor to the main game-legislation that this parliament is yet to see and for which we are all waiting. Many of the suggestions in the McLeod report were aimed at streamlining the way in which the Public Service operates. The opposition has sufficient confidence in public servants to realise that they do a very good job when left alone to administer day-to-day administrative affairs. The proposed merger of the Public Service Commission and the MPRA will allow a streamlining of the appeals functions that go on inside the Public Service. But the new agency must be left alone, and the opposition trusts the government when it says that the effectiveness of the MPRA will not in any way be compromised by amalgamation or hindered by a lack of resources. As an ex-public servant, I can say that there is some fear in the Public Service community, given recent events concerning the Australian War Memorial, where the MPRA was actually used as an offensive weapon by the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on Public Service Matters( Mr Johns) who, if reports are to be believed, did not even tell the Minister for Veterans' Affairs( Mr Sciacca), whose portfolio covers the Australian War Memorial, that an inquiry-which could only be described as some sort of trawling expedition-was to be",126,Representatives Main Committee

The oppositionMC 2046 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 28 September 1995 launched into the conduct of two senior public servants. The call for the inquiry was quite extraordinary because the minister responsible did not know of it. If the reports are to be believed, he had no advance warning and was not allowed any input into the brief that the MPRA was given. There are indeed many questions which are yet to be answered as to why Brendan Kelson and Michael McKernan were investigated and why, at a time when this federal government was quite keen to dish out legal aid money, these two senior public servants, who had served successive governments very well, were initially denied legal aid to continue their legal defence. There have been many articles written about this and I am sure members present are aware of the matter. One of our major concerns is that the impartiality of the new Public Service and Merit Protection Commission is in no way jeopardised by political process. This leads to the questions that are yet to be answered about the entire way in which the Public Service is being administered. There have been recent comments about the effectiveness of the Public Service, and to my mind, and to the minds of many on this side of the House, that is really a reflection on the way in which this government has been handling the Public Service. In fact, it is a reflection on this government's attitude to the Public Service. This year's budget was very unclear-and it is even more unclear three months into the new financial year-about Public Service job losses. At the time, I think the figure of 4,000 public servant job losses was bandied around. The number of positions that were to disappear because of this year's budget was a great concern to people in my electorate. In fact, I put my concerns in a letter to the Assistant Minister for Industrial Relations, the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on Public Service Matters, to get some understanding of what this year's budget implications were for public servants. The letter I got back was quite extraordinary; the minister did not know. The letter says: As the implementation of the Government's Budget decisions is the responsibility of individual portfolio ministers and their Departments, I am unable to provide you with precise figures on the possible staffing impact of the Budget. I seek leave to table that letter. Leave granted. government's failure. Obviously, I had to go further and ask the ministers responsible. I put questions on notice in late June to all the ministers and, as yet, I have not received a single response about this government's expected Public Service cuts for this financial year. It is absolutely extraordinary that, three months into a new financial year and five months past the budget date, we still do not know what this year's budget means to Public Service numbers. Is it that they do not know or that they are just not willing to say? Given the interest displayed in the bill by the honourable member for Macarthur ( Mr Haviland) and the honourable member for Bonython( Mr Martyn Evans), perhaps they could question the ministers responsible and assist me by getting an answer for my constituents. Where is the truth? We have numerous comments from those opposite about the Public Service and we are worried about the future of the Public Service in this city under another Keating government. There are no answers so far.

It is quite extraordinary when you look at the numbers of jobs that have been lost and the dozen or so public service bodies that have been removed from the ACT or, indeed, the bodies with national functions that perhaps should have come to the ACT. For example, the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission was moved to Sydney. The Administrative Appeals Tribunal went to Brisbane. The Industry Commission went to Melbourne. Australian Defence Industries went to Sydney. Australia Post's national stamp collection was moved to Melbourne. The CSIRO headquarters was moved to Melbourne. The National Aviation College went to Tasmania when reports suggested that it should have been in Canberra. Then there was the attempt to move the National Maritime Safety Authority out of Canberra to Newcastle, but the government backed down under pressure. It raises the question: what would happen to Public Service numbers and what would happen to government departments were this government to be returned for another term? They actually campaigned heavily in the ACT in the 1993 election on this issue, claiming that the coalition would seemingly clear-fell the ACT. Yet what we have here is an obvious indication that it is the Labor Party that has been affecting the ACT. They are the ones that have been sacking public servants and they are the ones that have been moving out the departments. What is the government's position on the future of the Public Service and the public servants in the ACT? The McLeod report, which was brought down in January this year, has not yet been answered. We are told we may see the legislation in this session or we might see it next year. I wonder if that would be after an election? But there are other issues about the Public Service. Indeed, the former member for Canberra, when she came back to campaign-on her one and only outing-during the by-election, made the claim that if people voted for the Liberal Party, or if a Liberal Party member was returned for the seat of Canberra, the Liberal Party would clear-fell the ACT. What did the people of Canberra think about this little claim? They thought that was so reputable and they thought so highly of that comment that they produced the biggest by-election swing in 60 years. This is public servants voting for a Liberal candidate. If you have worked inside the Public Service and you know what is going on inside the Public Service, you will know that public servants are sick of the way they are being treated by this government. get from the union and from this government. It is interesting that the ALP and this Labor government so clearly paint themselves as champions of the Australian Public Service and of Canberra. But if you were to look at the development of Canberra since it was selected as the national capital site, the evidence would suggest that Canberra has benefited most under Liberal governments. In fact, the National Capital Development Commission was set up by the Menzies government and it was under Menzies and subsequent Liberal governments that the majority of government departments and public servants were moved to Canberra. And many of the capital's national attractions were built by Liberal governments. When confronted with Canberra's future, the centrepiece of this government's 1993 election cultural promises was the building of the National Museum of Australia.

In this year's budget and the three-year forward estimates there is not a single dollar dedicated to the building of the National Museum of Australia. It was during the 1960s that the majority of government departments were moved to Canberra and this city really started to develop into the great city that it is. And these things have happened, in the main, under Liberal governments. In recent times, we have heard many statements about the future of the Public Service. I would like to reiterate a statement that the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Howard) made during the Canberra by-election and it is relevant to the question of public servants. When speaking of the coalition's attitude towards the Australian Public Service, John Howard said: We don't only represent, as we proudly do, the interests of small business and the interests of private enterprise but we also represent those hundreds of thousands of Australian men and women who work in a very effective, faithful and conscientious way in both the state and federal public services and, as I've said on an earlier occasion, you don't advance the cause of the private sector by denigrating the public sector. The public sector has an honoured place. It provides many important services and it is comprised of hundreds of thousands of men and women of enormous commitment and dedication to the future of this country. Indeed, the Leader of the Opposition reiterated this statement recently by saying that the Australian Public Service has nothing to fear from a coalition government. He made it quite clear at the most recent annual general meeting of the ACT division of the Liberal Party when he said: Upon the election of a coalition government at the next election, we will not be adopting, as perhaps some have suggested, a slash-and-bum attitude towards the federal Public Service. The Public Service is very important to Australia and to have an independent Public Service of good quality is very important to the implementation of any government's policies. I commend this bill to the House. Amendment Bill 1995 which effectively amalgamates the Public Service Commission and the Merit Protection and Review Agency. I am particularly pleased to speak after the member for Canberra( Mr Smyth) who, like myself, is an ex-public servant. The member for Canberra has not been around all that long, as is quite obvious from some of his comments not only today but also on previous occasions in the House, when he said that the public servants of Canberra have nothing to fear from a coalition government. I was in the public service when Malcolm Fraser was Prime Minister and did we not have a lovely time then in the public sector! It was industrially unruly. Certainly in the history of the Public Service there were more industrial disputes in the period 1976 to 1983 than in any other period. That was because of the attitude of the Fraser government to the Public Service, which was far different from what we were led to believe by the member for Canberra a few moments ago. There was legislation such as the CE(RR) Act and the CEEP Act, which was very draconian legislation and took away basic industrial rights of public servants. I even recall-this is testing my memory-that the public sector unions, as they were at the time, did not have access to the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. There was a separate public service arbitrator set up by the Fraser government which was very heavily loaded in favour of the government. Public servants and their unions could not even take industrial disputes to the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission as it was then. So much for the Liberal Party's attitude towards public servants!",133,Representatnes Main Committee

314,Mr Smyth,"Public servant numbers grew during that period.Thursday, 28 September 1995 MAIN COMMITTEE MC 2049 Mr HA VILAND-I do not know whether or not that is true. When the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Howard) was Treasurer there were terms like 'the Phil Lynch razor gang' and 'snouts in the trough'. There were allegations that public servants were bludgers and we had the famous name 'dole bludgers' for the unemployed. Those were all very much flavour of the month expressions in the late 1970s under the Fraser government. The bill gives effect to the government's decision announced in the 1995-96 budget to amalgamate the Merit Protection and Review Agency and the Public Service Commission to form the Public Service and Merit Protection Commission. Presumably, it will be known as the PSMPC. The Public Service Commission was set up in 1987 following the 1987 election. Massive changes were made in the public service on Bastille Day, 14 July, 1987, when a number of smaller departments were amalgamated into super-departments such as DEET, as we call it now, and Human Services and Health which was called Community Services and Health. It is fair to say that some of the decisions at the time did cause concern amongst public servants, in particular the trade unions who have not always agreed with anything that any government has done. One of the significant changes in 1987 was the abolition of the Public Service Board and the devolution of the functions of the Public Service Board to individual departmentsresponsibility for selection procedures and recruiting, et cetera. Also, many of the functions of the Public Service Board were passed on to the Department of Industrial Relations, the Department of Finance and the newly formed Public Service Commission, which was a much smaller version of what had been the Public Service Board. The Public Service Commission has approximately 150 staff. The other half of the equation is the Merit Protection and Review Agency which was set up by the Hawke government in 1984 and commenced operating from 1 July 1985. The MPRA brought together a number of other smaller bodies such as the Promotions Appeal Committee, the Disciplinary Appeal Board and the Redeployment and Retirement Appeal Committee, which needed to be brought in after the Fraser government's redeployment and retirement legislation. The MPRA also deals with a number of other public service matters, such as grievances, under the various public service regulations. It is a very important part of the Public Service, as has already been said today. The right of appeal against promotions, as the member for Canberra correctly pointed out, is a very important part of equity and the merit principle in the public service. We have not always had the merit principle. I inform the member for Canberra that, under the Fraser government and governments before the Fraser government, it was all about equal efficiency and seniority. Indeed, in the past I had the good fortune to win two appeals in the Promotions Appeal Committee. In the first situation, another person was put onto long-term higher duties ahead of me on the basis that he was senior; he had been there for 30 years and I had only been there for 12 years. I managed to knock him over in the Promotions Appeal Committee, but I will come back to that. There were concerns about some of the changes that were made in the 1980s and there were concerns in 1986 when, under the streamlining provisions, access to the Promotions Appeal Committee was limited to fairly junior officers and up to middle management officers. In today's language, access was granted up to the level of ASO 6. Senior officers and senior executive service officers do not have access to the Promotions Appeal Committee, but they MC 2050 MAIN COMMITIEE Thursday, 28 September 1995 do have access to the Merit Protection and Review Agency for grievances and other matters to do with process. The merit principle is important and it is enshrined in the Public Service Act. I particularly refer to section 33, which talks about prohibition of patronage and favouritism, and, of course, section 33.3 deals with all forms of discrimination. I used to teach people about these things in the Public Service. Discrimination is illegal on the grounds of race, colour, sex, sexual preference, religion, age, marital status, pregnancy, social origin, ethnic origin and physical or mental disability. There is one other form of discrimination and it will come back to me in a minute. The words 'mental disability' worry me a bit. As I said only a week ago in this chamber, the words used should be 'intellectual and psychiatric disability'. The Promotions Appeal Committee-and, indeed, the MPRA itself-is there to protect public servants against discrimination, patronage and favouritism and it is very important that the committee be maintained. The committee has been maintained-albeit in a different form since it will be amalgamated with the Public Service Commission-and its integrity is maintained, which is a very important thing. There were concerns raised by the Community and Public Sector Union as to whether this legislation ensured the independence of the MPRA and concerns were also raised about resourcing matters, as has been pointed out already. However, I understand that there were discussions and that the concerns were largely overcome in this legislation. This legislation does protect the independence of the MPRA-and the Public Service Commission, for that matter-and it does not have any adverse resource implications for these bodies. My own experience in the public sector was as a trade unionist in the Department of Health. As a unionist, obviously I had to represent people who had been discriminated against. I also experienced discrimination myself-usually because of my trade union activities-and sometimes I was given a hard time. From 1979 through to 1993 when I was elected to the House of Representatives, I was only promoted once in the Public Service without the need for an appeal. A job came up and the selection criteria required that I sit an aptitude test. Obviously I did fairly well because I got the job. Whenever a promotion was up to a selection panel of Public Service managers in the department I never seemed to score a promotion, but, on a couple of occasions, I did manage to take the matter to the Promotions Appeal Committee-once, as I have described, on the basis of long-term higher duties, when I was passed over because the other person was more senior. This situation can no longer occur under this government's reforms, but it was very much the go under conservative governments in this country. The Promotions Appeal Committee was created by a Labor government-the Chifley government-back in the late 1940s. A fairly important point to remember is that this decision arose out of the sectarianism that dominated the Public Service in those days; it was rife. Depending on which department you were in, you either had to be a Catholic or a Mason to get promotion in the Public Service. Of course, Catholics and Masons are not known for loving each other or particularly liking each other, but there was an unwritten power-sharing agreement between the Catholics and Masons. Depending on which department you were in, you were either one or the other. You would be in a department that was either a Mason stronghold or a Catholic stronghold, and you were usually looked after. If you were neither Catholic nor Mason, you were in a bit of trouble in the Public Service in those days. You also had to be a male, as I recall, to get on Thursday, 28 September 1995 MAIN COMMITfEE MC 2051 in the Public Service because, before 1949, women could not be promoted. They could not even get into what was then the third division until 1949. In fact, until 1966, if you were a female in the Public Service and you got married, that was no good. You had to either 'live in sin', as it was called then, or resign or become a temporary employee. Things have come a long way in the Public Service under this government, I am pleased to say. We have preserved the Promotion Appeals Committee which was set up in the late 1940s to overcome sectarian bias within the Public Service. As I said, I was fortunate not only to win two appeals myself but also to help a number of union members whom I represented, by preparing their cases and enabling them to have successful appeals-which I thought was a pretty rewarding part of what I used to do. The second occasion when I won an appeal was in 1989. Ironically enough, it was for the position that I had held previously but that was being upgraded: of all things, the position of equal employment opportunity officer. I was passed over for that job and was rated unsuitable because management did not want me in a job like that when I was a union delegate, and that is basically what it came down to. I was rated unsuitable, but I fronted up to the appeal and was unanimously successful, which was very unusual and did not really please the department very much. That is an illustration of the fact that it is important to have the merit principle, that it is enforced and that there are safeguards. I note with interest the concern and the scaremongering in the community about the government's unfair dismissal legislation as it affects the private sector. How dare we have due process in the private sector, and how dare we have a fair go for people who are wrongfully dismissed! I do not believe that any employer has anything to fear from due process. Certainly, there are times when you have to sack somebody if they have done the wrong thing, and there are also provisions in the Public Service now for people to be disciplined and eventually dismissed if they have done the wrong thing: if they have stolen or they have hit somebody or whatever. There are procedures to be gone through, and those procedures should also apply in the private sector. If somebody has done the wrong thing or, for whatever reason, an employer has fair and reasonable grounds to dismiss somebody, then they can do that. But I also think that there are plenty of times when that is not the case, and that people should have a right to be represented in a due process, and that is why we have the unfair dismissal legislation. It is also why in the public sector we have, and we need to have, the existence of the Merit Protection and Review Agency and the merit principle enforced, as it is to a large extent because of the provisions of the Public Service Act, and section 33 in particular. I support this legislation. As with a lot of other pieces of legislation in the Public Service over the years, there are always concerns about change and sometimes they ani quite justified concerns. I must admit that, in the past, with another hat on as a trade unionist and as an employee in the public sector, I have not always welcomed some of these changes. But you can fairly say that the Public Service today is far more efficient and better managed than it was in 1983, when this government came to office. As I said, I do have a pretty long memory about the Public Service: I have been a public servant since the early 1970s and I have been active in the trade union movement in the Public Service since the late 1970s, so I have a memory of some of these issues. It is fair to say that the Public Service, warts and all, is more efficient today. Nothing is perfect, but we do have a very efficient Public Service with a lot of hard working people, as the member for Canberra MC 2052 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 28 September 1995 pointed out, and the existence of the MPRA goes a long way towards ensuring that that remains the case. I believe it will continue to be the case under this legislation, which, of course, amalgamates the MPRA with the Public Service Commission. I commend the bill to the House. need to be made about the Public Service Legislation Amendment Bill 1995 have already been made. This is a turbulent time in management in the public and private sectors. There has been a lot of debate about how to encourage the growth of efficiency whilst retaining humanity and effectiveness and an orientation towards meeting the goals of organisations. That kind of debate has occurred just as much in large private organisations as within public ones. I do not think the debate has, in any sense, concluded. There is a tendency for some people to say that the public sector should be treated in exactly the same way as the private sector. I question that. The goals of private organisations and public sector organisations, or the public service at least, are significantly different. The public sector is there to deliver goals, to serve the public, to make accessible the services that are best provided in common with the whole community and to do that in a way that ensures that they are accessible, equitably available and effectively and efficiently delivered. To a large extent the private sector overlaps with that but, of course, their bottom line is making a profit. In a sense, the goals are narrower. Equity does not have to be one of the goals of the private sector. Accessibility is important but it does not have to be a top priority in the way it does in the public sector. The public sector should, by definition, be working for the common good while private enterprise is working for shareholders, for management and employees and also for consumers. A good private enterprise will have a balance between those goals but that balance is not always as well achieved as it might be, any more than in the public sector the balance between efficiency, effectiveness, accessibility and equity are achieved as well as they ought be. It is important that we continue with this debate about how best to deliver public services. Some of the reforms that the government has introduced, including devolution to departments for responsibility for a lot of personnel management, will probably contribute to that but, given that the devolution has occurred, it is also important to have somebody that has the task of ensuring that departmental heads and senior officers administer their staff fairly and in a way that ensures that their rights are preserved. The Merit Protection and Review Agency is a very important element of doing that. It is there to provide an external appeal body which can be available to anyone who feels unfairly treated. It was very important that the agency be established. It does not matter greatly whether it stands by itself or as part of the Public Service Commission. It is ironic that, in the report on reform of the Public Service commissioned by the government, the proposal to combine the Merit Protection and Review Agency with the Public Service Commission was explicitly rejected and yet it has been decided to do it. Anyway, I do not think it matters greatly. The important point is that the chair of the Merit Protection and Review Agency retains her independence. That ensures that her tasks will be pursued with impartiality and a commitment to fairness and that the government will continue to fund the organisation effectively, therefore enabling it to do its work. It is very important as a guarantee, as a visible reminder to public servants, that they can appeal if they feel wronged in any way.

It is very helpful to us to be able to refer them to the MPRA. It is also important that we have confidence that the MPRA does its work impartially and I have every confidence that it does. I am glad to be able to support this legislation, particularly because I want to reinforce the value of what the MPRA does and also to urge public servants generally to continue this debate about how best to ensure humanity not only in the delivery of services but also in personnel management within departments. and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Public Service Matters) (12.06 p.m.}-in replyI would like to close the debate by thanking those members who have taken part in it-the member for Ryan( Mr Moore), the member for Canberra( Mr Smyth), the member for Fraser( Mr Langmore) and the member for Bonython( Mr Martyn Evans). It is a reasonably narrowly based debate but it has broadened out and it is important that I make some comment to rebut some arguments that are being given, especially by the members for Ryan and Canberra. The member for Ryan suggested that the McLeod report, which was an investigation established by me to be used for rewriting the Public Service Act, had somehow recommended against the amalgamation of the MPRA and the PSC. It did not recommend that. It had a preference for leaving those bodies apart but it did not recommend against amalgamation. But neither did the McLeod report-and this ought to be written down and remembered-have a brief on machinery of government matters. It did not have a brief to discuss whether there would or would not be amalgamations, which I call machinery of government matters. It was up to the government to make up its own mind on this, and it would have been established reports and having them received by the government, then believing that somehow that report is written in stone and that the government needs to accept the findings. We sent people away to do a major exercise, the rewrite of the Public Service Act, with a major level of consultation, but governments not only reserve the right to make their own decisions in the end; they must do so. We are bound to make decisions about what we consider to be meritorious. We use reports that we have established to give us a guide, to give us a feel for the debate, but no more than that. However, having said that, of the 118 recommendations of the McLeod report, cabinet accepted 112 recommendations. It was a successful report in the sense that it reflected accurately the sorts of changes that needed to be made and in that the government concurred. A point made by the member for Ryan was that this may be an uncomfortable situation where the MPRA, which was seen to represent the interests of individual public servants, and the Public Service Commission, which is seen to represent the interest of management, the bosses, should somehow be housed in the one organisation. He does not understand that, with the changes over the last number of years and especially with the changes ensuing from our rewrite of the Public Service Act, the responsibilities for personnel management will rest fairly and squarely with departmental secretaries. The PSC is not an arm of management. The key decisions about the conduct, hiring practices and so on of public servants will be made within the law by heads of department. That ought to be made clear so that there is not even an implied conflict between the roles of the PSC and the MPRA.",138,Representatives Main Committee

I Get A Little Bit Tired Of People, Having","MC 2054 MAIN COMMITIEE Thursday, 28 September 1995 However, it seemed to me that great strengths would derive from the amalgamation. These are not large organisations-the MPRA especially-and although they have some outposts outside Canberra, it is very difficult for them to bring in any staffing power to those regional headquarters. Through the amalgamation we may have some strengthened regional presence under the new commission. I know that the amalgamating bodies are putting together their heads, and their resources, to ensure that the roles of the old PSC and the old MPRA can be delivered at regional centres outside Canberra. That is a strength that we hope wiII arise from the amalgamation. Another consideration was to ensure that the MPRA, which had been deciding particular cases, should be well informed on personnel policy, and that the PSC should learn from those cases when it comes to the question of drawing up policy. There had to be an intimate flow of material and understanding between the two groups. I think it was happening and it ought to happen now. The quality of that interaction will be improved somewhat by the amalgamation. The discussions about cooperation between the two groups are well advanced. I recently appointed Dr Peter Shergold to head the commission. He has been in discussions with Ms Ann Forward, the director of the MPRA, and they are getting on famously. I might also use this opportunity to thank Mr Dennis Ives, the former commissioner, whose five-year appointment came to an end recently. He has been a sterling and outstanding public servant and has undertaken great duties as the Public Service Commissioner. I wish him well in his future role in the Public Service. The other point was made by both the member for Ryan and the member for Canberra. The member for Canberra said that he took us on trust, and that the role of the MPRA would remain, that is, the statutory obligation for looking after the merit principle. You do not have to trust us. It is in law. We are not affecting the powers of the commissioner or of the director of the MPRA. It is in that sense a minimal amalgamation. It is a re-housing; it is an opportunity to make sure we get the greatest efficiencies in the staffing of the two organisations; it is an opportunity for them to have a stronger regional presence, should we be able to do that; and an opportunity for them to work more intimately together. But it does not cut across the statutory obligations of either the commissioners or the director. It cannotMr Barry Jones-Read your lips. It is not changing. We are not for turning. What some other government might do in the future I cannot say. I always had the view that the MPRA was a very small organisation hanging out there in the wind, and I would not mind betting that the coalition would have knocked it off, had they come to power. They have less regard for those sorts of matters. Over 12Y2 years, we have consistently had a very high regard for the importance of individual public servants having access to an independent tribunal in order that their grievances could be heard, and this has been taking place since 1984. There are some other matters on the question of Public Service numbers, which I do not really need to address, but nevertheless they have been raised by the member for Canberra. The member for Canberra will remember that he asked me in the House, and he has written to me, about the impact on Public Service staffing as a result of the running costs program",139,Representatives Main Committee

The answer is in the budget papers, as you know, and published theretheir departments, and one component of that is salary money. Depending on how they manage running costs, there will be an output on the numbers employed at the end of the year. We can provide only an indication. I think the indication will become more accurate. I am sure we will give an answer wherein we give an update on that indication. But the entire notion is that we did not set a level of numbers of public servants. In fact, we said-as part of the drive for efficiency, not only in the public service but also in the private sector-that we would have to make considerable savings in the public sector as a result of the 1995-96 budget. So we had to tighten our belts too. But that goes to the question of running costs-not that of public servants, as such-so we can make only a reasonable prediction. As I say, the prediction we made has been published in those papers already. We would be happy to update it as we learn more. But it really is a matter for the managers of the public service to see how they can best manage that money. The other question raised is the hoary old one of the War Memorial and the MPRA's investigation into it. I cannot say a great deal about it, because the matter is before the courts. But I will reassure you, as I have a number of newspaper journalists who keep getting it wrong-as did Crispin Hull, most recently, in the Canberra Times. Firstly, quite clearly, I operated on the basis of the powers in the act when I said that the MPRA should undertake its investigations into the War Memorial. Secondly, I did so on the basis of very good evidence. It included evidence that was given to me by the MPRA, evidence that came to us from the CPSU-the union-and the view of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, who was consulted on the matter on the way through. This is public. It has been known. I have said it a number of times. I wish Mr Hull and others could get this one right: we were as one. There was considerable unease about matters at the War Memorial and we used, quite properly, the powers available in the act to see if we could assist in those matters. The matter is now before the courts and I cannot say any more on that. I think that covers my response to all the matters raised by the various members.
