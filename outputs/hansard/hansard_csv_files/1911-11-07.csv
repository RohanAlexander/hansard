When the B i ll providing for the construction of this line was introduced, it contained a provision practically making the Consolidated Revenue liable for the cost of construction, but on a question being raised by the Opposition the Prime Minister said that the Government would withdraw the appropriation clause. It was pointed out by the honourable member for Richmond that the procedure usually adopted in the State Parliaments in regard to the construction of railways is first of all to lay upon the table of the House plans and specifications and books of reference, showing the whole contemplated scheme. I do not know what is the practice in the other States, but the honourable member for Richmond said, quoting from the Queensland Hansard, that in Queensland, it was usual for the Parliament to refer the plans and books of reference to a Select Committee for report upon the proposed line. When the Frime Minister was reminded of this procedure by the Opposition, he, and the Minister of Home Affairs also, promised that, before an appropriation was made, detailed information would be laid before the House. The Minister, however, is now asking the Committee to make the first appropriation* for the construction of the railway, although he has not submitted to us either plans, specificasatisfactory results are tions, books of reference, or any information whatever. vote is towards the construction of a railway that will cost ,£4,000,000. gentleman think the item has been submitted in the proper way to the Committee ? He has our support in carrying out this railway, and we are anxious that it shall be constructed as soon as possible; but there is a proper business-like method of procedure to follow, and I submit that it has not been followed in this case. I presume that the Minister will lay on the table of the House books of reference and other information relating to this proposal.

I do not think there is any necessity to wait, because the Minister could easily determine upon several of the leading lighthouses that are necessary. plans for their acquisition and construction, ancl, in the meantime, could make further inquiries as to lighthouses required in addition to those already mentioned in the report. the Queensland coast, ancl in other parts of Australia, improved beacons and minor guiding lights are required.

The Minister have a transcontinental line not touching' the sea, or approaching anywhere closeenough to the sea to be attackable from the sea, between Sydney and Fremantle. That would be a great advance on the present proposal from a defence point of I presume that the honourable view. The Minister undertook at the time to take the suggestion into consideration, ancl I take this opportunity of urging upon him its extreme importance I wish now to refer to the from a defence point of view.

We may not be ready, but we want to get ready. question is, when will Parliament meet next year? The suggestion of the honourable member for Wentworth will have careful consideration; but, of course, it will have to go before Cabinet, which will have the final decision. Trade and Customs) [7.56] -Eve r since it was intended that the Commonwealth should take'control of lighthouses, beacons, and buoys, the inefficiency of some of our lights, on account of the increased speed of vessels, and for other reasons, has been brought under my notice, and, probably, uncier the notice of other Ministers who preceded me in the Department. That is why I considered it advisable to obtain expert advice on the subject; and no exception has been taken, so far as I know, to the qualifications of the gentleman appointed for that duty. It is not possible for the expert to inspect all the existing lights, except when the vessels which go out to providore them are available-that is once in every three or six months. As soon as Commander Brewis was appointed, we communicated with the States, and asked when their vessels would be going out, so that we could fit in his arrangements with them. Commander Brewis is now in Tasmanian waters. The honourable member for Darling Downs asks what lights are considered by the expert to be the most important. The only report which it has been possible for the expert to lay before the Department concerns the Bass Strait lights. Most people who use the sea consider that the south-eastern corner of Australia is the most dangerous. Captain after captain has said that he has practically passed the whole of the dangers before the Wilson's Promontory light opens out. only £2,500 has been set down on the Estimates, that is considered sufficient to make a start with the most urgent lights. Speaking from memory, I believe that the recommendation is to alter the Wilson's Promontory light from a 12-mile to a 25-mile light, to place an unattended light upon one of the islands of the Glennie Group, and another unattended light at Cape Liptrap, and to alter the light further along to the [82]-2 east, at or near Cape Howe. It is estimated that 4,000 vessels pass that corner of Australia every year.' Although it was originally estimated that to alter the Wilson's Promontory light, and to put additional lights in the places I have named, would cost about £60,000, it is now possible, by the use of unattended acetylene The lights, on what is known as the AGA system, for the same work to be done for less than £8,000. As soon as the Lighthouses Bill is passed, we shall proceed to take action in regard to this matter. The papers will be sent to the Department of Home Affairs, in order that the work may be put in hand as soon as possible. ceived a report about Queensland yet? port is being prepared. On the day when the expert arrived from New South Wales, there was an opportunity for him to go away in the tender that visits the Tasmanian lighthouses. He was only in Melbourne two or three hours, because he wished to make an inspection of the Tasmanian lighthouses immediately. As soon as I receive his report, I shall make recommendations to the Cabinet. If the amount already appropriated for the purpose is not sufficient to enable urgent and necessary work to be commenced, I shall recommend the Treasurer to brinir down Supplementary Estimates, with a view of doing all that is necessary in that regard. As to beacons, I understand that the expert will make some recommendations with regard to the Barrier Reef, but, until I receive his report, it is impossible for me to state what will be done. He has already been round the coast as far as Port Darwin for the purpose, and his report, when completed, will be comprehensive as to the coast as far round as Brisbane. should like to have a definite statement from the Minister of Home Affairs with regard to the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta Although railway. The honourable member for Darling Downs has drawn attention to the fact that the sum of £22,500, which we are asked to vote for the purpose, is practically for the building of the line. It commits Parliament to the total expenditure for the whole line. During the progress of a previous debate, the attention of the Minister was drawn to the fact that it was customary, before money was voted for railway works such as this, to give Parliament full particulars.

31,Mr Greene (Richmond) [8.2],"IHansard for the present year it is reported . that when the honourable member for Darling Downs-followin g up something that I had said a little while before-aske d the Minister whether he would promise that before any appropriation was made by Parliament for this line he would lay upon the table of the House plans, sections, books of reference, and so on, the Minister of Home Affairs said, "" We will give the fullest information."" The Committee is entitled to that information before voting this money. Seeing that the survey has been completed a considerable time, I fail to see why the information has not been furnished. It surely could have been made available to honourable members. The Minister is ever priding himself upon, and imand the item was disposed of. pressing honourable members with, his great and undoubted business capacity. I put it to him, as a business man, whether he, in the conduct of his own business, when payon Friday was to reduce the whole item ing what was tantamount to a deposit on -a contract which would involve him in an expenditure of £4,000,000, would not insist on knowing what the terms of the contract were? Surely his business instincts will tell him that that is merely a member for Richmond proposes to submit reasonable proposition to put' before busiany amendment on the subject. ness men? by day labour, or by contract? as to which we are entirely in the dark. We are entitled to a full statement of the policy of the Government. What are they going to do? How do they propose to construct the line-by day labour, or by contract? Is purely Australian-manufactured material to be employed in the construction of the railway? We ought to have a quantity of information on these points. What the Minister has already Deane's report that the money was simply for preliminary work. But what we did not know, and what we still want to know, is the policy of the Government. We want to have some idea of the way in which the line is going to be built. That information should be furnished before we vote this money. The same remarks apply -perhap s to a fuller extent-to money voted for purposes of the Federal Capital site. I had an opportunity, of which I availed myself recently, of visiting YassEventually we found out that by voting the Canberra. For my own part, I can say that I am very glad indeed that the amendselves to an expenditure of £313,000. ment with regard to that matter was negatived on Friday last. member must not discuss that matter now. amendment.

The Committee has passed the line of the Estimates dealing with it. whole subdivision is under discussion. on Friday was on the question that item 2 of subdivision 3 be reduced by £66,000. That question was discussed in every phase, Chairman, I think that if you look at the records you will find that the amendment by £66,000. I believe that, under tbe Standing Orders, it would now be in order for an honourable member to move for the reduction of the item by any lesser sum, though I do not think that the honourable the honourable member says is correct. that I can discuss the proposal to spend money on the Federal Capital site? member will be in order. with the site, which, I think, is admirably suited for the particular purpose for which it is to be used. It is certainly infinitely better than I had been led to believe that it was. the country at its best. those who have been at Yass-Canberra frequently that it was looking even better six months ago. My point now is, however, that the matter under discussion is not being dealt with by the Minister of Home Affairs in a business-like way. First of all, he comes down with no information as to the £.100,000. He made no attempt at an explanation, until it was absolutely dragged out of him, as to how much money was going to be involved in the work. amount proposed we were committing ourBefore we proceed further with this undertaking, we should have from the Minister",16,Estimates Additions New Works And Buildings

Has he not any clear, definite idea of how the whole of this scheme is to be finally worked out; and, if he has such an idea, will he not take the Committee into his confidence? Surely that is only a business like view to take. When we remember that we have not yet acquired a single foot of land in the Territory outside the grant from the State and the acquisition of Acton Estate, and that we will have to acquire an enormous area from private owners, it should make us pause.

I think that the general character of this country must be perfectly evident to every honourable member. I do not say that it is all of the same character, because it is not.

It has a 15-inch rainfall, and most fertile land, suitable for the growing of wheat, and so forth. We should be better employed in developing the Northern Territory than in dealing with this miserable Capital site, which never was wanted and never will be. Surely we have sufficient capital cities in Australia already, with aggregations of population? I hope and trust that this Parliament will never spend anything on a Capital site, or any other scheme that is not self-supporting. I was much surprised to hear the honourable member for Richmond suggest that the Federal Territory would finance itself, for we know that he is a good business man, and understands Australia. The honourable member has not seen very many nice dairy farms in that country. have improved very much since I was there. the land will be a "" bonzer "" I get the water from ?

So far as I can see, the Yass-Canberra country is too porous for irrigation. I really wish the Minister would give us the benefit of what he really knows of the Yass-Canberra site. It is all very well to build a Military College there, because the site is far enough away from civilization, affords abundance of room for drilling, and plenty of rabbits for shooting practice. I hope honourable members will be very careful before they sanction any further expenditure, because all the money we have is required to develop Australia generally on proper lines. I have been highly amused in listening to the honourable member for Richmond. I thought that, as a man of the soil, the honourable member would have been able to give a better idea of the carrying capacity of the land at Yass-Canberra than his estimate of a sheep and a half to the acre. been there? against this particular site before, I said that I had not seen it, and quoted from the statements of Ministers and others who had visited the site. I can speak now from a personal knowledge of the country, which has more than confirmed me in the opinions I previously held concerning it. The honourable member for Richmond is anxious to know exactly how every item of the vote for the Federal Capital is to be expended. broad lines of the Government's financial scheme. block the Estimates, though I should have liked to block a particular vote the other day. I should have been glad to have had the assistance of the financiers, and those who know something of land values; but I found the honourable member for Richmond, and other honourable members, when they had the opportunity to prevent this expenditure, swinging in behind the Minister of Home Affairs. The honourable member for Richmond voted away £100,000 for expenditure on the Yass-Canberra site. Now he irrigation wishes to know exactly how that money is to be spent. £100,000 is to be spent. member's shrewdness, he is following the old plan of locking the stable door after the horse has been stolen. The only lands that I saw at the Capital site which would be likely to cany a sheep and a half to the acre, were the alluvial flats on Molonglo Creek. Of the three estates which have been referred to, I should say that that on the road to the Murrumbidgee is the best. It is rather late in the day now for the honourable member for Richmond to complain about these particular items. There is another matter to which I should like to direct the attention of the Opposition. They are accustomed to hold up their hands in horror whenever anything in the shape of a Socialistic proposal is submitted for consideration. But they have assisted to carry votes for expenditure on the Capital site; and, no doubt, will assist to pass further votes for the same purpose, although the money will be spent on the most Socialistic schemes that have ever been carried out in Australia.

I think that he ought to withdraw it. minded of it ; I certainly withdraw it. I submit to the honourable member for Bourke that it is only fair that he should accept my statement. Possessing the knowledge that I do of the conditions of the Defence Department, I think he ought to accept my statement that this is a genuine attempt on the part of the Minister of Defence, acting on the advice of his most responsible expert advisers, to establish a college in a direction that will be best calculated to secure the effective defence of Australia. ask what the ground is going to cost? than the amount included in the principal item. scribed by the citizens will be over and above the £53>ooo to be expended by the Government. apparently assume that the total sum of £53,000 is going to be expended on the Naval College, but they will see, on looking at the item that it is towards the cost of Naval Barracks tails of each subdivision of the item? Home Affairs has the details? would be most injudicious to say definitely we were entitled. The question asked by what was going to be done in regard to the honourable member for Eden-Monaro these propositions if he had them. There and the honourable member for Bourke, as are a Naval Barracks, Submarine Depot, Not one Naval Gunnery and Torpedo School, Naval Training School, Naval Boys' Training School, and Naval Midshipmen's College. The whole of those necessities are heaped under the vote of £53,000. I am very sorry, but I have tried to get hold of the Minister of Defence in order to obtain the particulars of each of those items. I think honourable members might reasonably assume that this is a vote which is intended to carry out the defence scheme of naval instruction for boys to fit them to go into members might also assume that the Government have taken all reasonable precautions to see that the site most suitable and most advantageous has been picked in order to secure the best results. I would ask the honourable member, on the strength of the statement that has been made to him, to allow this item to pass without forcing it to a vote. I think the Minister has quite misconceived the tone of the discussion. He was out of the chamber when tbe questions were, asked. plained it, he made several attacks by insinuations. In the first place, he attacked us for having a "" Dreadnought policy,"" but we have the satisfaction of knowing that, not only was the Dreadnought accepted, but the whole of the Naval Unit, including a Dreadnought, was accepted. I do not want to say anything more. You know that is not right. rect, but I do not wish to raise that issue now. The Minister raised all these issues, which we do not want to discuss. All we said was that this item was a large one, and that a whole series of matters was grouped together in it. We simply asked the Minister two questions-What was the extent of the commitment, and what were made no charge of incompetence against any Minister or other person.
