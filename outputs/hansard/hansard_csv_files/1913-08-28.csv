The Prime Minister, sought by telegram from Mr Fanstone, who is at present at Cockburn Sound. Meanwhile it is assumed that the surveyors in question have completed the work for which they were employed, and it naturally followed that their services were no longer required. If the information now being sought confirms this, the word "" dismissal"" is hardly accurate. a personal explanation regarding a charge repeated agaiust me last night by the honourable member for Ballarat. He accused me of having slandered Australia by certain statements made in an interview concerning our electoral system. already denied that I made such stateorable member's attitude, but I am desirous that the facts shall be known. The following-is a ful l report of the published interview: Mr Cook observed to-night, in a special interview which he kindly accorded me, that the Labour Ministers are obviously bad losers, but had to recognise that they had been defeated at the polls, and accept the consequences of the electors' decision. The Liberal party was clearly in a difficult position, and the only satisfactory solution would be a further appeal to the country, which would not be long delayed. In the House of Representatives Mr Cook said business could only be conducted by the casting vote of the Speaker, but even if he had a substantial majority the overwhelming hostile 'majority in the Senate would ultimately bring about a deadlock. Mr Cook referred to the unsatisfactory condition of the electoral rolls, and said that the new voting system was open to grave abuse. That is all I said; and I have a confirmation of that from the writer of the interview, which I wish to read to the HousesI see that my cable to the Morning Post, aa June 12th, was made an excuse for an attack on you during the course of the present debate.

A document relating to public affairs quoted from by a Minister of the Crown, unless stated to be of a confidential nature or such as should more properly be obtained by Address, may be called for and made a public document. The only question that arises now is whether the document from which the Prime Minister quoted was a private communication, or a document of such a nature as was contemplated under the standing order. . private document: he said it was a letter. private personal letter, because the Prime Minister said he had received a letter from the person to whom he had granted the interview, and who was responsible for the article. have a friend at court, is it not? member for Kalgoorlie to withdraw that statement; it is a reflection on the Chair. letter read by the Prime Minister is a has been made in time, it has been generally reply to a request or intimation from the acquiesced in.

I feel sure that the time is not far distant when the whole of these seats will be captured by our party. The result of the late general election justifies that belief. We have grown in strength, and one of the chief factors of that growth is the existence in Brisbane of a newspaper which advocates the cause of Labour. I was instrumental last Decemberi n starting a Labour newspaper in Queensland, and its existence was one reason why we were so successful. Until we have a daily newspaper in each of the States, however, we cannot hope to secure the success we desire. We know the power of the press; we have had experience of it on many occasions. The attitude of the daily newspapers throughout Australia makes it an easy matter for Labour journals to be established. For the most part, the press of Australia is conducted to suit only a section of the community, the articles published in them from day to day being written in the interests of the Liberal party. There are in Brisbane many business firms that have subscribed very liberally to the funds of that party. some Commonwealth electorates, at the recent general election, we are given to [ 2 5 ] -2 understand-and our authority is fairl y reliable-as much as £10,000 was spent. We have, therefore, to fight a great army of soldiers well equipped with funds, so bhat the success we have achieved is something of which to be proud. We have also to fight almost all the newspapers in Australia. In Queensland and South Australia we have our own daily press, and our success in those States proves the abI t is to us, although solute necessity for the establishment of The letter I feel certain that the time is not far distant when we shall have them, so that our New South Wales. nearer the birth of a Labour daily in Victoria than many imagine. W it h the establishment of these Labour journals, we shall be able to fight our opponents, no matter what money they may have at their command. The financial difficulties Notwithwith which we have to contend should not be lost sight of when the amending Electoral B ill is before us. It should not be possible for thousands of pounds to be spent in connection with one election. TheA c t should be so amended as to render it impossible for more than £ 1 0 0 to be spent in connection with any one candidate. Until we have such an amendment of the law, we can never hope to achieve the success which we and the great body of the people so much desire Our opponents can spend money lavishly, and when they can buy privileges and win power poor people of Australia to say that they can be bought. hard for Labour members to fight the big financial institutions, which are practically Liberal leagues.

I may introduce them to him some day, as they might be of assistance to him. Our opponents are not satisfied witli the provision of the electoral law that requires the signing of certain newspaper articles published during an electoral campaign. A f t er what occurred in this chamber this afternoon in connection with the reading of a letter by the Prime Minster, I am of opinion that any statement quoted from any document should at once become the property of the House, and be laid on the table. The other evening the Attorney-General quoted from a circular, but when he was asked by an honourable member on this side to show it , he absolutely refused to do so. If an honourable member quotes from a document, he should be prepared to hand it immediately to his opponent for the purposes of criticism. ing out the name of the writer, and hounding him down. who quotes from a paper is prepared to hand it to his opponents, there must be the suspicion of something that was not honourable in connection with the matter. The honourable member for Adelaidei n forms me, in regard to the paper quoted by the Attorney-General, that the latter handed it to him after his speech. An y document quoted in this Chamber should immediately become the property of the House, and be available for perusal by any honourable member. We on this side know-o n many occasions it has been to our sorrow-the great influence which newspapers have on the public opinion of Australia. We know, too, that newsI have given the paper writers are often instructed to write in a manner that is contrary to their opinions. This has been proved by what has happened in connection with W h a t trust provided the the establishment of the Labour journal at Brisbane. We were told that it would be impossible to get writers for a Labour newspaper, but we had no difficulty in finding men who were willing to advocate Labour politics. We drew our staff from the Sydney Daily Telegraph, the Sydney Morning Herald, the EveningT h e working men lent News, and the Melbourne Age, and our honourable journal has the best circulation of any evening newspaper in Queensland. claims to have the largest circulation. forfeit £10 0 to the Brisbane Hospitali f our statement be disproved. We are satisfied, by reason of the ease with which we get advertisements and the number of our advertisements, that the newspaper has a large circulation. The number of advertisements is the best index to a newspaper circulation. This journal is going into the homes of the people, and the results of the State election, and the still better results of the Federal election, prove that it carries great weight. Print is one of the greatest powers in the world; it moulds the minds of all thinking people, and assists tliem to true and correct decisions. readers know that their newspaper articles are written by men thoroughly well acquainted with the subjects on which they write, they have confidence in F o r the purpose of findthe value of the opinions expressed. When articles are not signed, it is difficult to know who the writers are. Newspaper writers would like to be permitted to sign all their articles, because of the advertisement of their ability which that would give, and capable men would be able to improve their position. When journalists must write as directed by editors or managers, they cannot show their ability to the same extent as when they are writing in accordance with the promptings of their consciences and their feelings. These remarks are my reasons why we should not erase from the electoral law the provisions requiring the signing of newspaper articles. I am sure that the proposal to erase this clause will not receive general support. The Prime Minister-whethe r in this debate or",18,Osborn J Fenwick

As her father and mother are in receipt of old-age pensions, her statements received some credence. I mention the fact to show that misrepresentations occurred on the Liberal side. In my opinion, the insurance scheme which the Government propose will not give the same satisfaction or comfort to our old people as they obtain from the pensions, and the prospect of its being adopted is not very great. Honourable members supporting the Government have spoken at length on the land question, and pose as the only friends figures available in regard to condensed of the farmers, treating those on this side as enemies of the farmers. We, however, are greater friends of the farmers, and likely to do more for them, than our opponents. The democracy of Australia favours closer settlement. We are told that the farmers of to-day were the rural workers of ten years ago; but I ask where will the rural workers of to-day get land ten years hence if the land laws are not altered? Government supporters have not put forward one practical suggestion for dealing with land settlement. AU they say is that they are opposed to the rural workers' log. The land question is one of Australia's greatest problems, which is exercising the minds of those who desire to better the conditions of our people. The agricultural statistics of 1912 were in many respects better than those for any previous year. The dairying industry was not altogether as successful as we should have liked, because of drought in many parts, but in many respects the statistics are an improvement on those for former years. I wish to quote a few figures to show our opponents that Labour legislation has not prevented the progress and success of agriculture in Australia. The acreage under cultivation at the end of 1911 was 12,107,017 acres, while at the end of 1912 the acreage was 13,036,570 acres, an increase of land under cultivation of 929,553 acres. This gives some idea of the great progress of our agricultural pursuits which we were told Labour legislation was going to strangle. I would remind my friends that these figures are supplied by Mr Knibbs. and the year after, and tell us the result. members to the figures as supplied in Mr Knibbs' book. The 1912 figures are not included in the publication, and I have them from the author himself. ferent story at Maryborough. are the correct figures. Mr Fisher is not in the habit of making statements that are not true. I could not get the increase in dairy cattle for 1912, because the figures are not available; but the increase from 1910 to the end of 1911 was 56,060 head. So this particular line was also a great success during the reign of the Labour Government. The latest milk show that there was an increase of 10,492,446 lbs. during the year 1911. I have to quote these figures, because our opponents tell us of the great evils Labour legislation wrought on the dairying industry. I have to admit that last year was a bad year as regards the butter industry, but I have the figures for three years. The output of butter for 1910 was 193,211,909 lbs., and for 1911 the output was 211,577,745 lbs. I am sorry",19,Osborn J Fenwick

Honourable members who are acquainted with the tactics of the middleman will agree with the statement Mr Sharpe. that he has been most ruinous to the farmer. He has exploited the farmer in every way, and also the consumer.

But I quite believe the banks were not in a position to be very liberal, if we can take notice of the banking statistics, which I shall quote, if only to show the reckless manner in which the banks have been doing business. The deposits at the end of 1909 amounted to £181,709,036. of 1912 they amounted to £211,225,365. But the coin and bullion in the banks had only increased in the same period by £4,646,980.

There is not the slightest doubt that if the present Government carry out their intention to give the freehold of the land the American Beef Trust will purchase all that is worth purchasing. We know from experience that the Northern Territory country is the best we have for beefproducing purposes, and we ought to take care that a portion of the country is reserved for the purpose of providing the necessary meat for this community. The trust will, no doubt, purchase all the good land and leave the bad for the people. I hope, however, that the Government will seriously consider the suggestion I have made in this connection, or otherwise we shall find ourselves, in a few years, in the position the United States is in to-day. My time has about expired, and I shall take another opportunity to deal with the other parts of the Government policy. The encouraging approval with which honourable members have been good enough to greet my rising, I gratefully acknowledge. When my mind goes back over the intervening years since the various States became united under one Federation, when I recall the names of those distinguished men whose counsels in this very chamber have guided the youthful steps of the nation along the lines of national progress, my feelings are many and varied; but theire predominates a natural sense of diffidence, combined with a feeling of responsibility, at being myself elected a law maker. have been appointed successor to Mr now it has become almost a crime to be old George Cann, a gentleman who, by his geniality of manner and modesty of demeanour, succeeded in winning the respect of honourable members on both sides of the House. While a certain amount of feeling may have been engendered in some of the contests during the recent campaign, I had the privilege of opposing a gentleman who played the political game Mr Sharpe. fair and square, and for whom I entertain up. The ground already traversed by older and more experienced honorable members, and also by the political "" colts,"" is so extensive that very little is left for a new speaker. There are, howI ever, several matters in the Governmentprogramme on which I desire to expressmy views. I entirely disagree with the honourable member for Oxley in his condemnation of the postal vote. I must remind the honourable member, as the honorable member for Calare has already done, that when the postal vote proposal was first before this House even the ex-Prime Minister himself had a sincere admiration for it as a "" natural corollary of a universal franchise."" After one or two trials his opinion of the postal vote remained unaltered; but when in operation at the 1910 general election and the greatest, percentage of postal votes went to the Liberal party, it was struck out of the Electoral Act. It passes my comprehension that the Labour party should have placed in its stead an absentee vote, which gives to the unscrupulous voter, with a little time and preparation, unlimited scope for voting from early morn till late at night if he cares to face the little danger of detection. Possibly there was not a great deal of impersonation at the recent election; but the pub(Nepean) [3.54] licity given through the press during the last few months in regard to the operation of the absentee vote must have educated the public up to the opportunities presented. I do not say that the people of Australia are more dishonest electorally than are the people in any other parts of the world, but if we desire to get a proper expression of opinion at the ballot-box, opportunity for fraud should be removed. The postal vote was regarded as one of the greatest concessions won for the Australian Democracy. By its means thousands of sick men and women and old and decrepit I people were able to record their votes, but and feeble. Distributed throughout the country districts there are thousands of men and women who have given the best days of their lives to the progress of their particular locality, and now, when they are approaching the allotted span of life, and time has laid its hand heavily on them, they find themselves physically in capable of travelling any long distance to",22,Osborn J Fenwick
104,Mr Orchard,"vote. boast that they are the champions of Democracy, deny to those people the right to say who shall represent them in the National Parliament. in my opinion, are quite right in restoring whereas over 73 per cent, was used for the postal vote. Their action will be endorsed by every man and woman who is desirous of seeing a proper expression of opinion by the people. Turning to other points in the Government programme, I have to say that, personally, I am absolutely opposed to preference to unionists in the Government employ. being taxpayers, all should have an equal right to such work. There seems to be great anxiety on the part of the Opposition to bring the rural workers within the scope of the Federal arbitration law; but I remind them that the conditions under which men work on the land are entirely different from those of men industrially employed in the cities. I firmly believe that there are conditions of country work which need improvement, and should be improved; but if I am asked whether it is possible to apply to the country the same rates of pay, hours of labour, and the conditions generally that prevail in the cities, I unhesitatingly say that it is not. The man on the land is dependent upon influences over which he has no control. He is dependent upon the elements, and there are times when it is not possible for members of the Labour party adopting him to comply with conditions such as exist the best methods in the interests of the in the various trades, where employers have their orders, know what work they have ahead, and consequently know what employment they require. That being so, we cannot apply to the man on the land the conditions that we apply to men engaged in various other industries. I have been a supporter of unionism for years, because I find that in my calling the best men are in the unions. Whilst the unions perform those duties which they originally set out to do, no reasonable men can find fault with them. Unionism has been not only the means of bettering the conditions of the men themselves, but also a protection to the employer, who 'is paying his men a fair wage, against the unfair competition of those engaged in a system of sweating. But when we find unions becoming mere political bodies, when their funds are being used for political purposes, then a very serious objection arises average employer of labour in Australia in regard to such a phase of their operations. The astounding figures produced Yet our friends opposite, who by the Attorney-General-figure s proving that in New South Wales alone, out of the huge sum of £163,000 raised by the unionists, less than 20 per cent, went in The Government, actual benefits to the unionists themselves, managerial and "" other,"" with the accent on the ""other,"" expenses-sho w that these funds are being used in a manner not altogether to the interests of the non-militant section of the unionists. I think honourable members will agree that in connection with every union there are All men men who do not identify themselves with either Labour or Liberal politics. They believe in voting according to the dictates of their own consciences. That being so, from the figures that have been disclosed, it is evident that their money has been used in a direction over which they have no control. Some honourable members opposite have been good enough to admit, by their interjections, that these funds have assisted them in their campaign. since we can expect no redress from honourable members opposite, that it is time tliere was formed a Committee from this side of the House to endeavour to secure for the non-militant unionists a better return for the money they are subscribing. But the question arises, Are honourable progress of this country-in the interests of the people of Australia-by creating that class feeling which has largely originated the policy of not only the Federal Labour party, but the Labour party of the several States? I consider this is introducing a condition of affairs altogether undesirable. The strong vindictive language that is frequently indulged in by some honourable members on the Opposition benches can do no good, but must be productive of a great deal of harm. Listening to some of the advocates of Labour, one would come to the conclusion that the average employer in Australia was a Simon Legree of the most pronounced type; that he was a man absolutely devoid of all consideration for his fellow men, and that, in order to satisfy his greed for gold, he was prepared to sacrifice all those principles which a man should hold dear. The is prepared to give his men a fair deal. Generally speaking, he has risen from the.",23,Osborn J Fenwick

We have not a moneyed, leisured class in Australia such as exists in other parts of the world, where estates and inheritances have been handed down from one g£neration to another. have a few such families, but they are comparatively very few. Here in Australia opportunities are waiting, and have been waiting, for all. When a man on .the very lowest rung of the ladderthe mechanic, the shearer, or a man following any other occupation-by energy, thrift, and by the practice of self-sacrifice, comes out of the ruck and becomes an employer surely he should not have pointed at him the finger of scorn as a creature to be abhorred., who must have obtained his present position by, figuratively speaking, walking over the bodies of his fellow-men. for every man to endeavour to secure sufficient of this world's goods so that in the winter of his life he will not be dependent upon his family or the State for his daily bread. These are the class of men we should encourage; these are the men who are going to assist Australia to realize her destiny; and honourable members opposite are ill-advised in the use of the bitter language that has been so strongly in evidence during this debate. Our Labour friends would lead us to believe that the Liberal Governments of the past have had no sympathy with the workers. ments, despite the nature of the laws that we have on the statute-book to-day. It is generally admitted that, whilst in many instances, perhaps, the conditions of the workers could be better, here in Australia, as the result of Wages Boards and Arbitration Courts, the lot of the worker has .become the envy and admiration of his co-worker in other parts of the world. All these things have been made possible, not under Labour Governments, but under the administration of those whom the Labour party would lead us to believe were blind to the needs of the workers. .If the Liberal Governments of the past had treated the claims of labour as the Labour Government treated the claims of the non-unionists when they were in office, we should not have had on our statute-book to-day the democratic laws to which we can point. The record of the Labour Government during their term of office proves that, had they been in power as many years as Liberal GoMr Orchard. vernments have been, they would not have been as generous to their opponents as have been Liberal Governments in the days that are past. I have no desire that We may honourable members should think, because I am arguing in this way, that I have no sympathy with the workers. Par from it. My colleagues from New South Wales will bear me out when I say that I have been a worker for many years. At a very early date I had to shift for myself. his I come from a line of workers, and I am proud of it . But I tell the House that I have no time for the man who, in order himself, to gratify mere personal ambition and in order to get into the public life of this country, is trying to delude the worker that the man who employs him must necessarily be his natural enemy. Such men are a menace to the common It is a laudable ambition weal. We are all members of the same family; all endeavouring to do the best we can for ourselves, and for those dependent upon us, as well as for the country in which we live. The interests of capital and labour are indissolubly bound up together, and the sooner we recognise this the better for the advancement of this young nation. It is very gratifying to find upon the Government programme a declaration that they intend to give increased encouragement to rifle clubs. We are aware that distributed throughout Australia are bodies of men who have banded themselves together to follow They make such statetheir sport. We are essentially a pleasureloving people. Many critics have decried this tendency on the part of Australiansto devote so much time to pleasure. Butwith the glorious sunshine of our land,, with all nature calling us out of doors',. what else could be expected 1 Rifle shooting, however, possesses one great advantage over all other sport, and that is its usefulness as a means of defence should occasion arise. Discipline, the forming of lines, and training in the variousmilitary evolutions in time of actual warfare are very necessary; but it is the man who can shoot straight that counts every time. Consequently, we should be prepared to give every reasonable encouragement to those who are devoting their spare time to an effort to perfect themselves in the art of rifle shooting. Butwhilst every man should be prepared to pay for his own pleasure, I consider that, the circular sent out last year, and again this year, by the Defence Department to the secretaries of rifle clubs is altogetherunreasonable in its demands. «ircular the Department calls for volunteers from the various rifle clubs to proceed to the different ranges, there to instruct the trainees in the use of the rifle. It also imparts the information that such services must be purely voluntary. I think that honourable members will agree with me that these clubs are composed of those who find the ordinary cost of membership, combined with the expenses incidental to their sport, a quite sufficient strain upon their slender incomes. To ask these men to saddle themselves with the extra expense of journeying to different ranges in order to instruct the trainees, without even offering to pay their out-of-pocket expenses, is to demand more than they are prepared to give. As the military education of the trainees will be incomplete without this very necessary knowledge, I hope that the Minister of Defence will see his way clear to set aside a sum sufficient to reimburse the members of rifle clubs the expense to which they will be put in attending the different ranges. There is another matter relating to the rifle clubs to which I desire to refer. Area Officers is the same-£15 0 per anI allude to the closing of the Windsor rifle range. The old town of Windsor, as honourable members must be aware, is rich in historic associations. on the Hawkesbury are the descendants of many of the oldest families, the grand old pioneers who have always evidenced P keen interest in the various military duties and matters appertaining to the defence of their country. has been in existence for forty years, but in the midst of their quarterly competition the other day, without any previous intimation, the riflemen had the range closed upon them, because it did not comply in some minute particular with the regulations in regard to the danger zone. these years picnic parties have been held behind the stone butts there, and no accident has occurred, this range, without any previous warning, was suddenly closed. This is altogether unfair to the members of the local rifle club. Some of our best officers have come from that district, and the officers of the Department should, in my opinion, show more discretion. If no accident has taken place in conplant men possessing years of experinexion with a range, the fact that it is a few yards short of the distance laid down by the regulations relating to the danger zone should not be a sufficient reason for In this closing it . I trust the Minister of Defence will use his influence towards reopening the range. I desire now to draw attention to the absurd disparity that exists between the duties performed by Area Officers in charge of country districts and those performed by officers in charge of city areas. This matter, I understand, was brought before the last Parliament, but since nothing has been done to remove the discontent that exists, I consider I am justified in again introducing the subject to the House. A city Area Officer can do his military work in his spare time, devoting his days to his private occupation. With him military duties are merely a hobby, taken up very often as a profitable pastime. But the country area officer must devote the whole of his time to his military duties. Many of the city Area Officers are public servants, employed in the Works, Lands, and other Departments, and do their military work in their hours of leisure. The country officer must work six days out of the seven in order to keep up with his work. Yet the remuneration of city and country num. In my division, there is an Area Officer who has sixty, schools, attended by members of the Junior Cadet Porces. Settled He has to perform all the clerical work connected with the training of these youths, and it takes him a week to visit his various centres. On the other hand, many a city Area Officer has but one school to visit. Again, in the city, a This range trainee, on attaining the age of eighteen years, is drafted into the Citizen Forces, and the Area Officer ceases io be responsible for him. But the responsibility of the Area Officer in the country does not then cease; the trainee learns the more exacting duties of the citizen soldier from him. The young men now being Notwithstanding that during all educated at Duntroon for military service will, after four years' training, be put under Area Officers, to supplant them as soon as they have mastered their duties. These military fledglingsI use the word without disrespect, because some of them will be only twenty years of age-wil l commence with a minimum salary of £300 per annum, with all before them. They are to supence, and, in some cases, active service records, who get only £150 per annum, and have no future. I do not say that the work of our young officers will not be worth £300 per annum, but the present Area Oflicers, who are doing the pioneering work, straightening places and making smoother for their successors, should receive at least as much. the best returns for our expenditure defence, we must get rid of the discontent which exists in many country districts to-day, and pay our officers in accordance with their work.

108,Mr Orchard,"I apologize. ThereOn Friday last, the new members of the House were given an object lesson in political tactics by members of the Opposition. The honourable member for K a l goorlie was criticising the Attorney General for holding a general retainer from the Marconi Company. To an unbiased mind, nothing could have been clearer or more convincing than the manly straightforward explanation of the'Attor ney-General. In my opinion, there is no analogy between his position and that which Mr Justice Isaacs occupied. But when the honourable member for K a l goorlie made his charge, his impetuosity of utterance, the seemingly condemnatory extracts which he read from Hansard, with the running commentary which accompanied them, cast a peculiar spell over me. One can understand the effect of his oratory on the impressionable mind of a new member as he crouched at the table like Shylock, explaining the purport of the bond, the chamber ringing with the fierceness of his denunciation. But when the honourable member for Werriwa, with those Sherlock Holmes instincts which have become characteristic of him, whether in pursuit of some detail of bacteriological reseach such as the germ of vaccinia, or the microbe of tuberculosis of the epigastrium-whe n he rose and revealed to the House that on the previous occasion the honourable member for Kalgoorlie, like the proverbial sheep, had opened not his mouth, but had actually voted in support of Mr Isaacs' posiopportunities to all. If we legislate tion, the spell was broken, and shades of Kean, Macready, Irving, and all the histrionic giants of the past flitted before my mental vision, and I realized that, had the honourable member for Kalgoorlie, instead of entering the political arena, taken to the stage as a profession, he would have been the greatest Roman of them all. It seems to me honourable members opposite are prepared to condemn as a vice in the Liberal Government what they are ready to hail as a virtue under their own administration. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie had nothing to condemn in the position occupied by the honourable member for West Sydney when he was Attorney-General, and at the same time President of tSe Waterside Workers' Association. There was a position utterly untenable to one who realized that his duty to the community must come into conflict' with his position as president of a union whose members were violating the law. But we have no record of the honourable member for Kalgoorlie or his colleagues rising in their wrath and condemning in scathing tones the then Attorney-General for occupying these dual offices. It shows that where the administration of their own party was concerned, they were prepared to swallow twenty camels, but where the administration of the Liberal party is in question they will strain at the infinitesimal section of a gnat. The ex-Prime Minister considers that the programme of the present Government is only beating time. But the people of Australia are not so much concerned about the number of Bills passed; they are more concerned about the quality of the measures; and it is well that we should beat time, and that the country should have a few bars rest, in order to t r y to put into a workable condition some of the measures rushed through by the last Administration. Despite all the things said on the Opposition benches, we shall have an opportunity when we come back from the country to justify our position by the legislation we place on the statute-book. No doubt, Australia has a great and glorious destiny, but she will never realize it under class legislation. She will realize it only by legislation which conserves the interests of every man, woman, and child in the community, giving preference to none, but along those lines, there will be no fear for the future of Australia, and we shall hand down to our children a heritage of which they may be proud. If we are true to our great progenitors, true to the great traditions of the English-speaking people, we shall build up in this glorious land of ours a Greater Britain, a free, white, and united nation, famous for the liberty and justice of its laws and the contentment and prosperity of its people. would think, after listening to the oration of the honourable member, that the late Government did right in giving preference to unionists, because the honourable member said that, as an employer of labour, he had always employed unionists. He recognised, as an employer, that he got better work from unionists, but if i l is right for the private employer to have the best article, is it not equally right",27,Osborn J Fenwick
109,Mr Burns (Illawarra) [4.30],"On eior the Government to have that article? We have heard a great deal from members on the Government side of the House about misstatements and abuse from members of the Opposition, but I would carry the minds of honourable members back to the last election, and ask whether they did not read the statements and hear the utterances of their own party from different political platforms in abuse of the Labour party. organizers out in every district.

I claim that if the Liberals can move censure motions, it is equally right that the party to which I belong should have the same privilege. motion simply because the Government are going to t r y to bring about an alteration of the legislation passed by the Labour Government, though all that legislation has been placed on the statute book in the interests of the whole of the people of the Commonwealth.

Many of our fellows have taken their beatings in a really good spirit, and we have not heard the abuse that we heard during the recent campaign and a The Liberals had little after the elections, when we were told that defeated members of the Liberal party went down because there had been duplicate voting.

122,Mr Burns,"The party that passedto-day are the men who were in opposition to that proposition. All along the line, when the Labour party in Australia first advocated old-age pensions, the press said that it was all moonshine, that it was an absurdity, and was not within the realm of practical politics, but to-day we find that it is not only in the realm of practical politics, but has been placed on the statute-book, thanks to the agitation of the Labour party. I support the want of confidence motion because I am opposed to retrogression, and I am opposed to the proposals contained in the Prime Minister's manifesto. We are told that the Government are going to interfere with the maternity allowance and with old-age pensions, and we know that on the Government side are men who have always been opposed to the latter.

Mr. Wade, who did the greatest portion of the Liberal campaign work in New South Wales, in a speech at Manly, said that the increased cost of living was due to the Tariff barriers, and he advised the people that if they would remove those barriers the cost would be decreased. What stand will the Age take in regard to a statement of this kind? The party opposite is composed of Pree Traders, Single Taxers, Protectionists, and some who really do not know what they arefiscal atheists. The reason of the defeat of the Labour party at the last election is to be found in press misrepresentation. The people were told through the press that if the Labour party remained in power all their shops and small businesses would be nationalized, and we find newspapers like the Daily Telegraph and the Sydney Morning Herald resorting to such arguments. The Liberal party in New South Wales, however, were not sincere in supporting their Protectionist friends, and always preferred Pree Trade candidates. Mr Huie, the secretary of the Pree Trade and Land Taxawho was running as a candidate, said at Mr Huie said that he was asked some twelve months ago to stand for the Senate, but he did do so because he thought that it might not to do so unless both parlies put up Protectionists some electorate.

128,Gentlemen Mr Burns,"I shall tell the honorNew South Wales. When the last In dustrial B ill was brought forward in the State Parliament, there were demands that it should embrace all workers within its scope. We have heard it said by representatives of farming districts that there is scope enough in the State Acts to meet the case of the rural worker. The honourable member for Wannon, and others who are farming representatives, have declared they have no objection to the rural workers going to the State Courts to have their grievances remedied. ment would not give them a State Court. Minister for Labouri n the McGowen Government, he caused to be in serted in the schedule to the In dustrial DisputesB ill a clause bringing rural workers within its scope. Liberal party in the New South Wales Parliament, however, opposed that provision, and when the B ill went to the Legislative Council-the great citadel of the Liberal party-the clause was struck out. If honourable members opposite are sincere in their professions of goodwill towards unionism, they should exercise their influence with their Liberal friends in the Legislative Councils of the States. If they believe, as they say, that the States ought to make provision for the rura l workers fo secure a Wages Board, why do they not urge the State Parliaments to establish such tribunals? small f r y . If the Liberal party put up one of their big guns against me, I will reply. for the honourable member. is not even a pop-gun; he is only a political squib. able member must not use that expression. been trotted out during the present debate against the rural workers being allowed to go to the Conciliation and A r b i tration Court-the argument that legislation cannot be framed to meet their case without inflicting injustice on the farmers -wa s used in Great Britaini n 1830, when Lord Shaftesbury was endeavouring to secure the passing of factory legislation dealing with the question of child labour. It was said that if that legislation were passed it would. spell ruin to the factories of Great Britain. It was, however, eventually passed, and, instead of the industries of Great Britain being ruined, they have increased by leaps and bounds. We heard the same cry in the early days of our factory legislation in the State Parliaments. When the Labour party first proposed factory legislation and measures to provide for early closing and the creation of Wages Boards and A r b i tration Courts, they were told by our opponents that such legislation would bring ruin upon the country. I admire the honourable member for Werriwa because he is a straight-out opponent, and tells us that he is against all legislation of the kind to which I am referring. He has also told us that he believes in the right The of a man to refuse to work. When an honourable member tells us straight oub that he is our opponent, we can fight him fairly, knowing that he, too, will fight fairly in return. A f t e r stating that he believed in the right of men to refuse to work-to strike if they so desired-the honourable member proceeded to state that only 20 per cent, of the workers were organized; so that when he said that he believed in the right of men to strike, what he meant was that, in the event of the 20 per cent, of organized workers going out on strike, the remaining 80 per cent, of unorganized workers could be utilized to defeat them.

When he went to another mine and, giving his name, asked for employment, he was immediately told, ""There is no work here for you. You were an agitator in the mine where you last worked."" Many men who were treated in this way had to leave the district, and sought work elsewhere, only to meet with the same reception.

The miners, however, came to his help, and elected him their check weighman. He was also made the general secretary of their union, and he occupies to-day a seat in the Legislative Assembly of Western Australia. Many instances of the kind might readily be given. Let me come now to a more recent happening. W h y did the Brisbane tramway men go on strike?"" There was a Wages Board system in operation in Queensland, and the Brisbane tramway employees, in order that they might take advantage of it , desired to organize themselves into a union. A gentleman named Badger, who was manager of the company We have heard honourable member say ? When I first Badger, who was manager of the company, objected to the formation of the union, and every employee who took part in its formation, or accepted office in it , was immediately discharged. This went on for a number of months u n t i l independent men connected with other organizations formed the tramway employees into a union. Then Mr Badger insisted t l i a t no tramway man should wear a union badge while on duty. The men cited a case before the Queensland Wages Board,, but were denied the right to go before the Court. They then applied for registration under the Commonwealtli Conciliation and Arbitration Act , and their appli cation was opposed, not only hy the Brisbane Tramway Company, but by Mr. Denham, the Premier of Queensland, who had briefed counsel to assist Badgeri n fighting them. And these are the men who tell us to-day that they believe in trade unionism! The Brisbane tramway men at this time were not taking any political action. Politics were not within their realm. But they were told by Badger that they should not form themselves into a union. I am a believer in the settlement of industrial disputes by peaceful methods. These men had sought to avail themselves of the State Wages That Board system, but could not get before the Court, and when they endeavoured to obtain registration under the Federal Act, they had to fight not only Mr. Badger, but counsel briefed by the Premier of Queensland.

They did so, and all the other unions in Brisbane, in order to assist them, decided to "" down tools,"" and go out on strike with them. Nothing serious happened during that strike. The daily newspapers reported that the men were inarching up and down the public streets, on The march, however, was a peacef u l one. It was not that of an army with guns, bayonets, or swords, yet the Queensland Government, through Mr Denham, applied to the Prime Minister to despatch troops to Brisbane, and members of the Liberal party in this House, including the present Prime Minister, protested against the refusal of the Prime Minister to comply with that request. members of the Liberal party, but the newspapers of Australia protested against the stand taken by the present Leader of the Opposition, and urged that the Commonwealth Government was disloyal because it would not supply troops to shoot down harmless men, women, and children. sure on us. out the instructions of Mr Denham.

An y one who has to be compelled to join a union is hardly worth having as a union member. We have heard a great deal from honourable members opposite in favour of Wages Boards; but in 1902, when the railway men of Yictoria approached the State Ministry, of which the present Commonwealth Attorney-General was the head, asking for a Wages Board for the rectification of their wrongs, their request was denied; and because as a protest they decided to strike, the Ministry of the day passed a measure disfranchising them by giving them separate representation.

It was the first Act of the kind passed in Australia, and was afterwards withdrawn because the Labour party forced its withdrawal.

In 1907 I ,went to Charters Towers to organize the Associated Workers Union. A t that time the Electoral Act of the State provided for postal voting. There was an election in 1907, and in a double constituency for which fewer than 10,000 electors were on the roll, 1,600 postal votes were recorded. On that occasion the Labour candidates were defeated. In February, 1908, there was another election, and although the names on the roll numbered a little over 9,000, 2,730 postal votes were applied for; that is, nearly one-third of the electors enrolled applied for postal votes. standing, we were able to defeat our opponents by over 400 votes.

In the latter part of 1907 the Kidston Government was defeated, and the Philp Government succeeded. On the Governor dissolving Parliament, the Philp Government appointed twenty additional justices of the peace for the Charters Towers electoral district alone. gether. twenty justices of the peace was a Liberal. They were employed to collect postal votes. Most of them were mine managers. They went to the houses of the men working in the mines, and said to the wives, "" We have called to get you to make application for a postal vote."" If a woman said "" I do not wish to vote by post, because I am well enough to go to the p o l l , "" they replied, "" Y o u do not know how you wil l be on election day. The, best thing is to apply for a postal vote now."" If she signed the application, they took it away, and brought back a postal ballot-paper, getting her to fill it up for their candidate. Every ballot-paper so collected was posted from their offices to the Returning Officer, and after the election it was found that 130 out of 2,700 odd postal votes were missing. Where did they go? They were votes for the Labour candidate, and were destroyed. over the world has been fighting for the secrecy of the ballot, and it can be secured only by requiring electors to vote in the polling booths. I have every sympathy for those who are unable to go to the poll, and if any provision could be made to enable them to vote without destroying the secrecy of the ballot, I would agree to it ; but I am not willing to allow any justice of the peace, Labour or Liberal, to collect postal votes under coercion. It is a singular thing that after the elections of 1907 and 1908, over 1,000 men were discharged from the Charters Towers mines because their wives had the courage to refuse to make application for postal votes. The husbands of those who did that were invariably marked men. None of the men at Charters Towers were allowed to join a union, and any one seen speaking to me was a marked man.

It is said that there are 24,000 tenant farmers in New South Wales. are sincere in their arguments, and believe in freehold, why do they not give the tenant farmers the right to freehold ? If it is right for the State to grant freehold to its tenants, it is equally right that the Liberals, or landholders of this country, should grant the freehold to the men tilling the soil to-day. We have heard a great deal about election irregularities, and we have been told that duplicate voting took place all over Australia, in every electorate. A t the declaration of the poll in my electorate my opponent, to my surprise, referring to the conduct of the election, saidIrregularities of the grossest description have occurred throughout this constituency.

The Returning Officer, Mr Prott, and his deputy, Mr Cupitt, both said there was no truth in such a statement. These gentlemen have both been opposed to the Labour party for many years; but I have contested a good many elections in various parts of Australia, and I have not found two Officers of the ability and capacity of those two officials. They were both as fair as could be found anywhere in Australia. Prott is a very good man. equally good.

We are told that the Labour party are responsible for the tightness of the British money market, and that it is impossible for the State Governments to go to the money markets of the world, and under good conditions. market, but the local money market. Australia have invariably gone to the British money market for money they desire to borrow. Mr Watt, Premier of Victoria, who has just returned from the Old Country, speaking about the credit of Australia, saysIn England the recrudescence of the Balkans trouble had seriously affected the London money market. There was nothing from the advices which had come to him almost daily since he left London to lead him to believe that, the London money market was shut against Australia. We heard during, the election that it was utterly-impossible for any Australian Government to go to the London market and borrow money on the terms that were secured before the Labour party came into power, and we heard a great deal during the recent campaign about the high cost of living in this country being due to the Labour party's rule in Australia. But all over the world there has been an increase in the cost of living. The increase has been 33 per cent, in America from 1890 to the present time, and in Great Britain, while wages have risen in a few trades by 14 per cent., the cost of living has gone up in the same period by 17 per cent., so that the workers who received an increase of 14 per cent, in their wages are 3 per cent, worse off than before. In Germany and every Continental country we find an increase in the cost of living of from 15 to 17 per cent. There are no Labour parties in these countries; there is no Labour party in America, and in England there are only forty-two Labour members in the House of Commons. In Japan and in China, and in every country of the world, the cost of living is on the increase, and there are no Labour parties responsible for it. It is claimed that the higher wages paid have increased the cost of living. I was living in Tasmania for We should appoint men seven and a half years. If low wages mean cheap living, we ought to have We have heard a found in Tasmania conditions much better than in other places, but when the honourable member for Bass and Senator Long and I entered the Tasmanian Parliament, in 1903, we started to investigate the conditions under which the men, women, and children of Tasmania had to work, and we found those conditions of the most deplorable character. We found men working in Hobart receiving less than 30s. a week, and boot clickers and others working in the boot factories of Tasmania receiving 27s. 6d. a week. We found that bakers in the bread factories of Hobart were receiving the magnificent wage of 35s. and 36s. a week for a day of ten, twelve, and, in some cases, fourteen hours. Under such conditions it might naturally be assumed from the argument of our Liberal friends that cheap living would have been found, and that beef, boots, bread, and other commodities would have cost less than on the mainland. As a matter of fact, however, at that time the price of the 2-lb. loaf was 2Jtd. in Hobart, and it was the same in Sydney and Melbourne, where bakers were being paid £2 10s. a week. The argument of our friends opposite that low wages mean cheap living is altogether fallacious. When Senator Long and myself brought the subject up in the Tasmanian Parliament we were told by the members of the then State Government that we were exaggerating; and in order to prove the truth of our statements Senator Long, on a motion, secured the appointment of a Royal Commission to inquire into conditions and wages in Hobart and Launceston. That Commission consisted of Mr O'Reilly, who had been a Police Magistrate; Mr Payne, a member of the Liberal party, and Treasurer in the Tasmanian Government, together with Senator Long. The inquiry was an exhaustive one; but when Mr O'Reilly moved in the House that the report should be adopted and printed, the Premier moved, as an amendment, that, while the report be printed, the names therein contained should be deleted. Thusi t came about that when the report was published, not a name of any one, whether employer or employed, who had given evidence, appeared, each witness being represented by a number from number one upwards.

I admit that I aro not an authority; but I flunk that, if better sanitary arrangements were insisted upon in Sydney, it would be much more creditable to those concerned than the present quarantine. Age we find the followingSydney, Wednesday. Professor R. F. Irvine, of Sydney University, who was appointed a Royal Commission to inquire into the question of the housing of workmen, has presented his report to Parliament. This discloses a shocking state of affairs. The report states that many areas in Redfern, Surry Hills, Woolloomooloo, & c , are greatly overhoused. One block in Redfern, comprising three-quarters of an acre, has 37 houses, an average of nearly £0 per acre. In these places the housing conditions are as bad as they can be. "" Our worse residential areas-Redfern, Surry Hills, Woolloomooloo, Waterloo, & c "" he says, "" have all very similar characteristics. The land is usually divided into very small allotments. Frontages of 12 feet are quite common, and the greater part of the site is built upon. Front doors open on the street, the back yards are of the smallest. Yards6 feet by 12 feet and less are common. Tliese infinitesimal yards are also encumbered by privies, many of wood, often in a bad state of repair. Not only is there much defective housing, but there is in Sydney at present a great deal of overcrowding. "" One .three-story building in Surry Hills was found to contain seven families, and several of these had only one room in which they cooked, ate, and slept. In another cottage, with five small rooms and a kitchen, were living a mother and five children, ages five to sixteen, a married couple without children, a married couple with young children, and two male lodgers, fifteen in a l l . "" Unable to pay an increase in rent, or to find cheap houses in any other suburb, about 30 families from Surry_ Hills and Waterloo have ' squatted' on the hills near Long Bay. Here they have founded ' Eucalyptus Town,' the oddest collection of homes it is possible to imagine. It consists of huts hurriedly put together out of scraps of galvanized iron, kerosene tins, packing cases, sacking, &c. The roof on most of them is nearly flat, and just high enough to permit a man to stand upright. The floors are either rough cobblestone or plain earth. Very few of these gunyahs contain more than two rooms, and these are small. Their one good feature is the ventilation. The builders have not been able to exclude the air."" The commissioner recommends a General Housing and Town Planning Act on English lines, and an Act to provide for rural villages for city workers. The building code should provide for a minimum size of allotment and the extent to which it might be built upon. That part of Sydney referred to in the report is where the small-pox broke out, Mr Burns. and where most of the disease is to be found to-day. I charge the landlords of New South Wales, who let these hovels to the people, with the responsibility for the outbreak. The men who were agents for these places were organizers for the Liberal party. In this morning's party. After the general election of 1910 the around Sydney, explaining that the Labour party and the land tax were responsible for their action. A friend of mine who was a captain on a North Shore ferry boat, and had been living in the same house for thirty years, was told a little while ago that his rent was to be raised from 15s. to 22s. 6d. per week. When he asked the reason for this increase, he was told that the Labour party and the land tax were responsible for it . A few months later his landlord again increased his rent by 7s. 6d. per weekmaking a total increase of 100 per cent., due, as he explained, to the Labour party and the land tax. According to these men, the Labour party have much to answer for. Every crime in the calendar has been imputed to us. We were told during the last election campaign that we were responsible for the increase in rents as well as the increased cost of living generally, whilst one candidate actually said that the McGowen Government were responsible for all the burglaries that were taking place around Sydney. A t Kiama, a town in my electorate, a lady organizer armed with a note-book went from house to house making inquiries, as she explained, into the increased cost of living, and the reason for the increase. She asked at one house that she visited what the housewife was paying for sugar, butter, and so forth. Then she went on to say that since the Labour party had got into power the prices of various commodities had increased wonderfully. "" By the way,"" she added, ""What are you paying for eggs?"" The housewife looked at her and said, "" My good woman, surely you are not going to blame the Labour party because the fowls will not lay. I want to tell you that my husband works in one of the quarries here, and that, whilst it is true that the cost of living has increased, his wages at the same time have also gone up.

The tales told by this lady organizer in my electorate were told all over New South Wales, and, indeed, throughout Australia. many people were induced to vote for the Liberal party. Liberal party, in view of these tales, what they are going to do, now that they are in power, to decrease the cost of living. Mr Wade says that the Tariff barriers are responsible for the increase in the cost of living. for Wannon tells us that he is an uncompromising Protectionist, but Mr Wade says that commodities can be cheapened only by removing the Tariff barriers. vote to remove them? member for Werriwa is a Pree Trader, and he is consistent. he is not, and I hope that he will prove his consistency at the right time. I ask the Liberal party what they are going to do to give effect to the promise which they made to the people that they would reduce the cost of living. from the Prime Minister a statement of policy, but it gives no indication that anything is going to be done by the Government towards reducing that cost. In conclusion, I desire to say that I intend to vote for the amendment, which expresses want of confidence in the Ministry, and that I believe that the time is not f ar distant when the Labour party will again be in power. majority which I secured at the last election was the smallest obtained by any successful candidate-m y majority was only 106I am just as prepared as is any honourable member to face the music tomorrow-to go back to my constituents and to obtain a mandate from them-and I feel sure that, instead of having a majority of 106, I shall come back with a majority of 1,606. planation, I desire to point out that the honourable member for Illawarra was wrong in attributing to me a statement that only 20 per cent, of the workers were members of unions, and that I wished to keep out of such organizations the remaining 80 per cent. WhatI did say was that, whereas the wages of the men in the unions who could go to the Courts had been increased by only 20 per cent., the increase in the wages of those outside the Courts, who had to depend on private It was because of them that enterprise, amounted to over 50 per cent. We have asked the I propose in my opening remarks to deal briefly with the criticism which has been levelled at members of the Liberal party regarding the occupations which they follow. I well remember that in the first Parliament of the Commonwealth the relations of members on all sides of the House were exceedingly friendly. A l though we differed in politics, and in some cases differed very materially, we never heard a member of one party referring' to the occupations of his opponents. The honourable member for Ballarat more parW ill the honourable member ticularly emphasized this phase of the deThe honourable bate last night, referring to honourable members on this side of the House as land-owners, auctioneers, commission agents, and middlemen. He confessed I have yet to learn that that there might be in our ranks "" one farmer,"" and, if it be true that we have but one, I can only say, in reply, that the Labour party have in their ranks one doctor, so that on that score honours are easy. A f t e r all, our occupations are We have had a matter of no concern to any one. We are all returned by the electors, and as long as we are honourable men, and do our work honestly and faithfully, both in side and outside this chamber, we have a perfect right to expect the respect of our fellow members and the people generally. A man has every right to follow whatever occupation he pleases, and as long as he conducts himself decorously Although the he is entitled to the respect of all. When one of our honourable friends opposite visits a certain portion of Melbourne to collect his rents, no one can take exception to his action, as long as he makes his demands in a proper way. I know that rent collectors are often somewhat abrupt, but we have an honourable member opposite who can go from house to house, ring the door bell, and ask the person who answers it to "" Tell the good woman that the poor landlord is here."" ber is now doing what he deprecated in others but a moment or two ago.",39,Revealed Landlords Started To Raise Rents In And

205,Mr Charlton,"The honourable memthat the honourable member will find that I intend to be offensive, and I am sure that the honourable member for Darwin does not object to the reference I have made to him. Honourable members opposite complain that they have been relegated to the Opposition benches because of misrepresentation on the part of the organizers of the Liberal party and their candidates. The real reason is that, in 1910, they made to the farmers of Australia certain promises which they failed to fulfil. They told the farmers, for instance, that if they were returned to power there would be cheap land and cheap money. That promise was not kept. I remember that in the early eighties a section of a party of the British Parliament raised the election cry that if they were returned to power every man would have "" 3 acres and a cow."" That, no doubt, was a very tempting bait, and, when the party succeeded, one man, determined to be a little bit ahead of the others in obtaining his 3 acres, made an early call on the Inland Revenue Collector. Addressing him, he said, "" I have 2 acres of land, but John Smith has an acre of beautiful land alongside of me. I want to get it. Give me his acre of land and I shall then have three."" The officer replied, "" Y o u are too late, my man. Smith has been hare already, and has put in an application for your 2 acres, in order to increase his holding to 3 acres."" That man at once turned down the party, because he feared that he was going to lose the 2 acres that he held. illustrates the position of the farmer in Australia to-day. He has come to believe that the promises made or the alluredeal of travelling to do. I ascended ments held out by the Labour party were unsubstantial. As the result of certain legislation passed by the Labour party, he finds that money, instead of becoming cheaper, is dearer than it was, and that the price of land has not been reduced, as he was promised it would be. ber for Wannon said that it had been reduced. did. The gentleman whom I had the honour to defeat at the last general election was, lated by our opponents was that the last I know, a very popular member of this House, and I am glad to say that we fought our battle fairly. The contest was as fairly fought as was any in Australia. We never referred to one another personally on the platform; we were content to refer only to the different politics of the parties which we represented. I must me the same compliment-that the fight was perfectly fair, and the result of the elections proves only that Corangamite is a Liberal constituency. It should never have been captured by the Labour party, and I hope that it never will be captured again by it . During the campaign misrepresentations were made perhaps by both sides. But-what did the supporters of the Labour party say in my electorate. Mr Scullin was informed, and informed oh the best authority, he said, that the Liberal party was going to spend £25,000 to win back Corangamite. Corangamite has come back to the Liberal fold, but I did not see any of the £25,000, and I believe that the Liberal party spent less money there than in connection with any other election. Then we were informed that if the Liberals were returned to power old-age pensions would disappear. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie repeated the statement in this chamber. pensions would disappear, but that the old-age pension and the invalid-pension system were not safe in the hands of an Administration of which the honourable member for Flinders was a member. rection, and confine myself to saying that the statement was made in the country, This story especially in localities which the Liberal candidate was not likely to visit. A candidate for a country division has a great Spion Kop, spoke at Mafeking, and saw the road to Lady smith. Mafeking was a big mining centre where there are old men who do not care 2d. for either political party. The only question they had to ask was, "" If the Liberals are returned to power, will they do away with old-age pensions?""

That was a good programme to get the electors to believe had been carried out, but what are the facts? The fault I find with the Labour Government is that they created for the Commonwealth an immense liability by attempting to carry out too much at one time. How much is the transcontinental railway going to cost, and to how much is the country committed in connection with the building of the Federal Capital, the development of the Northern Territory, and the making of railways there? What shall we have to pay for land defence and the Fleet Unit? The liabilities which mately, £5,000,000 was spent on dehave been incurred are heavy enough to keep us down for some years to come. bilities ought not to have been undertaken ? ber, I suppose, would develop the Northern Territory with black labour? that subject presently. Replying to the question of the honourable member for Adelaide, I say that the least important of the undertakings I have mentioned is the building of the Federal Capital. said that we are not spending enough on the Federal Capital. little fad. I am saying what, in my opinion, is the least important of the undertakings to which we are committed. The most important is the development of the Northern Territory, which is more urgent than the transcontinental railway. The liabilities that have been imposed on the Commonwealth can never be met out of revenue, even in a number of years. We shall never have the money to spare for them, and must borrow. That is plain to all. But the honourable member for Wide Bay, in his Maryborough speech, gave no indication of how the necessary money was to be found. It was not the duty of the then Opposition to say how provision was to be made for these works. I have tried in vain to ascertain how the Labour party propose to find the money. If the undertakings that I have referred to are to be carried out within the lifetime of honourable members, money must be borrowed. To increase the land tax and to impose other taxation will not provide what is necessary. I quite approve of the defence scheme, and give the Labour party credit for what they have done in making military training compulsory. That, to my mind, is the only way in which we can provide for our defence. But the expenditure on defence must be very great, and, in addition, there are all these other undertakings. that the Commonwealth can raise will be swallowed up in a short time in defence expenditure. Last year, approxifence, and between £6,000,000 and £7,000,000 will be required this year, and the expenditure will continue to grow. We are under the obligation of seeing that the youths and young men whom we compel to submit to military training are provided with proper places for drilling in, and proper equipment. It was pointed out the other evening that they are now almost without overcoats, and have to pay for their own boots. Estimates for boots. fort to those who are now compelled to pay for their own boots. Our trainees should be properly equipped, and the equipment will be very costly. In my opinion, the area over which training is made compulsory is a little too wide. In the country districts, youths are required to walk a distance of 5 miles on Saturday afternoons to attend drill, which is rather much when they have been walking that distance each week-day to attend school. The Area Officers, I understand, have some discretion in this matter, and need not force children who live just about 5 miles away from the drilling centre to attend. I think that the distance is too far to require boys to travel. But having committed ourselves to this defence scheme, we must pay the piper, though I do not know how we are going to raise the necessary money. who has ever owned land is assailed, on addressing a public meeting, with interjections about land tax I have heard so many reasons given for the present",41,Revealed Landlords Started To Raise Rents In And

I suppose honourable members know that it was impossible at that period to find men to rent or buy one's land. In the early days of the dairying industry where could we get the people? Money could not be borrowed from the much-abused auctioneers, because they did not realize what the dairying industry would be, and the dairy-farmer could not get credit in any other way than from the owner of the land. What happened was that a If it was imposed to certain number of working men who had saved their money were able to start as tenant farmers, and a great number of those people who had families, and had the strength to do the work, were able to commence as share-farmers; from share-farmers they became tenant farmers, and from tenant farmers they became freehold farmers. I do not think that is such a bad record. Nearly every The honourable member for man on my property at Camperdown, which is the property referred to,' I suppose, was eventually in a position to buy I foresaw what the Labour the land. He was not very badly treated. Whatever estates I have had suitable for closer settlement I have endeavoured to use for that purpose. I have a property on the Richmond River, in New SouthI f honWales. Some honourable members representing New South Wales electorates might inform the New South Wales Government that if they are prepared to pay for the land they have already acquired I am prepared to go in for a honourable little more closer settlement. They have taken a long time to pay for the land they have already acquired; but as soon as that is paid for there will be another Honourable members opposite lot available. Some people are born under a lucky star. There was another property I agreed to subdivide and sell. I happened to be out of the country at the time, and I was afraid that those The honourable member for who were representing me would delay the sale a little too long, so I wrote and reminded them that the Federal elections were coming on, and that they had better hurry. They did hurry, and the sale took place exactly a fortnight before the honourable gentlemen opposite were returned to power. SoI do not think they can say that a land tax had very much to do with the position I have taken up regarding settling people on the land. On that aspect of the question we were perfectly square. Sitting suspended from 6.80 to 7'Jfi p.m. journment I was a little drawn off my remarks by interjections from honourable members opposite as to what I had to do with closer settlement in Victoria and New South Wales.

In my case, and in the case of the land I referred to in the Western District of Victoria and that rich portion of New South Walesi n the electorate of the honourable member for Richmond, the Federal land tax does not affect the property owners at all, because they all have land suitable for subdivision, which they can sell. What the Federal land tax does affect is the land in the western portion of New South Wales that is unfit for closer settlement, for which the owners have paid, practically, £ 1 per acre, but which is not saleable to-day at that price. The tax does not hit the people in the settled districts of Australia, especially in that portion of Victoria that I represent, and which, despite the boasts of the honourable members for Queensland as to their Darling Downs, is the garden of Australia. does hit those who are on poor land fit only for running sheep, and it takes out of the pockets of the owners of this land so much of their spending power which formerly had been applied to improving their properties in the way of ring-barking, and such like, involving the employment of labour. If we take a certain amount of money out of a man's pocket we stop his spending power straight away. Under the land tax the Federal Government have had that money, but the men have not had the employment, and they will not be able to get that employment unti l some adjustment takes place by which these people can be r i d of this class of legislation. In regard to the imposition of the tax for defence purposes, our friends opposite have told the people that the only thing which is to suffer special taxation for defence purposesand the only thing in Australia worth defending-is the land. there are other things in Australia worth defending, and which the people are prepared to defend, and if this expenditure is to go on increasing, as it must, for defence purposes, we shall have to look to something else besides the land to provide the money. As to the Northern Territory, which honourable members opposite seem so intent on hearing me upon, it has been circulated throughout Australia that I favour black labour for the Northern Territory-that I approve of black labour altogether for the work in that The two arguments Territory. I have never said anything of the kind. I have never allowed any one to believe that I do favour black labour. I believe in a White Australia. I have believed in it from the first time. I entered Parliament. I voted for the abolition of Kanaka labour in Queensland, but I said that the mistake was that a great injustice had been done to the Kanakas by allowing them to believe that they were to be permitted to live in Australia. If it is ever found necessary again to bring in any form of black labour we must see that we do not commit the errors of the past. I believe that white labour can do the work required in the Northern Territory. The white man can work where the black man can work. But I put in this safeguard, that if it is found that white men cannot work in the Northern Territory during the developmental stages or on certain work, and it is found necesThe tax sary to bring in black labour, that labour must be brought in under the strictest conditions possible, and must be sent away as soon as the work is finished. the question. have given a straight answer. The honourable member may take up the attitude that he does not care whether the Northern Territory is developed. I have read a report from the Health authorities at Port Darwin, and, if it is true, something will need to be done for the drainage of that port. We must not make a farce of the development of the Northern Territory. If Port Darwin has to be sewered, and if channelling has to be put down, or if it is impossible for white labour to do it , and black labour has to be brought in , I favour it being brought in under the strictest conditions, so that it will do no harm. Those opposed to me But I maintain in my electorate, and honourable members opposite, have talked of the purity of the race. Is there no black population in the Northern Territory? There are blacks there now, and altogether apart from the aborigines, the coloured population is about the same as last year. There would be no great danger if such a thing as I suggest took place, yet I do not see that it will ever be necessary, because the Australian coming from the southern portions of the continent w ill be able to work in",43,Revealed Landlords Started To Raise Rents In And

That is how that particular point came in. The development of the Northern Territory is a most important matter. But how are we to do it? the present railway down a few miles each year out of revenue? are to develop the Northern Territory, we must go in for loan expenditure on that railway, and we shall then get back a great deal of our money. We should not develop the Territory only by a railway running from north to south. That will not do a great amount of good: We must connect with the Queensland, and, perhaps, the New South Wales system. It will mean a big expenditure, but it will pay us. We have to be watchful. The Northern Territory still has to be developed, and if that development does not take place within a certain period others may step in ; and then where will be our White Australia? teeming millions to the north of us; and if any of those great Asiatic Powers which are awakening in the East come down with their fleets, our Australian Navy will, I am afraid, disappear in a very short time. honourable member for Darling produced a balance-sheet connected with the Australian Workers Union, and I understood from him that the subscription the members had to pay is 20s. per year. subscription has been 20s.; previously a majority paid only 5s. creasing, and I should like to know whether that is the only charge the members have to pay. levies of any kind to pay? few levies during the existence of the union.

If the idea had been to raise all the sheds to a fair price, I should have said nothing; but it was at the better sheds that the men were ordered to strike.

Even allowing that there were twenty or thirty irregularities, is it fair that all sick and aged persons should be disfranchised? There are many people, who, from various causes, are confined to the house, and there are others who live great distances from a polling booth; and the postal vote ought to be retained for the use of people so circumstanced. In the southern portion of my electorate the distances are great, and the roads very bad.

That is a fairly large proposition. I think it would b'e better to ascertain where the money is to come from before such a development is proposed.

Isi t fair , when a man is prepared to part with his land The Labour at a reasonable rate, that he should suddenly get notice that it is to be compulsorily resumed, and that that notice should be followed almost immediately by the appearance on his land of a gang of workmen, who proceed to do with it exactly as they please? Every owner of Q u it e big enough. land required for Commonwealth purposes, whether that owner be a corporation or a private individual, should be treated fairly , and when portion of a paddock is resumed, it should be fenced off from the rest. The Government send out men with certain orders, and they begin to think that they are little gods. They do not hesitate to tell the occupier of the land that has been resumed that he must get off. Is that reasonable ? Two cases of the kind haveoccurred in my electorate. In each the owner was prepared to deal with the Department, and to sell at a reasonable price. In one instance, however, notice of resumption was served on the owner, and was followed by the appearance of a gang of men, who proceeded to build mounds for rifle butts on the land, and ordered off the tenant. In all, 10 acres out of a holding of 55 acres were acquired for this purpose, and before the Department had erected a dividing fence, it instructed the owner to clear out. Such proceedings must involve the Commonwealth in considerable expenditure, for the owner must be entitled to compensation. I had some trouble over this matter before the present Government took office. The matter has been going on for over",47,Revealed Landlords Started To Raise Rents In And

If u l l y appreciate the compliment that has been paid me by the electors of that constituency, and recognise the importance of the work of this Legislature. The National Parliament has a great future, and a work that must continue to increase. I wish at the outset to reply to a few statements made by the honourable member for Corangamite, who declared that the object for which the land tax had been im posed by the Labour namely, the breaking up of large estates, had not been accomplished. He went on to prove, however, to the satisfaction of all who listened to him, that the tax had actually succeeded in the desired direction, since he stated that, believing that the Labour party would be successful i u their appeal to the electors in 1910, and, in that event, would impose a land tax, he had cut up his large estates, and sold them, so that he would not be brought under the operation of the Land TaxA c t . He proved conclusively that so far as he, a large land-owner, was concerned, the land tax had been absolutely effective in bringing about the cutting up of big estates. The revenue from the land tax has amounted to £4,500,000. According to the honourable member for Werriwa, about £50,000 has been collected under its absentee provisions. The honourable gentleman went on to say that he believed that those provisions had caused something like £50,000,000 of capital to be withdrawn from Australia. He did not explain how that capital had been taken away, but he stated that he considered the absentee taxation most unjust. have found, however, by visiting the rura l parts of Victoria, that no legislative act of the Labour party has met with more approval by the people than the taxation of absentee land-owners. The intention of these provision's was this: Some of the best lands in the country were, and are, held by persons residing in other parts of the. world, and these lands are continually improving in value because of the energy and enterprise of our people. It wasth'ought that we were quite justified inmaking the land-owners who benefited in this way contribute something towardsthe cost of the Australian institutionswhich increased their wealth. The honourable member for Werriwa referred also to the Navigation Act passed by tha Labour party. He said that although a t the last election we condemned combines, we had passed an Act to assist the Australian shipping combine by practically' excluding from the Australian coastal trade all deep-sea vessels. What are thefacts? On both sides of the chamber aremen who believe in protecting native industries. We believe in protecting the iron trade, the sugar industry, and many other industries, and the provisions to which the honourable member referred protect the shipping industry, which is Government, thus protected for the first time in o u r history. In future, all vessels entering ourcoastal trade must observe Australian industrial conditions. We hold that that isr only fair. There was no intention to give greater power to the Australian shipping combine. But we know that of late years British and foreign shipping has cut deeply into the Australian coastal trade.. A t one time the mail steamers carried, coastal passengers only between Fremantle and Sydney, the latter being theirterminal port. But of recent years, they have been going as far as Brisbane and Auckland. These extensions have greatlyaffected the business of the Australian shipping companies, on whose vesselsevery one, from the skipper to the brassboy, is being paid and worked in accordance with conditions laid down by Australian or New Zealand logs. The Australian fireman receives £ 1 0 a month,, whereas the Peninsular and Oriental Company's fireman just before theNavigation B ill was passed, received, only £ 4 a month. The Australian deck hand gets £ 8 a month, and the British deck hand about £ 3 5s. I a month, with similar differences in a l l , ratings. It seems only fair that when weplace restrictions on employers, compelling them to pay certain rates of wages and observe certain conditions, we should protect them from the competition of other employers whom we cannot com-pel to pay these rates and observe these conditions.

284,Mr Hannan (Fawkner) [8.23],"Ithe provisions in the Navigation Aot. The Labour party has set a good example by protecting the shipping industry from the unfair competition of British and foreign companies, whose vessels trade on our coast. I come now to a subject which has been greatly discussed during the unionism. It is objected by honourable members opposite that the trade unions of to-day differ from what they call the genuine trade unions that existed prior to the 1890 strike, after which political unionism sprang into existence. Honourable members opposite say that they heartily support the old genuine trade unionism, but are bitterly opposed to the political unionism of to-day. They say that it is not right that the members of unions should contribute to political funds. Prior to the 1890 strike, those connected with the industrial movement followed the lines laid down by their parents. Our parents, when they came from the Old Country, brought with them the British trade unionism, and the lines they laid down were followed u n t i l the great maritime strike occurred. showed that something was wrong with the industrial movement, and that the weakness was lack of political action. From that time until the present day, trade unionism has been altering greatly. In my view, no union is a true one that does not donate something to the maintenance of the political labour movement of Australia. We are told that it is wrong for the workers to contribute towards the political movement, and it might be believed, from what has been said by our opponents, that their organizations make no provision for the collection of funds for political work. following letter proves that that is not soNos. io and n , third floor, Equitable Buildings, Collins-street, Melbourne, May 5th, 1913.

Both the Age and the Argus, during the last election campaign, every morning tried to convince the electors that all social and industrial legislation placed on the statutebooks of Australia in the National or State Parliaments had been passed by Liberal Governments. that the social and industrial legislation passed by the Victorian Parliament has been passed by Labour Governments, because, so far, Labour has not had the honour of sitting oc the Treasury bench in the Victorian State Parliament; but the Labour movement commenced in Victoria prior to 1890, and I ask honourable members to look back and find from what date the whole of the social and industrial legislation of Victoria starts. There was not one measure of social or industrial legislation passed by the State Parliament of Victoria unti l the political Labour movement came into existence. that is right. our movement who bore the brunt of this fight were told that they were extremists; they were told by the business people, "" Immediately you compel us to comply with certain laws, and compel us to close our shops at a certain hour and pay higher wages, and immediately you commence to regulate the hours of our workmen, the whole of our business system will f a l l down, aud ruin w ill fall on every man."" However, the men connected with the Labour movement in Victoria continued their form of agitation and education, while their comrades were doing the same in other States, u n t i l they brought the people of this State to a certain standard of education in this matter; and when those who were always opposed to Labour saw that industrial legislation was becoming popular in Australia, they said, "" We will give it to y o u . "" Without the Labour party, the possibilities are that not one form of industrial or social legislation now in operation in Australia would have been enacted. These measures were advocated by the Labour party, they were made popular by the Labour party, and our opponents recognise that it was a matter of either giving way, and adopting this legislation, or going into political oblivion. They came forward and passed it. Yet we were told by the Age and the Argus that all this legislation was due to the Liberal party. Liberal Governments only passed this legislation when public opinion educated by this Labour movement compelled them to pass it . As it was in Victoria, so it was in other States of Australia. I cannot claim Factories Act in South Australia u n t i l long after 1890. commenced, we have heard expressions from both sides of the House as to an early appeal to the people. I would not shirk that appeal. It would be in the best interests of the whole community, and one question will overshadow all others, namely, the alteration of the Constitution under which this Parliament is working. We are told that the question of the referenda will be altogether beyond consideration, but I say that it is still as live a question as it was at the last election; because if the Labour candidates in any other State. are returned in a majority, it means that I do not thin k within three years questions for the alteration of the Constitution will be reThe older men in submitted to the electors, whereas if our opponents come back in a majority, probably there will be no appeal to the people for au alteration to the Constitution so long as they remain in power. As one who has for a considerable time taken an interest in the industrial movement, I believe that we shall require nothing else but the one plank of the alteration of the Constitution, in order to appeal successf u l l y to the people. During the debates in the last Parliament with reference to submitting the referenda to the people, honourable members, according to Hansard, told the supporters of the Fisher Government that the proposals of 1911 had been rejected by such a large majority that it should be sufficient to show that the people of Australia did not desire these questions to be re-submitted, but, as a matter of fact, the majority of nearly a quarter of a million votes against in 1911 was reduced on one of the questions to practically an 8,000 majority against in 1913. If we do go to the country again, the principal question upon which members of the Labour party should appeal should be that they may be returned with a majority, so that in three years' time, questions for alteration of the Constitution may be again submitted to the people of Australia.

Every morning there was a column article in the Age or the Argus appealing to the electors of Corangamite on behalf of Mr Manifold. The same thing applied in connection with the elections for In d i and Wannon, and right through the State. seats in the metropolitan area were picked out for special attention, and special consideration was devoted to those standing in the Liberal cause. What was the position of the Labour men'? lets carried all over the country. a pamphlet, and the difficulty was to get it distributed. In every home, every morning for eight weeks prior to the election, the Age or Argus gave a thousand reasons why the people should vote for the Liberal party, and ten thousand reasons why they should vote against the Labour candidates. And what applied in ""Victoria applied to the other States. have a Labour press. papers in Adelaide and Brisbane, and in both States we were successful, but other States, and there we were unsuccessful. Wherever the Labour party have a newspaper in circulation showing the case for Labour, we have met with success. In Victoria are two newspapers, one with a circulation of over 100,000, and the other with a circulation of about 80,000; so that practically 200,000 copies of printed matter were sent into the homes of the people of Victoria for three months prior to the election, showing reasons why the electors should vote for the Liberal party, and containing misstatements in regard to the action of the Labour Ministry during their term of office, and also in regard to men who have never previously .had a seat in Parliament. As a matter of fact, the Age drew up a platform for me, and said to the electors of Fawkner that those who desired a policy of ' ' gag the press, bully the manufacturer, and hound the non-unionist off the face of the earth,"" should vote for me. Now, that is not the policy of my party, and 1 take the opportunity to say that I have never tried to ' ' gag the press ' ' or "" bully a manufacturer,"" and at no time in my life have 1 ever endeavoured to "" hound a non-unionist off the face of the earth."" The tactics adopted towards myself were adopted towards every Labour candidate in the State; and yet the present Government are proposing to remove certain restrictions which the Labour Government placed on the press. Only the other day the honourable member for Two or three Henty uttered an interjection in favour of the Government proposals, and later he asked why the TradesH a l l in Melbourne had expelled the Melbourne Age representative from its chamber. Let me tell the honourable member for Henty that the TradesH a l l Council expelled the Age representative because of unfair and unscrupulous attacks made on honourable men, who are members of the Council, during the last Federal election. And I may add that the TradesH a l l Council only did what the honourable member for Henty, as a member of the State Parliament of Victoria, urged that the Legislative Assembly should do to the representative of the same paper in 1906. He then said that he would call the attention of the Speaker to the fact that there were In some States you strangers in the gallery, with the object of having the representatives of that paper Yes ; we have daily removed from the precincts of the House. Then, again, on 6th October, 1904, Mr. Watt, the present Premier of Victoria, we had not daily papers in made an explanation in regard to an attack made upon him by the Age, and he was followed by the present honourable member for Henty, who saidA l l I have to say in connection with attacks of this kind is that we should adopt the French method, and make the writer of the article put his name to it. The words of MrW a t t wereSurely we give the press sufficient liberty in this country without allowing them to deliberately attempt to blast the reputation of a man, and lower any prestige he may have obtained in the country. I take the opportunity of deliberately branding every one of -these statements and insinuations as infamous falsehoods.

That is the opinion held by the Labour party, but the distine tion between the Liberal party in the State and the Commonwealth Labour party is that, while the former never had 'the courage to carry their desires into -effect, the Labour party, immediately 'they got the opportunity, pursued their usual policy of translating their words into deeds. opposite during the recent elections been 'as unfairly attacked as were members of the Labour party, and had the Labour 'party come back victorious, those honourable members would have been the first to remind us that there was nothing in our victory to feel proud of. Eveni f the Liberal party have come back with a majority of one, it is the opinion of the majority women outside, who are not too strictly attached to any party, that, in view of the difficulties that were presented, the Labour party have achieved a moral victory. Had the Labour party had ""one-half the support enjoyed by the 'Liberal party, or had we had the advantage of Labour daily newspapers in Victoria and in New South Wales, I have not the slightest doubt that the Liberals would to-day have been in a sad minority. Corangamite has referred to the attitude of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports towards Protection. The honourable member for Corangamite has evidently adopted the arguments put before the people by the A y e ; but I remind honourable members that the Leader of the Opposition, in his policy speech at Maryborough, put the position of his party quite plainly. He said that the Labour party in 1910 were pledged to new Protection, and that, if they were returned, he would take the earliest opportunity of submitting certain questions to the people, with a view to an alteration of the Constitution; that if those questions were answered in the affirmative, and the Constitution was altered, the Labour Government would give effect to the new Protection policy. were returned, and, true to the pledge, the questions were submitted, but, unfortunately, were not answered in the affirmative. The defeat meant that the Labour party could not give effect to their promise in regard to new Protection, and the hands of the Government during their term of office were practically tied in this lot of breaking away on both sides. connection. On the occasion of the last election the Age declared that the Leader of the Opposition, and the members of the Labour party, had betrayed their pledge-that the Leader of the Opposition had pledged his party to give a measure of effective Protection during the Parliament of 1910. As a matter of fact, no such pledge was given; the pledge was Had honourable members for new Protection, which, as I have shown, depended on an alteration of the Constitution. If new Protection, or effective Protection, was not given to the people by the Labour Government, the fault does not lie with the Labour party, but with the people for rejecting the referenda in 1911. During the election of 1913, the Leader of the Opposition, speaking at Maryborough, laid great stress on of fair-thinking men and the necessity for an alteration of the Constitution, and he again pledged his Government and party to give new Protection in the event of an alteration being made. Further, he said that, should the proposal for an alteration of the Constitution be defeated, his Government would pledge themselves to give effective Protection to the manufacturing industries of Australia. That was a clear and definite promise; but the newspapers here questioned the sincerity of the proposal. I The honourable member for am prepared to believe, and I think the majority of the people are prepared to believe, that the promise then given by our worthy leader from the public platform would undoubtedly have been carried into effect had the opportunity presented itself. able member for Melbourne Ports? been told by honourable members opposite, and by others outside, on the public platform, that members of the Labour party have not the right of freedom of speech, and cannot express an opinion different from that of their fellows. We now see, however, thatwhile the leader of the Labour party gave a pledge to the people of Australia, one of his followers declared that he did not feel The Labour party bound by it , because it was not provided for in the platform of the party. That goes to show that there is just as much freedom allowed members of the Labour party as is allowed to the members of the Liberal party. comes up for consideration we shall see a",52,Constitutional Unio N Committee

I am sure that if the Tariff -be submitted to this Parliament its revision on sound Protective lines will be made possible only by the support of -honourable members on this side of the House. I think that I am expressing, not -only my own view but that of the great majority of our party and those who support us, when I say' that a Protective policy is essential in this country. The public man who, on the one hand, will advocate the passing of industrial legislation, imposing upon our manufacturers restrictions in regard to hours of labour and rates of pay, while at the same time he is prepared to allow the products of -cheap labour in other countries to come in here without restriction, occupies a very inconsistent position. passed industrial legislation declaring that and consequently there is also depression regulations shall be framed in regard to wages and conditions of labour, although, unfortunately, the industrial tribunal which has the making of those regulations has not sumcient power at the present time, and we should be courting almost industrial suicide if , whilst imposing restricof our opponents will say, "" This is antions with regard to wages and hours of labour, we were at the same time to allow the sweated products of other countries to come in here to compete with goods manufactured in accordance with our industrial laws. In the circumstances, therefore, I hope that this Parliament will reand fostering it . vise the Tariff. Some honourable members opposite have sought to impress upon us the idea that the primary industries of Australia are alone worthy of our attention. that no country in modern history has become great as the result of its primary industries alone. Of recent years it has been the desire of all progressive countries, by every means at their disposal, to encourage and foster their manufacturing industries. It is almost a scandal that, despite our boasted progress, the total tonnage of ships built in Australia last year was only about 3,000 tons. That tonnage was made up of small motor boats I beand ferry steamers, buil t almost entirely in New South Wales. Recently the In darra, a vessel of 10,000 tons, intended for the coastal trade, arrived here, and she will be followed next week by the Katoomba, another vessel of 10,000 tons, which has just been built for Messrs. Mcllwraith , McEacharn and Company. Both these vessels were built abroad. Japan, Russia, and almost every great country that we can name, believe in building their own vessels for their own trade. Yet the state of the ship-building industry in Victoria is such that recently, when a small steamer was required to ply between Port Melbourne and W i l liamstown, it had to be constructed in New South Wales. There is a great work in this connection before our party. There is no possibility of private enterprise in Victoria at present entering into the shipbuilding industry, which, it must be recognised, is the most important that could be established and fostered. The ship-building industry in Germany and England is slack to-day, with the result that depression practically rules from one end of the country to the other. The shipWe have building trade in Scotland is also slack, there, for the reason that so many thousands have to depend upon the industry. I have little hope of private enterprise undertaking in this country what is really a great national industry. The work is one for the National Parliament. Some other stride towards Socialism."" They may call it what they please, but I contend that as long as this industry will bring employment and prosperity to our people, the National Parliament should undertake the responsibility of creating The Commonwealth Parliament should take up the industry, and give it every possible protection. The same remark will apply to many other industries. I shall not go so far as -to I would point out, however, say that whatever depression may obtain in Melbourne to-day is due entirely to the lack of Protection. I believe many of our industries are f u l l y protected, but there are others which could well receive more assistance through the Customs House. A revision of the Tariff, in the circumstances, is necessary, and I trust there will be no delay in entering upon that work. In Victoria to-day, unfortunately, we are faced with an unemployed problem. We have, at a low estimate, from",53,Constitutional Unio N Committee
302,Mr Hannan,"Perhaps so.5,000 to 6,000 unemployed in this State, and these are practically to be found within the metropolitan area. I shall not say that they are all out of work because of ineffective Protection, but I think that much of this want of work is due to the irresponsible system of immigration which the State Government is conducting. There are certain times of the year when a number of people could be brought to Australia and absorbed by the labour market, but there are other times when to bring people here is merely to dump them among the unemployed. That is what is going on at present. Mr Watt, Premier of Victoria, speaking at a function recently, said he recognised that it was the duty of his Government to find employment for every immigrant brought to Victoria, and that it was also the duty of his Government to find employment for our own people. But what is taking place in Victoria to-day? I m migrants arrive here with letters of introduction, many of our own people are being forced out of employment, and just as they are forced out of employment, immigrants take their places. The State Government have taken upon themselves the responsibility of finding work for these people, and they know that while they are doing so they are in many in stances actually crushing the native-born out of work. The system of immigration in operation to-day is most unfair. one. that this Government will not assist the State Governments at this juncture, at least, to bring more of these people here under the existing conditions. The present system is unfair to our own people, and unfair to the new arrival. It must be very disheartening to those who come here-havin g been induced to come by the glowing pictures put before them of a land flowing with milk and honeyonly to find that they cannot obtain work. The State Government finds it impossible to-day to secure employment for all the immigrants, and many are amongst our unemployed. Those connected with our movement have been charged with hostility to immigrants. That cannot be said of me. The majority of the immigrants coming here are men and women of spirit. Indeed, men and women must have some spirit to be prepared to cut their home ties and to travel 15,000 or 16,000 miles to another land to make a new home for themselves. There must be something in the man or the woman who will undertake the journey, and the risk attaching to it . Therefore, I personally-and I think I am expressing the feeling of all in our movement-have , no hostile feeling towards new arrivals. As a trade union official, almost every day I have been interviewed by these people seeking employment, and in many cases even asking for financial assistance. This is our experience at the TradesH a l l day after day. ployment, is there not? to 6,000 unemployed persons in the Victorian metropolitan area to-day. years of Labour Government! or sixty years of Liberal Government, there were from 35,000 to 40,000 unemployed in Australia. My honourable friend may think that an exaggeration, but I lived in both Sydney and Melbourne at the time, and know that there were soup kitchens in every suburb of both cities to give relief. The poverty and unemployment then existing in every State of Australia was not less severe than in any part of the Old World. Moreover, there are more unemployed in Victoria to-day, where the State has a It is a very foolish Liberal Government, than there are in New South Wales or Western Australia, It is, and I hope where Labour Governments are in power. The Pisher Government was in no way responsible for the unemployment of which I speak. The legislation which it passed will for all time redound to its credit, and to that of every man and woman connected with the Labour movement. The honourable member for Werriwa yesterday spoke against the Commonwealth note issue; bnt let me read what was said on that subject by Sir Josiah Symon, speaking at Adelaide on the 25th A p r i l last.

But this is the opinion that he expressed last yearI read from a report published in the Age on the 16th March, 1912With regard to the referendum questions to be re-submitted next year, he still held the opinion that the Commonwealth would yet have to seek larger powers over trade and commerce. It would be necessary, if the Federal Parliawith them is that which has been advoment was to achieve the purposes of a National Parliament, to acquire more control over trade and injurious monopolies where they arose. The honourable member then considered that it would be necessary to have an alteration of the Constitution to deal with combines and monopolies as they arose. I admit'that he did not say that we have combines and monopolies in operation here to-day. That was the contention of the Labour party, however, when it went to the country. when Crown Solicitor, was appointed to ascertain whether there were trusts and combines in existence, and he reported that there were not. are combines operating here, but that it was useless to prosecute them under the existing laws. The Labour party held But I would not have introduced the existing laws to be ineffective for the suppression of combines and trusts. We believed that an improper combination existed in the Coal Vend and Shipping Combine. Mr Justice Isaacs held that opinion, too; but, fortunately or unfortunatelyI do not know which-the Privy Council, on appeal, decided that the combination was not detrimental to the Australian public. I What would have been the position had the Privy Council upheld Mr Justice Isaacs? The people of Australia would have found themselves situated similarly to the people of the United States of I wish now America. There the huge trusts are prosecuted and penalties inflicted; but, no matter how huge the fines, they are paid, and the trusts get the money back by charging increased prices for the goods Since this Parliament met, whose sale they control. H ad the late Attorney-General successfully prosecuted the combines to which I refer, and obtained a conviction, no satisfactory result He has also tried to k ill would have followed. Suppose that a conviction were obtained against the Sugar Combine, what would happen? It would pay a fine of £10,000, or £15,000, and call upon the public to make good the amount by paying the grocers higher prices for sugar. combines is to sweep away the Tariff that creates them. cated by the Labour party.

We were told that thc Labour Government had practically appointed pickets, and had refused to assist the Statesi n maintaining law and order when indust r i a l strife actually existed. instance the press placed the whole of the responsibility on the members of the Labour Government and their followers in the National Parliament. inductrial unions have the greatest respect for those who represent them in Parliament, and for their opinions, and honour them for the positions they hold, but those responsible for the management of our industrial movement do not allow members of Parliament to dictate to them what their industrial policy should be. The members of the Fisher Administration were no more responsible for the industrial strife that took place during their term of office than was the Leader of the Opposition at that time; in fact, they were less responsible, because if they had had the power to pass the industrial legislation advocated by us as a party, industrial strikes would be a thing of the past in Australia. What has taken place in Australia is not strange to other parts of the world. The upheaval that has taken place )*n England during the last two years-and it has occurred in other parts of Europehas its cause in the fact that the schoolmaster has been abroad. In the hearts of the working men of all parts of the world is a desire to live in something like common decency. That sentiment is abroad, not only in Australia, but in every part of the civilized world, and workers are not prepared to live in hovels, as they were prepared to do some years ago. Just as they have become educated, and just as they have realized how others live, so does the desire come into their hearts to live somewhat similarly, and as long as that desire grows stronger, so will their agitation become stronger. If those people cannot, by constitutional means, obtain the economic justice they are asking for, they w ill go on strike. I was told even in my electorate that the On every workmen of this country go on strike and bring misery and hardship on their wives and children without giving any consideration to them; and that was also said in the press of Victoria. The working men of Australia, or of Britain, do not go on strike to bring misery and hardship on their wives and children. The desire of men in going on strike is, in 99 cases out of 100, to get increased wages, which mean a greater degree of comfort and happiness for themselves and their families. We are told that the Labour party is responsible for the indusI n every trial strife in our land.to-day. But the Labour party, on the political side of the movement, is not responsible. From the inception of the movement we have tried Members of to place on the statute-books of the States and the National Parliament industrial legislation that will give to the worker justice without asking him to make the great sacrifice of going on strike. We say that it is unjust and unfair that workers should have to strike-to cease work-to obtain reasonable wages and conditions; that it is unfair that they should be asked to make this sacrifice. U p to the present we have been denied the right of placing on the statute-book of this State industrial legislation of the k in d ; and by whom has the right been denied ? By members sitting on that side of the House, who have withheld from this Parliament the Constitutional power to give effect to such legislation. It is the supporters of honourable members opposite in our Legislative Council who have placed every difficulty in the way. We brought into existence an effective system of Wages Boards. A t the dictation of the Employers' Federation of Victoria that system was wrecked, and there was constituted an Appeal Court, which is responsible for a strike in Victoria to-day. When a Wages Board gave the men an award of fortyeight hours, the employers appealed, and the working time was increased to fiftyfour hours. A Wages Board awarded men 48s. a week, but, when the employers appealed, the wage was reduced to 36s.

I u that State, in 1911-12, there was a reduction of 140,725 acres in the area under crop; in South Australia, there was an increase of 219,000 acres; in Western Australia, an increase of 217,000; and in Tasmania, a decrease of 16,900 acres. Thusi n three of the States of the Union there was a decrease of 469,000 acres, compared with the area under cultivation in the preceding year. able member obtain his figures? MrM c WILLIAMS them from Knibbs, and they are the latest available. One of the points made by Mr Bavin, the New South Wales Commissioner on the H i g h Cost of L i v ing, was that there was not in respect of production in Australia the same increase that there was in the aggregate population. A f t e r 125 years of cultivation in Australia-becaus e it is 125 years since Captain Phillips first used the plough in Australia-w e find that in New South Wales there is only one acre out of fifty-five under cultivation; in Victoria one out of fifteen; in South Australia one out of eighty-two; in Queensland one out of 815; in Western Australia one out of 582; and in Tasmania one out of sixtytwo; tory there is only one out of every 894 acres. Only1 per cent, of the acreage of Australia is under crop. Honourable members can see that if the duties on imports are high, whether they be protective or revenue duties, and there is a decrease in the area under cultivation, with the large growth of population in the cities, the cost of living must increase. It is to play with the question to suggest that by increasing the protectiveTariff the cost of living will be decreased. W ill the honourable member for Batman say on what goods we could increase duties without interfering with the cost of living? There has been a good deal of talk during the debate about the sugar question, and the statements we haveheard conflict so much, that I have beer* unable yet to master the details; but it seems to me that a considerable sum of money has been given to the Colonial' Sugar Refining Company', temporarily, I hope. Whoever may be to blame, I trust that the Government will take early steps to protect the revenue. The sugar question will have to be faced by Parliament No , I spoke of sooner or later. Wheni n Queensland' twelve months ago, I suggested that a committee of five cane-growers should' visit Sydney, and there confer with a committee of five persons interested in theconfectionery and jam trades, with a view to devising means for removing the present heavy handicap on the fruit-growing, industry without, if possible, in j u r in g thesugar industry. None of us wishes to injurethe sugar industry, but we should not. protect it at the sacrifice of other indus-,tries of equal importance. By a confer-' ence such as I suggest, a fair compromiseI have taken might be arrived at, which would enablethe sugar industry to be assisted without the practical strangling of a kindred industry. Coming to another matter which has been constantly mentioned during thedebate, there can be no question that, Australia entered upon an entirely novel, experiment in creating the Commonwealth Parliament with two Houses having the same franchise. It was inevitable t h a t these Houses would one day come intoconflict. But the present position is in-! tolerable, and opposed to the best interests of Australia. We have the Government with a majority in this Chamber, but with an absolute minority in the Senate. If honourable members of the Labour party really desire an appeal towhilst in the Northern Territhe country, as they say they do, let the members of both this House and the Senate tender their resignations, so that we may have a fair fight. It is the electorswho have brought about the present position, and it is they who should remedy the trouble that has been created. But the members of the Labour party wish toplay with loaded dice.
