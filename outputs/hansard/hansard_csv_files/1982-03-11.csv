Enormous legislative resources There was never any suggestion in any of the have been expended on this relatively small group speeches made from the Government benches in the community. First of all, the Government that in the inevitable conflict between capital and denied the unemployment benefit to actual labour, capital might occasionally be wrong. It is strikers.

That is, after all their other resources have gone Let us consider the situation which applies at and they can no longer sustain themselves, at least the moment-that is, what this legislation aims the Government will prevent them from starving. finally to get rid of. First of all, the benefit which Indeed, the Bill can be said to enshrine the latest the Government aims to remove is the single rate of Liberal principles-family destitution as a sysbenefit of $69.70 a week, plus $10 a week for each tem of industrial discipline. child. That is what the Government is striking at. It is not a family benefit because the spouses, The Australian Labor Party is totally opposed usually the men, have already been dealt with. to the principle embodied in this Bill-that of The Government is now primarily getting at the using the social security system as a weapon in inwives and children. The amount involved is the dustrial relations, as a means of imposing indussingle rate benefit of $69.70 a week, plus $10 a trial discipline. We object fundamentally to that week for each child.
