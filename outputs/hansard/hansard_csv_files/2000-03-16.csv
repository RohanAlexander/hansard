222,Mr Speaker,"Order! It being 6.00Thursday, 16 March 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 14943 Thursday, 16 March 2000 ----Goods and Services Tax: Sun Protective Clothing and not all of them result from Mr Howard’s deal with the Democrats. As we draw closer to 1 July, the number of inconsistencies is growing. The inconsistency I raise today is entirely of the government’s own making and demonstrates its indifference to the fact that by its deliberate action it will increase the number of young Australians who will at some stage in their life experience skin cancer. The inconsistency is in the government’s decision to continue the tax-free treatment of sunscreen but impose GST on sun protective clothing. This is of particular concern to me for two reasons. My electorate has 30 kilometres of Adelaide’s finest beaches, including Aldinga, Christies Beach, Hallett Cove, Maslin Beach, Moana, O’Sullivan Beach, Port Noarlunga, Port Willunga, Seaford, Seaford Rise, Southport, Silversands and Sellicks. My constituents are, therefore, frequent beach goers and users of sun protective clothing. A significant Australian producer of sun protective clothing, Solarsuit, is based in my electorate. Solarsuit’s sunsuits are made from Chloresist, a fabric developed to resist 98 per cent of UVA and UVB rays for at least one year’s exposure to the sun and chlorine. The company began 10 years ago and has grown to supply hundreds of thousands of sunsuits throughout the world. Its products are endorsed by the Anti-Cancer Foundation of Australia and available in each of its 26 shops Australia-wide. Australia has the highest rate of skin cancer in the world. The Anti-Cancer Foundation predicts that at least half of Australia’s population will be affected by skin cancer. Fortunately, skin cancer is preventable. Education campaigns by anti-cancer groups have succeeded in changing the community’s attitudes to sun protection. That any government would act to discourage the use of preventative measures is astounding. My family visited the beach frequently this summer and my kids, like most kids at the beach, swam and played in their sunsuits. I have been advised by Solarsuit that 70 per cent of children between two and 12 wear sun protective swimwear. The reason for the popularity of sunsuits is that they offer greater protection than even the strongest sunscreen. Given the impact of skin cancer on the lives of so many Australians and the fact that skin cancer treatment costs about $300 million per year, sun protective clothing should be GST exempt, just like sunscreen. As vital and tax free as sunscreen is, it is not cheap. A large bottle of UPF 30+ sunscreen retails for about $15 to $20, whereas a child’s neck to knee sunsuit costs only about $40 and lasts for a couple of years unless they are growing by a foot a year. Sun protective clothing makes financial sense for families on low incomes. I raised this anomaly with the Treasurer in a letter dated 28 September 1999. It has been 5½ months but the Treasurer is yet to respond. The letter makes it clear that the anomaly is of particular concern to Solarsuit, which is an employer of 27 workers in my electorate. That the Treasurer has not had the courtesy to respond in almost six months demonstrates the height of absolute arrogance and the fact that the Liberal Party is not the party of small business.

224,Mr Cox (Kingston),"There are many inconsistencies in the government’s GST package14944 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 16 March 2000 ment’s white paper on water in our state. This is an extremely complex paper and many communities, certainly in my area, have not had the time or knowledge to thoroughly assess the white paper. I do not think that many of them are aware of the huge implications of the white paper for towns in my electorate. I have recently had the opportunity to discuss some of these issues with people who really do know what they are talking about, in Walgett, Narromine, Burke and Warren. It is important for the communities in this area to recognise that, whether they support, oppose or are ambivalent towards irrigation farmers, all of our towns are critically reliant on the production of this group of farmers. Whether we work on a farm, own a business in town or work in a business in town-or, indeed, send children to school in one of our towns-a very significant proportion of the wealth of our community is derived directly from the irrigation industry. Just two of the areas that raise concerns are the proposal to only give the water user a five year licence and the suggestion that water licences that have been paid for with an expectation that they will be able to be used to produce an income may well be taken away, with no form of compensation whatsoever. It is something akin to someone in town buying a block of land to build their house, only to be told that the government has decided that there needs to be a park on that block of land and there is no recourse for compensation for the money spent buying it. As far as the five-year licensing is concerned, it is inconceivable that a financial institution would lend money to a producer to develop a farm when they cannot guarantee that they will be able to produce a product for any longer than five years. The vagaries of the climate in our area are enough of a handicap to predicting production without the uncertainty of a five-year licence limit. In New South Wales, it appears that the money that has been given to the states as competition payments has already been spent in the cost of running the Olympics and the pressure is on to meet the timetables for these buildings. The laws that need to be passed to allow these reforms to be met to gain access to the next tranche of competition payments appear to be the reason for such a hasty, headlong, poorly thought out dive into these laws. Separating access rights from usage rights seems like a good idea because it means that we will have a true value put on water. The worry I have is that, if Coles, Woolworths and Franklins dip into owning the water in an entire valley, they will be able to dominate the farmers as they never have before. They already set the prices they pay for the produce and are squeezing our farmers to produce for virtually nothing. If they also control the water, many of our towns might die. It is important that not only the irrigation communities but the bigger regional centres like Dubbo which rely on other successful and prosperous communities surrounding them for their business have reliable access to water and make proper use of it. They are conservation farmers and not abusers of the land. (Time expired) Groceries ing rise of the price of groceries. Since December, the Lilley Pricewatch team, which I coordinate, has found an almost $7 rise in the average price of a basket of 38 groceries. This $7 rise comes even before the GST is even implemented-and families are already feeling the pinch. This result simply confirms what many people have been telling me about what they are seeing happening to prices at the checkout. A constituent of mine wrote to me about how the rise in grocery prices was hurting her family. Leanne Noble of Boondall expressed it this way:",105,Representatives Main Committee

Plus no one seems to know exactly what is included and what is not, all I know is we are already a lot worse off than we were. And that is before the GST is introduced. Trudy Bray, who lives in Camden in New South Wales, wrote to me in these terms: Late in 1998, we started noticing that our budgeted amount for groceries no longer covered what we needed. We cut back but it did no good and we had to increase the budgeted amount. By the end of last year the bill for largely the same list had risen by 30% over what it was in June of 1998. That is the public perception, Mr Deputy Speaker. Sadly, the government and the Treasurer are more concerned about the share market than they are about the supermarket. So far, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission has taken little action regarding the consistent price rises on basic groceries and milk. How can consumers be assured that they will be protected after the GST is implemented? In December last year, I wrote to the federal Treasurer, Peter Costello, and the ACCC regarding milk price rises in Queensland and the impact they are having on families. I specifically requested the Treasurer, after the first price rise, to authorise the ACCC to investigate the massive rises on the price of milk in Queensland-to this day, I have received no response. The price of milk in Queensland has gone from $1.16 to $1.31 to $1.40-odd per litre, and we can get no action from the ACCC or the Treasurer. That is simply not good enough. There has been no formal information concerning how and when the investigation is to take place. When I raised the latest price rise-and there was a public furore-Professor Fels said that there would be an investigation, and that was the only time he made a statement about it. But he did not say what it was going to be into-the previous price rises or the price rises that may well come after the federal milk deregulation in June or July this year. For the sake of Queensland families, the federal Treasurer needs to stop twiddling his thumbs on this issue and get the ACCC out and investigating why the price of milk in Queensland has risen by over 20 per cent. But, more than that, we actually need a government which is going to be serious about policing the price rises for a basket of groceries, and its failure to do so is hurting the average family. As a result of what this government is doing with its new tax package, every time a family has an additional child, they go up a tax bracket. Families are already experiencing massive increases in the price of basic items, which is eroding their living standard.

The bill proposes changes to the Telecommunications (Numbering Charges) Act 1997.

228,"Debate Resumed From 9 December 1999, On Motion By Mr Mcgauran:",,107,Representatives Main Committee
229,Mr Stephen Smith (Perth) (10.00 A.m.),"The opposition supports the passage of the14946 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 16 March 2000 service. Numbers are held by both primary and secondary carriers. Secondary carriers are resellers of carriage services and obtain their numbers directly from the primary carrier whose services are being resold. The act currently determines that, despite the numbers having been originally allocated to the primary carrier, the secondary carrier is still responsible for numbering charges on services that have been transferred to it from the primary carrier. The bill seeks to clarify aspects of that process and simplify the collection of numbering charges. The bill also provides a limited flexibility for the ACA in determining the date on which numbering charges will be imposed. That flexibility is provided to allow the ACA to determine a date in order to address exceptional circumstances which might arise. This is a simple bill which improves the administration of telecommunications and the relationship between carriers in our nation. It is a simple measure but one which will enhance the effectiveness of our telecommunications operations. On that basis, it is supported by the opposition. vancing in new technology, services and efficiency. The deregulation of the telecommunications industry in 1997 has seen Australia move from one all-purpose carrier, Telstra, to 30plus carriers, 100 service providers and more than 800 Internet providers. This is of significant benefit to users, though the introduction of new and improved services and lower prices have also played their part. It has also seen the proliferation of new telephone numbers and call centres assisting customers through the minutiae of the Australian telecommunications system. The Telecommunications (Numbering Charges) Amendment Bill 1999 amends the Telecommunications (Numbering Charges) Act 1997, which essentially taxes carriage services provided on a certain range of telephone numbers. In 1998-99 about $60 million in revenue was collected from numbering charges. The charges apply to certain numbers-for example, the 13, 1300 and 1800 numbers and some mobile services. I would like to make it very clear, lest there be any misunderstanding in the community, that these charges do not apply to the standard eight digit numbers that people use in their homes and businesses. The carriage service provider may hold a number as a result of being allocated the number by the Australian Communications Authority or through the transfer of a number as a result of a commercial resale arrangement. The number of transfers from primary providers, those who have been allocated numbers, to secondary providers-in other words, the resellers-makes the collection of the annual charge administratively complex. In 1997-98 the ACA had to deal with 102 carriage service providers, 83 of whom were secondary suppliers paying only six per cent of the total revenue, with most invoices being less than $120. The bill provides two minor amendments to enhance the act’s operation and simplify the administration for service providers. Firstly, the act will be amended to explicitly define what are transfers of numbers for the purposes of the act. As a result, certain types of number movements would not result in the liability for charges being transferred. The liability remains with the primary service provider, which may collect the charges from the secondary providers. The ACA has advised that all the companies that transferred numbers in 1998-99namely, Telstra, Optus, Vodafone and AAPT-support the proposal because it will simplify administration. The overall effect will be to reduce the number of invoices issued by the Australian Communications Authority. Secondly, the act will be amended to move the date on which the charges are imposed from 22 May to a date in April, as determined by the ACA. This will give the ACA some flexibility in setting the date and give it at least three additional weeks to undertake its tasks. Providers will also have six to 10 weeks notice of the charge date and will have a minimum of 30 days",107,Representatives Main Committee
230,Mr Neville (Hinkler) (10.02 A.m.),"The telecommunications industry is rapidly adThursday, 16 March 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 14947 in which to pay their invoices. The amendments today reflect the government’s aim to ensure that the administration of number charging arrangements is done in an efficient, effective and timely manner. It is heartening that a bill like this needs to be introduced. Significant numbers of telecommunications providers have entered the marketplace and this has necessitated the bill. Deregulation has benefited consumers because other carriers have created an increased focus on the efficiency, timeliness and competitiveness of which I spoke. During our time in government, untimed local calls have come down as low as 15c, STD charges have dropped by as much as 45 per cent and international charges have fallen by as much as 80 per cent. Telstra’s monopoly-like grip on the $5 billion local call market is being challenged. Optus is charging 20c with cheap line rentals and, in recent months, we have seen AAPT, RSL Communications and Primus undercutting Telstra’s untimed local call charges with offers between 15c and 17½c. Telstra has responded to this competition by reducing its standard call rate from 25c to 22c, and a 15c call within a local exchange area has been offered. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission Chairman, Alan Fels, says that he thinks there will be further reductions in the near future. ‘This is not the end of local telephone call competition but the beginning,’ Mr Fels said. And most welcome it will be for my constituents in regional and rural Australia. In addition to the local call market, we have also witnessed significant price competition in the mobile market, with cheaper pricing packages on offer from a range of existing and new entrants. I think it is now time to introduce a tender system for the universal service obligation. For those who are not adept in this field, this is a legal obligation that states that every Australian, wherever they live or work, should have reasonable access to a standard telephone line service. Currently, Telstra is the USO provider and therefore has to provide these services-namely, standard telephones, pay phones and digital data service. The USO works in practice by forcing all telecommunications carriers to contribute-based on their eligible revenue-to the cost of providing services to rural and remote areas. The government also provides a substantial subsidy, as honourable members will be aware. The National Party is absolutely committed to the best possible services for regional and rural Australia. We are determined to maintain the momentum that has occurred since the visit here by the Telstra executives last Thursday of focusing on service standards in the bush and, even beyond that, on a timely, efficient and costHonourable members will also be aware that the National Party has a very strong view on the 49.9 per cent private ownership of Telstra. It does not wish that percentage to go beyond that until a certain set of conditions apply. Those conditions include a rigorous and searching inquiry into Telstra’s performance, which is a very important aspect. With respect to Telstra 2, the social bonus arose out of a resolution of a National Party central council meeting in Bundaberg two years ago this month. I might add that I was the mover of that motion. That mandated what the National Party saw as seven major areas that needed to be looked at in providing basic broadcast and telecommunications services to regional Australia. That was brought to Canberra by Senator Boswell and negotiated with the Prime Minister and Senator Alston. They came to a very amicable arrangement which was welcomed by National and Liberal country members alike-and, I am sure, by country Labor members, such as they are. ices to regional and rural Australia. It has since become known as the Bundaberg resolution. WhatI am about to say might, to some of my colleagues, seem to be heresy. There are some matters in addition to mandating that Telstra provide connections, reconnections, service and",108,Representatives Main Committee

232,Mr Neville,"Few and far between. It provided $762 million worth of additional serv14948 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 16 March 2000 maintenance to all Australians, but particularly to those in isolated areas where telecommunications are part of their lifeblood. In these areas you cannot run up the street and pick up the payphone, and many areas do not have access to mobile telephony, so the phone line is a very important thing. I am not minimising the importance of that for one moment, but I think we have to look beyond that to the new horizon. The new horizon is a range of satellite-provided services, the like of which we have not seen anywhere in Australia, much less in the bush. It is an opportunity, for the first time since the introduction of very basic telecommunicationsthe old wind-up phones and the party lines-for regional and rural Australia to get on the front foot and have a service which is equal to, if not better than, that which exists in the capital cities. This week a number of companies have visited the parliament. Optus have been here. Mr Murphy interjectingportant change in direction. Another company, the Farmwide and Heartland consortium, which have also been active in the parliament this week, have offered two models. One model, for example, offers 1.2 metre dishes, a number of phone lines, access to Austar or Optus pay television, free-to-air television and, in the next few years, interactivity with digital television. They would undertake to keep those calls at the same price as the USO price-22c or less. They would also undertake not to charge connection fees in excess of what Telstra is currently providing. They could provide data at 64 kilobytes. That is one offer. The Optus offer is that it would take over the USO. I have one problem with that: even if that were the case, there would still be a requirement for Telstra to maintain basic services to some areas. Whether there would have to be two levels of USO would need to be looked at by the government. Going to the Farmwide and Heartland proposals, theirs is that they would require a one-off payment from government of about $240 million and that they would put all Australia under a satellite umbrella, so to speak. They could provide up to four phone lines to each home, access to free-to-air television and pay television, access to high-speed data, and they are willing to match, or more than match, the current charges that Telstra is charging in the bush. For example, their maximum local call charge is 20c; their STD call connection is 15c; their maximum STD call per minute is 20c; their Internet connection cost is zero; and they use a more innovative form of Internet usage charge based on $5 for the first 25 megabytes and then 20c per megabyte thereafter. It is interesting stuff. I am not speaking today to favour any of those, but I would like them to start coming into the consciousness of members from both sides of the House. What we have to be careful of-and I am passionate about this-is that in focusing on copper cable and on the minutiae of the ownership of Telstra we may lose a great opportunity. Hand in hand with that, the DCRS technology of Telstra is not the greatest technology in the world. It has served us well, it is microwave technology, and for the people in remote areas it has been providing a very good service. I do not speak for the government; I speak just as a private member on this issue, but what we have to ask ourselves is whether we are going to allow regional and rural Australia to lock itself into that technology which will require a fairly high USO to back it, or are we going to look more innovatively into putting the whole of Australia, or certainly the whole of remote Australia, under a satellite umbrella? Within two years this technology will be at our doorstep, so to speak. Just to illustrate the point on how costs are coming down-although this is not germane to my current argument-just two years ago in this place I saw a demonstration by Iridium. They showed us the first satellite phone. It looked about the size of a stubby; it even looked like a stubby with the phone recessed into this rather bulky looking round thing that was",109,Representatives Main Committee
233,Mr Neville,"It is good to hear one of my Labor colleagues supporting this very imThursday, 16 March 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 14949 mainly batteries and aerials. Within 15 months we saw one that was not much bigger than the mobile phones we are using today. The price had come down from $5,000 for the stubby style thing to $2,000. The cost of usage had come down from over $2 a minute to $1.40 a minute. And now we have seen one, smaller still, at $1,200, with a commensurate drop in the usage charge. If that can happen with mobile telephony, which of itself is a more expensive medium than the normal household phone, imagine what satellite technology can do to connecting those in the bush. I am not saying that Telstra’s repairs, service, maintenance and connection are not important; in fact, I think they are very important. In fact, I would go so far as to say they are so important that we should even boost the service guarantee levels to make it less attractive for them to be indolent about it. I am not saying that the 49.9 per cent is not an important point for a lot of rural Australians, especially at national and at some rural levels. It is very important because it is the great dividing line that says that up to this point the government still has notional control and therefore we want to see Telstra perform. The National Party has said that we will not go beyond that point unless there is a rigorous and searching inquiry into Telstra and that that T2 social bonus is delivered. Beyond that-and I reiterate my original premise-it is vital that we do not just fixate on copper cable, that we do not fixate on the old microwave technology and have a huge USO around it to the exclusion of all others, and that we do not fixate on the minutiae of the ownership of Telstra. We must lift our sights over that horizon, and to get over that horizon we are going to need a satellite up there. We talked today at the start of this debate about the numbering charges, but they are just one small symbol of efficiency the government is giving to the telecommunications industry. I urge the government and I urge members of goodwill in all three major parties in this House of Representatives to lift their vision and let us make sure that the whole of Australia gets on the front foot; but, more particularly, that for those people in regional and rural Australia who have been told that they have to be efficient, that they have to get on the Internet, that they have to be able to interact with their agents and so forth overseas, they do not try to do this through antiquated technology but through the most modern technology. cations (Numbering Charges) Amendment Bill 1999 by supporting a lot of what the member for Hinkler has just said. These services are very important to Australia. But, of course, you know our position in the ALP: we do not want to see any further privatisation of Telstra. I understand the position of the National Party. As someone who was born and bred in a rural part of NSW, in a little country town called Dunedoo, I know how important telecommunications services are. To that extent, I just hope that the government does deliver those services to the bush, to areas like Dunedoo and to where the member for Hinkler comes from in Queensland, because it is terribly important for those people. In my speech I will go into some detail about the provisions. I know the points that the member for Hinkler was making here this morning for the benefit of his constituency, but I want to balance that by putting on record the ALP’s complete opposition to any further privatisation of Telstra. The amendment bill before the parliament this morning was introduced into the House on 9 December last year. Principally, it proposes changes to the Telecommunications (Numbering Charges) Act 1997. That act stipulates the method by which sets of telephone numbers are allocated to the carriage service providers and the methods for charging for the service. The purpose of the bill is to change the method for the collection of the annual numbering charge by the Australian Communications Authority. The ACA is responsible for administering and allocating the numbers and then charging the carriers for this service.",110,Representatives Main Committee
234,Mr Murphy (Lowe) (10.21 A.m.),"I would like to start my speech on the Telecommuni14950 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 16 March 2000 The Telecommunciations (Numbering Charges) Act 1997, the principal act, imposes charges on the carriage service providers for the numbers they are allocated under part 22 of the Telecommunications Act 1997. The principal act also imposes an annual charge on providers for the numbers they hold after 1 July 1997. This bill is concerned with the collection of the annual charge. In 1999, carrier liability for the charge was assessed to be approximately $60 million. A carriage service provider may hold a number as a result of being allocated the number by the ACA or through a transfer of the number by way of a commercial resale arrangement. The numbers of transfers from primary providers-those who have been allocated numbers by the ACA-to secondary providers, the resellers, makes the collection of the annual charge administratively complex. The explanatory memorandum reports that in 1997-98 the ACA had to deal with 102 carriage service providers, of whom 83 were secondary suppliers who paid only six per cent of the total revenue, with most invoices being for less than $120. In some cases resellers are not aware of their liability or they dispute liability, resulting in increased collection costs. This bill inserts a more restrictive definition of the circumstances in which number charge liability may be transferred, with the intention of reducing the complexity of collecting the charge for the ACA. Numbers are held by both ‘primary’ and ‘secondary’ carriers. Secondary carriers are ‘resellers’ of carriage services and obtain their numbers directly from the primary carrier whose services are being resold. The act currently determines that, despite the numbers having been originally allocated to the primary carrier, the secondary carrier is still responsible for numbering charges on services that have been transferred to it from the primary carrier. The bill seeks to clarify aspects of that process and simplify the collection of numbering charges. The bill, if enacted, would make a number of changes to the act, and for the benefit of the parliament I will go into some detail on the various sections which are subject to the amendments. The bill will alter the definition of the word ‘transferred’ in section 5 of the Telecommunications (Numbering Charges) Act 1997, which sets out the definitions of key terms used in the act. The word ‘transferred’ is currently defined, in relation to a number, to mean transferred between carriage service providers in accordance with the ACA’s ‘Telecommunications numbering plan 1997’. Proposed subsection 5A(1) of the bill provides that a number is transferred when it is ported from one carriage service provider who holds the number to another carriage service provider. The new definition is also designed to include, but not be limited to, rules for portability established in accordance with section 455(5)(d) of the Telecommunications Act 1997. For the purposes of this act, a carriage service provider who holds the number refers to a carriage service provider who, at the time of the port, holds both the number to be ported and the numbering charge liability of the number to be ported. Proposed subsection 5A(2) also provides that a number will also be taken to be transferred if there is a binding written agreement to that effect between the two carriage service providers that jointly provide the ACA with written notification of the agreement. The transfer will come into effect either on the day the ACA receives notification of the agreement or on a later day specified in the written notification. Proposed subsection 5A(3) provides that, if a number is ported while subject to a written agreement providing for its transfer at a particular time, the porting takes precedence. The number will be taken to have been transferred from the time at which it was ported, rather than the time specified in the written agreement. Proposed section 5A will permit a carriage service provider to move a number to another carriage service provider without necessarily moving the numbering charge liability attached to that number. Thursday, 16 March 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 14951 Item3 inserts additional words at the end of section 17(1)(b)(iii) of the act which will mean that only transfers of numbers from carriage service providers that hold the numbers for the purposes of the number charge count as transfers for the purposes of the act. This ensures that, should a number be ported or moved in some other fashion from a carriage service provider that did not hold the numbering charge liability, the number movement shall have no impact on the numbering charge liability. Item4 repeals section 18 of the act and replaces it with a new section 18, which provides for the determination of the date upon which numbering charges are imposed. Proposed new section 18 of the act does three things: it provides for the ACA to determine the date on which numbering charges will be imposed, this date being a day in April and the ACA’s determination of this date occurring before 16 February each financial year; it states that, if a carriage service provider holds an allocated number at the beginning of the day determined under section 18(2), a numbering charge will be imposed on the number; and it requires the ACA to publish its determination of the numbering charges date in the Gazette prior to the determined date. The new section will also provide limited flexibility to the ACA in determining the date on which numbering charges will be imposed. The flexibility is provided to allow the ACA to determine a date in order to address exceptional circumstances which might arise from a Y2K type problem. The opposition is very happy to support this amendment bill because it improves the relationships between the carriers and it certainly improves the efficiency of the numbering charges and the administration. We support the bill and commend it to the House. communications (Numbering Charges) Amendment Bill 1999. It is yet another one of the many sensible measures that this government has undertaken over the past four years in the vital new business area of telecommunications. Firstly, I turn to the member for Lowe’s contribution and state that he has shown to the House a far greater understanding of the matter before us than the poor old member for Perth, who sort of blew in and blew out in a matter of 90 seconds, such was his interest in the matter. I congratulate the member for Lowe for proving his credentials in this area. I suggest also that the member for Hinkler should be roundly congratulated by all members of the House for his very commanding understanding of this area, and I think his speech today was, in fact, one of the landmark addresses. I believe that he has, given the urgency of the current debate, shown that he is prepared to nail very high on the mast his colours on this matter and he should be congratulated. The bill before us is all about trying to sort out matters in this incredibly emerging telecommunications environment, where we have dozens of providers of telecommunication carrier services and 800 or more people or organisations who are providing Internet services. The 1300, the 13, the 1800 and the mobile service numbers are all intersecting and crossing all those various service providers. This bill before us attempts to try to sort out some of the complications of this multifaceted telecommunications industry in a sound and practical way, so that the Australian Communications Authority will have a far more streamlined process than would have been the case had this matter not been dealt with. The bill understandably has the support of both sides of the House. This morning’s Australian newspaper sets out, if you like, some of the environment in which we are currently operating in its story headed ‘Airwave sale nets bonanza’, pointing out that this new business has provided an extra $1.3 billion to government revenue. That front page story underlines the sort of industry that we now have operating in this country, where we have a Hong Kong based company like Hutchison willing to spend more than $670 mil-",111,Representatives Main Committee
235,Mr Hardgrave (Moreton) (10.30 A.m.),"I am delighted to rise to speak on the Tele14952 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 16 March 2000 lion, and One.Tel has ‘splurged’-in the Australian’s words-$523 million to buy up licences in five major markets, Adelaide, Brisbane, Perth, Melbourne and Sydney, with Telstra and Vodafone also buying licences-paying a big something for what really seems like nothingfor access to the spectrum. That is, according to the Australian this morning, the biggest price ever paid anywhere in the world for spectrum. That in itself is a very big tick from this market in a worldwide sense for this government and its policies and the growth that we are experiencing in telecommunications in this country. This spectrum, while it may be especially used for mobile phones, is also going to be part of the new generation of telecommunications, for which this government is constantly revising legislation to ensure that more people have access to it at an affordable price. So it is not just about mobile phones. Of course when you contrast that to the previous government’s stewardship in this area over 13 years, the one big hallmark failure of the Australian Labor Party would be their very narrow-minded decision to sign away analog telephone usage in this nation as part of a deal to get a little extra competition into the country. As a consequence, we have had tens of thousands of Australians tossing their analog telephones in the bin. The Telstra CDMA rollout has caused a number of problems in a few people’s minds, but every bit of that pain can be simply put back straight onto the Australian Labor Party, because Telstra contractually were unable to run the analog system any more and CDMA, as an emerging technology, was something that had to be introduced. At the heart of all of this, though, is not just the telephone; it is not just simply being able to call someone. At the heart is everything to do with the computer industry and the IT&T industry. Information technology and telecommunications are tied hand in glove. The words of Lachlan Murdoch come to mind. In a conversation I had with him some years ago he said that the two big issues as far as he, as someone involved in the number one media company around the world, is concerned are content and access to means of distribution. That means broadcast distribution and access to the telephony systems. In fact the two major technologies that exist in this world by his estimation-and I suspect there is a lot to be said for his estimation-are the television and the mobile phone, because everything else plugs into them. So what we have before us today is yet another matter of trying to sort out some of the issues involved in that access and that distribution of content. We are dealing with new technology day in, day out. Again, I reward the member for Hinkler with my appreciation for his contribution today. He is quite right that telecommunications in this country are no longer just about copper wire. For many years Telstra, that 800-pound gorilla of telecommunications kicked sand in the face of anybody who dared to try to get access to its copper wire. Its big boast was that it had a copper wire pair going into every home and business in Australia. But of course we are now seeing, through this government’s deliberate encouragement of competition in telecommunications, that the supplanting of copper wire is the means of technology used. Consumers are now benefiting from the types of services they are now getting and from the cost of the services they can now use. One.Tel charges 17½c for an untimed local call, and Telstra has responded by lowering the local call cost. This is all due to the fact that technology is supplanting the plain old copper wire. Of course out in rural and regional Australia, where there is a lot of angst and, quite frankly, a lot of hyperbole about the way Telstra should be the only means of trying to provide telecommunications, there is understandably a copper wire system that in too many cases strings from tree to tree, or from dead tree to dead tree. Just like the member for Hinkler, I am also rather excited about a couple of the contributions and suggestions that we have seen from some of the innovative companies in our nation. The Farmwide and Heartland Communications offer of taking on the availability of access to Thursday, 16 March 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 14953 telecommunications in remote rural and regional Australia for a one-off $240 million charge paid for from the social bonus from the partial sale of Telstra and using satellite to provide the range of services that we in the city are awfully used to, is something that is definitely worth looking at. That particular proposal would see the end of the universal service obligation, and of course that in itself would provide a greater sense of efficiency in this entire sector. Likewise, the Cable and Wireless Optus submission, which is again using greatly underutilised satellite infrastructure that is floating around thousands of miles off the surface of the earth and is not used to the capacity that it could be, is also worth looking at. Cable and Wireless Optus have put a submission to the government saying, ‘We’ll take over the USO. We’ll take over where Telstra are currently demanding that they have complete control, and we can provide untimed local calls to customers in rural and remote areas who currently only receive pastoral rate calls.’ Forty thousand customers in regional and remote areas would get access to an array of broadband, pay TV, free-to-air and telephony services all through one dish, and they will provide the dish. These are the sorts of innovative ideas this nation needs to not just simply play catch-up in rural and remote Australia but to put rural and remote Australia clearly on the map as the best region in the world as far as telecommunications are concerned. So 40,000 customers in rural and remote Australia-and probably a lot more people-are currently, understandably, feeling quite left behind. But as a direct result of this government’s determination to provide them with Internet access at a fast rate, anything up to 64 kilobytes, all those sorts of things are being promised and offered from technology that exists at an affordable price now. Frankly, I find the confirmation by the member for Lowe of Labor’s opposition to selling off any more of Telstra quite passe at best. I believe that, because the Australian Labor Party members are against the continuation of the government’s privatisation of Telstra, they are therefore against the continuation of the government’s liberation of the resources that we can use to provide the bush with the services they should have. Therefore, Labor want to hold the bush back. It is a very simple analogy. What is the government doing each time we have sold off a bit of Telstra? We repay debt. We liberate the budget from the burden of debt repayment, which means we can refocus our efforts in other ways. Also, we are putting deliberate amounts of money into improving the services that those who do not have good services would expect. At the same time, this government is continuing to legislate, just as it is doing in this bill before us today, that everybody plays by the same rules, that all telecommunications carriers-and there are over 30 of them, and 100 service providers and 800 ISPs-are playing by the same rules and regulations. Also, it is a very pathetic argument that unless it is badged ‘Telstra’ it cannot be communications. It is a convenient argument for this 800-pound gorilla of the telecommunications industry as they attempt to try to cement market in the Australian industry. It is a very convenient argument because, if they get it in the lexicon and in the mind-set of everyone in Australia that ‘unless you see a Telstra badge on it then it is not worth having’, we may jeopardise some of the great advantages we are currently seeing. We are getting lower call costs. We are getting a greater range of services. We are getting new technology being used to try to improve the services for people who desperately need that improvement in services, not because Telstra is doing it but because innovation through competition is doing it. I welcome all attempts by this government to bring Telstra to book. They currently have a range of fines which in a lot of cases do not work because Telstra, as large as they are, say, ‘We’re better off copping the fine than doing the work.’ So weeks and months go by before certain tasks are undertaken. But I know this government is setting in place the rules and the regulations that demand results and that Telstra is continuing to be put under great pressure. 14954 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 16 March 2000 The great competitive advantage that Telstra has-the size of its network and its standing in the community-means that nothing any of us could say about Telstra would ever devalue its price as far as a saleable commodity is concerned. But I also understand that Telstra is running at something like 10 to 15 per cent behind world’s best practice as far as efficiency is concerned. Back in the days when opposition leader Beazley was the minister responsible for telecommunications in this country, back in the days when he signed analog phone users away into the oblivion they have just suffered, we saw a drop of 17,500 workers from the old Telecom work force. A lot of those who went were hangovers from the old PMG days. Again we are seeing Telstra rightly saying, ‘If we are running 10 to 15 per cent behind world’s best practice, we are going to have to look at using technology to create the greater efficiency that we need.’ But what is particularly interesting is that when the 17,500 were axed by Beazley all those years ago there were something like 24,000 new jobs created in the entire industry. If you run that analogy today, given that technology is growing at an exponential rate, proportionately there will be an even greater number of jobs created as a result of any changes Telstra may bring to the size of its work force. We have an industry that is growing. We have an industry for which the world, according to today’s paper, is giving us a big tick in this country. It is willing to invest $1.3 billion just to buy spectrum for tomorrow’s use, not just for what we are doing today. We have an industry that is hiring more people. We have an industry that is growing new businesses all around this nation. We have an industry that is offering people in rural and remote areas greater possibilities as far as access to world’s best telecommunications practices are concerned. We do not just need Telstra to keep doing those things that they were doing. I must say that Telstra is a fine old Australian institution. Telstra is something which is worth getting value for. Unlike those opposite, when they floated for sale things like the Commonwealth Bank, Qantas, Commonwealth Serum Laboratories-and we heard a question in the House yesterday in regard to the partial sale of Telstra being factored in to this year’s budget, to prove my point further-we do not need to sell off things like Telstra to meet today’s expenditure. We do not need to sell off the family car to pay for the groceries, as those opposite did over their 13 years in government. When we sell off worthwhile community infrastructure and assets like Telstra, we repay public debt-debt clocked up by those opposite. We naturally want the best price, and we will get the best price, because nothing can really devalue Telstra as it is such a dominant player in such a major and growing industry. Like the government, and like the Minister for the Arts and the Centenary of Federation, who is at the table, I am concerned that people get results, that the service quality that people expect is guaranteed. That is why I have always been pleased to contribute to debates in this place and to endorse the government’s efforts to ensure that it does not matter who owns the phone company as long as the phone service is the right service, that people are getting what they expect. The key point of my contribution today is that you do not need a Telstra badge on technology, you do not need a Telstra badge on the things that you expect to have in your home in order to get the best service. In fact, as long as there are the same rules for all, and as long as each of these many telecommunications service providers now working in Australia understands that they have to conform to the government’s expectations or they will be severely fined or dealt with in other ways, then I think we are going to get a good result for consumers. It is important that telecommunications consumers come first. It is important that the people of Australia have a great sense of satisfaction that they are able to access the sorts of facilities that they want. But it is very important also that, when you sell off important assets Thursday, 16 March 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 14955 such as Telstra, people feel very well satisfied that the results of that particular sale are turned into the right areas as far as this nation is concerned. This is an industry that is growing at an exponential rate. It is an industry that is difficult to legislate for because day in, day out technology is keeping ahead of all of us as legislators. It is an industry that does not need an opposition running an ‘opposition for opposition’s sake’ approach and using hoary old union chestnuts of keeping public ownership and public ownership is the only way to go. It is an industry that demands that the public ownership factor be taken off, that this shackle be taken off it. It is an industry that wants this government to continue its proactive and demanding role in this area which puts the consumers first and gets the best result for the industry, especially keeping an eye on those who do not have the sorts of services that they would like to have, all because Telstra has been holding them back. This is a very important debate because it strikes me that those opposite-and there are the odd one or two on the government side as well-are helping Telstra’s cause in this ‘Telstra badge is best’ analogy. What is happening as a direct result is that those who claim that they want good results for their constituents by trying to protect Telstra are in fact providing extra featherbedding for an organisation that needs the big shake-up, that needs the big hurry-up that new technology and new players are currently providing. I commend the bill to the House. speakers list for this debate are members of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Communications, Transport and the Arts. enormously. I would also like to thank the member for Moreton for his courageous speech. WheneverI hear government spokespersons singing the praises of Telstra’s privatisation, I cannot help thinking that they are very courageous people because, when you come from Bendigo or any other part of regional Australia, to talk about privatisation of Telstra means that you will probably lose your seat immediately, instantly. The member for Moreton was painting this wonderful picture of the communications industry, and indeed a lot of what he said is right. It is a very exciting industry that moves very quickly, but there are major problems in regional Australia, as I am sure the minister at the table-the Minister for the Arts and the Centenary of Federation, who represents the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts-would be aware of and would have heard of quite often. One of the major problems in my electorate of Bendigo was caused by the decision by Telstra to opt out of the paging service. This is causing major concern, especially for the Victorian State Emergency Service. For example, I received representations from people who are as far away as Rochester-which is not in my electorate-who have been trialing a new service in place of the Telstra service, and it does not work nearly as well. For example, they trialed the Orange service or the link service. The pagers were tested on 25 and 27 February. Tests were carried out at different locations, covering an area from Bendigo to Echuca. Of course, the main area of interest for these people was the Rochester area. As the results of the test revealed, five key locations within the Rochester township were not able to receive the signal. Specifically, the Rochester State Emergency Service’s unit controller was not able to receive the service at all. That is quite dangerous for emergency services. That service is going to be phased out by, I think, the end of June. This is an example of Telstra pulling much needed services out of regional Australia and that, in my view, could be quite dangerous.",113,Representatives Main Committee

238,Mr Gibbons,"Yes, it is a very hard working committee, and I enjoy working with them14956 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 16 March 2000 One of the other areas of concern to me is that Telstra made much fanfare about its new charging rates-25c phone calls down to 22c. Telstra made a big announcement about that. On the surface it appears to be quite good, but it is actually a double-edged sword because the line rental will increase from $11.65 up to $13.85 as a result of that reduction. An increase of $2.20 erodes gains in the reduction of the local call rate. For example, 50 calls at 25c each equals $12.50; 50 calls at 22c each equals $11. You have a saving of $1.50, but you add the extra $2.20, which gives a net loss of 70c. So Telstra is clearly trying to get people to use the phone more often by offering them a cheaper call rate, but with a bit of a spike to make sure that people use the telephone even more. One of the other areas of concern to me is that there are quite a lot of areas in my electorate which still do not have a local call rate for Internet access. Indeed, Senator Lundy, the shadow minister, met with some people at Newbridge last year. Newbridge is about 25 to 30 kilometres from Bendigo. Bendigo is a major regional centre, with a population of 60,000 to 80,000, and yet 30 kilometres away there is no local call access to the Internet. It is great to see government spokespersons giving these courageous speeches about the privatisation of Telstra. I have to admire their courage because, if you talk about the privatisation of Telstra in Bendigo or in other parts of regional Australia, people just shake their heads. In Bendigo we have seen the loss of between 250 and 300 jobs as the government prepares Telstra for the full sale. That is about $12 million a year which has been taken out of that region’s economy. It is very hard to replace those jobs, although it has been done with AAPT, and I have already spoken about that in the House before. I commend the government members for their courage. I am sure that, come the next federal election, Telstra will be a big issue and we will all be behind a Beazley-Labor government to ensure that Telstra remains connected to regional Australia’s future. (10.54 a.m.)-in reply-I wish to thank all members who contributed to this debate on the Telecommunications (Numbering Charges) Amendment Bill 1999. The members for Hinkler and Moreton are invariably committed to participating in these debates. It does not matter if it is in the House or the Main Committee, they will participate and put their point of view. It is always innovative and, at times, courageous, as the member for Bendigo mentioned, but it is always thoughtful. Both of them again took a very pragmatic approach to the issues of telecommunications. They are not ideologically hamstrung, as is the member for Bendigo, who thinks that maintaining Telstra in public ownership is the solution to the array of problems he raised. He totally confuses the ownership of Telstra with the range of service and the efficiency of its delivery and, consequently, that you can separate the two. You need a regulatory legislative framework for Telstra to provide the types of services and you need funding to provide Internet access, the local call rate for Internet access and the like. That is what we have done under Networking the Nation, which I am afraid the member for Bendigo and his party have opposed completely. But of all the points-political, unfortunately, though they were-that the member for Bendigo made, he did raise a genuine concern that rural people have about Telstra closing down their radio paging service on 30 June. Some communities and emergency services have expressed concern about the loss of the paging service. I have sought advice from Telstra and they have advised that they will close their radio paging service in view of significant reductions in the size of the paging market as well as developments in mobile phone technology and associated messaging services which they believe have largely overtaken the paging market. They argue that new products and services now on offer through mobile phones provide",117,Representatives Main Committee

Of course, the full service and the full provision of services of the network will continue to 30 June. Telstra further advised me that existing paging customers who want to switch to a Telstra Mobile Net service will receive free connection and two months free access to the memo messaging service. Telstra is negotiating with Link Communications to transfer customers in most parts of the country who wish to retain traditional paging services. The government, I assure the member for Bendigo, are very aware of community concern and we are in close contact with Telstra to monitor developments and make sure efforts are undertaken to ensure community concerns are met. I again thank members who have contributed to the debate on the Telecommunications (Numbering Charges) Amendment Bill 1999, which makes minor administrative changes to improve the efficiency with which the Australian Communications Authority collects annual number charges. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Ordered that the bill reported to the House without amendment. Economics, Finance and Public Administration Committee Report Debate resumed from 13 March, on motion by Mr Hawker: That the House take note of the report. to this report on the review of the Reserve Bank of Australia annual report 1998-99. The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics, Finance and Public Administration is a committee which I have the privilege to have served on in this parliament and also in the previous parliament. I would like to begin by expressing my gratitude particularly to the staff of the committee, in particular the secretary, Bev Forbes, and Tas Luttrell, who made a major contribution to putting the report together. The report highlights the fact that, whilst our differences within this place are often stressed in the media, some of the best work in the parliament is done through its committees. The deliberations of committees such as the one chaired so well by the member for Wannon and the outcomes we have from reports such as this make a valuable contribution to the parliament’s analysis of directions for the Australian economy. Discussion of this report gives an opportunity to put a viewpoint as to the current economic direction in Australia. I want to make a contribution on one particular aspect of economic policy and, indeed, economic development that is occurring: globalisation. The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics, Finance and Public Administration is currently undertaking an inquiry into international financial markets and the impact that globalisation is having, particularly on the ability of domestic governments to make policy decisions which will impact on the people in nation states. One of the concerns that I have about globalisation is the growing evidence of an expansion of income inequality occurring in advanced countries such as Australia and the United States-and, indeed, on a global scale, if you compare rich countries and poorer countries. To discuss wealth distribution in Australia in 2000 is perhaps to risk being branded old fashioned. Paddy McGuinness has asked, ‘Why are the chattering classes so obsessed with the inequality of incomes?’ The answer to that is that it matters to many more than the chattering",118,Representatives Main Committee
240,Mr Albanese (Grayndler) (10.59 A.m.),"I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak14958 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 16 March 2000 classes. It is not just a case of growth and economic expansion; it is a matter of what happens to that growth in terms of whether the benefits of economic growth are shared fairly. Certainly, disparities in wealth distribution matter to workers such as those at National Textiles and Braybrook, who have struggled for their meagre entitlements at the same time as the failed chief executive of AMP can get a $13 million payout as reward for failing in his job. Income disparity certainly matters to rural and regional workers who are dismayed by the Treasurer’s call for them to be paid even lower wages. It certainly matters also to those lower and middle income Australians who will pay a GST on the essentials of life while tax avoidance by the wealthy remains a growth industry. According to the last Business Review Weekly Rich 200 survey, in three years the total wealth of the rich 200 has jumped $21 billion, or nearly 60 per cent. The share of wealth for the top 10 per cent of people has risen from 43.5 per cent in 1983 to 48.6 per cent at the end of 1998. The 10 richest Australians were 15 times better off than they were in 1983. At the other end of the scale, a significant portion of Australians are wondering where the economic growth is. The Bureau of Statistics has estimated that the bottom half of Australians own just five per cent of the national wealth. One example is the alleged revolution in share ownership. Largely, that is a result of the privatisation-by governments of both persuasions, it must be said-of publicly owned assets. Privatisation of national institutions such as the Commonwealth Bank is something that I opposed and continue to oppose. Privatisation of Telstra, just up to 49 per cent of it, we have seen-as the member for Bendigo eloquently pointed out in this speech earlier today-has resulted and is continuing to result in a loss of services. But, as a result of that and as a result also of superannuation investment in shares, we have seen a growth in share ownership. But when you actually compare the reality with the rhetoric of the government, you get a very different picture. When the 1985 decision to introduce imputation credits for fully franked dividends occurred, Treasury estimated a cost of $250 million in the first year and $500 million thereafter. Those figures have proven to be absurdly low. In 1997-98, the figure was $3.8 billion for individuals, with an additional $1.77 billion for the trusts, such as those which most of the frontbench members of the government have. The regional dimension of inequality is evidenced by comparing suburbs in Sydney. Bellevue Hill’s 5,625 residents shared more than $28 million in imputation credits, representing shares worth $1.43 billion, an average of $713,433. Compare that with Mount Druitt in Sydney’s western suburbs: in Mount Druitt there were 24,577 taxpayers of whom only 831 owned shares. The total amount of shares owned was $26,640 and they received an average imputation credit of just $666. Class is alive and well in Australia in the year 2000. The tax office has estimated that 100 wealthy individuals continue to avoid about $800 million in tax. In recent years, one of Australia’s five billionaires claimed a taxable income of $12,524-a weekly income of $241, this gentleman would have us believe, at a time when ordinary Australians are doing the right thing and paying their tax through the PAYE system. You have this sort of obscenity continuing to occur. And it might not be fashionable in this place to raise Kerry Packer and his case, but it is an outrage that Australia’s richest individual is not prepared to make the appropriate financial contribution to society. The passive resentment I feel turns to anger when battlers struggling to pay their mortgage view traders cheering as interest rate increases are announced. The paper profit for these traders, like the growth in speculative derivatives, has an almost surreal element to it from the perspective of so many Australians, for whom an interest rate increase dramatically impacts on their supermarket purchases. Concentration of the benefits of growth is not just confined to income. At a time when there is growing generational unemployment in some suburbs and Thursday, 16 March 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 14959 regions of about 25 per cent, the average working week has grown to more than 43 hours. While weekend papers highlight the happy sellers of inner Sydney properties achieving six figures above reserve prices, homelessness is growing rapidly. More than 100,000 Australians have a very different perspective of the trickle-down effect when they are sleeping in parks and struggling to gain shelter each night. It is not just groups or individuals traditionally associated with the left of politics who are concerned about this. In his The Crisis of Global Capitalism, billionaire international speculator George Soros criticised the system he has profited on by saying: Lasting relationships have been replaced by individual transactions. A transactional society undermines social values and loosens moral constraints. Social values express a concern for others. But a transactional economy is anything but a community. Globalisation does offer enormous potential opportunities, but the challenge for governments is to ensure that the benefits are not concentrated with the few. In my view, there is nothing inherently wrong with the growth in the number of millionaires, but it is very hard to be proud of this when, at the same time, there are increasing numbers of Australians living in poverty. Ms GAMBARO (Petrie) (11.10 a.m.)-I always enjoy listening to the member for Grayndler, but I have to admit that today I was not quite sure what inquiry he was talking about. The hearings that I attended on 29 November and also in February dealt with the issues of the Reserve Bank report and the globalisation of international markets, and these issues are the subject of a current inquiry the House Representatives Standing Committee on Economics, Finance and Public Administration is undertaking. To my knowledge, I was not aware that that inquiry had come to a conclusion or that a report had been presented. So it was quite interesting to listen to the member for Grayndler speaking about globalisation and not touching on aspects of monetary policy, financial systems stability, current account deficit, bank fees and credit charges. He did speak in depth about Kerry Packer, however, but I do not think taxation was one of the issues looked at in the Reserve Bank report. I was quite bemused to hear him speaking about globalisation and all of these other issues. At first I thought that maybe I was in the wrong place or had been put down to speak on the wrong report. I am happy to speak today on the Reserve Bank report and to add to some of the sentiments expressed earlier by the member for Grayndler. The report was tabled in the main chamber on Monday by the chairman of the committee, Mr David Hawker. On that day, the deputy chair and member for Isaacs, Greg Wilton, and the member for Burke spoke about the review of the Reserve Bank’s annual report 1998-99 interim report. Firstly, though, I would like to congratulate the chairman for the professional, inclusive and bipartisan way in which he has managed the review. A number of speakers have commented on his fine work. The work of the committee secretariat can never be underestimated. We were supported by a really top-class team of Bev Forbes and Tas Luttrell. It was wonderful to have such dedicated people to assist with this inquiry. The report was followed yesterday by some very good news that the Australian economy continues to grow strongly with growth of one per cent in the December quarter and 4.3 per cent throughout the year. We should be proud that the government has maintained a very low inflation rate and that inflationary pressures will continue to remain low. The December quarter figures-and I have a press release here that was issued by the Treasurer yesterdayhave to be commended, because they show yet again that the government has a commitment to sustained and strong economic growth in a low inflation environment. The Australian economy has reflected this strong growth in private consumption over recent quarters, reflecting the growth and household income and wealth. This means that there will be continuing levels of consumer confidence. 14960 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 16 March 2000 Business investment did drop slightly, though, and it is felt that this was a consequence of a number of things, including the introduction of tax reform and immediate resources being directed to implementation issues. But business investment will continue to grow and respond well in the year 2000-01, generally reflecting what is a growing world economy. The removal of business imposts in Australia will also occur and increase business investments. It is also important to note that net exports will continue to grow and rises in export volumes are already offsetting increases in imports. There has been a improvement in economic conditions worldwide, and the current account deficit has also improved, as predicted in the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook. So in this environment where inflationary pressure remains at the minimum level there is some indication that the household consumption deflator fell by 0.1 per cent in the December quarter and increased by 0.9 per cent throughout the year. Wage pressures have been well controlled and the Australian economy has to be congratulated for weathering that turbulent Asian crisis. It is in the current context that I speak about the hearings with Reserve Bank Governor Macfarlane in Sydney in November last year and in February this year. It was good to see in its bi-annual report that the Reserve Bank offers opportunities for greater understanding behind the decisions made on monetary policy. In terms of growth, everything that was mentioned earlier by me was also highlighted at those hearings-that Australia continues to exceed growth rates of beyond four per cent and that inflation is low. The review of the Reserve Bank is based on the bank’s semi-annual statements on the conduct of monetary policy and its annual reports. The bank is anticipating that this growth rate of four per cent will continue throughout 1999-2000. The government is well on target, and in fact is probably exceeding its target, and needs to be congratulated. The Governor also predicted the continuing growth of domestic demand ignited by strong household consumption. This was due to growing incomes, sustained high levels of confidence, low borrowing costs, wealth gains over a large range of assets, recovery in the household sector, and the prospect of increasing investment and spending over the next 12 months. Australia’s growth prospects continue to strengthen and astound the world. We are now experiencing something like nine consecutive years of economic expansion. A CPI rate of inflation of 2.75 per cent is anticipated, with an underlying rate of inflation of approximately 2.25 per cent. The good news continues to grow. At the moment, employment figures show that the unemployment rate has dropped to 6.7 per cent, with 653,800 new jobs created. Much of this review of good news comes not only from Australian sources. For example, recently the International Monetary Fund’s analysis of the Australian economy suggested that the economy has the potential to grow in the next four to six years at a rate of 3.2 per cent to 4.3 per cent. If the IMF’s predicted growth rate is achieved it will further reduce current levels of unemployment. Unemployment is definitely going to go down a lot lower than it is, and that is great news. The IMF also said of Australia that productivity growth of the Australian economy has increased to rates not seen since the golden age of 1960, and that the unemployment figure for 1999 was at its lowest since June 1990. What that equates to in domestic terms is that full time employment rose by 34,000 jobs and part-time employment was up by 25,100 jobs. That is fantastic. Teenage full-time employment has shown great improvement as well. It has gone up by 13,000 over the last 12 months. And there has been a three per cent seasonally adjusted employment growth over the last year. So, all in all, employment has risen in each of the last 33 months in trend terms. That is fantastic news. Thursday, 16 March 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 14961 The Reserve Bank has confirmed this trend by reporting that employment growth has strengthened to an annual rate of 3.5 per cent in the December quarter, its strongest performance in four years. In the February Reserve Bank Bulletin it was noted that unemployment was just under seven per cent. As I said earlier, that was predicted in that quarter. It has gone even lower and is at its lowest level in a decade. I would like to turn briefly to a few other areas, one being the current account. The bank produced a current account figure of six per cent of GDP. This level was reached in the June quarter and should remain so for the current financial year. In summary, the Governor said that the bank is expecting that the current financial year will be a good one for the economy. With respect to interest rates, the Governor was asked about the reasoning behind the current increase in basic interest rates from 4.75 per cent to 5.5 per cent. The reason given was that Australia has an independent policy. International factors such as the change in world economic outlook and the effects of the Asian crisis had produced a weak performance in the world economy in 1998. But the world economy generally recovered strongly in 1999-2000 and is expected to be stronger. He also noted that, as a result of stronger world growth, interest rates had been pushed up in most industrial countries. Australia’s tightening of rates was accompanied by similar occurrences in the USA, the UK and the European Central Bank, in Canada and in New Zealand. Household debt continues to increase. It is of some concern and will be monitored very closely. Another area touched on was bank fees and charges. The Reserve Bank Governor was questioned in depth about bank fees and charges. He drew a number of conclusions. He said that there had not been a systematic increase in fees charged and that in some cases larger loan fees seemed to have fallen. He mentioned that accounting service fees had fallen a little and the number of free fee transactions had increased. That has certainly been the case with a number of the banks, which have increased competition by offering, for example, 50 free transactions. There are a number of other examples of free transactions. Fees for transactions have increased for high-cost transactions. For example, cheques are still the most expensive method of doing business. They represent older technology, whereas the ATMs are being used more frequently. Fees for own-bank ATMs have been steady and fees for newer services have fallen. Total fees increased by 15 per cent in 1998. The increase, however, is in line with the increasing transaction levels and the per unit cost. One of the matters mentioned by the Governor was that it was unlikely that the increases in fees charged to small business had offset the benefits received when interest margins fell. That was an interesting point to note. An area of concern, though, as always, is that businesses have been paying the fees for some time and smaller businesses have been catching up with the level of some of the fees that have been paid by large businesses. The area of fees is still a sensitive one for households. That area was highlighted by the Reserve Bank Governor. All in all, banks are maintaining their profits, either by holding up their margins or by putting up their fees. He mentioned briefly that the offset in the reduction in margins has been very small-the increase in fees compared to the reduction in margins. Another area highlighted at the hearings was frequent flyer points and bonus card systems. The Reserve Bank Governor mentioned that frequent flyer points and loyalty programs were not free and that somewhere in the system somebody had to pay for those. He made the point-and I quote: Somewhere in the community some prices are reflecting that so that that value can be transferred across to the people who earn the bonus points. Yes, that is true. ... Is paying by credit card the most efficient way of paying, or is it simply being done because people get their points? In some cases, there are more efficient and cheaper ways of paying for the economy as a whole. 14962 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 16 March 2000 There is some irrational behaviour occurring out there. I asked the Reserve Bank Governor about the reasoning behind an incident that I knew of, involving a woman buying a washing machine from a retail outlet where the washing machine was $100 dearer than elsewhere, so that she could obtain the frequent flyer points. He indicated to me that such behaviour was highly irrational but that it does occur. One of the benefits of these loyalty programs-as a former marketer-is the fact that all sorts of information is recorded as a result of the purchases people make. Their purchasing habits, such as the last time they purchased a stereo, et cetera, provide valuable marketing information, but the benefits to the consumer have yet to be shown. The most important thing that was highlighted was that frequent flyer and loyalty programs are not free and that somewhere in the system, in order to implement these programs and offset the increase in administrative costs, someone has to pay for them. I conclude by saying that the current economic growth will continue. We have much to be proud of at the moment. We have low inflation. Our unemployment rate is continuing to decline. I want to emphasise a comment made by the Reserve Bank Governor when he said that he is expecting the current financial year to be another good one for the Australian economy. So we have much to look forward to. Debate (on motion by Ms Worth) adjourned. Primary Industries and Regional Services Committee Report Debate resumed from 13 March, on motion by Fran Bailey: That the House take note of the report. tatives Standing Committee on Primary Industries and Regional Services which is responsible for this report. It is an excellent report-badly needed. It is very appropriately worded, tooTime running out: shaping regional Australia’s future. Time is running out in regional Australia but, more importantly, time is running out for the Howard government. You have only to look at the results in the Victorian state election last year, where people in regional Victoria voted overwhelmingly to elect the Bracks government because of the way that regional Victoria was treated by the then Liberal-National coalition. Regional Victorians showed they would no longer tolerate being fobbed off with second-class treatment by a government which was mesmerised by Melbourne and which concentrated all of the infrastructure and jobs in Melbourne. Regional and country voters voted for a new deal for the part of the state that was beyond the tram tracks and away from the casino culture. Since the election, there have been major initiatives foreshadowed and taken up by the Bracks government to put regional and country Victoria back on the map. There was the establishment of an infrastructure program through the regional infrastructure development fund, with some $170 million in capital funds for regional projects. The groundwork has been done to develop fast trains between Melbourne and regional centres like Bendigo and Ballaratis a constant fighter for those in his electorate, and I am sure they are all very proud of him. The Bracks government is also boosting transport links. There is a commitment, in Bendigo’s case, to completing the duplication of the Calder Highway by 2006, with the federal government playing a part also.

243,Mr Gibbons,"And the Latrobe Valley, of course. The honourable member for McMillanThursday, 16 March 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 14963 The committee recommends that the Commonwealth government assist regional development and the regeneration of skills and leadership in regional areas by relocating strategic Commonwealth departments essential to facilitating regional development to the regions, beginning with the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry and Environment Australia. I could not agree more. That is a wonderful idea, but it is not original. The Cain Labor government in the state of Victoria had a policy to re-establish the then Department of Agriculture in Bendigo. I remember it well. Bendigo and Ballarat both competed fiercely for the rights to have that facility. If my memory is correct, Ballarat received the second prize, which was the big data centre. Of course, that is appropriate as Ballarat is Victoria’s second greatest city. Bendigo was to receive the then Department of Agriculture. Indeed, the minister located to Bendigo to set up offices there. They purchased property to put a building on for the relocation. The state election came around. The then opposition were committed to retaining that wonderful idea of decentralisation-a big election promise. Both parties fought it out. The Kennett government were elected. What did they do? They scuttled the project, moved the minister back to Melbourne, sold the land and that was the end of that. So the coalition government has considerable form when it comes to making promises about relocating government departments. But it is a worthwhile idea; it is not a new idea. It was a great Labor idea of the 1980s. I am pleased to see that the committee have picked it up. I only hope that they can do it, not just for Bendigo but for areas like McMillan. One of the areas not mentioned in the book is the privatisation of Telstra. Again, if the government is going to be fair dinkum about regional development, Telstra is linked completely to that infrastructure. We in the Labor Party believe that we have to keep Telstra connected to regional Australia’s future. The only way we can do that is to make sure that it remains in government ownership, so the people can have some control as to where the services go. We are seeing in my electorate of Bendigo the loss of 300-odd jobs from Telstra as the government prepares for privatisation. We have been fortunate enough to pick up another big call centre, which was announced last week, with some 600 new jobs. That is going to be a big help, but I cannot see the point in trying to establish Bendigo as the regional Australian call centre capital, mainly because of the infrastructure that was put there by Telstra, and now that infrastructure is being slowly stripped away. The 600 jobs are welcome, but it is nowhere near enough. I would like the Prime Minister and, indeed, the Treasurer to visit my electorate of Bendigo and I would take them up to a place called Korong Vale, a little town about 70 to 80 kilometres north of Bendigo. It was once a thriving rail town. To be fair, the Victorian state Labor government closed down its rail hub because of a change in the carriage of wheat, so both major parties have been guilty of this privatisation mania. But nowhere is it so evident as in Korong Vale. I do not know if honourable members remember the old western movies when the cowboys ride into the ghost town and there is tumbleweed blowing down the street. That is Korong Vale. There are only 1½ businesses open: the corner store is open for normal business hours and the hotel is open in the evenings only because the publican has a day job in Bendigo. They are the only two people employed there. You can buy a house there for $8,000 to $10,000. You cannot buy a litre of petrol in Korong Vale-you have got to drive to Wedderburn for it. Other areas in my electorate, like Dunolly and Wedderburn, are experiencing similar problems. They are mainly populated by elderly people, pensioners, people on benefits. As the infrastructure has been taken out of those areas, they just get poorer and poorer, with little hope for the future. 14964 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 16 March 2000 I commend this report. It has some very worthwhile ideas in it, not the least that great Labor idea of decentralising government departments. I am looking forward to the government getting on with the job and implementing it, but I remind the House again: time is running out. It is a great title for the report: Time running out. Time is running out for the Howard government. the report Time running out: shaping regional Australia’s future, by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Primary Industries and Regional Services. I was a member of the committee, along with the member for Braddon, who is here on the other side of the chamber, and a number of other excellent members who participated in quite an extensive inquiry over a 12-month period, receiving numerous submissions and conducting hearings and inspections throughout the country. It is a good report. There will be many aspects of it that I am sure people will not agree with and perhaps there is a number of recommendations that individual members of the committee probably do not totally agree with, but we worked very well together to come up with something that all of us could accept. There has been a number of reports over the years into aspects to do with regional Australia and infrastructure. One of the recurring issues that comes through time and time again, and which also came up in some study I did within the OECD recently, is that in areas outside the major cities that seem to have done well in the last couple of decades, one of the most common denominators in those regions is very strong local leadership and entrepreneurship. That does not necessarily have to come from the state, federal or local government members. That leadership, more often than not, comes from the community, through the chambers of commerce, individual entrepreneurs, et cetera. When you look around in a regional area where there is generally some backwardness, you will often find a glowing light, a particular town or region doing particularly well, and there you will find some excellent leadership that has been there for some time. That is why this inquiry report contains some recommendations dealing with leadership at that local level-for instance, leadership recognition and award programs, a centre for regional development best practice and a regional development fellowship fund for university placement of regional fellows. All these are about improving leadership at that local level. One of the other aspects I want to speak about-this is a very extensive report, so I am not going to speak on all of it here today-is planning and coordination. A significant recommendation reads: The committee recommends that the Commonwealth government establish a National Infrastructure Advisory Council (NIAC), with expertise from the public and the private sectors, to facilitate the efficient and equitable provision of national infrastructure by both public and private sector stakeholders. This key recommendation is the basis for many of the other recommendations, and concerns an aspect that a number of groups in the community have been pushing for some time. The Institution of Engineers highlighted to me a couple of years ago, in private conversations, that such a council should be formed to look from a national perspective at identifying needs of national infrastructure and how that can be put together. Another aspect of planning and coordination that I would like to mention is dealt with in recommendation 11: the upgrading, the accelerated acquisition and the sharing of data, including land, geographic, economic and social data, to better facilitate base information needed for infrastructure planning. This is something dear to my heart, as I spent 25 years in surveying and mapping, constantly battling to get more money into the national mapping program for that base mapping. It may be very hard for people who have not worked in that area to understand the benefit of having decent and up-to-date base mapping-particularly nowin a form that can be used by a variety of people in both the public and private sectors. A re-",124,Representatives Main Committee
244,Mr Nairn (Eden,"Monaro) (11.33 a.m.)-I am certainly pleased to speak on the tabling ofThursday, 16 March 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 14965 n a form that can be used by a variety of people in both the public and private sectors. A recent incident has highlighted this. During the current debate about the southern New South Wales Regional Forest Agreement there have been problems for landowners potentially affected by proposals for reserve. I went to the state bureaucrats and said, ‘Show me within your system the land tenure for these people overlaid by the proposal that you have for reserves.’ They could not do it. I am still to determine why they could not do it, because I think they should have that information, but it highlights that there are some inconsistencies between databases and so on at federal and state levels. If you are going to have any decent planning for the future, you really need to have that sort of information on tap. That is why that recommendation is there, and I would very strongly encourage the relevant government departments to look at that and see how they can respond actively to it. I will mention just a couple of other things, the first being transport. Two matters mentioned in the report are of particular relevance to my electorate of Eden-Monaro. One is the proposal, which I very strongly support, for a very high speed train between Sydney and Canberra. If Australia is to reconnect with many of the bush areas-and I think there is a disconnection-we need some of the technology for physical reconnection, and fast train technology has the capacity to do that, as shown in the reconnection of various regional towns in Europe to the major cities. Lille, in northern France, is an example: an area which has been depressed because of the closing down of traditional industries-in this particular case, coal mining and textile-has been able to re-establish itself in completely new respects because of the very fast train connection. This technology has a huge potential to allow people in rural and regional areas to gain access to major capital cities throughout Australia. The other transport matter I want to mention is the Eden port, which is mentioned in the report. Once again, I think strategic port upgrades in various parts of Australia can capitalise on new types of shipping and other trading activities. The Eden port is an example of that and we are currently awaiting a report by the Public Works Committee into the munitioning facility for Eden. The multipurpose wharf that would go with it would have potential, over and above the naval facility, for development right throughout the south-east of New South Wales, not just in my electorate of Eden-Monaro. It would be of great benefit to many parts of eastern, north-eastern and central Victoria as well. In conclusion, it is a good report. There has been in more recent hours-it is not even days-some comments about the city-country divide, particularly from one of my colleagues. I will not debate that issue with him now, other than to say that I think this report should be looked at very carefully. I think the comments that he has made raise the debate in some respects and that will probably be quite good, but there is a lot to work through with this report. I enjoyed working with the committee on it as well as with the secretariat, who did a great job. All members worked extremely well together and there is a lot of information for all members to take on board and certainly for government to work through as well. Shaping regional Australia’s future, and I would like to thank the members for Barker, Eden Monaro and Kennedy for their contributions to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Primary Industries and Regiional Services. It was an excellent group, all from regional seats and with the best interests of regional Australia at heart. It is just terrific to be able to work in the parliament with people with that goodwill, expertise and enthusiasm. If the public were more aware of this side of what it means to be a member of the federal parliament, then they would have a different view of the value and worth of our job and the Com-",126,Representatives Main Committee
245,Mr Sidebottom (Braddon) (11.42 A.m.),"I rise to comment on Time running out:14966 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 16 March 2000 monwealth. It was a great learning experience for me and I do thank them for their goodwill, expertise and friendship. There were 92 recommendations in the report, some of them quite contentious for all parties involved. One of my recommendations-make it No. 93 if you like-would be that all parties read them carefully, take them on board and then, hopefully, positively influence regional policy. I do not care whether they are Liberal, Labor, or Callithumpian. I think regional Australia is certainly the flavour of the month; it should have been the flavour of the years. The title is provocative, but at the same time it might be quite accurate. I think we will all learn from that. I would like to expand a little more on some of the issues I mentioned in the adjournment debate as they relate to my electorate in particular. I agree with the member for Eden-Monaro about the importance of leadership and local skills in the development of regions and their communities.The most successful are those that have had from the ground up leadership. At the same time, the role of government in all this would be to help facilitate it with a bit of a hand-up, if you like, rather than the handout mentality. There are a number of excellent recommendations in here in terms of assisting communities and partnerships in developing leadership skills at the local level. It is great news to know that, after much parochialism, the nine councils in my electorate have got together and created the Cradle Coast Authority. Its charter is to act as a lobby for the region as a whole-we now represent 88,000 people, not a lot compared with many other regions but certainly very significant in Tasmania-and its structure is rather interesting. The directors will be nominated from the business, education and municipal communities, and a secretariat will be giving advice. This will be a proactive organisation funded and chartered by the councils but at the same time having that independent directorship. I think that is terrific, and I applaud those who brought it about. I am very pleased to see that it would fit in very much with the recommendations of the committee, and we look forward to the policies emerging from the parties supporting this type of organisation. I know my colleagues here can cite a number of similar examples. As we went throughout regional Australia and visited many centres, I was very pleased to see that the most active ones really did have regional organisations that were led from the ground up and that people felt they had ownership. They were generating their ideas, finances and so forth, and I thought that was terrific. Another area continually highlighted throughout the report-and I was pleased to be able to make some contribution here-is the whole question of education and its impact on regional development. I think it is worth stating in particular the disadvantage that regional areas suffer because of distance and remoteness. Distance, of course, does not mean many thousands of kilometres. We all come from regions where, unfortunately, our students have to travel. The communities themselves suffer for this, because education is a very important part of our social fabric-of its social capital and its human capital. But generally speaking, and particularly in the chamber, we hear the bottom-line economic stuff and you sometimes wonder what economies exist for. I thought they existed for people. One thing that comes out in this report is that people are important. People live in regional Australia, as they do in metropolitan Australia, and therefore we have to try our darnedest to make sure there is a bit of equity. That is what this report is all about, and I think we subscribe to that. It is very important that we do actually bring some practical result to educational values and access in regional areas. I would like to give you an example in my own electorate. We have a campus of the University of Tasmania in Braddon. It is a very nice campus, physically very nice indeed. It has one year of some faculties, and you can also do some postgraduate Thursday, 16 March 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 14967 studies in primary sciences-which it is very good at-but basically you have to leave after one year. I am sure others in this chamber can also give similar examples. Like a lot of other areas in regional Australia, the retention rates in my area are very poorin fact probably some of the poorest in Australia. The incentive to go on to years 11 and 12 and then further is very difficult, but if you can do only one year it makes it even more difficult. Let us follow the people from our regions who do go on to university, those who have the incentive and are encouraged to go on. What happens? They go to the metropolitan area, and they are up for an impost above and beyond those people who live in metropolitan Australia. It is a basic discrimination. I have estimated that living away from home imposes an extra impost of between $5,000 and $10,000. There is no alternative unless you are on youth allowance or the equivalent of Austudy or break your studies, take up a traineeship, get to your $14,000 and then access all these funds. It is not fair. It is as simple as that. This report labelled it a national disgrace. It did not get a lot of coverage, except in my electorate-by chance. It is a national disgrace. Mr Secker interjectingWhat are we going to do about it? By assisting with living away from home, you can genuinely help people further their education. I think it is something we have to look at-I think it stinks, frankly, but we could not have that in a report-and I am sure that every member in this chamber would support that. As soon as you mention figures, of course, the bean counters go berserk and ask, ‘Do you know how much this would cost?’ That is not my job. AllI know is that people need assistance. In relation to telecommunications, we are constantly hearing about Telstra and its dividends, and they are very excellent dividends too, but in the same breath we hear about the loss of jobs. Somehow or other, people are able to equate these and get something positive out of it. I am a bit slow in economics-unlike some of my colleagues on the other side, the member for Barker in particular-but it is a basic fact that there should be equity of access to telecommunications. How we go about it we will debate and argue until the cows come home, but the point is it has to happen. I want to home right in on a major problem. I did a telecommunications black spot audit in my electorate. Here it is, and I am quite happy to share that with anyone in this House. In fact, members of a lot of regional seats could go away and do it. It actually worked and I was very pleased with it. There was nothing startling or sensational asked. I asked people basic questions about it. One of the things that comes out in regional Australia is that in a lot of instances they get shocking TV reception. The Commonwealth has just passed a terrific piece of legislation, and I do commend the government for having this in their Broadcasting Act. Basically, it said that, if you are in a remote area and you are getting poor television reception, once it is verified you will be given permission to receive satellite reception-a very simple, basic principle. There are some downsides to that. The first one is that you do not get local content, although I am sure some people in here would agree that that does not matter at all because of the as and whatever else. The other downside is that to get satellite receiving equipment costs about $1,200 to $1,500, and I have seen some estimates of up to $2,000. Here we have people discriminated against because they cannot properly access terrestrial signals. They can then go through a means of satellite reception, and they are paying above and beyond their cousins in metropolitan Australia for it. It is as though they are living away from home. So how can we assist them?",127,Representatives Main Committee
246,Mr Sidebottom,"I do not care whether it is Liberal, Labor or anything else, brother.14968 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 16 March 2000 If you want to look at an economically responsible way of doing it, why can’t we subsidise or discount the cost of the satellite dish, the decoder and the smart card? You could do that quite simply. The Australian Broadcasting Authority must verify the black spot status. That help could then be implemented either through the taxation system or through getting a direct government discount of 50 per cent, as they do now with the ISDN satellite service subsidy, to assist those people. One thing that is not very well known throughout Australia is that, if you are receiving relatively poor signals now on your terrestrial reception, when high density or standard digital television does come in you will get a black screen, a blank screen. It is like a flood in a valley and the only safe way is up. It strikes me that the satellite means is the way to do that. So, again, that is a problem that we will experience further down the track and more and more people will be forced into the satellite option. I know the government have a black spot program under way; they have a TV fund under way. That is terrific. They are using the Telstra funds. This should be budgeted online stuff, not some handout because they have sold off Telstra and said, ‘If you behave yourself you can have a bit more.’ This is online budgeted stuff, and it should be. Granted, these programs are going ahead, but it will not assist small hinterland communities like my own. For example, if you want SBS you basically have to have a 10,000-person critical mass to access the funds. In Tassie, that is a lot of people. I would like a lot of people in Tassie. We are doing the best we can to get them, as you know, Mr Deputy Speaker, but the point is we do not qualify for that program. These are serious questions that we have to look at. Satellites are the means, and I think there is a way to assist people to access satellites. I think it is pretty fair. Let’s face it, you can get sales tax exemptions for lots of things. Let’s hope there will be a few more GST exemptions for things. But it is fair and it can be verified. It is little mentioned in the report, but it is there and I hope we can do something about it. In the last few minutes remaining to me, I would like to commend the committee on its recommendation that the Commonwealth government work with the Tasmanian government and the private sector in implementing the Bass Strait passenger equalisation scheme as soon as possible. We met with the National Sea Highway Committee in Longford, Tasmania. It was a beautiful day and a beautiful place. The member for Lyons entertained us that day and night-and we can remember it, which is very nice. Essentially, it means recognising Bass Strait as part of the national highway system, so that you work out assistance for transport in terms of a cost per kilometre, just as we do on the national highway system now. It basically means that all Australians will have equal rights and access to a truly national highway for the purposes of interstate transport, at an equal cost on a cents per kilometre basis regardless of destination. To achieve this would mean altering the Australian Land Transport Development Act so that, in the same way that vehicular ferries forming part of a ‘road’ between mainland capitals and crossing bays and rivers can be declared part of the national highway, ferries to Tasmania could be included and the national highway would continue across to Tasmania. I notice that my good friend the member for Groom is smiling. He is also a member of the committee and made a very valuable contribution. Mr Secker interjectingwe were in Longford. It is a great concept and one that I think all parties should look at in terms of equity of access to Tasmania. The benefits not just to Tasmania but to Victoria and to",129,Representatives Main Committee
247,Mr Sidebottom,"We are great mates. He was absolutely taken by this concept whenThursday, 16 March 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 14969 the Commonwealth government are considerable. As one plank in a regional policy platform, it would do more for Tasmania than any other policy that I know of at the moment. I will be urging my colleagues and those on the other side, as well as the state government, to support this. It was a privilege to be part of the committee. (Time expired) of the House of Represtatives Standing Committee on Primary Industries and Regional Services with a great amount of pleasure. Let me say firstly that we should not be confused about the timing of this report. I do note, without criticism, the member for Bendigo’s comments about the Victorian election. It should be recognised that this report was started well before the Victorian election; in fact, nearly 12 months before that election. All members of this committee should be congratulated for their foresight in recognising the problem of infrastructure in rural and regional areas. I certainly commend the contribution by one of the previous speakers, the member for Eden-Monaro-not only for his speech here today but for his expertise over the entire course of the inquiry, especially in those areas which he noted today, such as planning, where it is so important to get the right result. I also say the same for the member for Braddon, who ensured that we never forgot the educational needs of country areas. I note that today he raised the matter again. He certainly made a very important contribution on that topic. I also note that he talked about the Bass Strait highway proposal, which I have no problem agreeing with. In fact, we have the same problem with Kangaroo Island and Investigator Strait. We believe that it should be classed as the road to Kangaroo Island and incur the same facilities and costs as anyone else incurs on a national highway. I would like to commend the chair of the committee, the member for McEwen, who often gave us wise counsel and worked very hard over the entire period of this inquiry. Overall, it certainly was a pleasure to work together for the betterment of country areas. We worked together as a committee and did not concern ourselves with party politics but with what was right for country areas. We all represent country seats, so it was a pleasure to be part of such a committee. As the member for Braddon said, it is a pity that more people in Australia could not see the way in which we cooperated in this committee. With respect to services being lost in the bush, we often hear that we do not get the services in the bush that city people get, and that is certainly the case. We have lost some services over the years. The committee received a lot of evidence to suggest that many of those services were reduced by state governments-I might add, of all persuasions-and not the federal government. However, it seems that if we are to ensure that the needs of country people are met, the federal government will have to do it, because unfortunately the states either do not have the financial backing or do not have the will to do so. We did see some good news over the period of this inquiry, for example, when we visited the Renmark filtration plant in South Australia. This was a water scheme that was processed through a BOOT scheme and, in actual fact, it now gives better water to the rural areas that it services than the city water of Adelaide. That is something I often boast about. This was actually done by a state government, so they should be congratulated for that. Anecdotal evidence will even suggest-and it is often said with humour-that now that water filtration plant is up and running under the BOOT scheme, which is recommended in quite a few areas of this report, they can now actually wear white shirts. You can wash them in the water; and now you can actually see the bottom of the cisterns after you flush them, whereas previously you could not see it. So you have some very practical reasons for having those sorts of things.",130,Representatives Main Committee
248,Mr Secker (Barker) (11.57 A.m.),"I rise to speak to the motion to take note of the report14970 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 16 March 2000 I will refer to some of the recommendations and comments throughout the report. One refers to the universal service obligations, which were brought in by the Howard coalition government. Box 5.1 of the report states: Following deregulation of the telecommunications industry, a Universal Service Obligation (USO) was designated requiring the telecommunications industry to ensure that ‘standard telephone services are reasonably accessible to all people in Australia on an equitable basis, wherever they reside or carry on business’. I thought that was a very important point to make. Recommendation 19 also states: The committee recommends that the Commonwealth government require telephone carriers to meet levels of service established under the Customer Service Guarantee for all customers, regardless of location. It is very important that rural areas have at least the same or similar access to the normal landline telephones and to mobile telephones as well. Another recommendation dealing with telecommunications was recommendation 20, which states: The committee recommends that the Commonwealth government require telephone carriers to develop pricing, technical standards and levels of support for telecommunications services that are independent of distance. Again, this backs up the thrust of this whole report that telephone services should be on an equitable basis, whether you live in Sydney or the Australian equivalent of Timbuktu. Recommendation 21 states: The committee recommends that the Commonwealth government fund alternative communications solutions for rural and regional Australia through the Regional Telecommunications Infrastructure Fund program. Digital broadband microwave link technology is an example of an alternative technology that could be considered. Mobile telephony is a very important issue in rural areas, and I do not suppose we will ever get exactly the same service that you do in cities, although who knows what is possible in the future with satellites and satellite phones. If the prices can come down on that, not only on the hardware but also on the user charges, I think we could get the same access, but there will probably be some need for subsidisation. On page 87, point 5.53 states: Mobile telephony outside of large regional centres is presently unreliable, inadequate, patchy or non-existent. I do not think any member of this chamber would suggest otherwise. It was the dominant feature of many submissions and information provided to the committee during regional visits. It certainly is a big issue out there. Provision of mobile telephony in regions is an economic issue. Major regional industries are not supported either in situ or during transportation of produce and that therefore reduces the competitiveness of regional business. Tourism, a growth area in many regions, is also impacted. Often you can go on a simple houseboat trip on the Murray River, for example, and your phones just simply will not work. must admit that has been improving and I am very confident that, when the CDMA rollout occurs, we will have a far better service than we had with digital. Recommendation 22 is: ... the Commonwealth government monitor the competitive provision of mobile telephony to regional Australia and, if market stimulation of carrier roaming is not evident by August 2000which is only a few months awayit should require roaming arrangements between all carriers.",131,Representatives Main Committee
249,Mr Sidebottom,You can find that on the national highway.,132,Representatives Main Committee
250,Mr Secker,"That is true. I note that quite often, even in my own electorate, although IThursday, 16 March 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 14971 It is very important that we try and get those carriers to work together so that regional areas do get service. It also recommends, in recommendation 24: ... the Commonwealth government adopt policies and mechanisms that require carriers to prioritise delivery of telecommunication services, so that areas already unserved are not further disadvantaged. Again, that is trying to ensure that we have better services in rural areas. Recommendation 28 is: ... the Universal Service Obligations be extended to include internet access for all regional Australians, and that the delivery of the Universal Service Obligation be undertaken so as to ensure promotion of competition in the provision of telecommunications infrastructure in regional Australia. We must ensure that we have Internet access for as many Australians as possible. It is not only important for business; it is important for education and it is important for a normal way of life. I can see the time in the not very distant future when faxes will be almost obsolete and we will be using email, so the Internet is very important so that we can bring the world to the people, rather than having them have to travel so far to achieve the same sort of advice. Recommendation 33 is very important on a practical basis. It deals with the need for audits to actually work out what we really need. We can all get up here as politicians and have our ears bent by different people in different walks of life, so we do tend to respond to whoever happens to have spoken to us. But the committee recommends: ... the Commonwealth government work with state, territory and local governments, communities and carriers, to determine the extent of existing telecommunication infrastructure in regions through audits, so that this infrastructure is considered in the development of regional telecommunication solutions. It is important that we have this audit so that we really do know where we are going. Recommendation 55 is in a different area-transport. That is very important to regional and rural areas. We rely on transport far more than any other part of Australia. The committee recommends: ... three cents per litre of the excise collected from fuel sales be preserved for expenditure on transport infrastructure. Of this three cents, two cents per litre should be devoted to the construction and maintenance of regional roads. It should be noted that this is providing extra money, over and above what is already provided to governments in Australia-for example, at the moment $380 million is provided to local government. Here is a way that we can perhaps double that amount so that the regional and rural areas and the local councils have the much needed money to spend on their roads. I know from personal experience in 11 years in local government that it is a continuous issue out there because councils, many of them small in population but larger in road networks, simply do not have the money to maintain and improve the roads to a satisfactory level. The simple fact is that, as a government, we collect something like $12 billion a year in excise, yet only about $7 billion is actually returned to roads and transport. I believe there is a fair bit of leeway to enable us to ensure that more money is spent on roads in country areas, which are so important to us. If we cannot travel-for business, for pleasure, to get our kids to school or for whatever reason-we are certainly not as well looked after as city people. Paragraph 7.131 highlights a lack of planning, saying: The Australasian Railway Association cited Mt Gambier as an example of transport infrastructure provision that had occurred without integrated planning. As a result, we have got huge imposts on our roads from road transport, as I know from my experience as the member for Barker. I am pleased to say that the government did provide $100,000 for a road study for the south-east of South Australia. That road study, which has just been completed, shows a real need for future planning for roads in that area. It is very 14972 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 16 March 2000 much an expanding area, with lots of heavy transport because of the timber industry, the grape industry-the vineyards-the wine tourism industry and the fish industry. At the moment, the roads certainly are not coping with the loads they have and the loads that are planned to come with the burgeoning blue gum industry in the south-east and the western areas of Victoria. It is very important that we have planning so that we have the proper road needs for our area. I note also a reference to the Alice Springs-Darwin railway line-again an initiative of our government. Unfortunately, time is getting away from me, but I must mention electricity. This is a very important area that we need to address. Paragraph 8.11, quoting from a submission, says: The availability of adequate power particularly 3-phase supply remains a major impediment to development … I certainly see that and I am sure that other members of the committee saw it. (Time expired) on the motion to take note of the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Primary Industries and Regional Services. The report is entitled Time running out: shaping regional Australia’s future. I will begin by reading from the report a quote which I think is pretty right: Action is needed to ensure that many regional communities don’t just survive but learn to thrive once again. Without action to stop the reduction of services still occurring throughout many areas and a new focus for investment in regional Australia, we face the danger of Australia being divided into ‘two nations’ … I am now going to read out a series of quotes which I think are very far from right-I think they are completely wrong and completely abhorrent. The first is this: The Grapes of Wrath was about the Oakies who recognised they had to get out of a dust bowl and go to California … The next quote is this: It’s up to people in the bush to create their own future-for those who can’t, don’t ask us to make the world spin slower. The next is this: If you choose to live 500 kilometres from a major metropolis, you are not going to have a five-star teaching hospital and a battery of specialist doctors, and you are not going to have the same level of access to the media, telecommunications and other services, and that’s a fact of life. In the long run the solution is not to force ever greater service obligations on Telstra, but to introduce genuine competition. And there is more to come: If you make the choice to go out to a remote part of Australia you get certain benefits. If you want to live in my electorate of Parramatta … you pay $300,000 for a four-bedroom house. Now you can buy that four-bedroom house in Walgett or Burke or Collarenebri for about $50,000. There are upsides and downsides. That is a series of quotes which I do not think are anywhere near right. And the last one from that gentleman is this: If you find yourself unable to find a job in a regional centre … you ought not to expect the rest of the country to underwrite your choice to stay there. You would have thought that the next quote I am going to read out would be inconsistent with those first few, but apparently that is not the case: It’s true that the great enclaves of poverty are in regional and remote areas.",132,Representatives Main Committee
251,Mr Zahra (Mcmillan) (12.12 P.m.),"I welcome the opportunity to speak in the debateThursday, 16 March 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 14973 Any sensible person would have thought that the first five of those statements were inconsistent with the last. Apparently that is not the case, however, as far as this person’s thoughts are concerned. I want to state clearly that I am not surprised to say that the person who made those comments is a Liberal. The person who made those comments is none other than the Liberal member for Parramatta. The mask has dropped and the Liberal Party stand exposed and naked in front of the world in regard to their true attitude towards rural and regional Australia. This person, the spoilt child of the establishmentMr Ian Macfarlane interjectingare probably agreeing with my comments. It is disappointing to hear these comments, even if they are from the Liberal member for Parramatta. I think most people would agree that he is churlish and brain dead at the best of times, moronic and often half-witted. This represents the worse type of middle class snobbery and it is a view which I could understand would be typical of that inner city suburban Liberal lawyer’s viewpoint which has started to dominate, or which has always really dominated, as far as Liberal Party policy goes. I want to address some of the comments which the Liberal member for Parramatta has made. He states: If you make the choice to go out to a remote part of Australia you get certain benefits. If you want to live in my electorate of Parramatta ... you pay $300,000 for a four-bedroom house. We do not necessarily choose where we live. We live there because we are from there; we are proud to be from those areas. We did not come from inner-city Sydney or inner-city Melbourne and say, ‘I have a house here which is worth $500,000 or $600,000. I am going to choose to leave all of that and head out to the Latrobe Valley because I can buy a house there for $20,000 or $30,000.’ That is not right; even though Ross Cameron, the Liberal member for Parramatta, believes it, it is not right. I think most people in the chamber representing, as they do, rural electorates, will find that type of attitude abhorrent. They should stand against, and voice their criticism of, the Liberal member for Parramatta and his views. Unchallenged, those views become the views of the Liberal Party. It is up to the Liberal Party and their coalition partner, the National Party, to come out and repudiate clearly those views-not to quietly mutter in corners that they disagree, but to come out and boldly state their vision for rural Australia. It has to be a better vision than that articulated by the Liberal member for Parramatta. The comments made by the Liberal member for Parramatta are typical of the Liberal Party in so many ways. They are ignorant of reality and, for those of you who have actually read the book The Grapes of Wrath, they are ignorant of literature. When the Liberal member for Parramatta makes the comment, ‘The Grapes of Wrath was about the Oakies who recognised they had to get out of a dust bowl and go to California,’ he does not understand that The Grapes of Wrath is a tragedy. It is a book of untold horror of a group of people who have been forced out of the community in which they and their families live. They are forced to sell everything they have at bargain basement prices and they lose everything they have to the banks, the corporations and all of the conservative political interests which are driving them off the land. They go out in an old truck to try to find any sort of work elsewhere. That is what The Grapes of Wrath is all about. It is a tragedy and it has bitterness throughout. It seems to me that in making the reference that somehow this book is a case study to refer to in terms of what the government should do today, the Liberal member for Parramatta is revealing the real strategy behind the government’s approach to rural and regional Australia.",134,Representatives Main Committee
252,Mr Zahra,"I am sorry, I missed that comment, but I think colleagues on the other side14974 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 16 March 2000 They want us all to become Okies: to get in our big old trucks, to load the beds on top, to load a couple of chooks on the back in a couple of cages, to get on the road and to start picking fruit somewhere for $12 a day. I think that is the real attitude which has been exposed by the Liberal Party in the comments made by the Liberal member for Parramatta. It is no surprise to me that the Liberal Party not only get it wrong as far as reality goes but also get it wrong as far as the truth in the literature goes. They have misquoted and misrepresented the ideas of Steinbeck in his book The Grapes of Wrath, and I am sure that Steinbeck would be appalled and would find abhorrent that there is a member of parliament going around using the horror, the terror and the tragedy of his book to try to advocate that people should leave regional areas and rural communities. That was never the intention of the book. The book was intended to expose the plight of those people in rural communities who were given a hard time by conservative political interests, big corporations and the banks all of those years ago. It is interesting to reflect on the fact that in the year 2000 we still have those same policies and attitudes coming from a federal government. We now have the attitude that maybe people should be encouraged to just get up and leave rural Australia, that maybe they should be forced to just become a travelling group of itinerant workers to be used from time to time to pick fruit or to do any other general labouring work whenever it is required. As far as the Liberal Party are concerned, we could just put them on a train every now and then and forget about them having any links to their community, forget about them having any rights to raise their kids in a place which has got a good school and forget about them having access to basic health services and rural telecommunications infrastructure-all those things. What the Liberal Party are on about is creating rural Australia in the image of the Okies of Steinbeck’s novel. They want to see this group of itinerant workers used as labour around the place whenever Sydney or Melbourne-the two beacons as far as the Liberal Party are concerned; the only two places which exist as far as the Liberal Party are concerned-need some work done. Maybe they could get a very big truck, put all the Okies in it and then ship us back into Melbourne or Sydney whenever there is a construction project going or maybe they could move us around wherever they need us to go and do a bit of work. member for Isaacs points out that we in rural areas could become like The Beverly Hillbillies, loading all of our stuff on the back of the truck and driving out wherever the government directs that there is a bit of work to do. That is all they want from us; that is the only vision they have for us. When people ask me what we in the Labor Party are about, I unashamedly say, ‘We are about a rural renaissance where rural areas in Australia are given the opportunity to excel, to build on their natural strengths and advantages.’ That is the vision which we in the Labor Party have for rural Australia. Unlike the Liberal Party, we do not have the view that we should become this itinerant group of workers, that we should drive around in big trucks wherever the work is going to be and not ask, as the Liberal member for Parramatta has suggested, for the world to slow down or to stop spinning quite so quickly. We are not intimidated by the changes happening in the world. We welcome the changes happening in the world, and we want to make them work for us, for rural Australia. That is the vision which we have. The only place in which the Liberal member for Parramatta thinks the world is spinning is Sydney-in the inner suburbs, in the affluent areas, in the places where you can buy a house for only $400,000 or $500,000. That is what he thinks civilisation is all about. That is what he thinks having any relationship with the world is all about. You can only have a relationship",135,Representatives Main Committee

Mr Deputy Speaker, they are wrong; they are badly wrong. With the changes taking place in information technology and with the emergence of the new economy, you can interact with the world from anywhere. In fact, it is better in so many ways and it is far more cost effective and economically sensible to have those interactions not from Melbourne or Sydney but from parts of rural and regional Australia. I will read again, for the benefit of members in this chamber and anyone else who might read this from time to time, what the Liberal member for Parramatta had to say only a day or so ago: The Grapes of Wrath was about the Oakies who recognised they had to get out of a dust bowl and go to California... I have to tell you, Mr Deputy Speaker: I do not consider myself to be an Okie; nor do I consider the Latrobe Valley to be a dust bowl. I am proud to come from the Latrobe Valley and we are far from being a dust bowl. Every rural member of this House should stand up to the likes of the Liberal member for Parramatta and his spiv mates in the Liberal Party and condemn what he has had to say about the areas that we represent. Where are you all? Where are you all standing up for your constituencies and condemning this sort of rubbish? ‘A dust bowl.’ Is that what they think of Tasmania? Is that what they think of rural New South Wales? Is that what they think of Far North Queensland or Western Australia? Why aren’t all the members of parliament who represent rural areas standing up and saying, ‘Ross Cameron, the Liberal member for Parramatta, you have got it wrong, sport. You have got it completely wrong.’ Every last member of parliament in this place should be standing against that viewpoint. The mask has dropped and the Liberal Party stand exposed for all of the world to see. This is how they view regional Australia: as a dust bowl. They view all of those rural electors, all of those good, decent, hard working rural people, as Okies. They should be ashamed of themselves. (Time expired) port some of the issues that are very important to regional Tasmania promoted by my colleague the member for Braddon. I have always understood that this is a non-controversial chamber. It is a chamber where we as a parliament work together to ensure that the interests of the people we represent are put first. I have just had that belief absolutely shattered. And by whom? By a person so interested in regional issues that he is not even a member of the Standing Committee on Primary Industries and Regional Services. He did not even take the time to travel, with the member for Braddon and other members of the Labor Party, the National Party, the Liberal Party, and even the Independent member, around regional Australia to get a first-hand look. He cannot even pronounce the names of the places. Let me give him a bit of a lesson: I was born in Boondooma. Does the member for McMillan know what Boondooma means? I doubt it. Does he have a heritage of regional Australia? The answer is no. He comes into this chamber, in an act of sheer political opportunism, to distract us away from one of the most important reports presented to this House in the short time that I have been a member of parliament. I congratulate the chairman of the committee, the member for McEwen, for her great guidance and leadership on producing the report. I congratulate all members of the committee for the time they spent, the time they gave up in their regional electorates, to go and see other people’s regional electorates so that we could gain a greater insight into regional Australia. I suggest to the member for McMillan that, instead of following around the minister for forestry to get his picture in the paper, he actually takes a bit of time to join committees like this and learn a bit about a bipartisan approach to government.",136,Representatives Main Committee

But just so that I can speak fromDebate interrupted; adjournment proposed and negatived. broad church. One of our flock this morning did what any good local member will do: he promoted the issues in his electorate. We do not object to that in the Liberal Party. I know that parties like the Labor Party take the malcontents out the back and thump the living daylights out of them. I have actually seen physical scars as evidence of that. But we in the Liberal Party allow our colleagues to speak out. Let us talk about the Liberal Party in terms of its regional credentials. We have more regional representatives in this House than the Labor Party and the National Party put together. Sure, they are level pegging; so we have basically got twice as many. That gives us greater coverage in more states on regional affairs than the member for McMillan’s party and the National Party put together. So let us not get dragged away with a bit of free speech. Don’t you allow free speech in your party? We do. The Liberal Party is out there listening to and speaking with the people that it represents right across regional Australia in every state. This attempt by the Labor Party to promote a great divide is nothing short of political opportunism, destroying the confidence of people in the bush-people who have contributed much to this nation and who, hopefully, if some of the recommendations in this report are adopted, will play their part in the economic development of Australia in years to come. That is what this report is about. It is about ensuring that we as a nation develop as one; that the opportunities that are granted to all people in all walks of life in Australia are shared equally between the cities and the regions. My concern about the statement by the member for Parramatta this morning was that he did not understand that if he works with regional Australia, we will help his constituents in the seat of Parramatta, because as the nation grows as one and as the economic benefits that flow through that permeate through our community, then all of us are better off. Again, that is what this report is about. It is about promoting economic growth for all Australians. It is about removing the impediments to development in regional Australia so that we will be able to play our part in ensuring that this great nation is even greater. It is about identifying economic opportunities; it is about encouraging the private sector to join with government to make investments in infrastructure or commercial opportunities, to provide jobs and opportunities not only for people in regional Australia but for people like the member for McMillan, who wants to move out to the bush and buy a cheap house. This report is about promoting opportunities and advantages in regional Australia. It is about both sides of government getting together to ensure that the future of regional Australians is secure and is able to provide a benefit and an opportunity for our children. The report identifies some key areas. I am in total agreement with one of the previous speakers, the member for Braddon, including on the issue of the land bridge to Tasmania but, more importantly, on the issues that he raised regarding education, skills and leadership training for regional Australia. These issues are so important. I noted an article in the Courier Mail this week which made some criticism of all parties-and, to a degree, I accept it: there needs to be greater leadership in regional Australia; there needs to be greater training, greater skills and greater education. This government is working towards that. This government is looking to provide those opportunities for regional Australians to take their place in our nation.",137,Representatives Main Committee

259,Mr Ian Macfarlane,"The Prime Minister often refers to the Liberal Party as aThursday, 16 March 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 14977 Another important issue raised in this report is telecommunications. Again, let me quickly dispel a myth. I want to dispel the myth that phone services in the bush are getting worse. Fifteen years ago, at Boondooma, I had a handle on the front of my phone. I wonder if the member for McMillan, who I notice has now left the chamber, ever had a handle on the front of his phone. I can assure him, in his absence, that in Boondooma they now have high-speed access to the Internet through an automatic telephone system and digital links. Telecommunications are improving in the bush, but not fast enough, and we are lagging a little in the opportunities that are being presented to some of our city cousins. But at the same time there are some technologies on the horizon which will tremendously improve not only the access to telecommunications but also the cost of telecommunications. I call on people to actually read through-rather than being distracted by the static-some of the excellent submissions that we received about some of the things that both the government and previous governments have done to improve not only Internet access but also telecommunications access. For instance, in a couple of weeks time-in fact, it may be next week: time flies when you are having fun-the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, Senator Richard Alston, is travelling to my electorate to launch a project which will give easier Internet access to southern regional Queensland. The federal government contribution to that is over $3 million. It is part of the RTIF and the social bonus packages that we have put out there, funded, of course, by the sale of the second tranche of Telstra. It is the sort of thing that is delivering better communications into regional Australia. This morning I am hosting a delegation from Toowoomba to talk to parliamentarians and ministers about another issue raised in this report-water. We currently have in the House a group from Vision 2000, an innovative and forward thinking group of people who are looking at ways of improving water availability in the Darling Downs region. It is the most fertile region in Australia, I have to say without a moment’s hesitation, but one where the problem is always going to be water. That project has enormous potential to bring much needed water to the Darling Downs, about 100,000 megalitres annually; also-and this is the best part of the story-it is in fact waste water, sewage for want of a better word, currently being pumped into Moreton Bay. To remove that from the environment of Moreton Bay, a wonderful, pristine area which a number of my colleagues represent, and to have that water brought into a region and produce $150 million worth of wealth annually, is a project which has already impressed the Minister for Environment and Heritage this morning and, hopefully, it will impress the Minister for Transport and Regional Services this afternoon. This report also highlights other water projects and the need for water projects in regional Australia. The Vision 2000 project in some ways is the epitome of what we are really promoting in this report. It will encompass local government-the Brisbane City Council is suggesting that it will make a significant financial contribution-the state government, which is currently doing some of the prefeasibility study on the proposal, and the federal government through some leadership and some coordination. It is those three tiers of government working together which again we call on in this report because when governments work together-and both sides of government work together-we can achieve the sorts of things in Australia that regional Australia so desperately needs. To reiterate, this report is about not just the sustainability of regional Australia but also the development and improvement of the opportunities in regional Australia and all Australia. Congratulations are due to the member for McEwen and, in congratulating her and my fellow colleagues on the committee, I should also congratulate the secretariat headed by Ian Dundas. They did a job which was at times arduous-and at other times very pleasant. 14978 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 16 March 2000 I have to say to the member for Braddon that he represents an area which is currently in great difficulty, an area of wonderful natural beauty and an area which I, as an Australian, would love to be part of addressing. The difficulties facing the residents of the electorate of Braddon, or of many other regional electorates in Australia, are issues of transportation isolation. With today’s technology, whether we are talking about a high-speed ferry across Bass Strait or an inland railway from Adelaide to Darwin or from Melbourne to Darwin, while I know the member for McMillan thinks we are doing nothing-and he does not even know where regional Australia is-the federal government is in there working and supporting the pre-feasibility study. Whether it is those sorts of transport links or whether it is air transport links to some of the Bass Strait islands or to Kangaroo Island, these are the issues that bring Australia together. These are the issues that resolve the tyranny of distance. These are the issues which we as a government and we as a parliament should be working together to overcome. If you can drive from one end of Australia to the other-and I do mean starting in Tasmania-if you can put fruit or produce on a high-speed freight train and freight it up to Darwin and then use high-speed water transport to run it across to our markets, those are the sorts of things that will provide the opportunities for regional Australia. This report is not about subsidising regional Australia. This report is about identifying the impediments, working to find the opportunities and bringing Australia together. This report is about ensuring that we do not get sidetracked into the petty arguments and the petty jealousies that have kept Australia divided and have given us three rail gauges that I know about-and probably a couple more that I do not. This report is about bringing Australia together. In closing, I can only say how proud I am to represent regional Australia. I represent regional Australia with a passion, with a heritage and with the experience of years of representing not only the grain industry but the farming industry in Australia as a whole. I only look towards the opportunities for regional Australia-(Time expired) Committee on Primary Industries and Regional Services is to be commended for the comprehensive report entitled Time running out: shaping regional Australia’s future. It has certainly made an impact and that impact will have far-reaching consequences, more so because the recommendations have generally had rare bipartisan support. The document is more than 380 pages long. That, of course, reflects the taking and hearing of submissions, public hearings, inspections and informal meetings throughout Australia. While very few of us have had the opportunity to read it in full, I will certainly be giving it close attention and I am sure that many ministers concerned about rural and regional development will be as well. BecauseI represent a regional and rural electorate, the recommendations in this report are of particular interest to me. It is very pleasing to those of us in the government, and I am sure in the broader community, that we have a booming economy. Yesterday the Treasurer, Mr Costello, predicted strong economic growth and low inflation, and that could be sustained for years to come. All of this followed on the December quarter national accounts data showing that the economy grew by 4.3 per cent in 1999. In fact, we have had 11 quarters of four per cent growth, unrivalled in the last 30 years. Of course, that is very heartening news. But as the standing committee’s report makes clear, the benefits of this boom are not always reaching all areas of rural and regional Australia to the extent that they should. I can certainly speak for my own electorate, where low commodity prices in sugar, coal and a variety of horticultural produce are causing a good deal of difficulty for farmers, for the millers and for the businesses that depend on the farming sector. The report noted:",138,Representatives Main Committee
260,Mrs Deanne Kelly (Dawson) (12.42 P.m.),"The House of Representatives StandingThursday, 16 March 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 14979 There has been a contraction of population resulting in a loss of skills in many regional areas and governments have focussed largely on metropolitan areas. Regional Australia’s contribution to the nation’s development has been well out of proportion to its influence on national affairs and policies. There is a growing sense of alienation and concern in many areas of regional Australia that their contribution continues to go unrecognised and that they are falling behind in health, education and technology. I commend the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Transport and Regional Services. Recently he gave a major address to the Outlook 2000 Conference in which he said: There are those in Australia that face some very serious challenges, and that applies to much of rural and regional Australia in particular. That is not to say that there are no other sectors of the community that face particular challenges, although I would like to say in passing that I see no reason at all why the national focus on the huge adjustment pressures being visited upon so many of our primary industries need somehow fuel divisions between city and country, as some commentators have seemed to suggest recently. Mr Anderson continued: If we fail to meet the reasonable expectations of country people, we will see this nation wrenched by political undercurrents that threaten to destabilise and undermine the foundations on which our economic prosperity is based. I have not heard truer words about the predicament of those in country areas. It is certainly a refreshingly honest acknowledgment of the reality that faces us. The report by the standing committee made reference to water. Currently, our national water infrastructure has a replacement value of $90 billion, yet more than half of that, $50 billion, is in urban areas. Underlining the importance of water infrastructure in rural and regional areas, the committee noted a submission attachment from the Hell’s Gates Development Council, outlining the benefits of the proposed Hells Gate dam on the Burdekin River, in the northern part of Australia. The council submitted that the dam would provide $740 million in increased agricultural production per year and generate 20,000 permanent jobs. I would also like to mention a water project in my electorate, the Elliott main channel, which would take water from the Burdekin dam down to Bowen, a battling little community. The dam and the Elliott main channel could open up 20,000 hectares of land-very productive land that at present is not being used at anywhere near its full capacity. It would obviously give opportunities for a huge number of jobs and an opportunity for those in Bowen who are unemployed at present, due to the closure of the meat works, to once again play a productive part in northern Australia. The report states: Through submissions and its visits to regional areas, the committee saw a number of examples where investment in water infrastructure has resulted in improved economic and social conditions through support for new industries and investment in regions. While dams may not be economically viable when first built, their eventual contribution to regional development is very substantial. That is a very important point and I certainly agree. The committee cited the Fairbairn dam at Emerald, in Western Queensland, saying: The Emerald Irrigation Scheme was developed in the late 1960s and 1970s, involving construction of the Fairbairn Dam and weirs and channels for irrigation, industrial and urban use … The benefits … have included: population increase in Emerald from 2 000 in 1966 to 11 000 in 1999; 25 000 hectares of irrigated farmland producing cotton, peanuts, horticulture, grain and beef; supply of domestic water to 6 towns and industrial water for coal mining; unemployment in the region steady at below 5 per cent; and development of supporting industries in the area including retail, health and welfare services, government agencies, education to tertiary level, sporting facilities and tourism development. 14980 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 16 March 2000 Nobody could walk through the town of Emerald and not be impressed with the bustling activity, the air of prosperity and the general enthusiasm of the citizens there for the future of their area. In my earlier remarks I cited the communique issued after the Regional Australia summit and I turn to that again. Motion (by Mr Wilton) unresolved: That further proceedings be conducted in the House. returned to the House for further consideration. Motion (by Mr Wilton) proposed: That the Main Committee do now adjourn. Mandatory Sentencing sentencing. This is an issue which has been unable to be addressed in the main parliamentary chamber due to the intransigence of the government and the refusal to have a proper debate on the bill carried by the Senate this week. This is a tragic debate which we should not be having in the year 2000. The Northern Territory’s Juvenile Justice Act provides that a 15or 16-year-old youth found guilty of a property offence for the second time must be detained for 28 days. There are economic costs but, more importantly, human costs to this tragedy. The costs to society in economic terms are that it costs taxpayers about $170 a day to detain a person in the Northern Territory. For example, Jamie Warramurra was jailed for the theft of biscuits and cordial on Christmas Day-one year’s detention for that, $62,000 for that year. Kevin Cook was jailed for one year for stealing a towel worth $15-another $62,000 of taxpayers’ money. Margaret Wynbyne was detained for 14 days for stealing one can of beer-a cost to taxpayers of $2,400 for stealing the equivalent of $2.40. The Wurramarrba boy who died in custody was detained for stealing goods worth approximately $50-he was detained more than 1,200 kilometres from his family. He was isolated. David Anderson from the Northern Territory Attorney-General’s Department stated that there have been only 113 juveniles convicted of a mandatory sentencing offence. That is 113 young Australians who have been jailed for minor offences who will now have a criminal record. According to the Northern Territory Legal Aid Commission, the Northern Territory imprisoned more than twice as many people per head of population as any other Australian jurisdiction. A study by the North Australian Aboriginal Legal Aid Service showed that 68 per cent of detainees sentenced under this system had a first language other than English. It showed that 63 per cent of detainees had an education level less than year 8 and 75 per cent of detainees were indigenous Australians. It is not hard to see where this is heading. Poverty and injustice are always companions. Overriding Territory laws is not without precedent. This parliament did it on the issue of voluntary euthanasia, led by the Prime Minister. Why is the government dragging the chain now? There are real humane alternatives. In New South Wales because of the Labor government we have judges and magistrates given the discretion as to imposing sentences, using guidelines handed down by the New South Wales Court of Appeal. These principles do not dictate the appropriate sentence but permit the judge or magistrate to consider all relevant facts. Mandatory sentencing was introduced in Australia before in 1883, but the laws were scrapped the following year because they were an abject failure.

It is inconsistent with the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child which Australia is also a party to, and it is inconsistent with common human decency to jail young people for stealing a biscuit, for stealing a texta or for stealing a towel. This is an outrageous law and it must be overturned. It is a populist stunt, nothing more and nothing less, which does not even achieve the objectives which it sets out. Quite frankly, the gutlessness of those people, such as the member for Hughes, who said that they were going to take action this week but did not have the guts to carry out their convictions, in spite of making themselves heroes in the press this week, just makes me feel embarrassed to sit in the same parliament as they do. (Time expired) Primary Industries and Regional Services Committee Report before the member for Dawson and I were so very rudely interrupted, and that is the presentation of the report by the Standing Committee on Primary Industries and Regional Services on rural and regional Australia and its development.

If you translate that onto the ground in a town like Julia Creek-and we had a resettle the inland meeting at Julia Creek and two of the councillors raised the issue-there are 330 kilometres of bitumen road in that shire on the two main state highways that intersect there. It is all bitumen, it has been there for over 25 years and it is all officially non-existent because roads last for only 25 years before they need to be replaced. None of it has been replaced, it is disintegrating at a very rapid rate and it will need a total rebuild rather than the sort of maintenance rebuild which can be done at this stage. If we remove the national competition policy guidelines from these councils and enable that work to be undertaken by the local councils, then this translates into $1.2 million a year for the Julia Creek shire, which is the McKinlay Shire, which will result in some 20-odd jobs and presumably 20 families moving back to Julia Creek, which has suffered a population loss of almost half its entire population over the last 20 or so years. Twenty families would be of incalculable value to the town of Julia Creek. The town of Julia Creek has lost its high school because, when we had the railway cutbacks foisted upon us by the ALP state government in Queensland and their national competition economic rationalist policies, the mid-west of North Queensland lost 600 or 700 jobs from the railways alone. Julia Creek, unfortunately, was one of the casualties. It lost its convent school-its little primary boarding school-and it also lost its high school. These are things that we could see returning to this area if in fact we could introduce this 2c a litre proposal. For those people who say it cannot be done, the late and great John McEwen-’Black Jack’ to the media-was in fact spending, in terms of today’s money, approximately $2 billion a year just on the beef roads scheme. We are talking here about state government roads, but that amount of money was for the beef roads scheme alone. The government of Australia is spending only about $1.2 billion or $1.3 billion on the entire road scheme for Australia. That $2 billion was in addition to that. That meant that a young person like me was able to make a very good living out of an insurance agency that I took up that nobody else wanted. It was the beef roads scheme that gave me the sort of inflow of business which enabled me to have a very successful business in that part of outback Western Queensland where jobs and opportunities in business were very hard to come by indeed. I wanted to stay home and live in Cloncurry, and that was about the only opportunity available to me. That opportunity was created by the great men who were in this",142,Representatives Main Committee
263,Mr Katter (Kennedy) (12.55 P.m.),"I would like to return to what I was speaking about14982 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 16 March 2000 place at that time. We can very easily reinstitute that greatness if we adopt this recommendation in the report. I pay a very fine tribute to all the committee members who put this report together. In addition, sometimes people say-and it is becoming a bit fashionable in the press to say it too-that we enjoy great subsidies in country areas. As to where all this economic rationalism came from, Mr Hilmer did a report on road transport in Australia and he pointed out that there was a $4,000 million a year subsidy provided to urban transportation systems. This committee heard evidence that that $4,000 million had blown out to $6,000 million a year in annual subsidies, and the tiny amount of money we are talking about here pales into insignificance when you compare the two amounts. (Time expired) Western Australia: Truck Drivers Ms GERICK (Canning) (1.00 p.m.)-If the tyranny of distance applies to Australia, then that tyranny is at this moment being most sharply felt by the communities in the north-west of Australia. Presently in the north of Western Australia there are a number of areas devastated by floodwaters, effectively isolating these communities from the rest of the state. It is reported that the Fitzroy River is expected to peak at 16 metres later this week, with no indication that water levels will subside at any time soon. You need only to read the newspaper to see that the damage has been extensive. Homes, businesses, livestock and food crops have been destroyed. The damage is not isolated to these areas alone. In the long term, we all know that the impact of this natural disaster will have far-reaching consequences beyond the areas currently affected. Past experience has shown that when the demand for fresh produce exceeds ready supply, the flow-on effect of this to the communities is felt at the cash register. Provision of fresh food items such as bananas, which Carnarvon is well known for, will simply not be available, and it is expected that supply will be severely affected for up to 18 months. It has been reported that in Kununurra alone, residents are experiencing severe shortages of essential food items such as meat, milk and vegetables. It is not known how long this disruption will continue. How many transport workers are cut off from their families and have had their means of income severely reduced? The latest report is that at least 200 truck drivers are currently stranded because of raging floodwaters. It is reported that some drivers have been stranded for up to 16 days and have been forced to live off the produce on the backs of their trucks and from community handouts. They are being forced to live without adequate toilet facilities and are facing the real threat of mosquito-borne viruses. We are all aware that truck drivers provide a crucial service to the isolated communities in the north-west with the provision of essential goods. You name it-food, medical supplies, housing, fuel, beer, everything. Without truckies there can be no mining, agriculture, farming, or any other kind of industry in these remote areas. The wheels of their huge trucks might not be turning but drivers are still incurring the ongoing costs of running their businesses. It is estimated that in some cases drivers are still meeting costs of up to $2,000 per week for truck repayments and insurance alone. Without any means of income, one cannot imagine how much longer their businesses will survive. There is already confusion, concern and speculation about how the GST will affect the transport industry. This government’s lack of concise information to the community about the full effects of the GST is concern enough for these battlers without the added pressure and concern brought about by this natural disaster. The Western Australian state government has Thursday, 16 March 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 14983 indicated that assistance will be offered to the Carnarvon region for specific flood relief, and has also promised long-term action to reduce flooding. It is well known that the federal government collects 36c in every dollar from fuel excise. It is time for the government to return some of this income by way of emergency financial assistance to those truck drivers stranded by the unpredictable floodwaters. It is without question that our truckies are the backbone of the nation. Without them, the wheels of our community would not turn. It is this government’s responsibility to step in now and provide much needed assistance to the drivers and their families. In times of crisis it is surely not unreasonable for these vital members of our community to expect and depend on the assistance of their state and federal governments. Primary Industries and Regional Services Committee Report previously-the report entitled Time running out: shaping regional Australia’s future. The subsidisation of city commuter transportation systems has now reached the level of $6 billion. Evidence was presented to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Primary Industries and Regional Services to this effect. Let us talk about subsidies. The cities get $6 billion, and there is nothing that you can point to that can come remotely close to that sort of figure. In addition to that, I took the top 20 export items to give me some idea of where our export earnings were coming from, and 94 per cent of our export earnings were coming from the mining and agricultural sector. One of the great recommendations in this document-along with the 2c per litre, which is of such vital value and importance to us-was that we move departments into regional areas. When we say ‘regional areas’ there seems to be some sort of an idea that we give something to a place like Townsville. Townsville, quite frankly, does not need a pest and weed research station. It means absolutely nothing to that community. Why you would put a research station for weeds and agricultural pests in Townsville, where there is no farming or agriculture whatsoever, is quite beyond the wildest stretch of my imagination. After 2¾ years of battling, we got the then Queensland government to site that research centre in Charters Towers. Thirty new jobs in Charters Towers means an awful lot to that community. In addition to that, every day of the week-whether it is at the P&C or the Lions Club or at church-those people interface with people who are coming to grips with the Acacia nilotica tree, rubber vine and Harrisia cactus problems. So they are socially interacting with the people who are going to pressure them to do the right thing and also the people who can provide them with information which is so vitally needed. It is unreal. One of the great reasons for poor government in Australia is that all of the agricultural industry departments are based in huge cities, completely away from the areas that they are supposed to interface with. The decision makers are remote in every sense of the word. They are not where they should be. An honourable member on the other side spoke earlier about the cost of education. We have gone from a situation where the government picked up the entire cost of secondary education in Queensland in the last year of the Bjelke-Petersen government. It was $6,000, and the whole $6,000 was paid by the state and federal governments. That figure has now decreased to $5,000, and the cost of boarding colleges in Charters Towers has moved up to $9,000. So we have a gap here now of $4,000 or $5,000, with transport and everything added. It is impossible for these people-unless they are rich or they get some special access to Aboriginal grants or something of that nature-to get an education.",143,Representatives Main Committee
264,Mr Katter (Kennedy) (1.05 P.m.),"I want to return to the subject. I was speaking about14984 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 16 March 2000 Moving on, the problems experienced by the sugar industry in the rural areas, which the member for Dawson and I represent, would not be problems if we had development banks. The late and great Black Jack McEwen introduced the primary industries bank, the AIDC bank. I think we would largely attribute to him the Commonwealth Development Bank, as we have known it over the last two or three decades. Government can secure money at a rate of five per cent interest at the present moment. There is no reason why they cannot pass that money on to people when the interest rate is 5½ per cent. I am not asking for it for my trawler men, who have been put under threat by the environment minister’s incredibly unbelievable and callous actions of the present moment, because they have no security value. The sugar farmers, on the other hand, have wonderful security value for a loan. So it is very safe to lend them money. If they can be loaned money with a five per cent interest rate, they will survive. In fact, a lousy $10 million subsidy on top of that, which would go back to the taxpayers instead of to the banks, would reduce that interest rate to 2½ per cent. I think almost every single one of our sugar farmers would pull through. At the present moment it is very doubtful whether even two-thirds of them are going to survive the current situation. This is the first time in 80 years that that industry has been asked to face up to the cyclical downturn, which they have regularly, without a development bank in place. You subsidise our loans at two per cent. What use is that to us? We are paying 11 per cent at the present moment. You are going to die on nine per cent interest rates. (Time expired) Four Corners: Treatment of Asylum Seekers last Monday evening’s ABC Four Corners investigation of the Howard government’s treatment of asylum seekers. It is my view that every member of this House should feel quite ashamed by the revelations contained in Monday evening’s program. It was a very serious program, dealing with four very serious issues. It dealt with mandatory detention of asylum seekers, a system that locks up all illegal arrivals, and locks up their children too. It locks them up for an indefinite time while their claims are being processed. It dealt with the contracting out of the deportation procedures to the private sector, in this case to a company called Australasian Correctional Management which is a subsidiary of the American multinational, Wackenhut, which operates prisons on the east coast of Australia and, indeed, across the world. The program dealt with the forcible and repeated administration of sedatives to asylum seekers, and it also dealt with the housing of asylum seekers in prisons in circumstances where no crime had been committed or has even been alleged. It is with regret that I note the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs shows every sign of delighting in a draconian attitude of harshness and strictness in his approach to the often most tragic circumstances of these asylum seekers. This Four Corners expose on Monday night was deeply disturbing not only for the evidence presented of serious violations of human rights but also for its revelation of the immigration minister’s belligerent defence of the appalling practices of his officials and the private sector contractors who now play such a key role in dealing with deportation cases. Australia unfortunately has an immigration minister who rarely, if ever, uses the terms ‘compassion’ or ‘humanitarian concern’ as part of his dialogue. Instead, it seems to me, there is always an eye to an appeal to the former supporters of Pauline Hanson and her One Nation party. The Four Corners program raises issues of fundamental human rights. Australia for our part is duty bound to speak up in defence of human rights and political freedoms overseas. That is our responsibility. But one has to observe that our ability to do so is irredeemably compromised when people fleeing from human rights abuse in their own countries are so often subjected to what can only be described as a form of institutionalised persecution here in",145,Representatives Main Committee
265,Mr Brereton (Kingsford,"Smith) (1.10 p.m.)-I rise this afternoon to speak briefly onThursday, 16 March 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 14985 Australia. The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs clearly prides himself on his zealous defence of his system. What a pity he cannot be as zealous in defending basic human rights and their application to those who come here seeking to escape persecution. The Four Corners program is to be warmly congratulated for this most revealing look at Minister Ruddock’s regime. It is a tragedy that the broader media have not paid more attention to this issue. I sincerely hope that this ABC program will prick the consciences of a great many people and encourage further investigative reporting. Beaudesert Heritage Tourist Rail Boonah Economic Development Institute regional Australia in downturn. While there are some areas that are doing it tough, others are clearly going from strength to strength, especially with the support of the Howard government. I want to share with this House this afternoon very positive good news stories about regional centres in my electorate of Forde. These are stories about the innovation and determination of local residents. I am pleased to say that the Howard government has given local residents their full backing, putting much needed funds into getting these projects off the ground. The first is the heritage tourist steam train from Bethania to Beaudesert. The railway line from Bethania to Beaudesert has not been operating for passengers for many years. In 1995, Queensland Rail disconnected freight services on this line. Since long before that, the local residents have been pushing for the line to be reopened to passenger services. This beautiful rural part of south-east Queensland has increasingly become a tourist destination, especially with the nationally recognised Country and Horse Festival in Beaudesert over the past few years. The shire is rapidly developing its tourist industry and recognising that this is a vital way of boosting local businesses and creating more jobs. The Beaudesert Shire Railway Support Group has put together a comprehensive plan to get a tourist steam train operating along this line. I am delighted that earlier this month, when the Treasurer was visiting Forde, we were able to announce that the project had been granted $76,500 in RAP funding from the Howard government to finally get the wheels moving along this track. I want to sincerely thank the local residents who have worked so extremely hard towards this goal and all the members of the railway support group, especially Jim Daynes, who put the submission together. The Treasurer commented how professional that submission was. I would also like to thank Jim for his tireless efforts in working within our community. This project has been greeted with much enthusiasm and optimism by local residents and there is enormous community support to help make this line a success. There was a double celebration when the Treasurer came to my electorate because he then visited the rural town of Boonah and announced that they also had received a grant, of $80,000, to develop the Boonah Economic Development Institute over the next two years. Last October the Deputy Prime Minister, John Anderson, opened the inaugural Boonah Economic Development Institute, a dynamic conference with delegates from all around Australia and New Zealand. It was a thrill to the townspeople to have so many people come and to have their town on display at that time. The conference delegates came together to share the ways that rural towns and regional centres can be revitalised. The institute is based on the very successful Nebraska rural institute concept. Last year’s institute was an enormous success and showcased the can-do attitude of the Boonah community, which is a truly shining example for rural communities throughout Australia.

I want to thank everyone involved in the institute-the Chamber of Commerce, the Boonah council, especially the mayor, John Brent, and also a very special lady in town who works on a number of projects in Boonah, and that is Wendy Creighton. This is a very dynamic and innovative project and I am delighted that my personal support has been backed by the Howard government’s funding. These two projects are an example of how the Howard government is helping rural communities to help themselves. We want to support the revitalisation of our towns, but we know that it is not just about throwing money around. It is about backing local groups who know the areas best and are passionate about making projects work. It is a common sense approach which is beginning to show results. I look forward to continuing to work with local communities throughout Forde to make these and other similar projects successful. I would also like to place on record the enormous amount of work that Deputy Prime Minister John Anderson does in rural Australia. I know he visits many towns. As I said, he has visited my area of Forde and he has promised to come back in the very near future. Our community groups within our rural areas are being innovative with our support and they do not want our bush people thinking that they are recipients of public money unnecessarily. They are equally appreciative of the confidence that we place in them. We do not actually tell them what to do. They show us what rural towns need and we are backing that support 100 per cent.
