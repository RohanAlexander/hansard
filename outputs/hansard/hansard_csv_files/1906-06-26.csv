The probity of the business men of the British race has always been claimed to be greater than that of any other business men in the world. business men of the United' States of America is not so good. that, Iby introducing a Bill of this kind, the Government are, to some extent, countenancing the party which has been said to decry the country we live in . people abroad view the matter? not appear to them that we have to depend upon drastic measures of the kind which have been adopted only in such countries as the United States, where great evils are known to exist ? call attention to the numerous conversations now proceeding; but there are five or six groups of honourable members conversing in somewhat loud' tones, so that it is not surprising that the honourable member for Grampians finds it difficult to make himself heard, and that it is almost impossible for me to follow what he is saying. ask the House, in courtesy to him, and to the 22,000 or 23,000 electors whom he represents, to listen to his speech in silence. seems to be that this Bill is intended to protect certain industries against evils which have not been shown to exist. I was pleased to notice that in the Governor General's speech, Ministers did not put into His Excellency's mouth words which they so frequently use themselves the "" a l leged "" tobacco monopolv was spoken of. I have looked into the evidence in regard to the supposed monopoly, and I have heard a great deal with reference to the combine associated with it . So far as I have been able to gather the facts, there is no absolute proof that a monopoly exists, or that the combine has been other than a beneficent, one. The tobacco manufacturers have joined forces with the view of lessening the cost of distribution, and not with the object of increasing Those honourable gentlethe price to the consumer or reducing the price to the grower of the leaf. That is the position in which the matter stands at present. We have heard a great deal with regard to the harvester trust, which has Australia, with a population been indicted on the evidence of interested persons. Some time ago a combination was entered into between the importers of harvesters and the local manufacturers. That was not what I would call a beneficent combine, because so far from having been entered upon for the purpose o t reducing the cost of putting the harvesters upon the market, it aimed at keeping up the price. The reputation of the So long ' as that combination existed the local manufacturers made no complaint, But it seems to me but when it came to an end they made loud complaints with regard to the injury that was being done by the sale of imported harvesters at low prices. It was How will stated by the local manufacturers last W i ll it year that some 1,800 machines were on their way to the Commonwealth, but we now know that only about 1,300 harvesters have been imported. The honourable and learned member for Angas told us that between 5,000 and 6,000 harvesters were sold to farmI am sorry to have to ers last year, and in view of the fact that only 1,300 harvesters were importedwe have no evidence as to how many, were sold-and that over 400 were exported, our manufacturers appear to have been doing remarkably well. I to any dumping. can scarcely complain of dumping as affecting them, when only 1,300 harvesters are imported as against the 5,000 or 6,000 sold to farmers. We have had no proof that dumping has taken place. The Minister was challenged by the honourable and learned member for Corinella to mention cases in point, but he deferred his reply until some other time. When the Minister was questioned on the subject, I remembered that I had heard that boots were dumped upon this market, and it occurred to me that the cry against dumping might have been raised by interested persons with a view to their own advantage. Upon one occasion a lady of my acquaintance went to a bootmaker, who",15,Australian Industries Preservation Bill Second Reading

30,Mr Skene,"The local manufacturersmade footwear for her, and told him that she was wearing a pair of American boots. He looked at the boots and said that they had never been out of Melbourne. Then, again, when I was in Sydney recently, I was told by a. gentleman well known to the Minister of Trade and Customs, and of the same political persuasion manufacturer there noticed in a shop window a pair of boots marked "" Best Parisian make, 32s. 6d."" He entered the shop, and said, "" Isn't this coming it a little too strong? from me for 8s. 6d."" The shopkeeper replied, "" That is perfectly true, but if I were to .offer them as Australian-made boots for 12s. 6d. a pair, I should not be able to find a purchaser, whereas I can sell them readily as Parisian boots at a much higher price."" est difficulty in distinguishing between dumping ancl dishonest trading. No doubt the prejudice on the part of the public is largely responsible for the deceptions that are practised. trade told me recently that the local manufacturers were doing very fairly under the present Tariff. for Moira spoke of the indebtedness of the farmers to Australian inventors. mit that the farmers have been, to a considerable extent, indebted to local inventors, but, on the other hand, the American manufacturers have some claim to our consideration. honourable member is old enough to remember, as I do, the English implements that were in use before American tools and implements came to this country. remember when we discarded the old No. 2 British axe in favour of the American axe, and also when we did away with the British pitchfork, with a great clumsy handle, ancl enough steel to make four American tools. rake was a great improvement upon the English tool. be the hay rake or the fork to the farmer easily regulate local combines. He admitted who had no crop to harvest? pitchfork would not insure to the farmer bines. a bigger harvest. the ploughs and the cultivators came before decreased, or increased prices be charged the forks and the hay rakes. provements have been made in agricultural implements owing to the opportunities which our manufacturers have had to study the necessities of the farmers. I am sure that if our local manufacturers were to rely more upon their own pluck and skill and good workmanship, instead of squealing out that they are being killed by the importer, they would stand a much better as himself, that a boot prospect of securing the market. I was glad to hear the honourable member for Moira state that he would not apply the proposed restrictions against dumping to importations from any portions of the BriYou bought those boots tish Empire. I would point out, however, that the greater part of the alleged dumping takes place in connection with goods manufactured in the Empire. The Massey-Harris Company are the strongest competitors of our local manufacturers in regard to agricultural implements. If There is the great, our manufacturers would combine to cheapen the cost of putting their articles upon the market they would act very wisely. Some time ago I interviewed the managers of both the Sunshine Harvester CompanyA traveller in the boot and the Massey-Harris Company, and they ' made no secret of the fact that they had entered into a combine with a view to The honourable member maintaining a certain price for their harI adone would do as I had done, and buy direct from the manufacturers instead of' putting them to the expense of sending travellers round the country, they would be able to sell their machines much more I do not know whether the cheaply. A combination among the manufacturers, or even between importers and manufacturers, with a view to lessening the cost of distribution, would be beneficial I can to the farmers. I think that we might try to get'along with some measures less drastic than those proposed in the Bill. The Minister claims that he has succeeded in breaking up the harvester combine. I presume that he means that he has succeeded In the same way the American hay in restricting their operations by increasing the valuation of the machines for the purpose of assessing the amount of duty. If he can succeed in breaking down outside that protection in Australia would have the High duties are bound to produce undue competition, and when that takes to the consumer.

There can be no question that in a limited market, such as we have, an industry, which requires more than a reasonable degree of protection is likelv to become the subject of undue competition. I think that the Minister is on the right track so far as local combines are concerned, but if reasonable protection were granted there would be no necessity for a Bil l of this kind. If the local combines engaged in any practice to the detriment of the public we could then allow the influences of free-trade to operate more freely. If the Minister contends that he will' be able to break down a foreign combine in, the way he has mentioned he may, with a great deal more reason, believe that he will be in a position to destroy any internal combine. governor of the industrial machine, one thing is necessary, namely, that its revision should be taken wholly out of the fighting line of party politics: No fiscal truce will suffice. It must be made a business, and not a political question. Prior to Federation, the States had arrived at some sort of settled policy in regard to this matter. New South .Wales had adopted a policy of free-trade, whereas the electors of Victoria Had supported a system of protection. Having arrived at some settled view upon this particular question, the States were afforded an opportunity for development, which the country will not have, so long as we continue quarrelling over it. Unless the Commonwealth arrives at some settled policy in this connection. I believe that our progress will be retarded. AlthoughI hope for much from the Tariff Commission's reports, I think that the recommendations of that body will, probablv. touch only the fringe of the subject. I well There is a much greater remember that Sir William McMillan, speaking in this very Chamber, pointed out the inequality of the incidence of taxation A very sensible protectionist in respect of cotton goods. The right honourable member for Balaclava also referred to certain other disabilities in regard to this matter. If the Tariff is to be made a means of governing the industrial machine, I hold that the fiscal question should be taken entirely out of the fighting-line He said that he did of politics, and some other method of dealing with it should be devised. ber agree to the taking of a referendum He said that 'he would prefer to upon the subject? that. What is in my mind is something in the nature of a Board of Trade, a permanent body which would report to this House upon any anomalies that may exist in the Tariff, upon any evidence of dumping that may be discovered, and upon the existence of combines, &c. That step, however, can never be taken if we are to make the Tariff a political question, and if its revision can only be effected by a fight between the two fiscal parties. WhilstI regard the Tariff Commission as a body which has done exceedingly useful work, and whilst I entertain great hope of good results from its reports, still, some other method of Tariff adjustment requires to be adopted. The right honourable member for Balacfava, in speaking upon this matter, saidButi f the Tariff is to be made the Every one admits Lhat there should be an inquiry into the working of the Tariff, and if it is to be conducted on right lines, no industry, whether it be small or large, should be shut out My experience teaches me that the moment a Tariff Commission touches one line, it is impossible to say where its labours will terminate. Take, for example, the item of "" Woollens,"" which is subject to an import duty of 15 per cent., and in respect of which it may be urged that a duty of 25 per cent, should be imposed. If that duty were so increased, it would necessarily follow that an additional duty of io per cent, must be imposed on articles made up from the raw material, otherwise we sliould handicap those who are making up the raw material in Australia. In that connection I feel that there is some necessity for dealing with this matter in a totally different wav from that in which it has hitherto been dealt with. It is necessary that it should be taken altogether from the arena of party politics. do that. the arena of party politics?",17,Australian Industries Preservation Bill Second Reading

I do not exactly know whether if we agree to its second reading-w e shall be prevented from coercing or inducing the Government to bring f orward the Tariff Commission's report. At the present moment my position is that I should like to see the second reading of the Bill passed, with a view to its provisions being threshed I am replying to the obout in Committee in the light of the information that we are able to obtain from honourable members generally, even if it were then dropped. The adoption of that course I am enwould have the effect of putting upon record very useful information for future reference.

67,Mr Higgins (Northern Melbourne),"quite time to take some action when the representative of ail outside manufacturer of great wealth and power boldly says that he is going to drive out of the Australian market an Australian machine. I do not know but that I should be willing to have a good deal of experimental legislation, if it were necessary, to pull ourselves together, and see if we are not able to deal with this insolence. the Bill, dealing with the repression of monopolies, I doubt very much whether the clauses in this part will do much practical good. I say so simply because monopolies are produced by the very same forces as produce economy, efficiency, and cheapness. As the honourable member for Grampians has rightly said, they largely prevent the waste of competition in the pushing of the wares of a business by means of commercial travellers and advertising, and otherwise. I wish to speak first with respect to a remarkable distinction drawn in clause 5 between corporations and individuals. Honourable members will no doubt have perceived that under clause 4 the individual who has a monopoly is not amenable to the Bil l unless he isi acting in relation to trade or commerce between the States and with other countries. monopoly within a State. the monopoly of an individual within a State. porations, whether foreign or domestic, that it is to be a penal act for a corporation to be in a monopoly, whether its monopoly is confined to one State or extends to operations between the States or with other countries. orable and learned gentleman means "" local."" poration "" I mean a corporation formed in Australia. I understand that the very important distinction to which I have directed attention is based' upon sub-section xx. of section 51 of the 'Constitution. Under this section we have power to make laws for the peace, order, and good government of the Commonwealth with respect to, amongst other thingsForeign corporations ancl trading or financial corporations formed within the limits of the Commonwealth. It seems to be assumed that because we can make laws as to corporations, we can trench upon the powers of the States in anv matter affecting corporations. I doubt that very strongly. Let us just see how far this assumption will carry us. It will mean that, although we 'have not the power to make factory laws, because that/ is a subject of legislation retained by the States, still we can make a factory law which will apply to companies and not to individuals. If that is so, let us know where we are. The As to Part II . of position will be really curious. If we can legislate in any way for corporations, whether it be in regard to factories, lands, bicycles, or anything else, I should like to know it. I have very strong doubts that we -have this power. So far as regards factory laws, suppose we had a law dealing with the hours and wages in factories passed by a State Parliament, and that the Federal power is oompetent to pass a law with regard to companies, is the Federal Parliament competent to make a factory law applicable to companies, although it be not competent to make a f actory law applicable to individuals? Under section 107 of the Constitution, it is clearly enacted that the: States still retain their powers, in so far as they are not expressly given to the Commonwealth. Suppose a law were passed by this Parliament for the compulsory sale of land, provided it belonged to a company, It does not apply to a what then ? Suppose there is a restriction of the area, of the lands of a State, which It does not apply to may be occupied by a company ? Is it so, that we can take over the subjects with Clause5 says with regard* to corwhich the States have retained the power to deal, in so far as they relate to companies ? Take the case of newspapers. I understand that the Daily Telegrafh. of Sydney, is owned by a company, and that the Age, of Melbourne, is not owned by a company. Is it so, that this Parliament can pass anv B y "" domestic"" the honlaw it pleases as to newspapers and their conduct if they are owned iby a company, and may not do so in respect of newspapers that are owned by individuals? I fear that we are going too far in clause 5 of this Bill. Although, it is very hard' to define the limits, I do think that one may roughly say that what was meant by sub-section xx. of section 51 of the Constitution, was the whole bulk of company law, as it was known under that title before the Federal Constitution was.enacted. I am speaking now with great reserve, and without being dogmatic, because I feel sure that the matter has been looked into, and that very likely there are good reasons for what is proposed. But I am one who does not like to promote any friction between the States and the",20,Australian Industries Preservation Bill Second Reading

I do not think that the Constitution intended to make such distinctions. whether this is company law as interpreted before the enactment of the Constitution. it is so limited as that. I think that the powers of legislation given in section 51 to the Federal Parliament must be read liberally and broadly, but at the same time section T07 must be read equally liberally and broadly. Under that section the States Parliaments retain all the powers they had before Federation, so far as they have not been expressly taken away by the Federal Constitution. to say the very least, that there is power given us to make one monopoly law for a company and another vidual. it in that for m ; I ought rather to say that if we are given no power to make a monopoly law for individuals acting within a State, then we are given no power to maike a monopoly law applicable to companies acting within a State. learned gentleman think that this ParliaI t certainly is very startment can, in its company law, forbid corporations from holding land in fee simple? question.

There have been books upon books exclusively devoted to company law, but no one ever thought of there being anything in those books about the law of monopoly, because there is no distinction between companies and individuals with regard to monopolies in British or American law. Let us take I would not say that another instance, sub-section x i x . of section 51 gives the Federal Parliament power to legislate as to aliens. Would that mean that this Parliament might prescribe one factory law for aliens and another factory law for British subjects? Parliament provide for the admission of aliens subject to various restrictions? I think it is very doubtful, but, at the same time, the admission would not relate to their working here. Before they come here this Parliament can legisfor an indilate for them, but, they being here, it would PerhapsI ought not to put be a most unnatural state of things for a State to provide factory laws, local government laws, and other domestic laws, and",21,Australian Industries Preservation Bill Second Reading

I think that honourable members all round the House are honestly desirous to join in putting down monopoly, in so far as it is injurious. I am quite sure that we shall be very glad to adopt any proposal which will enable us to deal with the evil of monopoly. But the truth is that, while this detriment 'to the public is a good logical test, it is not a good practical test. The detriment of the public is a matter of such infinite difference of opinion that I do not think it is safe to hang a man's deprivation of liberty on so flexible an expression. There are some monopolies that work every ill , and are a danger to society. It is a danger to society that private persons, working for gain, should have such power over human beings as have the Standard Oil Trust, the beef trusts, or the steel trusts. But the worse culprits are never hit by the monopoly law. I have had a little experience, and read a little of the subject, and especially the book of the late Henry Demarest Lloyd. That author gives the result of examinations made by Commissions in the United States, and it appears that when there is a distinct combine, as they call ita distinct trust, which shows a clear case-and the directors are haled before the Commission-ther e is found to be no agreement at all. The Commission are told by those charged, "" Oh, we have nothing in writing, and nothing verbal."" blank on oath agreement. who are trying to do a dirtv thing to the public always do it by a wink of the eve, or in some similar waya mere understanding is quite enough. agreement, and there is nothing in writing -a t least, nothing in writing can ever be found. The class of men. I find, who are most puzzled and most distressed by this monopoly legislation are men who want to Live honest, clean lives, and obey the law. In connection with the Secret Commissions Act, I have found a number of people in great perplexity as to whether they are I have already said doing right or wrong. I have found that they are cruelly puzzled. whether they are receiving two commissions ? I think the Bil l does proof receiving two commissions; that Act applies to much more. I find that when there is really a dirty thing being done, it is I am very glad to always done most secretly. Where there is a thing being done that is not dirty-a n act which men are riot afraid to avow-it is not done so secretly; still, there are people who are puzzled to. know whether what they do is legal or illegal. Our l if e is complex enough, without making honest men apprehensive for their liberty, or uncertain as to what they should do. As I said before, I do not like to have a man's liberty depending on the whim or belief of a jury. We all have our prejudices; but when it comes to a matter of political', economical, or social opinion, I do not think that these prejudices should form the crux of the decision as to a man's liberty. It is more important, to my mind, not to degrade honest men than it is even to punish dishonest men. A t this stage I suggest as, perhapsj, .'worthy of the Minister's consideration, that, in order to prevent honourable men being embarrassed men who have an agreement whicli . they believe to be a good one and not damaging to the public-the y should be allowed, under the B ill , to submit the agreement to the Minister, who, after getting the advice of such experts in the trade, and others as he thinks fit, should have power to give a certificate that the agreement is not, in his opinion, detrimental to the public.

147,Mr Higgins,"In the United' Statesgrowing communities began with private roads, private bridges with tolls, private fire brigades, private transport of goods, private education, and private grave-yards. Now all these matters are publicly managed, and, further, we find that municipalities possess oil fields and) produce oil, salt fields and produce salt, coal fields and produce coal; and they have legislation with regard to the extirpation of wild cats and grasshoppers' eggs, and also as to providing people with seed wheat, libraries, and hearses. It is remarkable that in the last fifty years there is not one case where an industry has got under public control in which it has been given back to private control. many cases in which public control has failed. as those in which private control has failed. is that the Minister has to act in the first However, I do not intend to go into that large question, which, no doubt, opens out a tremendous vista of difficulty. I do not say that all public control would be a success. As to dumping, I have only a few words to say. The desire is to prevent the dumping of goods from abroad on Australian soil, with the intention of destroying any Australian industry. It will be observed that the object is not to prevent any effort to destroy a rival in an industry; the old principles of competition, good or bad, will remain. You may take such steps as you like to destroy or ruin your rival, but you must not destroy an industry in Australia. You may, for instance, have a device by which you can destroy the maker of a certain harvester, but you must not have a device by which you can destroy the whole industry, in Australia. prices again. I hold that John Stuart Mill We should do the same thing if we were able to do it. At any rate, I have heard of men saying how they would like to dish the Danes in the English market, meaning that they would like to supplant the Danish butter by exported Australian butter. Therefore, we cannot claim to possess any particular virtue in this matter. But the destruction of an industry must not be by unfair competition. I do not suppose that it would be an offence to destroy an industry by giving better stuff, or cheaper stuff, on better methods. But there is the third condition that the industry must be worthy of Australian support. The essential principle, and the great diffiwould probably lead to the Australian goods culty, lies in the expression "" unfair competition."" In America they might discover a substitute for butter which, though not derived from the cream of cows' milk, was, nevertheless, a wholesome food, and that substitute might be sent to Australia in such quantities and at such a price that its importation would be likely to destroy our butter industry. What chance would the defendant in such a case have before a jury composed of men coming from Werriwa, from Illawarra, or from Warrnambool, to decide as to the fairness of the competition ? The term "" unfair competition "" is a very elastic one. an investigation relating to dumping.

There are two kinds of dumping-dumpin g of surplus stock, trusting to the home market for a profit, or to prevent a bigger loss; and dumping for the express purpose of destroying an industry in the country to which the goods are exported, by undercutting until a monopoly is obtained which will permit of the raising of was on sound lines when he said, in regard to the temporary cheapness produced by dumping, that cheapness of goods is desirable only when it is produced without the lowering of the wages of those working at the industry.

Under the B ill , such persons may be prosecuted and severely fined, and, in some cases, sent to prison. The Minister did not take the advice offered to him during the second reading discussion of a similar Bill last session, when it was suggested that, during fhe recess he should redraft the measure, with a view to making it less drastic and more effective. Sir WILLIAM LYNE I said at the time that if I did anything I should alter the Bill to make its provisions more drastic. gentleman has done so. He was advised to make the Bill less drastic and more effective ; but has desire has been to make it more drastic, and, as the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne has shown, he has made it less effective. The Bill has b&m introduced with the idea of preventing the destruction of Australian industries, but, as the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne has pointed out, it is a very dangerous instrument. It would have been preferable for the Minister to wait until the report of the Tariff Commission was before us, so that we might have been fully informed as to the disabilities under which our manufacturers labour, and the hardships that are being inflicted upon consumers. that report is before us, we may find that we can achieve our object more effectively by removing Tariff anomalies, thaii by legislation such as thab now proposed. seems to me that the introduction of the Bill is premature. We cannot expect to make such a measure effective without having, the fullest information before us. The Minister has not adduced sufficient reasons to justify the hurried passing of the Bill. He has shown that certain evils exist in the. United States and Canada, but he has not been able to satisfy us that similar conditions are to be found here. Canada had copied the legislation of tha United States, and New Zealand has, to some extent, followed suit; but we have not sufficient information before us to justify us in adopting the very drastic steps now proposed. Before tb? Bill was introduced, the Government should have f u l ly assured themselves of the necessity for such a far-reaching measure. Tlie conditions in America are very different fromi those which-prevail here. The people of the United States are a self-contained community. As Mr Chamberlain has pointed out in some of his addresses on Preferential Trade, the importations into the United States are infinitesimal as compared with the local production and the exports. The United States have developed their manufactures to such an extent under an almost prohibitive Tariff, that they are now able to produce practically all that they require, l n such a country, there is a wider ftijld for the operation of trusts, and such combinations are capable of more destructive work than would be possible in Australia. The introduction of legislation of this kind would probably have effects directly oppoT h e honourable site to those which would be brought about in the United States. We cannot possibly produce all that we require, and through the operation of a measure of this kind, the cost of goods which have to be imported in order to meet the daily necessities of the people will probably be increased. I approve, with certain modifications, of the provisions contained in Parts II . and III . of the Bill, which are intended to repress monopolies, and prevent the dumping of goods upon our market, because I believe that legislation intended to operate in the directions indicated would prove beneficial to the consumers. Monopoly, whether of the sources of production or of distribution, is essentially pernicious and injurious to the community. According to the newspapers, Possibly, when the Beef Trust in America has recently been fined for having obtained certain concessions by way Ojf rebates and preferential rates from the railway companies in that It country. We know that preferential rates have been in existence upon some of our Siates railways. As these rates, however, were intended to benefit one State as against another, and to bring traffic to certain lines of railway, they were regarded as legitimate. In the United States, the railway rates are arranged in such a manner as to enable the trusts to sweep all competitors from their path. Then, when the trusts have established a monopoly, they raise the prices to the consumer. The Shipping Combine might operate to tine detriment of the people here in much the same way. If the associated shipowners are adopting the practice of granting rebates to certain persons who give them the whole of their",28,Australian Industries Preservation Bill Second Reading
172,Mr Henrywillis,"patronage, and of withholding similar concessions from other persons who occasionally ship their goods by other steamers, some action should be taken to restrict their operations. Then, again, we are told that the tobacco combine is endeavouring to secure a monopoly. A number of persons with a large amount of capital may form a combination or trust capable of controlling the means of exchange, of crippling industry, strangling opposition, tyrannizing; over the retail traders, and reducing the free people of a State to pay tribute to the millionaire class. It is common talk that the tobacco combine are tyrannizing over the small retailers. All the evils that are (known to exist in America in connection with the tobacco trade are now arising, although perhaps in a less objectionable form, in Australia. It is only a matter of time, however, when this combine will be as pernicious and destructive in Australia and as capable of monopolizing the whole trade, of raising, prices, and of, at the same time, foisting on the public an inferior article, as it has proved iri the United States. The reasons put forward by the Minister for the proposed legislation are not altogether clear and satisfactory. They must be viewed with a certain amount of suspicion, because the Bil l is being hurcratic character ried through the House before honourable members have had an opportunity of considering the conclusions of the Tariff Commission, which has sat for a very long time, and has incurred an expenditure of ,£:i.o,ooo in collecting much valuable evidence. very striking testimony from persons who went before them .reluctant to give the fullest information. If we had their conclusions before us we should he in a much better position to frame an effective measure. The Minister of Trade and Customs is not to be absolved from blame, if his only reason for expending public time and treasure at this stage in connection with this measure is derived from the experience of the United States. no such evils as are to be found there. With us, trusts are in their infancy, and we must be fortified with the fullest information before we can expect to deal effectively with such a complex subject. The Minister has made out a prima facie case against the American Tobacco Company of Australia. .£3,700,000. and is seeking to monopolize the tobacco trade. As a representative of the people, I regard it as my duty to cut the tentacles of this octupus, but, whilst I hold that we are here to deal with the abuses of trusts and combines, it does not, in my opinion, follow that we should nationalize an industry that can be successfully controlled under legislation such as has been passed in other parts of the world. When a country is invaded by an enemy, or if its agents or emissaries are within the gates insidiously mining and sapping, with a view to capturing the citadel-the markets which should be available to the honest manufacturer-the Parliament should immediately legislate as against a common enemy. opinion ? deliberate opinion, after looking into this matter thoroughly. I have not arrived at my conclusion off-hand, but after having considered the whole subject as one' who desires to legislate for the benefit of the country. The partu -, of which I am a member, has always brought forward legislation for the frood of the people. The Minister of Trade and Customs laughs, but I would challenge him to mention any legislation of a demothat has not had the support of the majority of. honourable members on this side of the House. If any concessions are granted, they should be granted to the masses of the community, whose interests require to be safeguarded more than do those of the sharp, unscrupuThe Commission have obtained lous business men, whose chief mission in life is to filch the earnings of the unprotected. May I go further, and affirm that if the oppressor is of our own citizenship he must be stripped of his disguise as the wolf of its sheep's clothing. In this connection, I desire -to refer particularly to the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. tion to face now. A t present we have to hear it. No concern in our midst is a safe one-s of a r as the community generally are concerned-unles s fair competition is assured. Human nature is the same in all of us. As soon as a man secures control of a market), he will fleece the public irudv; and left. The Minister has intimated that he has asked for a report from the Colonial which has a capital of Sugar Refining Company as to the charges which they are levying upon the public for the sugar which, fhey are distributing. I say that he should thoroughly satisfy",29,Australian Industries Preservation Bill Second Reading

I should like fo know whether the Minister has received such a report, and whether he is satisfied that the public are not being injured. The Australian shipping combine is also under suspicion, having been charged before the Shipping Commission, in Brisbane, with a clandestine attempt to interfere with freedom of commerce. That is a very serious charge. Commission was to the effect that the shipping combine conferred certain privileges upon those persons who shipped their goods exclusively by its steamers. who occasionally shipped merchandise by their vessels were not granted the same concessions. way in Australia does the same thing. already stated that differential and preferential railway rates in Australia have been imposed for the purpose of protecting the caipital which hasi beeh investled in lines that run a long distance from the seaboard towards a neighbouring State line that is nearer to the seaboard. ping combine prevent a person who does not conform to its regulations from shipping goods by its steamers again? Further, the combine ordered a line of steamers off the Australian coast, and tlie vessels had to be withdrawn. duty, as legislators, to deal with that combine, and, upon this side of the Chamber, I have not heard a single voice raised against the enactment of legislation which will prevent the public from being robbed by such an organization. Then there is the tobacco combine. Sir WILLIAM LYNE bine £ 3 7 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 or £ 3 8 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 is not referring to the Australian combine. Sir WILLIAM LYNE the trust with which the Australian combine is associated. He pboulfd ascertain trusts would not suffer financial loss or be injured in any way-if their business methods were honest-by being subjected to the provisions of Part II . of the Bill. The speech of the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne only served to strengthen my conviction that these combines should be specified in the B ill , and that the Governor General in Council should be empowered to specify by regulation any other combine which is carrying on business to the detriment of the public, with a view to bringing it under this portion of the measure. No injury whatever could befall these companies as the result of such legislation, but a large measure of protection would be conferred The evidence given before the upon the public, and a great deal of scandal would be avoided. There are trusts whose businesses cannot be controlled as can those of the three combines which I Individuals have mentioned without injury to the consumers. .There are other trusts which are capable of doing damage to our industries and our commercial interests if they are passed unnoticed. Included in fhe latter category are the Massey-Harris Company, the International Harvester Company, and, I have so far as a great deal of the trade of Australia is concerned, the steel trust. If the goods manufactured by the agricultural implement makers, and by the steel trust -whic h controls the output of steel rails and metals used in railway constructionwere specified in a schedule published in the Commonwealth Gazette, as is provided for in the New Zealand Act, and if another schedule were gazetted showing the selling price of such goods in the country whence they were shipped, as compared I believe so. with their selling price in Australia, much good would result. In New Zealand this experimental legislation will terminate It is our within a month, but in my opinion we might permanently copy it here with advantage, it having been conclusively proved in that Colony that it is beneficial to the public interest. It would protect the consumer against tlie operations of the trust. It would also enable the manufacturer to utilize all the inventive genius of Australia The tobacco comin a particular machine. The ideas of in America is possessed of Australians have already been copied in America, so far as harvesters are conT h e Minister cerned.

Minister in his speech dealt very fairly with the provisions of the Canadian and New Zealand Acts. showed how they could be brought -into operation, and how the public could be protected in a similar way to that in which they are protected in New Zealand.

He is an excellent reader of human nature, and I fear that he might be tempted to administer this Bill in the interests of his party.

Sir WILLIAM LYNE wards the interests of the consumer rather 1 than towards those of the importer. hand, if the measure were being administered by a free-trader he would probably lean just as much in the other direction, and in that case a great deal of injury would be done to the manufacturer. It is not a good thing to place in the hands of a Minister an instrument which he can use for party purposes, against the best interests of the community, ancl against the general progress of the Commonwealth. The interjection of the Minister leads me to believe that he intends to amend the provision relating to the appointment of a Board of three persons to determine what is unfair competition, by substituting for that body a Justice of the High Court. Is that correct? how it would be possible for a lawyer to determine such a question"" satisfactorily. I think that the If he possessed the same instincts as does the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne, I do not think he would be competent to satisfactorily solve a matter of that kind. Buti f the Minister appointed a high-principled commercial man, and placed him above party considerations, it would be possible to secure satisfaction. The worth ? to secure a first-cliass man we should have He clearly to give him _£2,ooo a year. ber think that he would perform his work satisfactorily for that sum? I desire to legislate against abuses. The honourable gentleman said that this was not a question of free-trade or protection, but of legislation for the benefit of the Sopeople. If it be the object of this legislation to protect the people against abuses brought about by the dishonest operations of trusts and combines, its consideration should not be affected by party views based upon a belief in either free-trade or protection. The American Steel Trust has already operated, and it is shown by our Customs returns that we import from abroad steel and iron articles of all kinds to.the value of £7,000,000. These imports are to be dealt with under the dumping provisions of this Bill.

It seems to me that if any attempt is made to prevent the importation of these articles which, for many years to come, cannot possibly be manufactured here, the effect must be to raise their price to the consumer.

Next Professor Jenks refers to such difficult question, but one, I take it, which amendments and alterations of the law remay be decided on the merits of each parlating to corporations, or, as we call them, ticular case. As cases have to go before companies, as will make directors and proa jury, and we are told the Minister is demotors responsible for statements made in termined to have as high-class a jury as prospectuses, and for the proper carrying possible, I think we can say that the introout of a company's operations.

'Contrary to all Australian oppose, but should rather welcome. Proand' English ideas, we find practices going fessor Jenks makes a pointa point which on in regard to the formation and operations has been referred to by other speakersof companies which stagger us. In America that discriminations by trusts should be an efficient Companies Act does not seem abolished. That is to say, a trust must sell to obtain, and most, if not all, writers on to all purchasers at the same rate; a trust trusts, urge that an Act, such as would fix must not sell in some localities at a speciresponsibility on promoters and directors, is ally low rate for the purpose of killing comurgently needed. As to that branch of the petition, or sell to some favoured individual subject, Professor Jenks advocates that comat a specially low rate for the purpose of k ill panies should be required to furnish further ing out other individuals who may handle particulars, much as is done in Australia good's not made by the trust. To bring about and the United Kingdom, to the Registrarsuch a state of affairs as Pirofessor Jenks General, those particulars to be open advocates is extremely difficult.

Mr to be made punishable by law. It is feltCollier admits, however, that the monopolies the trusts have secured in many places are of a very dangerous character, and he suggests a number of methods of dealing with them. In the first place, he, like Professor Jenks and other writers^ declares that railway freight discrimination must be stopped. He is at one with all other writers on the question, in declaring that the first and foremost evil is improper, illegal, and dishonest discrimination in railway freights, and that the first remedy is the abolition or prevention of such discrimination. Though, as I say, a strong protectionist and a leading member of the Republican Party, MB. Collier is of opinion that in certain limited cases the Tariff might be dealt with'. On page 365 of his book he says:Abolish all special privileges; prohibit and absolutely prevent railroad discriminations; lower the tariff-no t whenever we can obtain our goods from abroad at a lower rate, but whenever the prices exacted by any trust or any ccrporation or any individual are in excess of a fair profit, after paying American wages. The establishment of an export trade in any article should be treated as presumptive evidence of the of taxation should be applied very caulack of need of a tariff, and the tariff upon such article should be continued only when it has been clearly shown that sales abroad are the result of exceptional circumstances. In that connection, I may say that the Customs law of Canada has a provision for allowing the Tariff to be reduced when it is shown that goods for export are sold by Canadian manufacturers at a lower price than goods for home consumption. Collier also advocates that the patent law should be modified whenever necessary, because he fears that the patent laws of America go too far in the direction of studying the interests of the patentees, and not far enough in the direction of studying the interests of the public. He is in favour of company reform, and of compelling corporations to pay their fair share of taxation. But, having carried all these ireforms, and, so to speak, cleared the ring, he says that there must be a fair fight. As the conditions with which he deals so largely do not exist in Australia, we are interested chiefly in what he has to say about the necessity for allowing a fair fight when the ring is cleared. We must deal very stringently Mr Robinson. with attempts to cut prices in particular localities. No doubt, in tha United States of America, prices have been cut in particular localities to crush competition, and Mr Collier thinks that that practice ought by this very able writer, and member of the Protectionist Party in the United States, that by dealing with the problem on these lines, trusts will be kept within proper bounds, and the interests pf the public will be duly safeguarded. Another writer on trusts is Professor Ely, a gentleman of world-wide reputation, and one of the newer school of political economists, who advocates Government or municipal ownership of public utilities, and Government or municipal control of all undertakings which-are necessarily monopolies, and in which competition is not practicable or possible. He is of opinion that the taxation of trusts is one way to deal with the problem, but that it is a method which must be handled very cautiously, because, very frequently, monopolies are created by improper Governmenttaxation. If the condition of entering into a trade or undertaking of any kind is that, to meet the Government taxation, a very large amount of capital will be necessary, competitors may be driven out of the field for want of the requisite money.. Hence the remedy tiously, and care should be taken to see that the taxation applied is not likely to produce monopoly. Under the Victorian insurance legislation, before a new insurance company can commence operations, it must invest £5,000 in Government stock, to be held in the name of the Treasurer for the. time being, so that new companies practically find it impossible to start in the same Mr way as the Australian Mutual Provident Society, the National Mutual Life Assurance; Society, and others of the present companies commenced. That legislation, therefore, though intended only . to safeguard the public interests, has had the probably unforeseen, effect of limiting competition. Professor Ely is of-opinion that natural monopolies and public utilities should be regulated or controlled by the Government, or by municipal bodies, in regard to such things as hours of labour, rates of pay, fares, freights, and so forth, or should be wholly undertaken by municipalities or fhe Government. He thinks, however, that in America, the difficulty of securing, a satisfactory Government control would be so great that, in the first, instance, ened, because the evils of trusts are ap-Government regulation and ownership would parent, and, undoubtedly, steps must be be more satisfactory. He points out that, taken there to deal with them.

He would deal with trusts by reducing the duty on an article when that duty was have been the causes of monopolies. found to be one of the prime: causes of is a pity that the Bill does not contain a the trust. of the patent and company laws; but the Canadian Act, which enacts, that, when a discussion of his proposals in that direccompany or firm sells its goods bevond the tion is not very germane to the subject at borders of the country from which it exhand, because the Victorian company law portsat a lower price than that at which is, if anything, a little too drastic.

He gives many examples of what the trusts clause we will support him. have done, and of the agreements which they have made in restraint of trade; but opinion that some of the remedies which -he cloes not deal with the subject in a have been suggested are reactionary and partisan spirit, and does not advocate many unnecessary, as, for instance, proposals to reforms. He confines himself to two prolimit the size of companies, to systemapositions.

That is rather a comtion of competition.

232,Mr Robinson,"Mr Clark is of thecompetitors out of existence, but that competition should be maintained, and everything should be done to prevent trusts, corporations, or individuals from securing a monopoly of trade in any particular spot or throughout the country. In order to keep the independent competitor in the field, it is necessary to secure for him fair treatment by the raihvays, and to prevent him from being placed at a disadvantage by secret arrangements between the trusts and the raihvay companies. He points out that there are three ways in which a trust may seek to crush out an efficient competitor. He saysIt may make use of the factors agreement by 5 which it .gives a special rebate to those merchants who handle only its own goods. resort, secondly, to the local cutting of prices whereby the trust enters its rivals' special terriWarrnambool, and also against Bairnsdale tory, and sells goods there below the cast of producing them, while sustaining itself by means of higher prices charged in other portions of its field. Again, the trust may depend on the cutting of the price of some one variety of goods which a rival producer makes, in order to ruin him, while it .sustains itself by means of the hitjh prices which it gets for goods of other kinds. Professor Clark urges that these three methods should be made illegal. At page 76 of the work from, which I have been quoting, he saysThen factors' agreement, the local cutting of prices, and the predatory breaking of a scale of prices must be forbidden, and there must be a real force behind the prohibition. Then he discusses the difficulties of enforcing such legislation. WhilstI agree with Professor Clark that it is advisable, as far as possible, to enforce legislation of that kind, I see the greatest difficulties in the way. Take the case of tied houses in the brewing trade, mentioned by the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne. The tied houses are worked in such a way that we are powerless to apply a remedy. If the hotel keeper complies with a certain number of conditions, including those_ relating to the purchase of beer, he receives certain advantages, and if he does not adhere to these terms he is denied the benefits of the arrangement -build up country towns on the seaboard The tied-hbuse system can thus be worked in such a way that all legislation intended to crush it out is rendered powerless. Merchants, traders, and manufacturers will try to push their business in certain ways, and if we prevent a manufacturer from giving special favour to those who handle his goods only, he will establish retail shops, Mr Robinson. and the independent trader on his own account will be driven out of the field. His business will be destroyed by a man who is practically an employee' of the manufacturer. Hence it appears to me that the remedies suggested for keeping the independent competitor in the field, whilst, no doubt, very good in theory, are unworkable. Nowf should like to summarize the methods which these five writers advocate. In the first place, they say that railway discrimination should be prevented. That suggestion is not applicable to our conditions, because the .railways are in the hands of the States Governments. At the same time, a most grievous system of discrimination is carried out in Victoria. TheI t may Railways Commissioners discriminate to the disadvantage of Portland, Port Fairy, and and Sale, in the most grievous manner, and do their best to prevent trade from flowing in its natural channels. this measure will not apply to such cases. tempt to deal with the Railways Commissioners. The Commissioners have sent special officers out to certain sta1 tions, and have offered to carry the wool by rail at almost any price with a view to prevent it from being shipped by steamer. They have offered to carry wool from stations 230 or 240 miles froni Melbourne at rates which could not be secured by station-owners whose properties were 120 or 130 miles from Melbourne. This system of preference appears to be bound up in railway systems, and instructions have been given by the Railways Commissioners that freight is to be obtained, no matter what has to be conceded. A special officer is sent out, and if he meets a stationowner who says that he can get his wool carried vid Portland at a certain price per ton, he will offer to convey it by rail at 6d. per ton less. By hook or by crook the railway authorities secure the traffic, and harbors which have been constructed at great public expense are being made little or no use of. The traffic that should go to such as I have mentioned is centralized in Melbourne, merely because of the discriminating policy adopted by the Railways Commissioners.

234,Mr Robinson,"No; it does not atreferred advocate the reform of the company law. applicable to Victoria, because we have the most up-to-date law dealing with that matter. In fact, our law is a little bit beyond date. the impress of the Attorney-General, and, like all the measures framed by him, is so f u l l of wire netting, ten-barred gates, and steel bullet-proof doors, that it is very dimcult to transact business. wrong-doer more dimcult. that, but I contend that the present law contains provisions that, while they do not check wrong-doing in the slightest degree, add very greatly to the cost of forming companies, and hamper the operations of small corporations. I have no hesitation in saying that the law costs in connection with the formation of companies in Victoria have been at least doubled since the present Act was passed at the instance of the present Attorney-General in 1897, and that there are very few trading companies that do not consult their solicitor before taking any important step. course, as a member of the legal profession I do not object to that, because I find that it is to my advantage. company promoters robbed the public without consulting their solicitors. agreement with, the honourable member that schemes for robbing the 'public should be discouraged, and that those who take part in them should be punished; but I think that I could show the honourable member that, if he undertook to form three or four small companies, he would find himself hedged about by vexatious restrictions that do not benefit any one, but largely increase the cost. The Victorian Companies Act has had one good result, from my point of view. Before it was passed,'the members of the legal profession, used to suffer from the competition of unlicensed persons, such as accountants and others., who formed companies on their own account. Under the operation of the present beneficent Act, such persons are absolutely prevented from adopting that course. If they undertook to form a company they would soon find themselves in a hopeless muddle, and no company can now be formed with safety without the assistance of a solicitor. From one point of view, such legislation is desirable, but from the public stand-point i l might very well be liberalized in some reThat recommendation is not spects, whilst the most stringent provisions against dishonesty on the part of directors or company promoters might be retained. The American writers to whom I In many respects it bears have referred also advocate the amendment of the patent laws. The points they have raised in this connection have all been met by English and Australian legislation, which I think adequately safeguards the interests of the public. There is a consensus It makes the path of the of opinion amongst protectionists and free traders that in certain cases-such , for exI do not object to ample, as that of the steel industry in the United States-the Tariff should be amended when an industry has reached' the point of large exportation, and the protective duties no longer operate with any advantage to the public, but are used by the manufacturers to enable them to extort an extra price for their goods. I would urge that the provisioni n the Canadian Customs legislation to which I have referred should be embodied in this measure. The Canadian legislation admits of the reduction of the Tariff being brought about by a Minister of the Crown without reference 0 Of to Parliament. I could not agree to that, because I think that Parliament is the proper body to deal with the Tariff, and that it would not be wise or proper for us to give up our control of the Tariff to any Minister, even though he might be as impeccable as the present Minister of I am entirely in Trade and Customs. All the American writers conclude by urging the necessity of what we may call fair competition. They insist that the trusts should not be permitted to club their competitors out of existence. I am not quite sure whether the provisions of this B ill would carry us far enough. I am inclined to believe that the cutting of prices in a particular locality would be regarded as an attempt to monopolize trade, and would be punishable under the Bill. Therefore, probably the views of the writers to whom I have referred would to some extent be met. Many of the writers have pointed out that centralization is an ordinary development of business at the present time, and that no attempt should be made to check it . I presume that the words in the B ill , "" to the detriment of the public,"" are intended to protect centralized industrv, and to hit out at monopolized industry. The only provisions in the American legislation which are germane to this Bill are those which aim at securing fair competition, and,",41,Williamlyne T H E Honourable Is Carried Out In Its Entirety These Trades

238,Mr Robinson,"speaking subject to modification in the light of further discussion, I think that the general principle underlying some of the clauses in Part II . of the Bill might be acceptedthe principle that a combine in restraint of trade or commerce to the detriment of the public should be repressed. the operations of a combine are to the detriment of the public? fact, upon which we must trust a jury. The Minister has promised that that body shall be of an exceptional nature*-that it shall consist offirst-classmen, so far as we can get them. We can only hope that the best men available will be chosen. It is admitted ' that some steps must be taken to check the growth of destructive monopolies. The only question which now arises is, '' What is the best way in which to accomplish the desired result""? think that much of the wording of these clauses ought to be amended, their underlying principle that a monopoly to the detriment of the public is an injurious thing, is a sound one. Consequently, we ought to endeavour to punish that sort of thing, always provided that in so acting we do not injure the ordinary operations of business people. In this Bill, I do not see any overt attempt to give effect to the suggestions of Mr Collier, Mr Clark, and. others, against what is called "" clubbing competition."" I presume that that is intended to be covered by the words "" combining or conspiring to monopolize trade."" There are several provisions in this portion of the Bill which I regard as most objectionable. For instance, clause n offers about as big a premium for blackmailing as it is possible for any legislation to confer. Any person who is injured in his person or property by any other person, by reason of any act or thing done by that person in contravention of this part of the Act, may, in any competent Court exercising Federal iurisdiction, sue for ancl recover treble damages for the injury. That is a very drastic provision for a start. The clause goes on to say-and this I contend offers an absolute premium to blackmailNo person shall, in any proceeding under this section, be excused from answering any question put, either vivd voce or by interrogatory or from making any discovery of documents, on the ground that the answer or discovery may swer shall not be admissible in evidence against him in any criminal proceeding other than a prosecution for perjury. That seems to me to permit of action being taken against an individual upon tha most flimsy ground, and-by an alteration of the Common Law of England-to deprive him of a means of defence, that from timeimmemorial he has been allowed. I am really astonished ithat such a provision should be contained in the measure. It shows that there is a disposition on thepart of some of those who are more intimately connected with it to serve up everything hot, rather than to ascertain what is the best means of dealing with this very important and very intricate question. I now wish to say a few words in regard to' the Minister. I have carefully read thespeech which he made in moving the second reading of the Bill, two or three times. It < possesses all that grace of inconsequence which is so characteristic of his deliverances. He flies from China to Peru, from ThoughI tobacco to iron, and then to kerosene upon them all. stance, I find that he stated that the Massey-Harris Company is an off-shoot of the great American Steel Trust. No more absolutely futile and inaccurate remark wasever made to any Legisfative Chamber. As a matter of fact, the Massey-HarrisCompany is one of the greatest competitors of the Steel Trust. Yet the Minister says that it is practically the same body. I suppose that somebody met him in the street, and told him that it was so, and he did not even take the trouble to ""verify his informant's statement. I might telf him that the Massey-Harris Company wasestablished in 1891, and the great Steel Trust in 1902. Yet, according to the stateI t providesment of the Minister, 1891 comes after 1902. His extraordinary arithmetic haslead him into many a trap before. The honourable gentleman then dealt with thetobacco combine.

246,Mr Robinson,"I do not think thatference to Hansard of the present session, page 249I find this extraordinary statement by the MinisterAt one time, tobacco was grown to a consider-. able extent around about Tumut and the Upper Murray, but, at present, very little is being cultivated. produced now in comparison with that grown a few years ago, but I believe that the operations of the trust are proving injurious to the industry in Australia, and that they will utterly -destroy it. That statement evidences such an absolute want of knowledge of the Minister's own Department as to be absolutely appalling. The import duty upon tobacco leaf is is. 6d. per lb., whilst that upon manufactured tobacco is 3s. 3d. per lb. There is no Excise duty upon Victorian leaf. The Excise upon tobacco tliat is locally manufactured is is. per lb. Consequently, if the tobacco combine used Australian leaf for the manufacture of their tobacco, they would save is. 6d. per, lb. According to the Minister, they are deliberately wasting is. 6d. per lb. for the purpose of killing off a few growers in the neighbourhood of Tumut. Was ever a more ridiculous statement made by a responsible Minister? If the combine could supplant imported manufactured tobacco by the use of Australian leaf, they would save from is. 6d. to ,-2s. 2d. per lb., or, roughly speaking, nearly £ 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 a year. Yet, with this enormous advantage in their favour, they are compelled to use a certain quantity of the imported leaf. The Minister thus argues that the combine actually pays away £ 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 annuallv for the purpose of .abolishing the local growth of tobacco. Sir WILLIAM LYNE apply his common sense to such a statement to ascertain the fallacy of it . Would any combine, however grasping, throw away £ 4 8 0 , 0 0 0 annually for the purpose of .insuring that of . certain Wales shall not be tobacco, but something else? -every consideration of common sense, and to ordinary business experience ? That is the Minister's statement in speaking of the Tqbacco Trust, which he declares this B ill ought to deal with. so must, of course, be a matter for evidence. If it is a combine, whose operations result in restraint of trade to the detriment of the public, of course it will be affected by the measure. By the use of the words "" detriment of the public,"" I assume that the framer of the B ill meant either that the combine improperlv increased prices, that it lowered wages, impaired the general conditions of employment,' or that it did not reduce the price of the manuI cannot ascertain the quantity that U factured article wheri its cheaper raw material and new machinery enabled it to turn out goods at a. very much lower rate. A failure to do any one of these things would probably be held to be to the detriment of fhe public. I understand that it is the intention of the Minister that a combine which cannot be convicted of pillaging the public in some way, ought not to be punished. A combination per se is not necessarily objectionable. If a combination of itself were an objectionable thing, we ought to punish 1 all trade unions, and every other union of individuals who combine to strengthen their particular cause or to advocate any special measure, either of a social or business character. A combination ought to be punished only when it is shown that it is something which will injure the public, either by taking away from them some benefit which they ought to enjoy, or by -inflicting upon them some burden which they ought not to be asked to bear. I favour Part IT. of the Bill, with certain 1 amendments, which will have the effect of protecting persons who may be engaged in business from being black-mailed, and of securing the determination of cases which may arise by, as nearly as possible, a skilled jury. I also favour certain amendments which will protect in our Courts of Law any agreement made by a combination, which is not detrimental to the public It is a fact, too. interest. I come now to Part III . of the measure, which relates to dumping. I admit that this is a question which is surrounded by a considerable amount of difficulty. There are some instances in which it cannot be denied that a particular industry the product has been built up by the dumping of its lands in New South raw material. But there can be no doubt that other industries have been very much Is not the idea opposed to injured by dumping, and by having to compete with goods which have been sold 1 without profit. Dumping does strike the average man as being something which is unfair. It does not permit of that fair Whether it will do competition which Parliament ought to see brought about as far as possible. Froni that point of view we are entitled to enact legislation which will have the effect of securing the fairest competition to those who",43,Williamlyne T H E Honourable Is Carried Out In Its Entirety These Trades
247,Mr Robinson,"A man has only toare engaged in any industry in Australia. There is no doubt that some industries have been greatly strengthened by dumping operatic-ns. I hold in my hand an extract from the report for 1904 of the British Consul-General at Frankfort. In it he shows that the German cartels in iron have been selling pig-iron to Belgium and Holland at a lower price than that at which it could be purchased by German manufacturers. The result is that large orders for finished goods have been completed in Belgium, Holland, and Great Britain, and the German finishing manufacturers have had to lose those orders. He saysAmong all the syndicates those controlling raw material and half-finished goods proved themselves the most powerful and the hardest masters. finished goods abroad at low prices, so that ths home industries, which worked off such raw material, & c , were severely handicapped. These asserted (and not without reason) that the consumers of German material in foreign countries, especially in Holland and Belgium, were by these prices placed in such an advantageous position that it was most difficult, if at all possible, to compete against their prices. The syndicates themselves admitted the seriousness of their position by expressing their willingness to grant certain export bonuses, which, however, the industries concerned pronounced inadequate. Some cases actually transpired in which German ""finishing"" manufacturers ""had to decline"" orders owing to the exorbitant prices of raw material, whichorders subsequently passed to Holland, Belgium, and the United Kingdom. There is proof in an official document, and if honourable members were to turn to the report of the Britisb Board of Trade presented to the House of Commons, about eighteen, months ago, they would find some very valuable evidence upon the same matter, showing that while it is a fact that certain industries have been injured by dumping, is is also an undoubted fact that certain other industries have been aided by it. However, I feel that the competition of a man who admittedly sells without profit is a class of competition with which a Parliament may be expected to deal. We are, therefore, in my opinion, entitled to consider any measure brought forward for that purpose. In Canada, and in New Zealand, special legislation has been passed to deal with it, and I venture to say that the legislation passed in those countries is decidedly of a higher character than that proposed in the measure before us. According, to the pamphlet issued to us, and which I personally wish had been issued earlier, under the Canadian legislation, if it appears to the Minister that articles are Mr Robinson. being imported for sale at a price less than the fair market value thereof, he may make such articles subject to a special duty. The amount of that special, duty is strictly limited under the Canadian Act, but under this Bill the amount by which the Minister may raise the Tariff upon such articles is left to his own discretion, and honourable members will agree that that means an i l limitable amount. In the New Zealand Parliament, under the leadership of the late Mr Seddon, an Act was passed dealing with dumping, which, I believe, supplies by far the best suggestion yet made for dealing with importations of farming implements. It is one .which I would support unreservedly, because I believe that it They sold raw material and halfwould give to the manufacturers of Australia all they can reasonably ask for, whilst it would secure to the farmers of this country the whole of the benefits of foreign competition. The New Zealand provision is that if the price of an article is reduced below what a Board considers a fair price, and New Zealand manufacturers agree to reduce their price, they are to get a bonus for every reduction fhey make. The importer can continue to send his goods into New Zealand, whilst the New Zealand manufacturer will get a bonus on every reduction he makes upon the price of similar goods. As the result of the New Zealand legislation, which I may say deals only with farming implements, the men who have to use them are able to secure them at Ihe lowest possible price, whilst id is impossible for the importer to crush out the local industry for their manufacture, because of the bonus given to the local manufacturer every time he lowers his price. Legislation of that kind would, it seems to me, completely meet all the complaints that have been made, and in a way which would not be unjust to any primary industry. It must not be forgotten that those engaged in t the primary industries of Australia must take the world's price for the goods they sell. They therefore deserve, in legislation of this kind, as much consideration as does any other class in the community. By legislating on the lines adopted by the lateMr Seddon, it seems to me that we should: be able to secure to our farmers and producers generally the whole of the benefits which may be secured through internal and foreign competition, and we should at the same time place our manufacturers in such a position that they would be enabled to stand any shock to which they might be subjected by foreign competitors. After perusing the correspondence with which I have been deluged from the time this, proposal was under discussion last year up to the present, I have no hesitation in saying that the great bulk of the farmers in the electorate I represent do not believe in the imposition of extra duties on farming implements. I am also quite certain that they would offer no objection whatever to legislation on the New Zealand plan. They do not wish to see extra duties imposed upon the implements they use, because they know that they must compete in the markets of the world with their produce, and they are unable to -see why they should be asked to take the world's price for their produce whilst some one else is permitted to take a strictly artificial price for his. On the harvester question we bad fsome very tall statements from the Minister. At page 251 of Hansard, I find that the 'honourable gentleman quoted a declaration made by a Mr also. Edward Coxon. The way in which this declaration is introduced shows that the Minister cut the clipping out of the Ape newspaper, and crammed it into Hansard. It was most unfair to quote that declaration without any reference to the fact that it has been denied point blank by a gentleman who, Mr Coxon alleges, had made a certain statement, or to the fact that evidence in reply to it was given to the Tariff Commission, who have yet to decide which of the two statements is the more reliable. The Minister has shown the judicial position which he takes up by absolutely ignoring every statement which may ibe made in contradiction of Mk>. Coxon's declaration. When the honourable gentleman .has heard one side, he says that that must be true, and he refulses to listen to the other side. thing about there being another side ? tleman never mentioned the fact that there by a trust would be equivalent to cutting was another side. In dealing in his judicial off one's nose to spite one's face. It: would capacity with matters of this kind, the Minbe carrying the rigid protectionist principles ister should hear both sides. If Part III . of of the Minister of Trade and Customs to the Bill be passed in its present form, we an extreme, at other people's expense, to must rely for the effects of its operation which I think they should not be carried. upon the discretion of the Minister, whose action, so far, does not encourage us in the belief that such discretion will be very impartially exercised. In connection with the peculiarly an agricultural one, and '[ have dumping proposals, I find in the honourable received many requests to oppose any gentleman's speech some cryptic references to the Standard Oil Trust. He saidIn a few minutes I shall tell honourable members liow I propose to deal wilh the Standard Oil Trustand, speaiking of the Standard Oil Trust and the Steel Trust, the 'honourable gentleman saidWe shall, however, under the Hill, be able to prevent them irom bringing tlieir manufactures here to unduly interfere with our own industries. The honourable gentleman then went on to speak of a company in New South Wales with a nominal capital of £600,000 that proposes to erect works for the extraction of oil from shale. It must not be forgotten that there are two competitors at the present time in the Australian market for kerosene. There is the Shell Transport and Trading Company, a British-owned concern, which sells a large amount of kerosene oil in Melbourne and ""in the country towns of Victoria. to its business in New South Wales. We have also the "" White Rose"" and other brands of kerosene, put up by the Standard Oil Company. If the Minister is going to deal with these trusts by shutting out these goods in this way, our largest supplies of kerosene, which is the universal illuminant throughout the country districts, will be cut off, and we shall have to rely on the costly oils taken from shale in New South Wales. The honourable member for Barrier is aware that some years ago a duty was imposed in New South Wales on shale and kerosene oil, with the result that those using these oils had to pay a higher price for them. things cheaper ? ber should ask the Minister of Trade and ful illuminants yet discovered, and to prevent its importation because ai large portion Sitting suspended from 6.30 to 7.30 p.m.",44,Williamlyne T H E Honourable Is Carried Out In Its Entirety These Trades

I refer to the well-known machine called the harvester. cannot help thinking that, but for the very skilfully engineered agitation of Mr H. V. McKay, of Ballarat, we should never have seen the measure-it the Minister to stop the importation of harvesters from abroad, or, in effect, to levy a high duty upon them. He may increase their value for Customs purposes to £60, or even to £6,000 if he pleases; or he may prohibit their importation I should like to call the Minister's attention, if it is not too much trouble for him to listen to me, to the evidence given by tion of a fixed duty on harvesters. stated that it would be better to have a fixed duty than to rely upon the exercise of Ministerial discretion. The subject has been dealt with by the Tariff and, if I may say so, I think that it shows rather indecent haste for the Government to introduce legislation dealing with the matter until we have had the advantage of the deliberations of the Commission, and before the whole of the evidence taken upon the subject has been amongst honourable members. the only evidence that has been circulated amongst us is that of those who argue for a higher duty. The evidence of those who oppose higher duties-not porters, but the farming representatives, who came at their own expense to Melbourne to lay their views before the Tariff Commission-is being withheld. being made to rush this BiM through, it seems to me, for the purpose of covering up the Minister's tracks in the very arbitrary action which he took in raising the valuation of harvesters. dinary allegations have been made on this question. somewhat astonished at hearing honourable members repeat.

But no invention, whether I believe that steps are being it be. of a machine or any other product, and no new discovery, can have its benefits diffused over the earth unless people do copy them. Take every article that we wear-hats , clothes, boots, and so on. Those articles of attire in their present form were discovered by somebody, and were copied by other people. It is not Under this Bill-and I disgraceful for any manufacturer to copy the inventions of another person, provided that in doing so he keeps within the law. These harvesters were entitled to be copied, is within the power of and any manufacturer was distinctly within his rights in copying them, and in manufacturing them at the lowest possible cost for the purpose of finding buyers, for them. But £600, this heinous practice of copying machines and other articles is not limited to Ameriabsolutely. can manufacturers. The very Australian manufacturers who have been loudest in their complaints about the copying by Americans of Australian machines, have themselves adopted the very same practice. Take disc ploughs, which were referred to He. the other night by the honourable member for Moira. The disc plough is an American invention. It was patented in America, and the patent rights in Australia were sold Commission, to a man named Peacock. Disc ploughs have been manufactured here by various firms, some under licences from Peacock, and some without licences; because some of the Australian manufacturers considered that the patent was open to attack in Australia. An action has taken place recently circulated in our law courts, the result Of which shows At present that the patent was open to attack in Australia; but the idea, so far from being Australian, was an American idea, and our manufacturers were absolutely entitled to merely the imcopy it, no matter whether it originated in America, Timbuctoo, or anywhere else. They were entitled to make the machine and sell it at the lowest possible cost. Take An attempt is next the case of grain drills. No implement ever produced and used in Australia has done so much to improve farming in this country as the grain drill. It is purely an American invention. It was Some extraornever attempted to be made by any manufacturer out here for many years. Now, One or two of ttfiem I was however, it is made in Australia. How is it being made?

And this is one of the men who now clamour against the Americans for having copied the harvester ! These men, having been the confidential agents of American firms, and having obtained .confidential information, copied their goods-as legally and morally they were entitled to do; because, as I said before, if they were not copied the benefits produced by new inventions and discoveries would not become diffused over the globe as they are to-day. ventor, though. his fourteen years under fhe patent laws, within which he must make his "" pile."" If a man breaks the patent laws he should be punished for it. Buti f an article is not patented it is within the province of any manufacturer to copy it, whether he be an American, an Australian, or a British maker. To attack the Americans because they copied al non-patented article, and were quite within their rights in doing so, whilst the very men who call them pirates have done tlie same thing themselves-onl y in so doing they were not quite so reputable shows frame of mind. that some attacks can be made, and ought to be made, upon the American manufacturers. But let them be made on lines of justice and reason, and let not attacks be made upon them simply because they are doing something which makes an article that is largely used amongst our farmers a bit cheaper, and distributes the benefits of that article amongst a larerer section than would otherwise, get it. _ The outcry about copying articles of this description is one which is based: not upon any fact, but upon an entirely erroneous view of the rights of manufacturers, and an entirely erroneous statement of what actually took place. It is rather alarming, however, to think that these people who have the hardihood to come to Parliament, and make a claim of this kind, have themselves been guilty of the very practice which they condemn. In this connection I may refer to a remark made in the course of this debate by the honourable member for Perth, and to an interjection by the Attorney-General. I quote this to show that the Attorney-General is influenced by the same idea-that ' we ought to prevent the introduction of new machinery and new = He methods if we can. statement. ber will see what I mean when I read the interjection. The honourable member for Perth assumed a case where a machine was introduced into America, and resulted in certain products being sold in Australia at a reduced priceThe Australian manufacturer who wants to c compete is placed in this position : that he has either to get the new machine or to reduce the wages of his employees. I regret that I am unable to go into details of evidence given before the Tariff Commission, but I may say, incidentally, that frequently it has been told that the demand for a certain class of goods is so limited in Australia that to put in the best and most up-to-date machinery would not be justified. Therefore, the honourable member pointed out .that in a case of that kind', where a new invention came out, which would greatly lessen the cost of a particular article, and whi;h it would not pay a manufacturer to utilize here, it was quite competent for the manufacturer who was following obsolete methods in this country to say, "" I am being unfairly competed w it h ; these Americans can sell'their goods at one-half my price, and I must ask for a very diseased a prohibitory Tariff."" Thereupon, , the I have no doubt Attorney-General interjectedDoes the honourable member assume lhat the Australian industry is one advantageous to be preserved or not? What does that mean? That, according to the Attorney-General, the industry must be preserved, even if it is one which is absolutely prejudicial to the interests of the 'people of this country, and even though it be an industry which does not emp'nv up-to-date methods that will result in",47,Williamlyne T H E Honourable Is Carried Out In Its Entirety These Trades

The one object of the Attorney-General is the protection of the man engaged in the particular industry, but to give the benefits of a new invention to the whole people is a proposition that would strike him as practically not worth considering. Carry his idea to its logical issue, and! we find that it means that wherever a new machine is made in some other part of the world, which results in lowering the cost of production, and the cheapening of goods, if it will interfere with an Australian industry which has not adopted the new methods, we are entitled to stop those goods from coming into this country.

A question was mentioned to-da,y as to the methods which have been urged in support of this B ill . A constituent of mine, residing at Cape Bridgewater, which is about 270 miles from Melbourne, has sent to me the precious production which I hold in my hand. It is a production called the Dairy Farming and Agricultural News. I think it ought to be called the Fairy Farming News, because there are more "" fairies ' ' in it than I have seen in any similar production. On the wrapper in which the publication was enclosed, is, as large as life, "" On His Majesty's Service."" The object of that is to convey to the farmers that this is a Government publication, with the purpose of disseminating knowledge on this question. tion ? I would take a large shade of odds that shine Harvester in Australia, has Imore interest in the publication than any other individual.

273,Mr Robinson,"I am not aware thatThe view I take of this may be wrong. Perhazards. For the time being, such a haps it is only another sample of the Deakinized rar:r atmosphere, which it seems we must get used to. I think the complaint of this farmer is very justifiable. Here we have people who have been "" pulling the strings,"" in a parliamentary sense, more effectively than have any persons with whom we have had to deal since the start of the Commonwealth, and they have brought their methods to such a pitch that they send partisan publications through the post so marked. The tactics of some of the American trusts I have read about are "" pretty steep,"" but I do not think these trusts have anything to teach to some of the people who seek to imitate therm in Australia. It is evident that one or two of our have taken as a lesson some of the worse features of the American trusts, because their methods are. of a most distinctly up-to-date character. The means proposed in the Bill for checking dumping are, in my opinion, a great reflection upon Parliament. If we consent to give up the power of taxation, and of dealing with imports and exports to the Minister for the time being, whoever he may be, we may as well close up Parliament. I am glad to see that the Minister has agreed to the improvement suggested of appointing a Judge to conduct investigations under this part of the Bill. any board of experts that might be appointed would probably have amongst its number a trade competitor of the man whose goods it was sought to stop. position a man, outside the Supreme Court, of the same status as a Judge? objection to that, so long as we got a man of independent character not engaged in trade. In fact, for some reasons I would prefer a Tudge not to be employed, because he would be asked to decide, not questions of law or of fact, but questions of opinion as to whether in the interests of workers, consumers, and producers, certain goods should or should not be admitted. If the Judge appointed was of one way of thinking he might say that, in the experience of the TJnited Kingdom, certain industries had been built up on the dumping of its raw material; if he was of another way of thinking, he might seek to stop dumping at all Judge would exercise a political sway that he ought not to exercise; and from that point of view I regard such an appointment as most objectionable. But the man secured ought to be absolutely impartial. In thinking the matter over, I do not believe that we could do better than fall back on a method which, though not a perfect one by any means, is freer from some of the objections that have been urged than are other tribunals. I refer to the method suggested by the Attorney-General on one occasion when he occupied a seat in the Opposition corner, namely, to appoint a Standing Committee on Trade, which would report every year or every three or six manufacturers months on questions of this kind'.. Once we place this power in the hands of a Judge, that Judge will be in a very awkward position. If the power is placed in the hand's of a tribunal appointed by the Minister, we may have trade competitors deciding on a matter which vitally affects their own pockets. The old expedient of a parliamentary Committee, much knocked about and deplored as that expedient has been on occasions, has much to recommend it. After all, I believe that the majority of honourable members would, in a matter of this kind, endeavour to bring the facts before their fellow members. Such a Committee would also have the great advantage that it would be a body appointed by, and composed of, Members of Parliament, so that parliamentary control would be to some extent secured. If. we give the power of controlling the Customs duties and imports solely to. the Minister, we shall as a Parliament abrogate one of our chief functions. The honourable member for Mernda the other day declared that Parliament had not the respect it once had, and that parliamentary debates did not excite the public attention that was earned for them in the past. ber for Mernda to-night? ber must ask me an easier question. There is something to be said for the attitude of the honourable member for Mernda; but if there is one thing more than another that is likely to injure the standing of Parliament in the eyes of the people of Australia, it is the fact that we shirk our responsibility by every day legislating more and more by regulation-mor e and more by proclamation-and less and less by Parliament.

301,Mr Wilks,"The honourable member ispolicy. Its object cannot be described as an attempt to sneak in protection, because it aims at much more than that, and if successfully administered by a protectionist would mean the deluging of the Commonwealth with protection. If the Bill is carried into force as it stands, the Minister of Trade and Customs will be able to do everything that he has been trying to accomplish for years past. need for an alteration of the Tariff, because he will, by his own act, be able to increase the protection given to local manufacturers as much as he likes. Even the honourable member for Perth, who is a member of the Labour Party, a supporter of the Government, and a member of the Tariff Commission, has stated openly that the Bill is an instance of protection run stark, staring mad. member for Perth is a free-trader run mad. glad' to get his support. The statement which I have quoted was not that of an irresponsible partisan, but of one wlio believes in the nationalization of certain monoshould run the shops whose employees were polies, and has spent eighteen months in listening to evidence upon the operation of the existing Tariff. I was elected as a free trader, and shall not allow, so far as I can prevent it, the carrying out of protection such as the Bill seeks to provide for. It is a curious thing that the gigantic monopolies of which we have heard so much all exist in protectionist America, and it has been only with the advent of protection in Australia that the fear of monopolies has arisen here. Monopolies can be based only upon legislative privileges. \\The Government party are responsible for the protective Tariff, which alone can be made the basis of any monopolies that may be established here, and, having created' a condition of things which makes the existence of monopolies to ibe feared, they now ask for power to regulate and control them. I can understand a protectionist like the Attorney General, who thinks that openings have been made in the Tariff wall which enable foreign companies to invade Australia, voting for fhe B ill ; but I cannot understand why other honourable members should vote for a measure whose practical effect will be to provide for prohibition, if a protectionist is establishing a branch in Svdney. When Minister of Trade and Customs cares to apply its provisions to that end. The Minister, speaking in December last, said that it would be useless to bring in a Bill for the amendment of the Tariff, because the Opposition would prevent it from becoming law. If we are strong enough to prevent the raising of duties, why should we ibe a party to the passing of a prohibitive measure such as this? As a free-trader, I am prepared to acknowledge that in the fiscal battle we were defeated, and I am therefore ready to respect the Tariff which ParThere will be no liament has passed. I wish to see that Tariff properly enforced, and to prevent its evasion by outside corporations; but I certainly shall not vote for prohibition. One effect of the Bill is that, while it deals with monopolies controlled by associations, it neglects those controlled by an individual, a co-partnership, or a voluntary association. Moreover, so long as a monopoly confines its operations to any one State, the Commonwealth legislation cannot, apply to it. As an illustration of what I think justifiable State interference with private enterprise, I would refer to the early closing legislation which a short time ago was forced upon many of fhe States Parliaments. It was never suggested, when that legislation was being advocated, that the Government appealing for shorter hours; but it was found' necessary, since a voluntary movement! for early closing had failed, to declare by legislation that, after certain hours, no business should ibe done in the shops to which it applied. That was an instance of State interference, and we, on this side, stoutly advocate State control and regulation of hurtful monopolies. The honourable member for Bland and his party, however, seem to have forgotten the most important plank of their platform. They had only two planks, namely, the progressive land tax and the nationalization of monopolies. They have given up the latter of these, and have adopted, in its stead, the principle of the regulation and control of monopolies. I would point out that the Colonial Sugar Refining Company are not free from competition. I am pleased 'to be able to inform honourable members that land has been purchased, and buildings are in process of erection, in the electorate which I represent, with the object of establishing a rival sugar refinery. Mr Poolman, who carries on a sugar refinery in Melbourne, we asked the Minister of Trade and Customs to point to one example of a destructive or oppressive monopoly in Australia,.",52,Williamlyne T H E Honourable Is Carried Out In Its Entirety These Trades

We are now being asked to legislate, not against an existing evil, but in anticipation of certain destructive monopolies arising in the future. cure. scared by what has taken place in America, where gigantic combinations are rearing their heads and becoming a menace to the whole community. We find that, notwithstanding all the efforts that have been made in the United States to pass effective, legisexpressed the opinion that it would be betlation, the trusts are able to work their own sweet will, and to go on their way rejoicing. We should not hasten to pass legislation of this kind merely because evils of a certain character have arisen in other countries. As a free-trader, I might point out that large combines and trusts find the most suitable fields for their secure the services of a Judge. operations in protectionist countries, where large legislative privileges have been conferred upon local producers by a high Tariff system. I know ot only two combines in Great Britain, where there is free competition so far as the outside world is concerned. upon privileges, in the form of certain patent rights, conferred by legislation. After having looked through the Bill very carefully, and having listened with attention to the debate, I have arrived at the conclusion that the measure provides protection for large business concerns, but affords none to those who are operating in a small way. admits that the measure will confer some advantages. tage upon those who are interested in the larger undertakings, because it will remove all competition. Whilst free competition is encouraged, there need be no fear of dangerous monopolies. Last session, Ministers appeared to think that all monopolies were dangerous and detrimental to the public interest, but the present measure is intended to apply only to monopolies that are detrimental to the public. Further consideration has led to a change in the attitude of the Government in this and other respects. The present measure was presented by the Minister of Trade and Customs, in a speech which consisted mainly of a recital of the marginal notes, and it rested with the Attorney-General to explain the principles Qf the measure, and to acknowledge that it would be effective as against corporations, but not as against individuals. The Government have changed their attitude also with regard to another matter. When the former Bill was introduced, the Minister of Trade and Customs stated that he was in favour of the appointment of a permanent Board. When introducing the present measure, he stated that he thought it preferable that Boards should be appointed as required. On the very next day, the Attorney-General ter to refer all matters to a Judge, instead of to a Board. These changes of front indicate, to mv mind, that Ministers are not agreed upon the best course to pursue. sistent, so far as that is concerned, because from the outset we endeavoured to isters have been doing in Cabinet. I only know what has been publicly announced by them. Nothing whatever was said about the appointment of a Judge when the Minister of Trade and Customs introduced the Even these monopolies rest Bill. On the very next day, however, after the honourable member for Bland had suggested that a Judge should be substituted for the proposed Board, the Attorney General said he thought there would be no difficulty in making the change, and that that would be a better arrangement. along endeavoured to secure the services of a Judge. attempt was to secure the services of a Judge. that the difficulty should have disappeared within about five minutes. Immediately after the honourable member for Bland had urged that a Judge should be appointed, the Minister of Trade and Customs said that such an appointment would be provided for. a Judge would be appointed, but that it would be much better if we could secure the services of a Judge. prevent the Government from appointing a Judge.

I have taken the trouble to look up the statistics, and I find that three-fouTths of our importations of steel and iron goods come from Great Britain. Sir WILLIAM LYNE of the goods entered as coming from Great Britain are really of Belgian origin. made his second-reading speech the Minister of Trade and Customs was beating the drum on behalf of preferential trade in Great Britain, and, on the grounds of loyalty to the Empire, was advocating that we should import British goods upon better terms than those accorded to foreigners. He now teJLs us that, owing to the extent to which goods-whic h come mainly from Great Britain-ar e being dumped upon our markets, legislative action must be taken to restrict such importations. I find that last year the value of the iron and steel goods imported into the Commonwealth from Belgium, was £ 1 9 0 , 0 0 0 , whilst the importations of similar goods from Great Britain were valued at £ 3 , 4 8 0 , 0 0 0.

We are not told that these goods are being sold at less than cost price, and I think that we should be supplied with some information upon this very important point. Surely it is only right that we should ask for evidence of the necessity for passing such legislation Ln the interests of the Australian producer. In the United States the Commissioner of the Bureau of Corporations was called upon to report upon the operations of the trusts, and the Hon. W. J. Bryan, one of the ablest of American politicians, and an advanced democrat, introduced what is called the licensing system, which has proved highly effective in connection with certain monopolies. I believe that the object which it is sought to attain by means of the measure now before us could be partly secured by an amendment The Minister told of the Companies Act. WhilstI am anxious that Australia should escape from the evils attendant upon the unrestricted' operation of huge foreign monopolies, I am not prepared to assist in making the buttresses of protection stronger, and thus render it possible for internal monopolies to work still greater harm to the community.

I venture to say that if it should ever emerge from Committee, nobody will recognise it. Of course, its title will remain unchanged, and' that will satisfy the Minister. I think that the Opposition are performing a great service in pointing out the deficiencies of the measure. Before it is passed I should like to be afforded an opportunity to peruse the report of the Tariff Commission, so far as metals and machinery are concerned. The Minister will not care a fig for that report when once tihe measure has been passed. aai improved Tariff. which consists of an equal number of free traders and protectionists, has been sifting continuously for eighteen months. It has conducted a most exhaustive investigation, which has cost the country ,£10,000. Here is a Bill presented for our consideration, which the report of that body may cut right into, and tihe Minister will not delay its passage to allow of the Commission's recommendations being placed before us. The honourable member for Perth regards the measure as a sham. of the Labour Party upon the Tariff Commission. of the free-traders, but not of the Labour Party. tain respect for the honourable member for Perth, even if the honourable member for Melbourne Ports does not. not respect him. for Perth, as a labour representative, declares that the provisions of this Bill are a sham. The Tariff Commission has been inquiring into certain matters, with a view to demonstrating whether monopolies exist in Australia, whether the Tariff has been over-ridden, and whether there has been dumping. The Minister has refused' to give us an illustration of the existence of any destructive monopoly, or of dumping operations. As the Tariff Commission has tobacco combines are quite enough, to begin been unable to present the official report of with. the evidence which it has taken upon these matters, I can only rely upon the newsfor Fremantle holds that the producers in paper reports of that evidence.

Sir member said £ 3 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 last time. in round numbers I may say that British manufactures, under the division "" Metals and Machinery,"" represent £ 4 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 . We do not ask for economic teaching in connection with this matter. posite need it . rican authorities on the subject, and the Prime Minister need not be so conceited. He is not the only man who can read, nor is he the only man who can remember what he has read. We know the evils that exist in America, and if they existed here, or were likely to arise here, we should be prepared to vote for a measure to prevent destructive monopolies. I can say, on the subject of dumping, that, while I am prepared to fight Tariff battles as a free trader, when a Tariff has been passed into law I am, as an Australian^ prepared to see that it is given effect to. But we are asked, in this matter, to shut our eyes and swallow the B ill as it is presented. Perhaps the Prime Minister will not accept the statement that destructive monopolies are caused by people taking advantage of the privileges given them under high protective Tariffs. I submit my amendment, not as one who is an enemy of the B ill , but that we mav be placed in possession of further information on which to deal with it. Ministers who are most strongly interested in the B ill , the discussion upon it has only had the effect of damning it with -faint praise. strongly in favour of it have admitted that they do not believe that it will be effective. I wish to see such a measure made effective. I believe in State interference in these matters, to the extent of control and regulation, and I say this Bill passes in its present form, ancl proves to be a failure, the honourable members of the Labour Party will accept no responsibility for it, and blame both the Ministry and the Opposition for carrying, an ineffective measure.

I am fortunate in having, engineering establishment in Australia, and I said £ 3 ^ 8 0 , 0 0 0 , and it is natural that I should like to see that industry progress. In spite of that, I have on no occasion voted for protection. When I hear people speaking of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company as a monopoly because it happens to be a successful concern, I ask to be shown that its operations are hurtful, before I vote for legislation which may injuriously affect it . I know We have read the Amethat Mort's Dock and Engineering Company have, in certain classes of work, a kind of monopoly, but it is not a hurtful monopoly. By their use of the word "" destructive "" in this Bill, Ministers admit that some combinations may be beneficial. I believe that the operations of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company are beneficial. This measure, as it stands, will provide absolute protection, not for the workmen nor the small men controlling Australian industries, but for the big men. It will be no disgrace to the Ministry to delay the further consideration of this Bill. I have heard it said on the best authority this evening that the repott of the Tariff Commission on metals and machinery will probably be in the hands of the Prime Minister in less than a week, and surely we cannot be accused of desiring to delay the consideration of the Bill, when we ask that we shall first be supplied with the information which will be contained in that report.

394,Mr Speaker,"I think the honorablemark. Although we may say that what I have described is not intended at the present time-and no one supposes that any one is going to be venturesome enough to bring in a Bill with that sole object in view-w e cannot help considering that legislation, unless it is well thought out and the administration of the lands. wisely framed, usually has the very opposite effect from what is intended. A strictly honbut, by writings and by conversations orable politician ought to decline to exercise with various Members of Parliament-on e the powers cast upon him by a Bill such as this in its present form. Not only do I wonder that it should be sought to entrust any one with such power, but I am amazed that any politician' should seek to have it for himself. If the provisions to which I have referred have crept in by mistake, the sooner they are knocked out by design the better. This is a Bill, not for the restraint of destructive monopolies, but for the repression of all sound and legitimate trading in Australia. The more I study this BiM, the more clearly I see that, supposing it to be prepared with an entirely honest purpose, the result would be entirely different from that which is intended. The measure would be destructive of all honest government, with such powers as it proposes to give to the Minister to do what he likes in' determining whether trading is sound or unsound. It would be unjust to the Parliament itself to do such a thing, and would be absolutely destructive of all confidence throughout the mercantile community. No man would be safe from his neighbour if such a Bill as this were to pass. Any man having found out something about the business of another might send along to the Minister of Trade and Customs, and say that such and such a thing was being done, and then the precious Minister would appoint his precious Board-woul d appoint whom he pleased, remark! We will suppose that there is an honest Minister in office. He, however, mav be succeeded by another Minister of a different character, when there may happen in this Commonwealth what has happened in America, in Canada, in New South Wales, andin Victoriaa Minister who is amenable to ""argument,"" and who of his own sweet will could levy blackmail on every large trading concern throughout the country. toria did anvthing of cially to an incident connection with the land laws in New South Wales seven or eight years ago.

I pointed out that it would be almost impossible to escape from corruption, because men would pay a good deal for the sake of peace. Once we allow that sort of thing to be started, we never know where it will stop, nor what state of affairs will result. There is no question that in New South Wales the sort of thing to which I have referred has resulted; and the very Minister who selected the men against whom the gravest charges have been made was the Minister who is in charge of this Bill to-day. If you have a system of that kind, how can you expect anything but corruption ? referred fo what a Minister in Victoria did, and said that he black-mailed the commercial community. regard to lands in particular, and I said that under this Bill there would be an opportunity to black-mail the mercantile community just as under the New South Wales lands system there has. been an opportunity to black-mail the land-owning part of the community. The principle is the same. In New South Wales a power was given outside that which ought to have been given. In fact, the Minister was set above Parliament. What happened was exactly what was prophesied by men who took the trouble to think. In our Customs Act we inserted a provision under which the Minister actually raised the duty on an article without any evidence to support his action, and even refused to allow the question to be brought Before the Courts, t Minister in Vicwhere it could be determined, when that sort? he himself must know that the evidence of am referring espethe men who are manufacturing harvesters which happened in would show that the valuation placed on",60,William Lyne Th E Honourable In One Portion Of My Electorate The Largest

399,Mr Conroy,"I was speaking withimported harvesters was greater than the price for which they themselves could manufacture them. He must know that, if he knows anything at all. But the Minister has been set above the law. What can we expect to happen under this Bill? Look at the Minister in charge of it ! We all know that the Bill was brought in at the dictation another ancl it has been. Nothing has surprised me more than that the Attorney-General should allow himself to countenance a B i ll like this after such threats as we have had. He is able enough fo know what the Bill means. None knows better than he the dangers that lie beneath such a measure, and none knows better than he the improper uses to which it can be put. Instead of efforts being made to put an end to monopolies, we actually seek to create them. How? Merely by blocking competition. In all other cases it was always said that to block competition tended to create monopolies. When a former Minister of Customs, the right honourable member for Adelaide, brought in a Bill for the repression of destructive monopolies, how did he proceed 1 He proceeded to lower Customs duties so that fuller competition should be allowed to take place. That, at all events was an honest attempt to deal with the evil. It was the method which has been proposed in America, though it has never been brought into f u l l play there. The same method Has been adopfecl in Canada. A t all events,, some reasonable effort was there made to deal with monopolies. But in this Bill we have legislation of an absolutely novel character. One would have thought that, before something entirely new was introduced into the arena of politics, some effort would have been made to read up the history of monopolies. One af the bitterest fights in English parliamentary history took place about the year 1600, and the half-dozen years preceding, when Parliament hacl become strong enough to assert itself against the granting of monopolies which went on under Queen Elizabeth. The fight became so fierce that eventually Elizabeth, had to make what was termed the "" gracious concession "" to Parliament that for the future those monopolies should not be granted. then may happen under the Bill. The Minister may do just as he pleases, and all the damage may be inflicted when Parliament is not sitting. Just observe what has been provided in some of the later clauses of the Bill. From the date of a simple Gazette notice it is provided that goods which are the subject of investigation shall not be imported except on such security, and subject to such conditions, as the Minister approves. The Minister will have decided the whole matter beforehand, he already having acted, or shown his willingBill would be brought in, ness to act, on the advice of some party interested. According to clause 18, subclause 2, if the Board report that the imported goods do, or probably will, compete unfairly with Australian, goods, the Governor General, under the powers of the Customs Act 1001, may prohibit their importation, either absolutely or under such conditions and restrictions as he deems just. Reallv there may be a total and complete prohibition of the whole of the goods. The manner in which the Prime Minister, at the end of last session, sought to hurry through this measure, acting at the dictation of the Minister of Trade and Customswho had been disappointed of a higher Tariff on some goods-wa s unworthy of any Minister who has ever been in power in Australia. Such a procedure isonly worthy of a Minister who would go to Sydney and deny statements that every one of us in this House knew to be true, though we did not care to give evidence in the matter, not desiring to be mixed up in the proceedings involving what had talken place within these walls. Every one knew that what the Prime Minister was stating was not true, but that the words complained of had been used. Under the circumstances, what chance is there of a legitimate administration of a measure of this kind? It is proposed to prohibit trading; and, after all, what is trading? Trading may not add directly to the production of wealth, but it allows the fullest possible use to be made of wealth that is produced. If we did away with trading in Australia, I venture to say that half the peop'le in the country would sink to a condition of poverty and misery without parallel except in parts of Russiaa condition in which half the comforts of civilized lif e would disappear. When we reflect on trade, and how slowly, and with what infinite pains, it has been developed, it should be the last institution What happened in the world to suffer any interference. From the time when the country was peopled with savages, who, after cutting rough paths through the forests or traversing the rivers in t'heir rude craft, exchanged little weapons and other articles, trade has",61,William Lyne Th E Honourable In One Portion Of My Electorate The Largest

We Were Threatened That,"grown and developed, until now great vessels traverse the ocean engaged in the work of the exchange of commodities. us welcome every extension in ship building, and of machinery to propel vessels across the waters at greater speeds, and less expense, so that our products may be carried to the markets of the world, and that we, in turn, may receive goods from elsewhere. change there is no trade. If we were compelled to export all and receive nothing we should be in t'he position of a people paying tribute which would be bitterly felt by us all. It is precisely because for every £1,000,000 worth of goods sent out, goods to the value of £1,000,000 must come back that we prosper as we do. Here we have a measure which is not framed in the interests of the great bulk of t'heproducers. Out of all the products of Australia, valued at £120,000,000, £29,000,000 one-fourth, that will be affected by this Bill. If we take the value of the manufactures did were,, therefore, and extend that averagie throughout the Commonwealth, we find that the value of the unaided manufactures £25,000,000 or £26,000,000, more than £2,000,000 or £3,000,000 of manufactured goods can be affected in any way by duties. of the manufacturers which represent, say, one-fiftieth or onesixtieth of the products of Australia, are so paramount that their representations to the Minister are at once listened to. House is asked to introduce legislation specially in their interest, and to hurry on that legislation before even we have had the reports of the Tariff Commission. That is a disgraceful state of affairs, and absolutely unworthy of any Minister, except, as I have said, a Minister ""who would go to Sydney and make the statements he did in one of the Courts. In the Sherman Aot, of which we have heard ai good deal, there was no proposal to do away with and no contention repress a monopoly other monopoly the field to itself. the Wilson Act was introduced, it set out that a monopoly was any combination which tried to increase prices. is entirely different to the proposed legislation before us, which seeks to prevent persons doing anything to lower prices. Mr Conroy. lowering of prices in our case is to be the evil, and one competitor may accuse another Some of of underselling him. Weknow that this lowering of prices goes on all over the world, and is a legitimate way of carrying on business. How can business be carried on unless men try to produce at the lowest possible price? I ask those who are allied with the Labour Party, in what better way Unless there is mutual excan labour be benefited, considering that workers have to sell their labour at the market price according to the law of supply and demand, than by getting f u l l advantage of any lowering of the prices of commodities? If a man has to work only half-an-hour in order to obtain a certain commodity,, that is certainly better than if he had to work one hour. Yet, according to this B ill , if there is any endeavour made to lower roughly prices, the worker, who has to sell his there are only labour according to the law of supply and worth, or a little less than demand, is not to be allowed any advantage, whereas the wealthy manufacturer, I presume, will have his demands .heard. We in New South Wales, which could get no better proof of the not enjoy any duties, and correctness of the latter supposition than in a natural state, the statement of the Minister of Trade and Customs himself, when introducing the B ill , is about at whose instigation he acts, in reference worth fairly large combination, and has done so uncommonly well out of his machines, that Yet the interests he should not be allowed to obtain any more of these goods, advantage than he can legitimately claim as the reward of his industry. The Minister of Trade and Customs next interviewed the manager for Sir George Newnes This and Co., who represent a capital of some .£600,000 or £ 8 0 0 , 0 0 0 ; and I hope that honourable members will note how solicitous the Minister of Trade and Customs is to interview only men like that. ' The Minister did not think there was anything peculiar in his interviewing those gentlemen, but regarded it as a very natural course for any one in charge of a ' B ill of this kind to take. But is it not only human nature on the part of competition, persons interested to get the Bill so framed that the way to as to squeeze what they can out of the was to give anpublic?

402,And That Not To The Harvester. Mr Mckay Represents A,"then asks us to support! hini in what he is doing in their interests. To my mind, the Labour Party has never occupied a more unenviable position than at present. Fully one-half of the Labour Party know that the B ill is not in the interests of the workers -that everything that tends to render it diffinose until the end of this Parliament, and cult for people of small means to get along, plays into the hands of the lanrge combination. With that knowledge, it is dreadful that those members of the Labour Party should be controlled and led about, as they are, by men like the presentPrime Minister. Many revilings, insults, and opprobious epithets have been heaped on the Prime Minister; but it cannot be doubted that he to-day sways the Labour Party, and that they dance as he whistles. follow him with a fortitude and devotion worthy of a better cause. . .However a Labour member may deride a Ministerialist, the latter has always the retort, "" You were three to two against us, and yet you could no.t find amongst you a man to fill Mr Deakin's position, and now you have to do exactly what he tells you to do."" I do not wonder that the Labour Leagues outside, seeing the anomalous position of the labour representatives here, are raising their voices in protest against it. Whatever those representatives may say, we know what their actions will be, and, as the Government have said that they intend to put this Bill through, the Labour Party will see that it is put through, although they must know that its provisions will injure the interests of the workers. Does the measure contain a clause providing for the maintenance of the wages of the workers? There is not a word in it which relates to that subject. Is there anything in the Bill to provide for the safeguarding of the interests of the workers? Not a syllable. Everything is to be given to the men who already have a big enough fortune. The Labour Partyis supporting the Bill because the man who framed it had the artfulness, or the cleverness, to name it a B i ll for the preservation of Australian industries, and for the repression of destructive monopolies. We are told that the title describes its true object and intention, but we know that its effect will be veryi different. Nearly four years ago, when the Customs Bill was being considered, I said that if the honourable member for Hume ever became Minister of Trade and Customs, he would take advantage of one of its provisions to prevent men from having a remedy at law for action taken by the Department, and my words have come true. Are we going to give the honourable gentleman still further powers? I pity many members of the Labour Party for the position in which they are placed. Ministers have them by the do as they like with them. They may go through the country declaring what they will do; but we know that, no matter how' largely they may talk about dictating to the Government, they will not vote against a Government proposal. Inferior as the Ministerial Party is to the Labour Party in point of numbers-and we are told in point of ability, too-the members of the Labour Party have humbly to obey the comThey mands of the Ministry. learned member discussing the amendment ? little from the question before the Chair. According to paragraph b of clause 6, competition shall be deemed to be unfair if it ""would probably, or does, in fact, result in a lower remuneration for labour."" Is there any new invention whose introduction will not, for a time, at any rate, result in a lower remuneration for the labour engaged in the industry to which it is applied? I could name a thousand instances in support of that statement. Does not the House remember the history of cotton spinning? Do not honourable members know that the cotton jennv displaced thousands, and resulted in lower rates of 1 wages until new trades came to be established? But the advantage to the public of the discovery of better means of making cotton and linen has been incontestableSimilarly, the introduction of machinery for the spinning of yarns threw hundreds of unfortunate weavers and others out of employment. If it were proposed to introduce machinery which would have the effect of saving labour, the provisions of the B ill , supposing it to be in force, could be used to absolutely prohibit its importation. and learned member to connect his remarks with the amendment.

If those honourable members who are responsible for the introduction of this Bil l had, on a previous occasion, acknowledged that an increase of prices would injure the consumer, what a fine thing it would have been. They would then have immediatelylowered the Tariff in order to enable those who were suffering, from the drought to retain some money in their pockets, instead of leaving them without a sixpence with which to' bless themselves. knows that the majority of the squatters had no money vvith which to buy food for their stock. and they are.now paying the penalty A Bill of this kind would only have tended to intensify the evil of which I have been speaking. is the purpose of the B ill , but I am merely showing how far the measure departs from the lines of sound legislation. Let me put a case. If , during a drought in New South Wales, certain men in Queensland and Tasmania entered into a combination with a view to selling potatoes at a lower price than they could be placed on the New South Wales market by the local producers, a complaint might be made that, they were lowering prices, and should be punished under the terms of this B ill . urged that no such case would arise, but 1 we have had such things as, what I may call, food combines. We certainly had a combine of that character in New South Wales during the last severe drought, when all the hay and maize was bought up in advance. that the late Premier of New South Wales expressed his indignation in the strongest terms at the suggestion that the duties upon fodder should be suspended in consequence of the drought, and that it afterwards transpired that he was interested as a produce merchant with others in buying up all the wheat and other produce that he could possibly lay his hands on. promote that kind of thing. [25] Commission was appointed to inquire into I a number of matters"" that in some way or other bear upon this point, and there I is abundant reason why we should wait until we have before us the whole of theinformation that they have been able togather. It may have been ascertained by the Commission that the man in whose interest this measure was framed has made a. profit of £ 3 0 , 0 0 0 or £ 4 0 , 0 0 0 , owing to the higher prices that he has been able to> charge the farmers. It may also have been-, ascertained that he has sold machines for export at a lower price than he receives for those ""which are purchased locally. I cannot say, because I do not know. But I have been told on the very best authority that when he was endeavouring to induce certain persons to put capital into his business, he stated that the machines could be produced for about £ 2 8 each. Yet we have a Bill framed practically in the interests of the one person referred to, and perhaps two or three others. It is not for a moment to be supposed that the measure will confer benefit upon many others. It is partial legislation of the very worse I do not suppose that that kind. Surely the manufacturer to whom I have referred does not pay his men more than they are worth-h e is not running a charitable establishment. Why should we not wait until we can read the evidence of the Tariff Commission, and ascertain the exact position ? It may be shown that some trades are enjoying protection to a larger amount than is represented by t'he whole of the wages paid by them in carrying on their operations, or that the cost of bringing machinery from other countries is more It may be than equivalent to the outlay for wages in the production of similar machinery in Australia. I know of half-a-dozen cases to which such statements would apply, and there may be other instances of'which-1 am not aware. At any rate, there is every reason why we should wait, and why we DoI not remember very well should refrain from rushing through a Bill of this character. learned member propose to vote against it? learned member knows me too well to dream that I could vote for it.

As I have already pointed out, nothing new could be introduced into Australia if the provisions of the Bill were strictly carried out. Suppose, for instance, that we had no Wireless Telegraphy Act such as is now embodied in our statute-book, that our telegraph lines were under private control, and that it were proposed to introduce wireless telegraphy into Australia. That system of transmission would undoubtedly have become a commercial success long before this if it had not been for the hindrances placed in the way of experiments, because of the telegraph systems being so largely in the hands of the various Governments. It is because of this fact that the development of the invention has been much slower than would have been the case if those interested in it had been afforded fuller opportunities for testing it. If , as I say, our telegraph systems were in the hands of private companies, and it were proposed to introduce wireless telegraphy, we should find the telegraph companies going to the Minister and saying: "" It is proposed to introduce a system of telegraphy which will do away with the thousands of poles that are used under present. conditions. in the forests, and if it becomes no longer necessary to use them hundreds of men will be thrown out of work. possible to dispense with the wire which now has to be manufactured out of iron and afterwards to be galvanized. If this is done thousands of men who are now engaged in digging the ore out of the ground and in providing the coal that is necessary for smelting the ore and producing the iron, will be thrown out of work. The new system should be excluded, because it would result in lowering the remuneration of our workers."" Such a condition of affairs would naturallv arise under the provisions of the measure. Then, again, it is provided that if competition would result in the disorganization of Australian industry, and in throwing workers out of emplovment, it could be dealt with under the B ill. No consideration would be paid to the additional number of men that might obtain employment under the new conditions. It seems to me that an attempt is I have read t'he being made to build a Chinese wall of restriction round the Commonwealth, and to render it 'absolutely dead to all progress. Who would suffer from such a state of things? Which class has advanced most as the result of free competition? If it had not been for the operation of the law of competition, how many honourable members of the Labour Party; would now be occupying their places in this House today ? I do not know that any of them are of high birth, that they can boast of long lines 'of ancestors which should entitle them to popular favour, or that they can claim that they possess any great wealth. The law nf competition has asserted itself and broken down the law of caste, and honourable members of the Labour Party ought to acknowledge that the very best thing that could happen would be to allow competition to have free play. Of course, competition has its hard and cruel side, as everything else has, but it has minimized the great mass of evils which afflict the public. When we say that this measure wi 11 restrict advancement we may be told that Ministers would not do this, or that, or the other. But I would' ask whether all politicians are to be regarded as wise? Have they such a name for wisdom that it is not to be supposed that they will make an unwise use of the laws? Do we not hear remarks on every hand with regard to the want of common sense on the part of the representatives of the peoDle? . That, These poles have to be cut of course, is the fault of the electors. If they cannot make a proper estimate of the value of one set of brains as against It will also be another, they must pay the penaltv. I cannot understand why members of the Labour Party should suppose that a law of this kind would operate for the benefit of. the workers. If they desire that the workers should be protected, they should insist that those who receive the benefit of the measure shall be called upon to show that they pay not only the ruling rate of wages, but the ruling rate plus the amount of the duty of which they receive the protection. If there is to be prohibition, let the worker receive the f u l l benefit. I do not believe in the nationalization of industry as a general principle, but I can quite conceive that the results, though, bad in many cases, would be better than those which would follow from the operation of a measure such as this. At all events, there would be an attempt made to secure justice. This Bill is ad-",66,William Lyne Th E Honourable In One Portion Of My Electorate The Largest

Could there be anything worse? Doubtless the reports of the Tariff Commission will show that there is a growing tendency on the part of trades to consolidate, and for their control to pass either into the hands of a combine or of some organization of individuals. In Germany the various trades seem to be passing into the hands of syndicates who are controlling them. learned member think that is a good thing? able and learned member do in regard to such combinations? little more freedom. The evil effects of trusts are infinitely worse in countries in which restrictive method's have been employed to cope with them, than they are elsewhere.

Why should we say to one set of beneficiaries, "" If you do such and such a thing, we will keep you going at the expense of other citizens, whose interests ought to be equally dear to us."" Few honourable members understand a simple [25]2 proposition of this kind better than does' the Attorney-General, and I am sorry indeed that he has not seen fit to espouse the cause of the struggling masses: His abilities would have enabled him to achieve a great deal in that direction. Who have they to plead their cause now thar the majority of the Labour Party are deserting them? I think it is Chateaubriand,. in his Memoirs, * who saysDepend upon it that any legislation introduced except it is founded upon morality and justice will always have a directly contrary effect to that intended. Cani t be urged that this legislation is founded upon a . spirit of justice, seeing . that we are singling out one class for preservation at the expense of the rest of the community? Can it be said that, as a Parliament, we are working upon lines of morality when we are considering only the interests of those who are well able to take care of themselves? I submit that it cannot.* By so much as we depart from the great principles of morality and justice, by so much will the legislative result of our efforts be exactly contrary to our intentions.

I desire to bring under your notice, Mr Speaker, a matter which seems to require attention, and that is the editing of the speeches of honourable members before they are published in Hansard. A striking illustration of that occurs in the last number of Hansard, wherein is published the speech of the honorablo member for Parramatta, delivered in this House last week on the SupplyB ill . to an interjection,that he had never signed anv pledge to any party. reply was definite and distinct-that he did not sijT.n any pledge to any party. It was made on two occasions, and reported in the daily press. But I find that that reply is not recorded in the Hansard report, and that the method of Mr Close, in New South Wales, has been adopted here-that the honourable member has no recollection, and that his memory fails. I think that Hansard should be a true record of what is said by the members of this House;and whatever honourable members may do with regard to altering the verbiage of their remarks, they should not be allowed to take out of a report essential matters that have been openly stated and amplified in speeches in this House.
