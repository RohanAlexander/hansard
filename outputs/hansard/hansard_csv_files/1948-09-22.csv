Sir Thomas Blarney's visit to Japan was arranged by the Department of External Affairs, and that his fares were paid .by the Government, will the Prime Minister say-whether the samo arrangements have been made for those who accompanied him? Is it a fact, as reported,that MrH . G. Alderman, K . C , was sent with Sir Thomas Blarney as a special representative of the Government to attend to his public relations? If Mr Alderman did not go in that capacity, was he given any credentials by the Government, and has he been authorized to enter into any negotiations while in Japan for the purchase dr acquisition of any broadcasting stations, air lines, or other commercial enterprises or agencies on behalf of the Government or the Australian Labour narty? Is the Government paying Mr Alderman's fares, and is he in receipt of any retainer by the Govornment in connection with the visit? it was indicated in a newspaper article that Mr Alderman was to accompany Sir Thomas Blarney to Japan. Sir Thomas Blarney went to Japan at the invitation of the Commander-in-Chief, General MacArthur. Sir Thomas Blarney was formerly Commander-in-Chief of the Australian Army, and General MacATtbur invited him, as an act of courtesy, to visit Japan. I understand that the opportunity will be taken to discuss various matters while he is there. Accordingly, arrangements were made for him to visit Japan, and for Colonel Dwyer to accompany him. I saw a statement in a newspaper that Mr Alderman OP SIB THOMAS BLAMEY-MB , H . G. ALDEBMAN.",7,Setup

3,Mr Chifley,"I was informed that was accompanying Sir. Thomas Blarney, ft Had-no-knowledge of any such-arrangement, either as Prime Minister or Minister acting, for the Minister for External Affairs, but I ' assumed that it was only natural that the press should know more of the matter than I did! I made some inquiries, however; and learned that Mr Alderman knew nothing about it either, apart from the newspaperreport. Therefore, the answers to the honourable member's questions are that no arrangements were made for Mr Alderman to go to -Japan; Mr Alderman has not gone to -Japan; Mr Alderman did not accompany General Blarney; and, therefore, he has received no commission or retainer to inquire' into anything in Japan. attention to a statement made by a member of theQueensland executive of the 06m muni st party that Australian Communists would fight on the side of the Soviet Unioni f Australia were involved in a war betweenRussia and the Western Powers. The Prime Minister undertook to have inquiriesmade hy the Acting Attorney-General. I remind the Prime Minister that-shorthand-notes were taken of the speech. Asi t is important that action be-taken promptly because of the special circumstances in which the subversive statement was made, can the Prime Minister say what action he proposes to take, and what recommendation he has received from the Acting Attorney General? another question asked on this subject in the House last, week I indicated that the matter would be 1 referred to tbe Acting Attorney General fbr inquiry and report. I understandthat a report will be available to the Acting Attorney-General, either to-day OT to-morrow, and after he has received itand studied it I have no doubt that 1 be will' make arecommendation. I am not-in aposition to-furnish the-honourable 1 memberwithanv additional information atpresent; hut the House will be advised Minister, inform the House whether, the if'any-recommendation made. -the _ action proposed to be taken, to stabilize, the wheat, industry, it has been rumoured that farmers , will, receiveonly 1 68.. 3d., a. .bushel at Australian, ports-, for all, wheat sold overseas.. My interpretation of"" the proposed, plan is that while we: haveguaranteed. 6s.. 3d. a bushel to the farmers,, irrespective of what , price isreceived, if. Australian wheat should realize prices in excess of that figure, they. will, receive the full benefit of the guaranteed price, plus, the profit madeaf aresult, of. such higher prices, during the currency of the plan. I should be glad if the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture, wouldexplain to the House thfexact provisions of. the scheme. whatsoever in the rumour mentioned, by the-honorahle-member for Riverina. Th» positionisperfectly clear, and the system that has hitherto' operated' will continue. In all cases-where the guaranteed'pric? is exceeded, the proceeds from externa) and internal' sales will be equalized, and thefarmers will receive the additional amount. The guaranteed price of 6s. 3d. a bushel is related to the index figure, for the cost of production. Tn some caset it may be substantially more than 6s. 3d : 1 should the cost of production rise. In the event of the export price .falling below 6s. 3d., in association with the index figure for the cost of production-, the farmer will receive from the Commonwealth the price guaranteed as ascertained in association with the index figure for the cost' of: production. It would take a considerable time to explain complete details of the plan.. ] do not desire to intrude on the patience of honourable memhers, for I think' that all' intelligent people fully understand'the position. It is quite clear that the fannerwill receive the benefits of any prices received in excess of the guaranteed""! price as a .result of' oversea? sales.

I have discussed the matter with the Public Service Board which is -lealing with it on behalf of the Government, and I have been informed that certain consultations will take place in the near future. I assure the honourable member that the matter is now being -xamined by the Public Service Board. for Immigration how many aliens havo registered under the Aliens Begistration Act? How many aliens have refused to register; and what action does he intend to take against those who have refused ro register? hand, to give the number of aliens who have registered ; but most aliens, I think, the people who want to come here. have obeyed the law. There are some who have not obeyed the law, and they will be prosecuted. The first prosecution will be launched against Lars Gustav Brundahl, who has failed to register, and whose contempt for the law is quite notorious. He has been 32 years in this country, and he has never tried to become naturalized. He has failed to obey the law recently enacted. He will receive a --ummons, and he can explain to the -*ourt why he has not registered. He might, also tell the court what his real nationality is; and that might help in ->ther directions. ment that has been made between the British and French Governments toabolish vises for British subjects travelling to France on British passports. Is the Prime Minister aware thar although Australians are British subjects and travel on British passports they still have to obtain vises,, because Australia has failed to make a corresponding arrangement ticipate in the British scheme ? Why wasthis not done? Will the Prime Ministerpaner they are written on? gration will answer the question. able member for Parramatta had seen me before he asked his question. 1 could have put him on the right track. Agreement has been reached between the British Government and the governments of a number of other countries to abolish vises. The Australian Government was asked to do the same thing. We have refused to abolish them for the time being because the issue of a vise to a person who possesses a passport gives us at any rate some check for security purposes. In the present disturbed condition of the world we like to know who is coming into this country from abroad We think that we sball be better able to protect the interests of Australia if our consular or diplomatic representatives have an opportunity to keep a check upon ment did not tbink that it was necessary to continue the issue of vises. British Government and the Australian Government are not necessarily the same upon all questions.

Tho time may como when we shall be able to abolish vises, but we -lo not propose to do so at present. It may be some years before we can do what is Hiiggestiid. The obtaining of a vise does not involve any serious inconvenience. Some people have gone from Britain to Switzerland without obtaining vises ancl as a result have experienced -tome difficulty, but if they had gone to rhe Swiss Consul-General in London and obtained vises from him they would have -mcoimtered no difficulty.

The questions which matters associated with it, including were being discussed at that time were human liberty and. the application of rhe building of ships in Australia and democratic practices. the type of engines with which they should be fitted. There was no secrecy about the matter at all. It would probeings vary in different countries? bably be correct to say that, in general, the Government's proposals cover the matters to which the honourable member for Wilmot has referred. It would, however, be much better if I furnished a stateniPnt setting out those proposals in detail. Final decisions have not yet been taken in regard to certain matters of administration, but in general, it can brsaid that the Government proposes to conduct shipping operations with ships ai present owned by it and, at a later date, probably with ships built in Governmeni shipyards. The shipping industry ha* known that for years, because I conveyed the information to the shipowners when I discussed with them thiquestion of building ships in Australia. the agenda of the.

I have given the assurance that I do not know Mr Campbell) and: that, so far as I am aware, he has never approached me or my department. There is no truth in the suggestion that I'might secure the cancellation of Mr Wood'flieence. The Department of Civil Avia tion has a responsibility to the public to ensure that trained engineers are capabh of performing their work, in an efficient manner. If Wood has been proved to have done his work in an inefficient mannei the suspension of his certificate will have been fully justified. However, as thifmatter is one on which a decision h&h been reserved by the tribunal inquiring into it, I do not wish to pass judgment on tbe matter at all.

Minister want an extension of time? member for Barker is prepared to proby way of amendmentpose an appropriate motion, I shall be prepared to speak on this subject for as an instruction to the Governmentmiother half hour. Prime Minister noticed certain recent references in the press, in the courts ind also in this House, to the questionable methods employed by certain companies, particularly in New South Wales, for the raising of funds? Is the right honourable gentleman aware that under section 51 of the Constitution the Commonwealth Parliament has power to legislate with respect to companies? With a view to overcoming the difficulties which obviously the New South Wales Parliament does not seem to be able to cope with, will the Prime Minister consider exercising the power conferred upon the Commonwealth Parliament to legislate to -protect genuine investors from the urooks who seem to nourish in that little Chicago, Sydney? Commonwealth company law has been -fxamined by the Government and the Attorn ey-General. As the [honourable member for Barker realizes, such legis'afeion would have to bo comprehensive and would require a. great deal of investigation before its provisions could be finally determined. I have always considered that it would be far more satisfacshowed it as the unhappy thing it is. He tory if there were a Commonwealth company law. Some investigations have been made and reports furnished, but the Government has not actually decided to introduce such legislation. The matter is still being considered by the Attorney General and his department and a report will be made to Cabinet later. In Committee of Supply: Consideration resumed from the 21st September {vide page 630), on motion by Mr CHIP LEYThat the first item in the Estimates under and allowances, £12,000"", be agreed to. That the first item be reduced by £1, to withdraw and redraft the budget . . . (vide page 430). Dame ENID LYONS (Darwin) [11.16]. -Contrary to popular belief there is no standard of living at all in this country. We have substituted instead a standard of spending. We have little conception of what a standard of living really means. We have a system of pensions of which honourable members opposite are inordinately proud. These pensions are, as 5 these things go, in nominal amount, relatively high, but for those who have no other resource they are barely a means of subsistence. We have high wages that benefit only those with no family responsibilities, and finally go to promote tht well-being of only bookmakers and brewers. We have short hours of labour, and it is generally admitted that during those hours of labour very few of us perform to the full extent of our powers. We have long hours of seeking for pleasures, every one of which is costly, and, indeed, it has come to be believed that only in the spending of money on pleasure do we achieve happiness and happiness therefore eludes us. I repeat that we have no standard of living, but only a standard of spending. The honourable member for Reid( Mr Lang) made this clear in a trenchant attack upon the budget. He stripped it of its tinsel and put his finger right on the spot that really matters when he said that the Government appeared to be mesmerized by figures and had forgotten that the problems of the Government were human",19,Tobacco

The honourable member for Wilmot( Mr Duthie) says, "" Hear, hear! "" and agrees with the view that the referendum had something to do with the problem. The referendum had nothing to do. with it . On the 20th of this month only did the States assume control of prices as-we were told a few moments ago by the Minister for Commerce and .Agriculture ( Mr Pollard). I want to make the position very clear to the people of Australia. [ want them not to forget it in the months ahead, when we may experience « few sharp price increases. In the budget the Treasurer saidNevertheless, the supply of many important commodities is failing to keep pace with -demand and inflationary pressure is still exceedingly strong. We must regard with -serious .concern the rate at which prices and -eosts have .risen .during the past .twelve -months. Therefore, ! l have taken out figures for tbe last twelve months so that the position may be impressed upon the minds of the people. They are .from the Commonwealth Statistician's Monthly Review of Business .Statistics for July, ""1948, and they show increased costs from June, 1947, to June, 19.48.' They .are as follows,:AND FOODSTUFFS. .Commodity. -Metals and-coal ..

But this budget is a disquieting documem for other reasons also, and for two in particular. Tbe first is the confirmation which it gives of the knowledge that the Government has -constantly infiltrated more and more into the whole social structure. I refer not merely to thai indirect influence which is inescapable with any form of government, but to direct government supervision, interference and control. The second reason for disquiet .is that the budget reveals in all its completeness the control .which the Commonwealth has achieved over the governments of thf States. Many people w ill believe this tc be due to the accident of war which brought about the system of uniform taxation. .1 challenge that -view. .1 believe that it is part of a deliberate plan 'for the assumption of control by the .Commonwealth over matters which should be controlled by the States. It is not generally known, I believe, that just a few weeks after the first agreement was made in respect of uniform taxation-a n agreement which was to last for the duration of the war, and one year afterwards-the .Attorney-General (Dr. Evatt) said, "" This has come to stay. This is permanent"". AndI do not thmk it is generally remembered that, in 1943, P er c e n t at the Australian Labour party's coninen ase. ference, a resolution was carried urging .. .. 16.3 the movement to undertake a wide cam.. <jo.l paign to invest all controls in the Com14.8 10.3 monwealth Parliament. 14;S .. 5.1 used to believe in that herself. .. 13.] Dame ENID LYONS -Yes, I used to belong to the Australian Labour party.

55,.. .. 8.5 Mr Dedman,"The honourable membernave made the Commonwealth Parliament supreme in a great many fields, the Government submitted proposals to the people in a referendum. That appeal failed, but the effort to obtain more power has been continuous, and it has not stopped yet. At the last conference ->f Commonwealth and State Ministers we noted the attitude of Commonwealth representatives, and of the Prime Minister in particular. In spite of the protests of all the State Premiers against the retention of the uniform taxation system, the Prime Minister remained adamant. Be would not even consider a, review of die present arrangement. Now, it is a strange thing that tlie Premier of Tasmania, Mr Cosgrove, had just come through a general election in which it was generally believed that he stood for the return of taxing powers to the States. A resolution to that effect bad been carried unanimously in the Parliament of Tasmania. Immediately afterwards, however, at the Premiers Conin that he said that, for Tasmania, the old system would not work. The Prime Minister tried to set at rest the fears of the State Premiers by issuing a set of figures showing the savings of most of the States, and notably Tasmania, under the system of uniform taxation. From these figures he made out a very good case for the retention of uniform taxation, but I maintain that there is no comparable basis from which to draw conclusions. The Commonwealth could . aot possibly have entered into some of its present commitments had the system of uniform taxation not been in operation. The financial and other conditions at present obtaining are wholly dependent upon the provisions of uniform taxation. Thus the Prime Minister's argument falls to the ground. But in any case, are we to accept the view that cost is the finalargument in matters of this kind? That is a suggestion which I strongly repudiate and which I shall deal with later. I propose to refer to one other item Ln the budget, an item which was discussed in greater detail in some sections of the press. I quote from the budget the following passage:At tlie Baine time the Commonwealth has made clear to the Fremiera that, in ita view, T24] the States might reasonably be expected to make greater efforts to exploit their own revenue resources and, in particular, to ensure that the costs of business undertakings were as far as possible covered by the charges for thc services rendered. That statement comes well from the head of the Government in view of the record of Trans-Australia Airlines, which lost £255,000 in the last financial year. Other recommendations which the Treasurer made included the raising of railway freight charges by the States. Is he aware that, as the result of financial undertakings entered into by the Government of Tasmania with the Commonwealth during the war, the railways in that ^tate are hardly in a condition to carry freight? The Treasurer spoke of raising motor registration charges. I remind him that Tasmanian charges of that nature are the highest in the Commonwealth. I must say that I regard as pure effrontery on the part of the Treasurer the use of those arguments to the Premiers of the States. I return now to the validity of the economic argument in all human and government relationships. ""We hear all too frequently in this House the .suggestion that all action springs from an economic motive, and that everything we do is governed by the profit motive. The acceptance of that view has led to a state of affairs which brought forth that speech from the honourable member for Reid to which I referred. When the Minister for Information ( Mr Calwell) was speaking about Communists he said that the only answer to communism was an economic answer, and that the only way to check communism was to abolish poverty. Surely the Minister knows that at this moment communism is flourishing in Australia as never before, and yet this Government continues to assert that Australia has never before been as prosperous as it is to-day. The argument falls very fiat. Communists are stronger to-day than ever before. Dame ENID LYONS -If the Minister and the Government believe that, it may explain the inactivity on the part",21,Primary Production Price Indexes
56,Ference Mr Cosgrove,repudiated the idea,22,Primary Production Price Indexes
57,Mr Dedman,"It is not true that theof this Government in dealing with communism. If the Government believes that communism is not flourishing in Australia, no wonder it is prepared to say, "" Don't put a ban on communism because it will merely be driven underground "". It is underground, largely, all the time and if the security service keeps the Government no better informed than that, it is time that the security service was overhauled. Are any of the Communists with whom we are familiar to-day other than prosperous? Does any one of them look poverty-stricken: does he preach his gospel in the slums? He does not. On the contrary, he moves amongst the people who have other reasons for discontent. I shall refer to this matter again later. The Prime Minister said that the Government had always realized that security must be provided for the people of this country. I do not want to be misunderstood or misquoted in what I am about to say, and I hope that honourable members will pay particular attention to my remarks. I believe that every community has a responsibility to ensure some degree of security for all of its members. I said that on the first occasion on which T. spoke after becoming a member of this House, and I have repeated it since. Whilst every action I have since taken in this Parliament has been towards that end, I warn this Government against making that the final objective. Those who seek only security generally perish of their own inertia and inactivity. Any young country that encourages its young people to look only for security is losing the greatest thing those people can give to the country, which is the fruit of their youth. Australia was not developed by those who sought only security, but rather by those possessed of a spirit of adventure who went out to win new places and make new homes. In people who are not already partially dead there remains an urge to express themselves in a field of wider endeavour. I believe that the Government by its continued reiteration of the word "" security "" is in some danger of stifling such incentive. itself involves a struggle which, in one form or another, must continue or we Dame Lyons. reach a point where life itself begins to die. That law of life has always operated. It was such a conception that Mussolini, in his arrogance and stupidity, completely misunderstood, and misapplied, when he said that life meant all strife. It means "" striving"" not "" strife "". Honourable members have talked often of the philosophy of communism, but lei us consider the philosophy of socialism. Let us also look at the fruits of that philosophy as we see them to-day. In the near future we are likely to see them further developed. If there is one pan of the constantly-repeated programme of this Government which makes a greater appeal to me than any other, it is that of full employment. That is a thoroughly admirable aim, and I have no patience with people who say, ""What is full employment? We do not know what it means."" It is not 8 matter of splitting straws about definitions, for we all know what is meant, but I. want to sound a note of warning to the Government and to those who may misquote me. I believe that the idea) that the Government has in mind is full of very grave danger. Por a long time. I have been convinced that such policie' as it espouses must lead eventually to s form of industrial conscription in thucountry. Indeed that has already occurred in the stevedoring industry, as honourable members are well aware. Any extension of that principle will result in the complete conscription of industry. Look at the implementation of the Commonwealth Reconstruction Training Scheme. We know, and havf that heard the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction ( Mr Dedman) say in thif House that some students were not allowed to undertake a course of their choice, because in the view of the Government there were already too manj people in that industry, or that that waV likely to be the position in the future It was not because of their lack of ability to pursue such a course, or because tb* equipment was not -available with which to teach them the trade or profession that they wished to learn. That reveab Life what is taking place in the mind of this Government. When a governmeni has a policy of full employment it should assume the responsibility to provide opportunities for employment for every one. But wben the Government assumes full and complete responsibility for tbe actual provision of work for all, theremust logically come a time when the Government takes the responsibility of deciding bow many and who, shall work in a particular industry. ""When the honourable member for Beid was speaking an honourable member asked by interjection, "" Why did you have dole inspectors ?"". The reason is clear that there must be inspectors to control any dole system. Any system which attempts by government action to provide justice for one must observe justice for ali and if it where euthanasia is legalized, and, under would provide justice for all, it must ena system of complete nationalization of sure that none exploits his privileges and his opportunities. That was the classic argument of the Labour party in by-gone days with the other side of politics. It is a sound and proper argument to be used on either side. But I issue a warning that the Government is rapidly heading towards the same position in the opposite direction. We are moving to a point where all industry and all workers may be at the immediate direction of r he Government. There are other fields in which governunderstand that the honourable member ment penetration is likely to do almost incalculable harm. I propose to refer for a few moments to the Government's health schemes. Again, the conception that the Government should ensure that the community is healthy is good; but I -mould like to know whether this Government believes that health is merely a matter of medicine. ' HadI sufficient time, I should deal more fully with that aspect. The Government proposes to persist with a nationalized health scheme. Any system under which all doctors are the servants of the State becomes another form of conscription and regimentation. If the Government makes itself completely responsible for the emsurgeon said to me, ""When you have ployment of the community, it must assume complete responsibility for health. A man cannot work if he is ill, and if he must work, in justice to other people, when work is provided, the Government must also ensure that he is kept in health. In that way, the Government assumes responsibility for sending a man to a dentist, or to a surgeon in order to undergo an operation. The individual will have no choice in the matter. To some people, that view may seem to be rather far-fetched, but the system is already in operation in countries which have a completely socialized form of government and in an even more extreme form. For example, honourable members know that there is a gradual movement in the public mind towards the practise of euthanasia, which is the painless despatch of people whose life's span has nearly ended. We could quickly move from a point where the idea of euthanasia is tolerated to another point health, we can move to a point wher*legalization extends to compulsion. ber's imagination is running riot. Dame ENID LYONS I cannot imagine that the honourable member for Cook( Mr Sheehan) would undertake, in per-on, the hanging of a criminal. honourable member's imagination is running riot. Dame ENID LYONS -A m I to would undertake, in person, the hanging of a criminal? Dame ENID LYONS -When I said that the honourable member would not be prepared to undertake in person the hanging of a criminal, he inten'ected that my imagination was running riot. However, I know the bonorable member better than he knows himself. I remind him that the execution of a criminal ie undertaken in his name and my name. In other words, we shelve our individual responsibility by making it a collective responsibility. Not lone ago a noted nearly murdered a man as I have many times, you are overcome hy a sense of intense horror. However, if you call in a medical colleague for consultation about the case, some of your load immediately lifts. If you call in half a dozen colleagues for consultation, you may even manage a smile or a laugh in a room next to that in which your patient",22,Primary Production Price Indexes
58,Mr Sheehan,The honourable mem,24,Primary Production Price Indexes
59,Mr Sheehan,I repeat that the,24,Primary Production Price Indexes
60,Mr Sheehan,"No.is dying."" The surgeon said that, for that reason, he would always oppose the idea of a nationalized health scheme, because under such a system his personal responsibility would be completely removed from him, as our individual responsibility to-day is taken from us in regard to capital punishment. Those are Logical ends to certain processes which are objective. But, there is a further pledge taking place to-dav, and I should like honourable members to discuss them among themselves and not dismiss them as figments of my imagination. The developments which I have described are the inevitable results of socialism. In Germany and Eussia, the only two countries where socialism has become complete, euthanasia was practised at the will and command of the State. People were removed as soon as they became useless. That process continues in certain parts of the world. Some people in Australia still express grave doubts as to whether the Labour party really stands for socialism. I propose to address a few remarks to them. We all know what is the expressed objective of the Labour party. People who imagine that that expressed objective has nothing whatever to do with present-day practical politics should examine the decisions of some Labour conferences in recent years. In 1943, delegates carried a resolution urging the party to put in motion a campaign for vesting all power in the Parliament of the Commonwealth. Two years later, the conference agreed to a motion urging the Commonwealth Parliamentary Labour party, when complete power had been vested in the Parliament of the Commonwealth, to give effect to the party's policy of socialism. There is one point which will he of particular interest to those people who seek some connection between the policy of the Labour party and that of the Communist party, and the methods that they espouse. The motion to which the conference in 1945 agreed, originally included the significant words, "" within the limits of the Constitunately, he did not continue after tion "". Clearly, that qualification made an important difference between the methods which the Labour party and the Communists respectively proposed to adopt for the establishment of socialism in Australia. But, on the motion of the Minister for Information ( Mr Calwell), those Dame Enid Lyons. qualifying words were deleted from th» resolution. We should not pass lightlj over that point. Again, to those who havi some doubt about the real intentions of the Labour party, let me say-and I cannot say it too often-that every membei of the Labour party must sign the well known pledge of loyalty to the party's -a t least I have seen it in the New Soutb Wales section-and I shall quote it carefullyI also pledge myself to actively suppori and advocate at all times the party's objective the socialization of industry production distribution and exchange. the honourable member signed. Dame ENID LYONS -No; that pledge resulted from the 1934 conference conference ? Dame ENID LYONS I have deali with that conference, and I am prepared to debate the matter at any time with the honourable member. I come now to the subject of communism. The Minister for Information ( Mr Calwell), the honourable member for Wilmot( Mr Duthie) and other honourable members opposite who have spoken in this debate made use of this argumentI admit that they mad« pretty good play with it-""Bemov e the seed bed of communism and you remove communism"". They said that the seed bed was the lack of economic security. I admit that their argument is, to some degree, just; but, as I have already said, those in this country who support communism are not poverty stricken. Furthermore, the Government claims that this if the most prosperous era that Australia has ever known. I put it to honourable members that the seed bed of communism is very different from what honourable members opposite say it is. The Prime Minister( Mr Chifley) at the conclusion of a speech he made on the subject of communisma speech which, unfortuhe had exhausted his time-sai d that this thing seemed to be growing throughout the world and the world was seeking the answer. The answer, as I see it, is that we are losing faith in the democratic system, but faith in the democratic system is not sustained",24,Primary Production Price Indexes
61,Mr Fuller,That is the pledge which,25,Primary Production Price Indexes
62,Mr Fuller,"What about the 1921merely by if he provision of economic benefits and systems of security and pennons. After all, faitb is not a tbing that is bought, although it is true that we look to the fruits of any system. ""We are losing faith in our own system. In Australia, particularly, we seem to be losing faith in parliaments and politicians. I am glad to be able to speak as a member of a parliament in this country and to refer to this loss of faith in politicians. There are very few people to-day outside the Parliament who do not believe that every man has his price, that he goes into parliament for what he can make out of it and that he frequently makes out of it much more than he has any legal, or moral, right to do. There is also loss of faith in onr administrative services. Wherever you go to-day some one will tell you where to go to get something that is forbidden, whom to approach for a permit and what way you should go about the matter. There is whispering dl around the place. In other words, people generally believe that opportunity now goes by favour and not by justice. There is something rotten in any community that shares that view, and I believe that this and every other Parliament in the Commonwealth shares responribility for it . We are not free from Teproach. I believe that the standards of governmental integrity to-day -are not what they used to be. Years ago, the mere hint of the prevalence of such a 'system, or any real suspicion of such a thing, would have swept from office any government, regardless of its ""political colour. That is not the position to-day. I remember very well that during my husband's term of office in this Parliament one member of his Government discovered that a company of which he was a director had entered into a contract with a government department. I believe-althoug h on this point I am not completely surethat it was merely a small day-to-day contract of practically no significance .at all. tract. Dame ENID LYONS -Yes; but immediately he became aware of that fact, he resigned from the Government. May I say that had he not voluntarily that the 'Minister for Labour and resigned he would 'have been asked to National Serviee( Mr Holloway) has resign. That was hard on that man, because he was not guilty of any impropriety. 'He did not know tnat his company had tendered for fhe contract. But his action in resigning was completely right, because our system depends for its very existence upon the integrity of those who uphold it. Dictatorships have no such need; 'they depend upon force whereas we depend upon our own interior integrity. Only a few days ago the case was brought up in the Parliament of the Government's participation in the formation of a company to control a radio station. Honourable members opposite viewed that matter lightly, and said that it should never have been brought up for discussion. Any one who is getting 16 per cent, on an investment is making a very substantial profit judged by any standard; but when that is being done by a party which constantly shouts against the profit motive and the profit system such action must create in the public mind the very serious doubts as to the political integrity of the members of that party. That is a political matter, and we must look at it squarely. I Temember on a previous occasion in this chamber defending politicians against the charge that they broke promises because certain parts of the programme they enunciate at elections are not fulfilled during the life of the ensuing Parliament. That is something which is almost inescapable. If the members of a party which is successful at the polls are honest, they make an effort to put into operation the whole of the programme they enunciate foT the ensuing period. But sometimes circumstances do not permit of that being done. However, when a government deliberately says that it will not do a certain thing and then proceeds to do 'that tbing it is guilty of political dishonesty to a serious degree. That has happened in the lifetime of the present Government. I refer to the pledge it gave to the people that it would not nationalize anything during the war, and its attempt .to nationalize*air other incidents of a similar nature. Mr Holloway interjecting, Dame ENID LYONS I am glad",25,Primary Production Price Indexes

That is another case in point; The campaign on that referendum was fought not on the basis that all price controls should immediately be swept away but on the basis that the price control powers which normally reside in the State governments and which are exercised by the Australian Government only in times of war and the periods which succeed them, should be retained by the State governments. Honourable members on this side of the chamber gave a pledge that they would support any legislation introduced by this Government which was designed to continue for a certain period the controls it was then exercising. Notwithstanding that, immediately the result of the vote on the referendum was made known, the Government said, "" This means that the people do not want Commonwealth controls. to completely dishonest decision. Government, having argued that the assumption of the control of rents and prices by the State governments would create chaos, immediately transferred those powers of control to the States in an attempt to create the chaos that it professed to fear. That was the most wretched and miserable political conduct that can be imagined. The time will come when the Labour party will be faced with the realization that the public conscience sometimes awakens, even after long periods of sleep. There does not seem, at the present time, to be sufficient moral indignation in this community. It is time that it was revived. The DEPUTY CHAIEM AN ( Mr of Tasmania also expressed their opiniou Burke) -Order! The honourable member's time has expired. speech of the honourable member for Darwin was a strange mixture. It was delivered with a great deal of passion and sincerity. The honourable member said that one characteristic of the public conscience is that of waking after long periods of sleep. It awoke in Tasmania a few weeks ago, when tbe people of that State' gave a decided answer to .the vicious propaganda that was indulged in by the anti-Labour parties in the course of the recent Tasmanian election campaign. The banking legislation that was passed by this Parliament last year, nationalization, communism, uniform taxation, the taking away of State rights and other issues were raised by the Opposition parties. The people of Tasmania answered Mr R. G. Casey, who said that the election was fought on local issues only, in no uncertain terms. The anti-Labour parties threw everything at us but the kitchen sink. Dame ENID LYONS -May I say thai it was one of the cleanest campaigns ever to be conducted? campaign was a very clean one. When I said that the anti-Labour parties threw everything at us but the kitchen sink. I was referring to the kind of propaganda that was indulged in. National and local issues were put before the elecLet us give them back tors in the press and over the radio for the States"". That was a weeks before the polling date. The OpThe position said that the eyes of Australia were upon Tasmania and that the result of the election would indicate the general trend of Australian public opinion. They prophesied that the Cosgrove Government would suffer a crushing defeai When the result was announced, it was found that the Cosgrove Government had not been defeated but had lost only one seat. One had to examine the mainland newspapers very closely to find areport, of the Tasmanian election result. Th? anti-Labour parties received a shock then from which they have not yet recovered Many honourable members opposite to-day are whistling to keep their courage up. By their vote at that election the peophof the propaganda that was poured out in the course of the campaign on the referendum on rents and prices, and. showed that they realized who had ""led them up the garden path"" a few months previously. We left them in no doubt about who had urged them to vote "" No '"" on that occasion. The people decided that in future they would trust the.

65,Mr Duthie,"I agree that thevote against the control of rents and prices that was then being exercised by this Government. The issue was confused by propaganda. The people were urged to uphold State rights and it was claimed that the State governments could administer prices control. The people believed that they were voting against all control of rents and prices by this Government. The anti-Labour parties are now trying to excuse what they said on that occasion and to blame this Government for the transference of prices control to the State governments. The newspaper headlines Fead, "" No more Canberra control The States can handle prices control effectively"" and ""Put it where you can watch it "" . This Government gave effect to the people's decision, and it would have been dishonest not to do so. The people said in unmistakable terms that they wanted State control, and not Canberra control. ments have now assumed responsibility for the control of rents and prices. ""We claim that they°cannot do so as fairly and as equitably as cm the Australian Government. Time will tell who is right. The anti-Labour parties are now saying that this Government is to blame for the price increases that will >>ccur. In my opinion, the Opposition will have to take 80 per cent, of the blame for the whittling down of the value of the people's income because of the higher prices that will have to be paid for goods, from now on. All the big business interests of Australia backed the Liberal party and the Australian Country party in their efforts to force this Government to relinquish control of the prices that could be charged for even essential articles. They wanted the sky to be the limit again, and in the referendum campaign they poured out thousands of pounds in order to achieve that objective. They won the day. We shall see who will be the sufferers. I contend that they will be the ordinary people -the average Australian family unTho present budget is a cautious one. £8 l is . , or 28.8 per cent., and the Lt is designed to ensure the internal corresponding reduction for a man earnstability of Australia for at least the next ing £1,000 is from £159 13s. to £129 6s., or twelve months and to safeguard us 19 per cent. These figures convincingly against the threatening external financial disprove some of the wild statements made -itorm. It has, in effect, lifted the burden last night by the Leader of the Australian of taxation from the lower and middle Country party. I can only describe his income groups, and considerably eased the burden on the higher income groups. The taxes paid by members of the lower income group will be reduced by 33£ per cent. The tax payable on incomes of £15,000 a year will be reduced by 3.1 per cent. A 3 per cent, reduction of taxation on an o income of £15,000 a year means a reduction of approximately £5 a week. That is more than some people earn in a week, and represents a considerable reduction of tax. In the lower income groups, of course, the tax reductions are not so high in money value although in percentages they are greater. The budget proposals mean, in effect, the complete exemption from both income tax and the social services contribution of many thousands more people. In view of the statements of the Leader of the Australian Country party ( Mr Fadden) last night, it is well that the people of Australia should know just how the taxaThe State governtion remissions will operate. A single man or woman earning £400 a year from personal exertion paid £48 12s. tax last year, and will pay £34 14s. this year, a reduction of 28.6 per cent. A single taxpayer earning £1,000 a year receives a reduction of 19 per cent, in his tax. A man with a dependent wife, earning £400 a year, will pay £21 9s. this year compared with £30 7s. last year, his reduction being 29.3 per cent. A similar taxpayer receiving £1,000 a year-and the people who are screaming most are those earning from £1,000 a year upwards-wil l have his tax reduced from £193 ISs. to £157, a reduction of 19 per cent. I am taking two or three illustrations from each income group. A married man with one child, earning £400 a year, will pay only £8 compared with £.1.2 7s. last year, or a reduction of 28.6 per cent. A man in the same category earning £1,000 a year will have his tax reduced from £171 ls. to £138 l is . , or by 19 per cent. The reduction in respect of a man on £400 a year, with a wife and two children fortunately-is from £12 a year to speech as ""'Fadden's flight of. fancy w it k figures "". Another frequent criticism of the Government's taxation policy is that overtime earnings are too heavily taxed. This* has been adjusted by the new rates, which, E believe, represent an adequate attempt to revise what in war-time was a very severe tax on all workers in industry. E should have welcomed the complete elimination of tax on overtime earnings but, having seen the figures of the latest, adjustments, I am sure that there is no real burden. Let us consider, for instance, the worker earning' £6 a week. If he is single and works three hours overtime a. week, earning an aditional 13s. 6d., he pays 2s. Id. in tax, retaining 84.6 per cenfc of his overtime earnings. If he works six hours overtime, he receives an extra £1 7s., paying 4s. 3d. in tax and retaining the remaining 84.3 per cent. to the overtime earnings' alone or to the total earnings? time alone. The same taxpayer working nine hours overtime a week earns an additional £2 6s., of which he pays 6s. 7d. in. tax and retains the remaining 83.8 per. cent. The figures for a married man. with two children are as. follows:Overtime worked. ' eanninsca.. £ 3 hours 6 hours 0 hours Those figures, which are official, illustrate the fantasy of the claim of the Leader of the Australian. Country party that Australian industry is being stifled by excessive taxation. Of course, honourable members opposite advance these arguments' merely to further their own political cause. They must have sometbing on which to attack the Government, so they attack it on the budget, making extravar gant claims, about, taxation and endeavouringin that way to delude the people of this country into believing that it is a vicious budget. Actually it is nothing of the sort. As I have shown, it provides a substantial reduction of taxes on overMr Duthie. timeearnings. It has removed from thstaxation field altogether many thousand* more Australian citizens, and it, hasreduced taxes on the higher incomes bj up to £5 a week. I come now to the tax exemption limit* for personal exertion incomes. Under the budget proposals a single taxpayerwil 5 not pay any income tax until he earn* £7 a week. The exemption fora married man is £9 15s. a week, for a married man with one child £11.12s. a weekj witb two children £12 15s. a week, and with three children £14 a week. I cannot see how these figures can be interpreted as vicious taxation. The greatest cry to-day is coming from the 10 per cent, or 15 per cent, of the Australian people wheare earning £2,000 a year or more. They will not be satisfied until they are exempi from, taxes, which would mean, of course, that revenue would not be suflicient fbr national requirements. As the Leader of. the Australian Countiy party also criticized uniform taxation, I propose to give a few facto about this matter. Recently MrK . J Binns-, M.A., B.Com., prepared for th* Government of Tasmania a report en: titled, ""Federal Financial Relations i i Canada and Australia"".. Mr Binnt visited Canada recently and his report on his investigations was published in. July, Additional Tax. . Remainder. of this year. He has quite a lot to sav about uniform, taxation. On page 47 h* sayss. d. 3. d. Por cent. 0 13 fi 90.7 Under uniform taxation-, the taxpayer it 1 7 0 2. 7 90.4 required to pay & single Commonwealth incoro/ S 2 6 6 4 0 90.1 tax in place of a Commonwealth tax, plus one. or more State income taxes. Prior to the introduction of uniform taxation in 1942. eleven separate taxes on incomes were levied by the six States. Individual taxpayers deriv ing income from more than one State were required to make separate income tax return* to each State from which incoine was derived if the income exceeded the taxable exemption' allowed to absentees. Companies trading in more than one State were required to keep separate records of the profits earned in each. State for State income tax purposes. There was some reciprocity between States, but because of differences in State assessment acts, double taxation was common. On page. 48 he statesI t is pTObab'.y true to say that, those t u , payers who profess to favour the return .of State taxation rights do so in the mistaken belief that their liability to taxation would thereupon be. reduced.. It is most unlikely-that",27,Primary Production Price Indexes
66,Mr Bowden,-D o those figures relate,29,Primary Production Price Indexes
67,Mr Duthie,"They relate to over'the Commonwealth Government would reduce its taxation by more than the minimum amount required by the States for their purposes. But, apart from thc question of the severity of taxation actually imposed, uniform taxation possesses great advantages from the taxpayer's point of view. There is a considerable saving in clerical work when only one income tax return has to be prepared. In addition, the taxpayer is able to assess more accurately his liability for taxation. Its comThat is a statement which, of course, the parative simplicity is a strong argument in favour of the retention of uniform taxation. . . . There is a stronger community if interests and sense of nationhood thruugh>ut the Comnionwealth than in Canada. . . . Australia is .a nation and not merely a temporary union of States. For those reasons, it is necessary that uniform taxation sliould be considered from the point of view of the Commonwealth aa a whole and uot merely from the point of view of "" State rights"". The post-war taxation agreements in Canada between the Dominion and the Provincial governments were made for the specific purpose )f preventing "" a return to the pre-war dual -system of taxatiou "". Ft w ill be seen that in Canada also, the -system has been simplified. The Australian Government, in continuing the system of uniform taxation, is following >a natural influence which operates at the present time in the various countries where there are State or provincial governments and a Federal government. Mr Binns continues on page 49Income tax is an important instrument of economic policy. With the reduction of Commonwealth expenditure since the end of the war, the financial justification for the continuance of uniform taxation has been weakened. The economic justification, however, remains, and is even strengthened, by the very complexity of post-war problems of so vernment -a special grant from the Commonwealth under Ee continues, that the main criticism levelled at uniform taxation is found, on examination, not to be against the principles of uniform taxation, but in the main, against the reimbursements made by the Commonwealth to the States. Recently at a conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers, the Prime Minister agreed to increase the allocation tc the States by a very considerable amount. In the Prime Minister's budget speech, on page 16, he statedIt is now proposed to amend the formula incorporated in the existing legislation in a way which will increase the aggregate tax giant in 1048-49 to £53,700,000-a n increase of £S,700.000. On the bai is of present trends in population and average wages the amended formula would bring about --"" further .iucrease next year of perhaps £0,000,000. The Premiers expressed their satisfaction with this proposed revision of the formula, and the Australian Governnient trusts that if this revised formula is brought into operation the States will be in a position in future to assume complete financial responsibility and to formulate their budgets without making yearly requests to the Commonwealth for special assistance. Australian people did not see in the press or hear about from the Opposition. Such matters are hidden behind the welter of words contained in attacks on the budget, such as that made by the Leader of the Australian Country party last night. U n if o r m taxation, according to Mr Binns's close analysis of the subject, is justified when it is purely economic. In Tasmania there haa been a hue and cry for the return of the State's taxing rights. An argument that was used in the recent election campaign in that State was that the Australian Government was endeavouring to crush the States out of existence and strangle State governments. The people of Tasmania would be interested to know what Mr Binns has to say on this aspect after close study of the matter. On page 50 of his report Mr Binns statesI t would be a very strong argument in principle for the abolition of uniform taxation if the States would thereupon be relieved of all financial dependence on the Commonwealth. This, however, wouid not be so, as can be seen from the financial position of Tasmania. Each year since 1912, that is, for thirty years prior to the introduction of uniform taxation, Tasmania has received section 90 of the Constitution. If the Tasmanian Government were now imposing its own income tax it would have required to Taise in 1947-48 approximately £1,050,000 in order to balance the budget, assuming no alteration in the special grant of £747,500 for that year, or £2,400,000 if there had been no special grant. To raise this revenue would have involved the imposition of State income taxation rates at least 10 per cent, and 60 per cent, respectively above those levied in 1941-42, the last year of State income taxation. Such heavy rates of State income taxation would obviously be impossible. It should also be remembered tliat Tasmania in one respect stands to gain less than other States from the abolition of uniform taxation due to this State's lower relative taxable capacity. The average of personal incomes per head for 1.940-47 was lower in Tasmania tlian in other States, being only £144, compared with £108 for Australia as a whole. This lower level of incomes means thut higher rates of State income taxation would require to be imposed to realize the same revenue per head as in other States. He then gives a table showing the taxable capacity in all States and in the Commonwealth, and concludes by sayingIn other words, the Tasmanian Government would need to tax about 50 per cent, more severely on the average than the New South Wales Government to obtain the same revenue per head of population. It follows, therefore, tliat uniform taxation has the advantage, so far as the smaller States are concerned, of tending to lessen their financial inequality. That is a considered statement, worked out after a long study of this difficult problem. There is no doubt that a single man earning £150 a year in Tasmania would be required to pay income tax under the dual system of taxation. To-day while the uniform system operates, a single man is not required to pay income tax until he earns £350 a year. To raise the amount of money required by the Tasmanian Government at the present time, a single man earning his income in that State would have to be taxed as soon as his earnings reached approximately £150 a year. What rot it is to claim that the abolition of uniform taxation would benefit the individual taxpayer! [t would do nothing of the sort. honourable member state the facts correctly instead of telling us a fantastic story ? story. tion was introduced the National Government subsidized Tasmania. subsidized South Australia. A comparison of the incidence of taxation in Australia with that in other countries is interesting. In Australia a married man with two children who receives an income of £300 a year pays no taxes whatever. In New Zealand, a man £22 10s. in taxes, and a man in similar circumstances in the United Kingdom pays £12 l is . in taxes. In Australia, a man with a similar family who rppp.'ves £400 a year pays in taxes only £8 l is . , whereas a taxpayer in similar circumstances in New Zealand pays £30, and an English taxpayer in similar circumstances pays £15 l is . A married man with a wife and two children to support, who receives an income of £1,000 a year, pays £129 6s. in taxes in Australia. £172 16s. in New Zealand and £192 l is . in the United Kingdom. Those are facts, and I stress them in order to disprove the fan cifu l story told by the Leader of the Australian Country party last night, when he claimed that taxes imposed on the people of this country were excessive. Since the war ended, the Government has reduced taxes by £110,820,000. In view of the criticism of the Government'* taxation policy made by honourable members opposite, it is of particular interest to read the report of a statement made in the Parliament by the honourable member for Wentworth, the present Acting Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Harrison), on the 19th May, 1942, when the Income Tax (War-time Arrangements) B ill was being debated. As honourable members are aware, that is one of the measure* which implemented the uniform tax system. The report of the portion of hi* speech to which I refer appears at page 1730 of Volume 171 of Hansard, and is as follows:This legislation will remain in operation ostensibly for the duration of the war and for twelve months thereafter. I venture to suggest that once the people experience the benefits of uniform taxation, the acts wil) never be repealed. It is not a fantastic Those are the actual words of the present Acting Leader of the Opposition, who supported the introduction of uniform taxation at that time. I turn now to the subject of defence.

The honourable member must proceed with his speech, and honourable members must refrain from interjecting. opposite speak of war as if it were an inevitable catastrophe. Of course, they have a right to express that opinion, but honourable members on this side of the chamber also have a right to express their opinions. We had a global war only three years ago; is it not right that we should now seek to establish a global peace for the peoples of the world? Deliberately to stimulate fear of war is certainly not to perform a service for global peace. Furthermore, honourable members opposite think of war in terms of battalions and rifles and other weapons used in World War II . They overlook completely the fact that we are now living in a highly scientific age. Since World War II . , eminent scientists have been constantly devising more potent forms of destruction and more deadly weapons, and that is a fact which no one can deny. I am amazed that honourable members opposite, who claim to possess such a complete knowledge of the technique of waging war, overlook so completely the menace to mankind of the latest developments of atomic warfare. When the Acting Leader of the Opposition spoke on the budget he devoted 22 minutes to discussion of Australia's defence. In that time he never once mentioned atomic warfare, the atomic bomb or the atomic age. Opposition has been to war, and he knows atomic bomb? Weapons are changing what he was talking about. The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN. Order! I shall not again warn the honourable member for Balaclava to cease interjecting. that the Acting Leader of the Opposition when speaking on such a vitally important matter as the defence of the country would not leave out of consideration the paramount importance of atomic warfare. Surely it has occurred to him that we are living in the atomic age! Is he aware that the United .States of AmericaI shall deal with the is now manufacturing atomic bombs 600 times more potent than the one which was dropped on Hiroshima, and that methods studied carefully in that country as well as in the United Kingdom and Russia? Does he realize that guided missiles fitted with atomic warheads and projected in supersonic flight may do away altogether with the necessity for using aircraft? Does he know that 90 Super Portresses could drop atomic bombs which would inflict damage so great that 79,000 bombers carrying bombs of the type used in World War II . would be needed to effect the same destruction? Does he appreciate that our guided missile or rocket range is intended to perfect the technique of atomic warfare, and that the guided missiles, with an accurate range of 3,000 miles, will be fitted with deadly atomic warheads? Surely the Acting Leader of the Opposition realizes that only one of the latest atomic bombs would be required to wipe out Sydney, and that six of them could wipe out the six capital cities of Australia. Six atomic bombs would kill in aflashapproximately 4,000,000 people and destroy 80 per cent, of our war factories. One hundred atomic bombs could possibly immobilize Great Britain for 100 years. Surely members of the Opposition realize that germ warfare is also still a grave menace, despite the fact that it was not used in World War II . Yet, members of the Opposition continue to talk of war in terms of battalions and rifles. There will be only one more war for white civilization.

82,Mr Duthie,"On e would imagineio rapidly that one which waa considered effective a year ago may be regarded as ineffective now. The changes which have taken place in any three years in the twentieth century are equal to the changes brought about in any period of 30 years in the nineteenth century. This Government has realized the importance of this very potent feature of defence. It is impossible to say at this stage with what weapons the next war will be fought. The Government is encouraging the development of scientific planning and is conducting the most comprehensive investigations in its attempt to keep fully abreast of the latest developments in the application of science to warfare. I am not speaking as a warmonger. I am merely pointing out that, in their criticism of the Government's defence policy, the self-styled defence experts on the other side of the chamber completely overlooked the importance of atomic weapons, with which the next war will be fought. ""Who would survive an atomic war? The white races have been slowly exterminating themselves during the last 50 years. If the next war is an atomic war-and who doubts that it will be-it may well reduce the white races to sheer impotency and well nigh exterminate them. I have no doubt that the world will be an oriental coloured man's world after the next war. An American writer recently saidI do not know with what weapons World War III . will be fought; but I know that the gentleman upon his decision to increase warafter the next will be fought with bows '.nd arrows. Shaw who said that. words of an American writer. The honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr isolated, areas next year. Bowden) poses as the possessor of a great fund of knowledge. He claims to have the answer to every question. Despite their claim to omniscience honourable members opposite have much to learn. Only isolated groups would survive the next war. Should another world war break out, the fantastic future so eloquently described by Wells in his book, The Shape of Things to Come,, may become a reality. The survivors would probably live like animals in isolated groups scattered throughout, the world. These grim forebodings are frightening to every lover of peace. To-day, however, we are not. supposed to talk about peace is talking a lot about peace. about the dangers of war. Millions of people in this country and in other countries who will not be consulted before the next war is forced upon them, will suffer most, from its devastating effects. Unfortunately, Gallup polls are not taken in order to obtain a cross-section of the view of the people as to whether or noi war should be declared; they are restricted to matters of only minor concern such as the party most favoured to win the next election. We have been kept in the dark by Opposition members as to their real views on the subject of defence, about which they claim to have all knowledge. The awful effects of the dropping of atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki have demonstrated, that a future war might very well sound thf death-knell of white civilization. The coloured oriental races: would then have s glorious opportunity to take control & world affairs.

87,Mr Anthony (Eichmond) [2.15],"the Communists, at least their very good friends. One could not perhaps say that Ministers are "" fellow travellers "" of the Communists, but one can say that no administration of Australia that was not a directly elected Communist administration could be more helpful to the Communist party than is the present Government. Everything that the Communists want done is done. No effort is being made by the Commonwealth Investigation Service to stifle them or to prevent their inroads on the life of the community. Not one word has been said by the Prime Minister or any of his Ministers to discourage the growth of the insidious cancer of communism in the community. On the contrary, when the Communists want to acquire property and other assets they are able to get by the Capital Issues Advisory Committee and the Land Sales Control, whereas other citizens are placed at a disadvantage. Communists can get 'passports to travel abroad when other people have to wait. effort has been made by the Government to counter the attempts of the Communists to bring Australia under the domination of the Soviet. It is all very well for the Minister for External Affairs (Dr. Evatt) to be parading in Paris declaiming on the rights of small nations, and pulling strings to get himself elected President of the United Nations General Assembly. ing majority. elected it is a good indication that that organization will continue to be a toothless body, because the Minister for External Affairs is content that Australia should be practically disarmed, and should make no effective provision for its defence. It also gives strength to the declaration of Mr Ernest Bevin last week that Britain could no longer wait upon action by the United Nations, but would have to act with the United States of America and other countries which were ready and willing to act with Great Britain. all. Commerce and Agriculture ( Mr Pollard) may know something about the Earle Page scheme for stabilization of the wheat industry, but he obviously knows very little about foreign affairs. The election of the Minister for External Affairs as president of the United Nations General Assembly makes it more than ever necessary that Australia should lead world opinion in recognition of the need to take effective measures for defence if the United Nations is to be a power in the world, but one of the principal planks in the platform of the Australian Labour party is that there shall be no conscription and no compulsory military training. Yet the United States of America and Great Britain, with which we shall have to aline ourselves in the event of a third world war, have already instituted compulsory military training. In the United States of America, the scheme will come into operation almost immeNot the slightest diately, and in Great Britain it is to b* put into effect at the beginning of next year. Those two nations, with a realisti outlook on world politics, and witb thineed to defend their territories, have embarked upon a system of compulsory military training, while honourable member* opposite talk about rockets and atomic bombs, and the development of scientific methods of warfare which will make it unnecessary to have large bodies of trained soldiers. According to them, no one will have to fight in the next war except the boys who take up the aeroplanes, and the scientists in charge of various devices. Is that what the Russians think? Is that why the Prime Minister told us, after his return from Berlin, that the Eussians, in the event of war, could sweep across the Continent of Europe because they had 5,000,000 men under arms? Eussia does not rely on scientific gadgets or atom bombs OT rockets. Eussia relies on man-power. Lord Montgomery has said that no matter what advances may be made in methods of scientific warfare, it will still remain true that there is need for the man with a rifle and bayonet to finish off the business. The Government ignores the realities of the situation. The Minister for",34,Temporary Chairman Of Waging Atomic Warfare Are Being

92,Mr Anthony,"The Minister forExternal Affairs can be very courageous in Dublin, or Paris or London, 13,000 miles away from home, but bis courage runs out of his boots when he faces the bosses of the Seamen's Union aim is to prevent the democracies from or the Waterside Workers Federation, who imposed a ban on Dutch shipping and took the foreign policy of Australia out of his hands. Evidently, the Minister, so far as his foreign policy is concerned, is content to tag along behind che Communists. Quite recently, a Mr Burns, who is a member of the Central Council of the Communist party in Queensland, stated in reply to an interjection during a public debate, that in a war' against Russia the Communists in Australia would fight on the side of Russia. Such a statement does not really surprise any one, hecause we know that that is Communist policy all over the world. That is why, in Great Britain, Communists have been removed from positions where they had access to secret information. That is why, in the United States of America, Communists have been deprived of every opportunity to betray their country. Only in Australia are Communists tolerated in high places, and the person who is most tolerant of them is Australia's Minister for Defence. He appointed to a responsible position a person who had heen sentenced in Perth to six months' imprisonment for treason during the war. That individual was a national guard with access to certain defence information, and learned much since then. While he may he was caught trying to convey information to a Communist agency in Russia before Russia came into the war. After his release from gaol, the Minister for Defence appointed him to a position in the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, a statutory body under his control. That example indicates very clearly just what communism means to the men who are in charge of Australia to-day. I say that the Communists in this country have only one objective, to create and stir up discontent and mischief. They organized the campaign for shorter working hours and having been successful in obtaining a shorter left by myself and Sir Earle Page respecworking week and thereby, as a result, raised the cost of producing commodities and the cost of living, they have started a campaign against higher prices. First they promote the reason for the unrest, and they then stir up another section of the population to resist it. Their tactics are similar all over the world. Their re-arming, either economically or militarily. They are probably acting under instructions from Moscow. If they can slow down production in a war factory or in a business concern, whether it be in the United States of America, Canada. Australia, or Great Britain, their masters are happy. That is part of the techniq\ie. Yet the Government says that they are not traitors, but merely people who subscribe to a certain kind of political philosophy. The Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Holloway), who has a great deal of responsibility in connection with industrial matters in Australia, said that they are almost Christlike in their ideas, and that they are carrying out Christ-like activities. He has been challenged on that before, and .1 shall not worry him further with it now. Neither shall I review his long record as the father and fountain-head of communism in Australia. He was the chairman of the 1921 conference of trade unions which set forth a manifesto urging, as a matter of trade union policy at that time, the abolition of the Parliament and the setting up in its place of a supreme economic council, modelled on that of Soviet Russia. That was 25 years ago, and the Minister may have have changed his views there is not the slightest evidence that he has done so. The Minister for Commerce and Agriculture interjects; he is the greatest Minister for Commerce and Agriculture that Victoria has ever produced! He is a gentleman who, having been defeated at every turn by the wheat-growers of Australia when trying to fasten upon them a stabilization scheme of his own concoction, and having been challenged in this House by members on this side, both as to the merits and the validity of the scheme, delved into the files which were tively, when we were Ministers for Commerce, and extracted an old plan which we placed before Cabinet in 1940. The Minister now claims that this is his new stabilization plan-the ""Pollard wheat plan "". Every bit of that plan has been taken direct from tbe secret documents left on the files when we went out of office. All that the Minister did was to change the name, alter the price from the figure of, I think, 5s 2d. in 1940, to 6s. 3d. He then called it the great Australian wheat plan. I hand it to him with pleasure. If he had asked for it he could have had it. The fact that he claims credit for it does not mattei', because the wheat-growers will recognize it as the old plan which was evolved by Sir Earle Page. It looked familiar to the Victorians, who thought that they had seen it around, but could not place it for a while. As soon as it was exposed to the full liglit of day I recognized it. I am very glad that we have been able to help the Minister to do so much for the wheat industry. doing something now for the dairying industry? We on this side of the committee could offer him a few suggestions. He may not be receptive, hut nevertheless if he is in office long enough the dairying industry might easily be dealt with like the wheat industry. As the Minister considers everything for up to six or twelve months, exhausts all his own resources, and finally adopts somebody else's ideas, I shall suggest one or two courses that he could take. I am glad that the Minister is present in the chamber. The dairying industry is on the down-grade despite everything that the Prime Minister has said. the Minister wants facts and fhjures I can supply them. I do not know whether he is a practical farmer, but if he has had any experience in farming, lib should recognize that the quantity of butter and milk produced in Australia is governed, to a substantial degree, by the number of cows that are milked. quality of the stock and type of feed are factors which affect production, but by and hirge the amount of production which we can expect is governed by the size of the herds. I sball quote figures published in tbe Commonwealth ouarterly statement, Summary <of Dairy Industry in Australia, for the year ended December, 1947, relating to the numhpr of dairy cattle. 'In 1943 there were £.000.000 dairy cattle in Australia. There was a decrease in 1944 to 4,900^000, .while J/t Anthony. in 1945 the number fell still further to 4,800,000. In 1946 there was yel another fall to 4,600,000, while in 1947 the figure dropped to 4,590,000. Honourable members will see that since 1943 there has been a decrease of approximately 100,000 each year in the number of dairv cattle in Australia. produced this year than in 1943. in the abstract, but am quoting figure* which were collated by an organization which was specially set up by Parliament to collect the information. One of the most serious aspects of that decrease is thai the number of heifers under the age oi one year, which are the potential dairj cows of the next year or so, fell last year by more than 60,000 to a total of But what about approximately 864,000. New England district. Minister that this is not a laughing matter for the people of Great Britain are down to the minimum of butter requirements. They are receiving the smallest ration of butter in their history, and their only hope of increasing the quantity substantially rests in greater imports, not from the United States of America, Canada, Holland and Denmark, but from Australia and New Zealand. That this fact is recognized is borne out If by the report of the recent decision to increase to approximately 2s. 7d. the price which the United Kingdom will pay to the Australian Government for our butter. As statements in the House of Commons and announcements by th6 British Ministry of Food indicate, the United Kingdom Government reached The this decision in the hope and .belief that the higher price will encourage Australian diary-farmers to step up production. That hope will be realized if the amount of the increase is paid to dairy farmers. Unfortunately, the Australian Statistician's Government, which boasts of its decision to make a gift of £10,000,000 to the United Kingdom this year, and which is extracting an additional 5d. per lb. for butter from the British people, is withholding the increase from dairy farmers who are entitled to it, and has",35,Temporary Chairman Of Waging Atomic Warfare Are Being

They were obliged to sign the pledge. Their masters said that they had to do so. One of the objectives of the Labour party is the socialization of industry, production, distribution and exchange. Commerce and Agriculture and the Minister for Works and Housing( Mr Australian Labour party is something Lemmon) interject "" Hear, hear! "", but the Minister for Defence is silent.

Perhaps honourable members opposite can reconcile that with legislation recently introduced by the Government to increase the number of senators from 36 to 60.

The federal platform and objective of the that is here to-day and gone to-morrow.

We should not have known anything about that but for a letter that was written by the Minisduction was concerned. Is there to be no ter for Shipping and Fuel (Senator Ashley) to a seaman on a ship on the Australian coast. It was not announced in the Parliament at all. Another plank of the federal platform of the Australian Labour party is the nationalization of wireless transmission, including broadcasting. We can understand why frequency modulation has not got much of a chance in Australia. If concerns such as the Macquarie radio network think that by fawning upon the Prime Minister giving the right honourable gentleman free time on the air and charging the leaders of the Opposition parties the f u l l rates, they will save rheir hides, they are making a mistake, as they will see if they read this document. Further down the list of objectives appear the following words:No imperial federation . . . In other words, no Empire. wealth of Nations instead. from which I have been quoting is issued by the Victorian branch of the Australian Labour party. Among its office bea-ers are ""the Hon. A. A. Calwell, M.H.R,, the Hon. J. J. Dedman, M.H.R., and Senator D. Cameron "", all of whom are members of the Chifley Ministry. The document sets out the Labour party's objectives and thereby reveals the inconsistencies of honourable members opposite. It shows that they are prepared to skip a principle here in order to gain an advantage there. It tells all those who are prepared to study it that the ultimate objective of the Australian Labour party is the conscription of people under socialization as a pathway to communism. Mrs. BLACKBURN (Bourke) [3.1] It is inevitable that any government positions as far as wages or salaries are which assumes office will be attacked by the Opposition. We are quite used to that. Nevertheless tbe people of Australia must be somewhat tired of the petty bickerings in this chamber which artbroadcast to the nation. Nothing seemito be worthy of attention to-day except the delinquencies of a small group of people in Australia. During the war there was a concerted effort to put the country on a satisfactory basis as far as war proconcerted effort with regard to peace production? Why is it considered necessary to have order and good government in time of war and apparently not considered necessary to have order and good government, or even respect for one another, in time of peace? I may noi be completely satisfied with everything in the budget that was presented by the Treasurer ( Mr Chifley), but I realize that Australia is in a more fortunate position at the present time that any other country in the world. This must be due either to good luck or to good management. If there had been glaring mismanagement, the country would not be so comfortable or prosperous as it is. To be logical, therefore, one must give credit where credit is due and congratulate the Government upon those things that have been well done. In my opinion, those things are neither few nor negligible. Having done that, I feel myself free to offer suggestions and criticism. I recently drew attention to the possible danger to some workers by the expiration of the Defence (Transitional Provisions) Act on the 31st December of this year. We are now advised that Cabinet has decided to recommend that this legislation shall be extended for a further twelve months. I am aware that by raising the question before the act has expired it might have appeared to some honourable members that the outcry was rather like that which was raised by the White Queen, in the famous story of Alice, before she pricked her finger on the pin that held her shawl. It will be remembered that the White Queen said, "" It is a poor sort of memory that onlyworks backwards"".

129,Mr Anthony,"The documentconcerned. I think that it ia necessary for the members of the Government to train their memoriea to work both backwards and forwards. Quite a number of pinpricks have been brought to my notice, but I do not intend to deal with them at 'his stage. I propose now to refer to some of the. paragraphs in the Treasurer's budgetjpeech dealing with social services. Before the Parliament assembled some newspapers stated on a number of occasions ',hat the means test was to be eased. I iad on several occasions previously asked for its abolition. The easing of the neans test now proposed is, to my mind, nost disappointing. It is claimed that -.he complete abolition of the means test vould cost the Australian Government *n additional £54,000,000 annually. What of that? With the introduction of tlmost every progressive measure some »ne has claimed that the country would aot be able to alford its application. Despite such claims the Australian people lave gained the maternity allowance, mild endowment, widows' pensions and hospital and other benefits. Shall we say, it any stage, "" This is where we must Iraw the line. We cannot make further progress"". The Coburg Citizen, which is an Australian Labour party publication, wrongly assumed that I had failed ;o ask in this House for the implementation of the Labour party's policy of abolition of the means test. That newspaper irew attention to the indignity of the neans test, and went on to sayItis good to know that Labour representatives are working for the abolition of the blot. By that sentence the newspaper quite iniorrectly intended to make it clear that I am not a Labour representative. The paragraph endsDoes Mrs. Blackburn think that the punishment of aged wage-earners should not be administered beyond bearing point? Tn reply to that article, I ask, where are those Labour representatives mentioned by the newspaper, who wish to eradicate this blot? It appears to me that, entirely alone, I conduct a campaign on this matter, despite this propaganda which is issued in my electorate by the Australian Labour party press whicli wishes to create feeling against me. It is claimed by Writ. Rlnnlrhiirn. many that age pensioners are living in almost luxurious circumstances. They may occupy their own homes and possess property to a value of £750.. A husband and wife, who are age pensioners, receive £2 2s. a week each. They may also earn 30s. a week each and thus have between then an income of £7 4s. a week. Thai is described by some people as a luxury The newspapers, have made that poim quite clear. It is conveniently forgotten that possibly SO per cent, of the age pensioners are physically unable to earn any money and would not be able to find suitable employment. N'o one wants the old and infirm except to do the unpleasam and dirty work which other members of the community avoid. There are noi many age pensioners who have the comfort of their own homes. The position in Victoria is so bad that the various municipalities have been asked by the State to supply facts and figures showing the requirements of homes and rooms and the age of individuals residing in various districts, so that steps can be taken to cater for them. The housing problem is worse to-day than it ever was, despite any statements to the contrary. We are told that in Victoria houses are being erected at the rate of 12,000 a year, tha' is only 1,000 a year behind the 1923 rate At the same time the marriages figure if some thousands ahead of that figure. 1 shall not go over that ground again as 7 have spoken of it before. An increase of 5s. a week is to be mad» in the allowance paid to trainees undei the Commonwealth reconstruction training scheme. The increase is long overdue and is not yet sufficient. Among university students who come under this scheme are married men with families. A trainee with a wife and children has been receiving £5 10s. weekly, plus a small sum foj fares, which is by no means enough when one considers that because of the housing shortage many of them have to live fai from tlie city and pay increased fares. Such a trainee will now receive £5 15s. 8 week. Trainees at present receive an allowance with which to purchase books and instruments. I wish to draw the attention of the Committee to the plight of medical students in particular. For the last three years of their medical course tliose students work in hospitals and ar* 1 a-equired to wear suitable clothing. They must wear white coats,, and require a -rapply of four or five, two or three of which would require laundering each week. At one hospital which students attend during the final years of their -course, they must dress entirely in white. That means that out of their small income they must provide white duck trousers, vhite shoes, white socks and. white ties in ancient writing gives us these colourful addition to white coats. Added to the -expense of providing these items of clothing is the cost of ha ving them laundered.. In honourable members know how far Jiort £5 15s. a week must be in the meeting of such costs. When I referred to this situation on a previous occasion the Minister for Eepatriation ( Mr Barnard) suggested that those individuals were being treated very generously by the Government and should be grateful. I agree that there is a very striking difference between the manner in which ex-servicemen from the last war are being helped to-day compared with the scheme in opera<ion after World WarI . lervicemen could obtain vocational traindirected to encourage marriage with ing just as they may now. Mrs. BLACKBUEN-They could not mately friendship would grow between obtain vocational training in those days victor and the vanquished. So comTO the same degree as they may obtain, pletely have we abandoned Christian it now. It must be remembered that exr teaching that to-day we speak of oui servicemen are being trained because the former enemies ""polluting the country' sountry requires their services in the and we refuse them permission to conn various phases of industry. For that reato our shores.

Unless they are prepared to do so, there is no prospect of peace in the world. It is not for me to suggest here how such collaboration can be brought about; but surely if it is seriously attempted it can be achieved. The common people all over the world # -lesire peace. Both the Prime Minister( Mr Chifley) and Minister for the Army( Mr Chambers) have spoken along the same lines. Their words were, I thought, at times, almost inspired, and we must all come around to this way of viewing the problem of world peace. We must not only talk of peace rather than war; we must also work for peace and do everything possible to avoid the recurrence of war. Ex-servicemen as well as aged people have taken a very live interest in the subject of home construction. First priority ihould be accorded to all home-construction projects. I am unable to understand how the Government can reconcile its appeals to the people to work for peace with its decision to accord first priority for scarce building materials to the guided weapons range at Woomera. If the Government is sincere in asking the people to talk and work for. peace, it should take this elementary step to bring about the security of the people by providing them with much-needed homes. The Government must think in terms of housing for the people. migrants coming to Australia are supposed to have accommodation provided for them, we hear every day of migrants who, after having resided in the accommodation provided for them for two or three weeks, have been able to secure homes of their own. In some instances to which my attention has been drawn wealthy migrants from overseas have been in the market for homes a few days after their arrival in this country. I do not know what can be done to prevent that sort of thing from occurring. If the Government is aware that this is going on it should be able to take some action to protect our own people from the competition of migrants bringing money from overseas^ I shall reserve my further comments until the Estimates are under consideration. Mrs. Blackburn. -During the debate on the budget much comment has been made on the Government's defence proposals. Running through the minds of Government supporters there seems to be the thought that peace is the paramount consideration. While we all desire peace, honourable members opposite appear to hold theextreme view, so popular before the outbreak of World War IL , when the call was for "" peace in our time"", that wt should seek to preserve peace at any price. The Government might well heed thechange of attitude of the Government of the United Kingdom, which, after having considerably reduced the forces in the last few years, has decided to increase them and build up armaments, specifically aircraft and tanks. This Government makes great play of its defenceexpenditure. It intends to expend £250,000,000 in afive-yearprogramme on defence, of which £75,000,000 will be expended on the Navy, £62,500,000 on the Army and £62,500,000 on the Air Force. We had a hint from the Minister for Defence( Mr Dedman) that the amount might be increased, but it has not been increased. It is an odious comparison to talk about the money expended on defence before the war and now, because, although we are spending a lot of money on the armed services, we have little or nothing to show for it. In his budget speech, the Treasurer ( Mr Chifley) Although saidSatisfactory progress has been made in the development of the Royal Australian Air Force on its approved post-war basis. All units have their full complements of aircraft and the Royal Australian Air Force will be developed and operated in 1948-49 in accordance with the planned increase of tliat force. I have endeavoured, from time to time, to obtain from the Minister for Air( Mr Drakeford) information as to the strength of our squadrons and the numbers of aircraft involved. My private information leads me to believe that the squadrons are not up to complement or anything like it. Reverting to the five year programme under which £75,000,000 is to be expended on the Navy, £62,500,000 on the Army and £62,500,000 on the Air Force, I most strongly believe that the greatest amount of money should be expended on the Air Force because",42,Temporary Chairman Of Waging Atomic Warfare Are Being
131,Mr Falkinder (Franklin) [3.24]..,"air superiority is of fundamental importance to defence. That was clearly demonstrated in World War II . by the sinking of Prince of Wales and Repulse by the Japanese because they had air superiority at the time and because the vessels went into action without air cover. It was also revealed in the combat aircraft, that is those that can be great change that took place in the Middle East when we gained air superiority and in the invasion of Europe, which could not have been accomplished without the overwhelming air superiority possessed hy the Allies at that time. My specific reasons for saying that we need a larger air force than any other armed force are that we have a tremendous coastline, which necessitates a highly mobile force, and that we can only achieve quick concentration on a section of our coast by means of an air force. There seems to be some misconception that we shall have a breathing space in the event of another war. In World WarI . , we had a considerable breathing space and, in World War II . , we had a breathing space of about eighteen months. But it required two years to get the Royal Australian Air Force under way. If we imagine we shall again have anything like that breathing space to develop our forces we are working on entirely false premises. When the Permanent Air Force, which the Government bas set up, is at full strength, it will consist of 1,930 men. The CitizenA ir Force will consist of 190 men. Those figures should be noted. Never was there ao grossly inadequate a citizen air force than one consisting of only 190 men. Our air defence is split into two components, a home defence force and a task force. The home defence force will consist of 54 aircraft and 1,182 men. There will be four fighter squadrons of eight aircraft each, one bomber squadron of eight aircraft, one target-towing squadron of nine aircraft and one air-sea rescue squadron of six aircraft. The task force will consist of 90 aircraft and 2,061 men. up and put into action quickly. I wish There will be two fighter squadrons of sixteen aircraft each, three bomber squadrons of eight aircraft each, one technical reconniassance squadron of eight aircraft, two transport squadrons of eight aircraft each and one survey The total strength will be 144 aircraft and 3,243 men. We are to have 439 reserve aircraft, about which I propose to say something later, and 698 training aircraft. What really mattersis our immediate defence in the eveni of aggression, and the total of available used for directly repelling the enemy, will be only 86. The numbers could be increased to 111 if the air-sea rescue and reconnaissance squadrons were included. Using the usual 75 per cent, serviceability rate, which is applied in the Royal Air Force, I poini out that this means that our from line strength would be S4 aircraft. That, to say the very least of it, is a pathetic state of affairs in this year of grace, 1948. What we could hope to achieve with 84 aircraft passes my comprehension. I propose to make some suggestions that I believe the Governmem might well accept. There is no wellthought-out system of developing potential operational bases in north and north-west Australia and the northern islands. Those bases are vitally necessary for strategic purposes. The best way to meet attack is to get as near to it as possible. We have no well-thought-out plans for a highly mobile force capable of concentration at short notice. Another lack from the point of view of civil aviation as well as military aviation is an efficienl radar system. We have for years, during the war particularly, lagged far behind the Royal Air Force in the development of radar. I recall vividly that when 1 returned from England during the war the only type of radar, and, in many instances wireless equipment in use in Australia was either obsolete or obsolescent in the Royal Air Force. Here is a task which if the Government had any real interest in defence it would tackle immediately and energetically. The greatest need in the event of war would be a reserve which could be called to quote from a statement given to me hy the Minister for Air, which lays down the conditions of service for the Citizen Air Force Reserve. Here it is stated that ex-members of the Royal Australian Air Force will be invited to give an undersquadron of eight aircraft. taking that, in an emergency, they will rejoin the service, and the statement conupon members of the Government tb* tinues, "" There w ill be no training importance of air supremacy:l i a b i l it y "" . That is most signincant. I jay quite bluntly that it w ill be an utter mander of the Panzer Lehr Division, describing waste of time to put men on the reserve his experiences on D day: "" At two o'clock if they are to be given no training. am myself an ex-member of the Royal Channel.

Nothing of that kind is being done in Australia. We have very few commercial aircraft capable of being rapidly converted for carrying troops. There is not in the Royal Australian Air Force a single machine which will carry troops, and the only kind of aircraft that might possibly be converted for this purpose is the Lincoln which, in time of war, would be needed for bombing.

I now desire to refer to the existing, set-up between the Postmaster-General's Department and the Department of Works and Housing. A series of questions which I addressed to the Minister representing the Postmaster-General (Senator Cameron) last June, and his replies, reveal the position so clearly that I shall read them to honourable members. I asked1. What restrictions are imposed on the were these restrictions imposed? Has a direction been given that these 1 and 2.

The amount of repairs and to postal buildingshas been inadequate, and many departmental buildings are in urgent need of alteration. During the war works of this nature could not be carried on and since ihe war ended there have been serious shortages years, no benefits will accrue to the State of labour and materials. In view of the diffifrom the rehabilitation programme forculties being encountered, an approach has already been made to the Department of Works and Housing, which has shown the Post Office the utmost co-operation. An agreement has been reached whereby the Postal Department is authorized to carry out, without reference to the Department of Works and Housing, any work of a minor character costing up to £25. tt has also been agreed that the resources of tlie Postal Department may be used to arrange, witli the approval of an officer of the Department of Works and Housing in each individual -ase, for the execution of urgent building works of a minor character estimated to cost between f 25 and £300. The necessary arrangements are now being made by the Postal Department to implement this agreement, -vhich will be reviewed by both departments -onecnied after a period of twelve months, with the object of smoothing out any difli-ulties brought to light by actual experience, f feel sure that, consistent with the demand ui the nation's building resources for other -issential works, the procedure now agreed upon wil] enable Post Office maintenance jobs tn he expedited. [ direct particular attention to the words ""'utmost co-operation"" in the latter portion of the Postmaster-General's reply. During the last few years, the Postmaster General's Department has found that its efforts to provide necessary facilities in the country districts of Tasmania and generally throughout the other States have heen seriously retarded by the Department of Works and Housing. Although the last-named department agreed to permit the Postmaster-General's Department to undertake minor works costing between £25 and £300, I have yet to learn of one instance where its approval has been given. A "" rider "" clause at the end of the Department of Works and Eousing (Functions) Order, published in Oommomoealth Gazette No. 149, dated the 2nd August, 1945, states that the permission should be given at the discretion of the Department of Works and Housing. Many small post offices throughout the country districts made requests two or three years ago for certain minor jobs to be done. The Postmaster-General's Department employs artisans who can carry out the works, but the Department of Works and Housing has evidently decided ro make itself responsible for them. To -late, it has not done the jobs. Its attitude hp.« hnori srreatly prejudicial to TasUr. Falkinder. mania. Unless those minor works are carried out within a specified number of mulated by the Postmaster-General's Department. I hope that the Minister representing the Postmaster-General will inform his colleague of the position. The Postmaster-General should protect hisdepartment against this unnecessary hamstringing by the Department of Works^ and Housing. I am vitally interested in war pensions. Although the budget provides for an increase of 5s. a week, war pensions are completely out of balance with other pensions. In 1920, the invalid and old age pension was 27s. 6d. a week less than the maximum war pension. By 1942, the invalid and old-age pension was only 12s. 6d. a week less than the maximum, war pension. Since 1920, the invalid and old-age pension has been increased on eleven occasions, the total amount of the increase being 22s. 6d., but, in the sameperiod, the war pension has been increased only once,' and, on that occasion, the amount was 8s. a week. WhilstI do not in any way deprecate.the increase of theinvalid and old-age pension, I believe thai scant a'ttention has been paid to war pensions. The proposed increase of 5s. a week is grossly inadequate. Some cognizance should be taken of the basis on which the war pension is computed. Af far as I can gather, there appears to beno real basis upon which it is calculated. The war pension should be based on the cost of living, the value of the £1, or thebasic wage. No real attempt bas been made to increase war pensions commensurate with the increase of invalid and age pensions since 1920. One of my friends, who is a member of the Eeturned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial: League of Australia, remarked, "" With all this talk of pensions for defeated politicians, it would be better to get the political bullet rather than the sniper's bullet.. which means that for the rest of your lifeyou try to exist on the meagre war pension which is paid now "". I shall devote much more time to thediscussion of the Estimates than I have to the budget itself, and at appropriatetimes, I shall refer to a number of subjects. However, I strongly support the-amendment submitted by the Acting Leader of the Opposition. have no intention of attempting to dissect the budget so capably presented by the Treasurer ( Mr Chifley), or of engaging in a dissertation on the creation of new States, although I believe that they will inevitably be required. propose to advocate constitutional reform, although I consider that the Constitution must he altered so as to give the Parliament of the Commonwealth complete authority in all matters. I shall not -engage in a dissertation on socialization, although the subject is so attractive that [ am greatly tempted to devote some time to it. However, I desire to address myself specifically to communism, which deserves -special attention. The Australian Labour party is uncompromisingly opposed to -communism, and has shown its opposition in a number of ways. Both the Federal and State branches of the Australian Labour party, which are the bodies that govern the organization, have -also expressed their opposition to communism. -chamber, notably the honourable member for Beid( Mr Lang) and the honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Spender), have made attacks on communism, and I largely agree with their statements. The Labour party is composed principally of unionists. Unionists may or may not be -Communists. I see no way, short of the exclusion of Communists from membership of trade unions, to ensure that unionists are not Communists. If unionists are not Communists, the reasons for the exclusion of Communists from membership of trade unions should be reasons stated by the Labour party. I -lo not think that Communists should be allowed to exercise any influence over the Labour party. They do so at present. The Labour party must prove that it is not Communist. The Labour party must prove that unionists have no association with communism. That may mean that the Labour party will be split into at least two sections. That would be regrettable, but it may be unavoidab e. 1 Communism is said to be irreligious. We are very proud of the fact that there is no religious test under the Constitution. Therefore, under the Constitution communism, though in other respects undesirable, is not forbidden. Yet the Labour movement must rid itself of communism. It must actually prove that Communist? are not eligible for admission to the Labour party, even though in the opinion of the Labour parfcy they are not eligible at present. munists in the Labour party. idea that Communists are not in the Labour party for the reason that they are not permitted to be in it. They are rightly excluded. They cannot be excluded for a reason which is incidental to communism, which is that Communist* are regarded as irreligious, not believing in Christianity. As there is no religious test under the Constitution, they should not be excluded on that ground. However, I think that they are rightly excluded from the Labour party on other grounds. I do not intend to say tha' members of the Australian Labour parfrv may not be socialists, because the honourable member for Darwin (Dame Enid Various speakers in this Lyons) proved that the Labour part? has a socialist objective. As a matter of fact, many of them are. The Labou' party is uncompromisingly opposed %>communism, and we may leave it at thai I do not intend to elaborate upon the proposals for the creation of nev. States, to which reference was made by the right honourable member for Cowper( Sir Earle Page). I merely say that 1 believe that, the necessary alteration o< the Constitution must eventually bmade. I do not propose to attempt to disseci the budget. I shall merely refer to some of its salient features in an endeavour to illustrate how hypocritical and false it is. and how the Treasurer ( Mr Chifley) has attempted to mislead the people. BeforeI do so, I propose to relate to the committee two incidents that occurred in the City of Sydney, the largest city in Australia, last Saturday and Monday. On Saturday morning I endeavoured to buy a small celluloid medallion witb the flag of my country on it, but 1 found it impossible to do so. Last Monday, again in Sydney, I attempted to",43,Temporary Chairman Of Waging Atomic Warfare Are Being

I inquired in many shops there, including some of the largest multiple stores, but I could not buy a blue ensign, which is the national flag of Australia. I believe that the reason why it is impossible to buy our national dag is that there is no demand for it in Australia to-day. The Government has brought the people of Australia to such a sorry pass that they are rapidly losing their national spirit. I eventually bought this flag which I now hold in my hand. I propose to describe to the committee some of its features in case honourable members, like the public of Australia, have largely forgotten what it looks like. In one corner it has the Union Jack, which is the flag of our Motherland. Beneath it, there is a seven-pointed star, representing the six States of the Commonwealth and the mandated territories. In another corner there is the Southern Cross-the great 'jonstellation of the southern hemisphere. Tbe Government would have no difficulty -in combating communism in Australia if it assured the people that that symbol, the Southern Cross, will not be removed *nd replaced by the great constellation of the northern hemisphere, the Great Bear. That is_ a constellation which some people are desirous to see shining, not only in the heavens, but also over the whole earth. The Prime Minister of Australia and his Government should assure the people of Australia that it does riot intend to permit the great Eussian bear to put his dirty paws on this flag, or to remove from it the constellation of the Southern Cross and replace it with the constellation of the Great Bear. What the people of Australia want to know to-day is that they have a government which loves and stands by the flag of our nation. The Government has betrayed the flag. It should give the assurance that the people -seek and so restore their confidence that they really have an Australian Government and not a government prompted by communism, and largely subservient to the will of the Soviet. In the circumstances I have outlined I ask for leave to have a replica of the flag of my native eountry incorporated in Hansard. Tbere Mr Abbott. iis no technical difficulty involved, -and I consider that anybody who denies the iright of the Australian people to see .their national flag in Hansard brandthimself as a sympathizer of the Communists. The TEMPOEAEY CHAIRMAN ( Mr Sheehan) -I s leave granted? Leave not granted. Eepatriation ( Mr Barnard) has refused toconsent to leave being granted to have our national flag incorporated i» Hansard. I do not propose to say anymore on that subject, and I shall turn no* to the budget When I read the budget speech and when I hear the Prime Minister( Mr Chifley) speak in this House, I an. reminded of that noble poem by Tennyson entitled The Passing of Arthur. Honor able members will recall that the dying King Arthur was lying on his couch, and turned to Sir Bedivere and asked him to throw the sword Excalibur into the lake Sir Bedivere finally did so and out of thelake rose an arm "" clothed in white samite, mystic, wonderful"". After hearing thtPrime Minister speak I always think of these lines, because he clothes himself "" in white samite, mystic, wonderful"". He if so pure, holy and righteous that one feeh that he could never do wrong. He is -a mystic and, like all mystics, when he is asked a plain question he never gives 8 plain answer. Like the Delphic oracle in far-off times, his remarks are 80 ambiguous and so mystical that nobody understands what he means. him during the last election campaign. cause people do not realize either what he does or is. There are two question* on which he made great play in the budget speech. Early in the speech he statedI am convinced that we -must step np the quantities of our exports.

Let honourable members examine those two ttatements. In tbe first statement the Prime Minister says it is our duty to step up our exports, and in the second he says that we should send our goods to dollar markets, to win dollars, or to the sterling market to save sterling countries from having to buy goods which are produced -inly in the dollar area. In either case the effect is the same. I shall quote specific instances to illustrate that the Government, and particularly the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture ( Mr wrote to it pointing out that the Minister Pollard), have betrayed the sentiments -jxpreseed in the budget speech by the Prime Minister by having refused to permit exports to go out of this country to win dollars or to assist starving people. [ particularly refer to an action which the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture took in October and November, 1947, with regard to the maize-growers of the New England Tableland. On the 14th November, 1947, in reply to a request from the Northern New South Wales Farmers Union, he sent a telegram, signed "" R . T. Pollard"", in which he stated that the Government was not prepared to issue an export licence for maize from the northern tableland, as tliere was an ample market available within Australia. He did not say that the price in Australia was about £14 a ton. Yet he and Mr Bulcock, the Director-General of Agriculture, for Ausr tralia, and the former Minister for Agriculture of Queensland, had put their beads together and issued to the Queensland maize-growers export licences for 3,000 tons of maize when the export price for maize was about £33 a ton. The Minister, I repeat, refused to issue export licences to New South Wales maize growers. Those growers naturally protested and after further correspondence Mr Bulcock told the general president of the Farmers Union that he would recommend the issue of licences for the export of 1,000 tons this year. I understand thai the quota allocated to the Tumut grower* could not be filled by them. torate of the honourable member for Hum* by some one else next year. The New England Tableland growers were prevented from sending their maize overseas. I saw at Guyra a telegram offering £2S a ton for maize f.o.b. ship Darling Harbour for export to Japan which would be paid for in irrevocabh credits in American dollars. This Government refused a licence for that maize to be exported to Japan. I might add that the Minister committed a breach of the Australian Constitution, He had simply acted in defiance of it. When the Farmers Union protested to me, ] had broken section 99 of the Constitution which states that the Commonwealth shall not by any law or regulation give preference to one State or any part thereof over any other State or any part thereof. I suggested to the union that it should take legal action, and I regret, that i l was not wealthy enough to do so, or go to the Privy Council as this Government has done in another instance. I suggested also that it might consider issuing a writ of mandamus against the Minister and the Government to compel them to issue the export licences required. Another suggestion I made was that the union should sue the Commonwealth for damages on the grounds of breach of section 99 of the Constitution for having given preference to one State or part of a State and also sue the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture and Mr Bulcock personally. I regret that the union was unable to take such action, but I hope, if in the future I ever have an opportunity to catch the Minister committing so flagrant a breach of the Constitution as he did on that occasion, that I shall be able to take the necessary action to make him respect the right?",49,Temporary Chairman Of Waging Atomic Warfare Are Being

141,Mr Abbott,"That is in the elecof private ownership and property, and make him respect the Australian Constitution. With regard to the Prime Minister's statement that Australia was economizing in dollars and was working to increase both production of goods and the prices received for their sale overseas, I shall say again that the Prime Minister has deliberately misled the people of Australia, and the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture has backed him up in so doing. To increase exports of primary products from this country it is necessary to import more and more tractors. At the present time Australia is deficient in these machines. On the 4th July, 1948, VIr. Bennett, the Controller of Agricultural Machinery in tbe New South Wales Department of Agriculture, was reported in the Sunday Telegraph as sayingThere are about 12,500 tractors in New South Wnles but many have broken down irom continual use. So far 0,141 applications for new tractors have been lodged with me *nd with tractor distributing firms. Despite this huge demand for tractors I expect to receive only 1,000 for New South Wales between June,"" 1948 and June, 1949. Restrictions have been placed on tlie importaposition but to the inability of American tion of tractors and spare parts to save dollars. Australian representative of John Deere and Company, the second largest tractor manufacturing firm in the world, pointed out that his company was prepared to supply many more tractors to Australia if import licences were granted. The Prime Minister, still very respectable and holy and clothed in white samite, in a reply to the honourable member for Calare( Mr Howse) on the 4th June last, said that there were no restrictions placed on the importation of .spare parts for American-produced machinery already in Australia, and that the same position applied to tractors. He addedWe have endeavoured to obtain from the of United States of America all the agricultural to t ractors possible. [ shall show how untruthful the Prime three-monthly intervals. How can the Minister was by quoting from a letter Government justify such a decision which written by the Comptroller-General of means, in effect, that tractors must be Customs, Mr J. J. Kennedy, to Mr held in cold storage until next year, thus K. McPherson, the representative of the denying to the people of Great Britain John Deere factory, addressed care of much-needed foodstuffs? What ineffithe Consul for the United States of ciency and blundering this is on the Mr Abbott. America in Sydney. Mr Kennedy says that owing to the diflicult dollar position the total number of tractors to be imported from the United States in the 1948-49 financial year, which had been determined, must be regarded as a tentative figure. His letter addedOf this number 190 John Deere tractor* have been tentatively allocated to your organization for distribution throughout the Com mon weal tli. The John Deere company was asking for an allocation and guaranteed the importation into this country of 1,465 tractors. The Prime Minister and the Government have stated that they are bringing in all the tractors they possibh can and that in regard to the importation of tractors the dollar position does not matter one iota. Yet Mr Kennedy, the Comptroller-General of Custonis stated the exact opposite in that letter. Neither the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture or the Minister for Trade and Customs did anything to alter the position, but they made lying statement? to the primary producers that the shortage of tractors was not due to the dollar manufacturers to supply them. The letter continuesImmediately this is finalized approval will be given for the issue of licences for 25 pei cent, of the total, subject to a condition that importation is not to be effected before 30th June, 1948. Each subsequent quarter approval w ill be given for the importation ol a further 25 per cent, until Uie approved total is exhausted. What that means is that this stupid Government and this stupid bureaucrat only allowed quarterly licences for 25 per cent, of the tractors ' required annually by those farms. Do they not know thai farmers have to sow their crops at a particular time of year? Do they think that the farmers can sow crops every three months?

142,"En The Same Article Mr K. Mcpherson,","part of this Government. On the wrote to the Controller-General of Customs and the Minister for Customs stating that his company had programmed, if required, an obsolute minimum of 1,469 tractors for manufacture and export to Australia for the financial year 1948-49, of which slightly in excess of 44 per cent, were of the large cereal type. These tractors have always been very difficult to obtain in Australia, and still are difficult to obtain. On wrote to Mr Bulcock, the Director General of Agriculture, pointing out the position, but Mr Bulcock did nothing. On the 27th May, the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture, backing up the untruthful statements of his leader, -wrote to the Gunnedah Chamber of Commerce, in the electorate of the former Minister for Commerce -and Agriculture, now the Vice-President of the Executive Counoil( Mr Scully), in the following terms:I might add that the limited imports from the United States of America have uot been solely due to the dollar shortage but to diffiallocation. culties i u meeting tractor requirement. There were no difficulties with regard to the John Deere tractors, but the offer of the company was turned down, the Government refusing to allow these tractors to come to Australia. I do not know what reason lay behind that decision. There may have been some subtle reason for it other than sheer inefficiency on the part -if the Minister. There may even have Seen some ""palm o i l "" . In a statement <>f policy on the 28th July the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture saidThe Commonwealth would continue to import all the tractors it could get and share them out between the States. The Minister made a lying statement knowing full well that he had turned down the offer of John Deere to supply 1,469 tractors and reduced the number to sent telegrams to the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture and the Minister for Trade and Customs (Senator Courtice). Like Pontius Pilate, however, the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture washed his hands of the matter and handed it over to the Minister for Trade and Customs. Subsequently, the latter replied to the effect that, owing to dollar shortages, no additional licences would be granted for tractors this year except for twenty additional units. During this period when tractors were prevented from coming to Australia, the Government provided 1,189,110 dollars to Metropolitan Cement Proprietary Limited for the importation of a second-hand cement plant from the United States of America. At that time, the company had no capital assets to pay for the plant, but the dollars were allocated to it . The company's managing director was Mr A. S. Taylor, whom I characterize, with a full sense of responsibility for my utterance, as a go-getting scoundrel. This is the company which, in the words of Mr TaylorIn the Commonwealth sphere, because of itr inherent merit, has received the complete personal sponsorship of the Prime Minister, who in addition to directing tlie approval of the capital issues matters, arranged for the granting to the company in this presenl time of stress, an authority and permit to import the complete cement-making planl from America, with the necessary dollar The Prime Minister-a n innocent man, a saint, a gentleman whom we are told would do nothing wrong-sai d that he had never met Mr Taylor and had never heard of him until I mentioned his name in this chamber. If the right honourable gentleman made these dollars available to Mr Taylor, and has lied to the Parliament about tbe circumstances, he is not fit to hold office as Prime Minister. If he, in fact, knew Mr Taylor, and has lied in denying that he knew him, he is unfit to lead the Government. On the other hand, if the right honourable gentleman is so simple and innocent as to have agreed to provide approximately 1,200,000 dollars to a company, the name of the managing director of which he did not even know, he is not fit to be Prime Minister. In the late final extra edition of the Sydney Sun, of the l l t h September. Mr Taylor is reported to have said that ho had been associated with the foundation of several companies. I propose to give to honourable members some information about the type of companies with which Mr Taylor was associated and some about Mr Taylor himself. 1",51,Temporary Chairman Of Waging Atomic Warfare Are Being

Many of the companies with which Taylor was associated failed, and only by the skin of his teeth has Taylor escaped gaol. My authority for that is the Attorney-General Wales, Mr Clarence Martin. Mr Taylor was declared bankrupt. assets at that time amounted to £340 and his liabilities were a little in excess of £6,000.

The directors were so terrified by the revelation of certain facts during the hearing of the case that on the second day of the hearing they agreed to accept a non-suit. During the hearing of the case, Mr Shand, KC., referred to the company as one being conducted with fraud. case were forwarded General for action. company that was floated. and organized by Mr Taylor. associated itself witb criminals. placed in the highest positions in the land men like the forger, Garden, and his associate, the Minister for Transport ( Mr Ward).

Who was the champion who then took up the cause of Tayloj in this chamber? It was none other than the former honourable member for Beid. statement Mr Morgan, the importer of refugees, of New South who were attracted by advertisements in In 1931 the Austrian newspapers, and .vhrHis charged them exorbitant fees for supposedly arranging for their entry into Australia.

Will bottle-labelling machinery feed the people of Great Britain or produce anything in this counsaid that our speeches were a compliment try that will earn us dollars? Of course not! But friends of the Government, whom I may name later, wielded power and influence with it and members of the Government party, whom I may also name, and went to and obtained from the Minister for Trade and Customs the licences to operate after the lst July for the importation of bottle-labelling machinery to the value of just under 60,000 dollars, the equivalent of about 30 tractors, which, in a normal year, would enable the production of 80,000 bags of wheat. However, the hungry, grasping, criminal element, which, from the beginning of time, has supported and been associated with the Labour party, including tbe forger, Garden, and the people concerned in the stench of the Keane trunk case and other scandals that have flashed like lightning on the Government's head, show us that the Government is entirely insincere and does not care a jot for the people of Great Britain or the farmers of Australia. -The speeches of honourable gentlemen opposite show that they are so devoid of a positive policy that would merit their replacing Labour in power that they think that the only way in which they can I do not believe in force or domination. shift the Government from office is by defaming it. The honourable member for New England( Mr Abbott) claimed that we practically lived in contact with the most undesirable people in the community which reminds me of the old saying that birds of a feather flock together. The honourable member apparently believes that we consort with rogues and vagabonds who would destroy the country and have no love for their fellow men. No matter how high the state of mind of bonorable members opposite may be or how pure their motives, they should know that all the good things do not grow in their garden. speeches made by honourable gentlemen opposite have failed in their object and have been a wonderful compliment to the Ohifley Government. Their efforts to pull down the Government will not carry any weight with the people. to the Government. not pull much weight in the direction that honourable members opposite desire. My idea of a satisfactory budget is thai it should give evidence of honesty, equity and security. The Government believes that all the people, regardless of their status, are entitled to adequate food, clothing and shelter. Honourable members opposite should debate the budget a* it should be debated, from that standpoint. Instead they are seizing every opportunity of belabouring communism. They are not doing tincountry much good by doing so. As communism has been debated so much, however, let me, before I .get on to my real task of debating the provisions of the budget, say thai Communists and I are as far apart as the poles. A Communist would get no support from me and I would not expect any from him. I appreciate thai a Communist may have ideals thai he believes are good. Tbat is a matter for his own conscience. But[ disagree with the methods of Communists and the way they endeavour to control the people's lives in the manner that they regard as the best for the people. We must have a system of governmeni that fits in with my remarks as to what a budget should be, and is honest, and that gives equity and security to the peoplo. I deeply regret that honourable members opposite have said that we are friendly with the Communists. One honourable member stated tliat he would not say that we were "" fellow travellers "", but that he would say we were sympathetic to Communists. If he were to attend meetings of the trades and labour councils in the States and hear those who favour communism condemn the Australian Labour party advocates, he I consider that the would soon realize that there is no friendship between us and the Communists. Doubtless, some policies to which the Labour party endeavours to give effect",52,Temporary Chairman Of Waging Atomic Warfare Are Being

147,Mr Bowden,The honourable member,55,Temporary Chairman Of Waging Atomic Warfare Are Being
148,Mr Thompson,"Yes. They willaccord with some policies of the Communists. In my parliamentary experience, I have become aware that administrations, Labour or Liberal, do many things that are in accord with the policies of their political opponents. I was amused when the honourable member for Richmond( Mr Anthony) read extracts from the platform of the Labour party. He brought no secrets to light. The platform has been well known by all interested people for many years. As one honourable gentleman said, Laibour members would not be here as representatives of and endorsed by the party unless they bad fully subscribed to Labour policy. That is quite true, but it is nothing to attack us with. Honourable members opposite have talked bitterly about the socialization or nationalisation of industry. many people do not like the nationalization of industry. But about two years ago, when I was a member of the Parliament of South Australia, the Liberal Country party Government led by Mr party when you pay over £1,300 in Playford, became, I think, the first government in Australia to nationalize the power and lighting services of a metropolitan area. Honourable members opposite say that nationalization or socialization is something that people should be afraid of and run away from-, but when their own colleagues in another legislative sphere nationalize a utility, they are silent. .Vfter the years that I have spent in both the trade union section and political section of the Labour movement, I know what it stands for. More than that [ know more about the people and their standards than do many honourable members opposite. The honourable member for Reid( Mr Lang) spoke about the standard of living of the workers and produced figures which, he said, showed that, although a man, some years ago, could buy a suit of clothes with the pay for -me week's work, he had to part with the pay for two weeks' work now to buy one. [f the honourable member had visited the homes of poor people as I did and had seen the conditions in which the people lived in 1939 and had recently revisited them, he would not have risen in this chamber and claimed that the standards of . the. workers to-day are far below what they were then. The Leader of the Australian Country party ( Mr Fadden), speaking about taxation, on the one hand, and wages, on the other, said, in effect, "" You give a rise with one hand and take it away witb the other"". I do not know whether he was speaking about ordinary people, because the great burden of taxation beans heaviest on people at 'the bottom of the ladder, and not on those at the top. I agree that a man on £1,000 or £1,500 a year is substantially taxed. But I also contend that what be ha left after paying his tax is what counts. I remember meeting a man in my electorate just after the last general election. He told me that he had been speaking to his bank manager, who had said to him, "" You will be voting for the LiberalI know that party candidate, I suppose "". He replied, "" No, I support the Labour party "". The bank manager said to him, "" But your cheque for income tax this year was over £1,300. How can you support the Labour income tax ?"" The man replied, "" I am well aware of how much income tax I paid, but I am also aware of what I had left after the tax was paid. Thai is what determines my standard of living "". When honourable members opposite say that taxation has not been reduced sufficiently they must, surely, be thinking of the higher incomes. I agree with them that income tax rates rise somewhat too steeply, perhaps, from the exempt income to the middle income, but even in regard to the middle incomiranges it is what is left after the tax if paid that counts. I have been examining the tables prepared for the information of honourable members about income tax rates, and I believe that some of the figures might well be put on record in Hansard so that the public may understand the real position. During the war, when taxation rate."" were at their highest, a man with out dependants, who was receiving £250 a year, paid £36 14s. in income tax. Such a man now pays only £12 10s., a reduction of £24. A man with £300 a year, without dependants, paid £55 during the war, whereas he now pays only £18 15s. The man with £500 a year, .without dependants, paid £136 in income tax during the war, but even then he had £364 ieft, and that is 'what counts. His tax. has ""been reduced from £136 to £53, a'reduction of £83. We now come to the man on ^£5,000 -a year. During the war, he paid £3,530 in income'tax, whereas he now 'pays £2,405, -a reduction of £1,125. When the Leader of the Australian Country party (. Mr .Eadden) said that the Government was collecting more revenue from income tax now than ever before, he did not state the position quite fairly. T am not saying that his figures were incorrect, because it is true that the total amount of income tax collected is greater than ever before. However, the individual is, in many instances, paying less than he did during the war, and even those who are actually paying more are doing so because they are receiving more. When the right honourable gentleman was discussing our exports of primary products he said that, on the basis of pre-war values, such exports had increased, not by more than 100 per cent, as shown by statistics, but by only 44 per cent. However, when he discussed income tax collections, he did not apply the same rule. He did not take into 'account the fact that present returns from income taxation are conditioned .by the present-day value of money. I regard the man in receipt of £6 a week as a basic-wage worker. On an income of £300 a year, a -man without dependants pays £18 15s. income tax, but the man with a wife to support pays only £7 16s. Moreover, it must be remembered that this payment of £7 16s. represents his social service contribution, and is not income tax in the ordinary sense of the word. Those who press for the abolition of the present system of uniform taxation would do well to remember this. Even if the system were abolished, existing social services would have to be continued. We should still have to pay age and invalid pensions, widows' pensions, and hospital benefits, all of which are financed out of social service contributions. Thus, if the system of dual income taxation were restored the man on £300 a year would have to make his social contribution to the Commonwealth Treasury, and pay something in State income tax as well. The man on '£300 a year, who has a wife and one Jfr. Thompson. child to support, now pays only £1 ll's. income tax, and I cannot agree that thi* constitutes an unduly heavy burden. It represents a social service contribution of only about '7d. a week. The man on £300 a year, with a wife and two chUdren, makes no social service contribution at all, but his wife receives £26 a year child endowment for one of her children. It is absurd, therefore, for honourable 'members opposite to talk of taxation pressing heavily upon basic wage earners, or to suggest that it it depriving them of food, clothing and other necessaries. During the waT, a man receiving an income of £500 a year paid £80 16s income tax .if he had a wife and tw(children to support. He now pays £21 9s That is not a very large deduction from £500, seeing that his wife is entitled to receive £26 a year child endowment as an offset against the payment of £21 9s. in tax. The tax payable by a man on £500 a year, who has a wife and two children, .has been reduced by £59 7s., whereas the tax payable by a man receiving £5,000 a year has been reduced by £1,125. Tht Leader of the Australian Country partj advocates a fiat rate reduction of income tax, claiming that rates should be'reduced by 30 per cent., or some other fixed percentage. That is where We differ from him. Income tax reductions, in the case of the man on £500 a year, with two de -pendants, total 28.5 per cent., but thej amount to only 10 per cent, in the case of the man on £5,000 a year. Honourable members opposite do not condemn 'the Government for having taken too much off the £500 a year man, but for noi haying taken enough off the £5,000 a year man. Evidently, they still believe thai the function of government is 'to protect the economically successful members ol the community, the persons who have done well for themselves. The honourable member for the Northern Territory ( Mr Blain) very seldom asks questions in this House about the poor man on the land. He wants to get at the "" big man "", and I believe that he is right. Members of the Opposition generally show great concern for the "" big man "", and their efforts are directed at ensuring that he shall not be heavily taxed. The -wage-earner 'has already ^received -'easonable consideration. . If .honourable members will refer -to the 'tax schedules which were in force during the last'financial year, they will find that a man with a wife and five children, in receipt of £8 15s. a week, did not pay any income cax or social services contribution. There are'not many workers, even in the skilled trades, who receive more than £8 15s. a week, unless they work overtime and on Sundays. The wife of the employee to whom I have just referred received child endowment amounting to 30s. a week. How can we assist that class of wage earner? The remarks of the honourable member for Eeid( Mr Lang) were calculated to make his audience believe that wage-earners in that category require consideration. That would immediately occur to our minds when we heard the statement that workers could not afford to buy suits of clothes at the existing high prices. A man in receipt of £1,000 a year would not be so affected. En making these remarks, I do not desire honourable members to think that I believe that the present inflated prices of clothes are justified. The increases in recent months have been remarkable indeed. I mention this matter merely for the purpose of showing that the remarks of the honourable member for Eeid -lid not apply to the average tradesman with a wife and several children, because he does not pay income tax or the social services contribution. Honourable members opposite may claim chat the working man is heavily penalized by indirect taxes, including sale tax. Generally speaking, the man who has figuratively to fight in order to support bis family does not buy luxury articles which are subject to sales tax. Admittedly, he might purchase a special article upon which sales tax is payable, but such an occasion would be rare. The remarks of honourable members opposite about the necessity to reduce the burden of taxation obviously apply to persons in the higher income groups. When I visit factories, some of the employees say to me, ""Why does not the Government reduce taxes VI ask them what wages they receive, and what families they have, and nine times out of ten I discover that they do not pay income tax or the social services ^contribution Their questions <to ane are inspired by the constant agitation in the newspapers in favour .of a reduction of taxes. As I have shown, the Government has already exempted many persons in the lower income groups from the obligation to pay direct taxes. I forecast that if workers with only one or two children do not continue to receive their present high wages, a government some .time in the future will be compelled to reimpose taxes on some of the lower income .groups in order to maintain the buoyancy of Consolidated Eevenue. Some .honourable members opposite have referred scathingly to "" attendance money "" which is paid to waterside workers when they .present themselves for employment, but are not engaged. I do not desire to deal with tliat subject, but I know that some people, while greatly concerned about the increase of social service payments, advocate the abolition of the means test. The honourable member for Bourke( Mrs. Blackburn) stated earlier that she had been severely criticized because a newspaper had erroneously stated she had not declared herself in favour of -such abolition. I make no secret of my attitude. I stand for the modification of the existing means test on property, but I do not advocate the complete abolition of tbe means test. A few days ago, a gentleman asked me, "" When does the Government propose to abolish the means test? "" I replied, "" Do you want a pension before you retire from your employment ? "" He said, "" No, of course not"". I informed him that the complete abolition of the means test would mean that, although he was continuing to earn his salary, his wife would be eligible for a pension of £2 2s. fid. a week on attaining the age of 60. In my opinion, that system would not be justified, and I would not advocate it. The adoption of that proposal for the payment of pensions would not be warranted unless the recipients had, for years, made contributions computed on an actuarial basis. When people advocate the abolition of the means test, I sometimes get into hot water by disputing the soundness of their contentions. In my opinion, any pension payable by the Government should commence only when a person has retired Hirom employment, OT has uot sufficient means to provide him with the necessaries of life. Whether he is in that position can be determined only by some form of means test. WhilstI wholeheartedly support the budget proposals, I had hoped that the Goget provides that the amount of property, vernment would be a little more generous than it has in relaxing the means test. Honourable members opposite may be surprised that a supporter of the Government should express that view in this chamber, but I do so because I desire to make a few suggestions about the means test, which, I hope, the Treasurer will carefully consider. In the past, when people did not pay the social services convested the money in security loans. They tribution, I did not feel so concerned about the means test applicable to income from property as I do to-day. In my opinion, the means test on property should be made less irksome. At present, a man in receipt of an income of £3 a week is eligible for the full pension, provided he has no property other than the home in which he lives. During their working life, many people have endeavoured to save a few hundred pounds in order to ensure that they will have some comfort in their old age. A man and wife who have Savings Bank deposits or investments in bonds or in property amounting to £1,500 a year, are not eligible for the age pension. A house in which they have invested that sum may yield them a net rental return of only 30s. or £2 a week. I hope that before long the Government will make the property condition more liberal. Instead of the existing capital test, which provides that a person shall forgo from the pension £1 for every complete £10 over £100, the money .should be regarded as income. A person who derives up to £3 a week from property should he placed in the same category as the man who has made contributions to an endowment fund to return him £3 a week at the age of <!5 years. Provided such a man has uo capital, he is eligible to receive the full pension. It is anomalous that a man who invests in property a sum to yield £3 a week is disqualified from receiving a pension. This position should be thoroughly investigated. My ideas on this matter are well known in official quarters, but I voice Mr Thompson. them again this afternoon because 1 realize the necessity to assist many people who have saved a comparatively small sum of money for a "" rainy day"", and who are now being harshly penalized. The bud apart from the pensioner's dwelling and other exempt property which he maj have without reduction of pension, shall be increased from £50 to £100, and the property limit above which no pension will be payable will be raised from £650 to £750. Thi3 position is causing grave concern to many people, some of whom have saved approximately £1,000, and inare thereby disqualified from receiving an age pension. We should seriously consider relaxing the means test as it is at present applicable to such persons. I appreciate the action of the Governmeni in increasing from £50 to £100 the permissible amount of property which th<pensioner may have without reduction of pension. Not many years ago, the maxi mum amount which husband and wiftwere permitted was only £50. Under tb> budget proposals the maximum will become £200. WhilstI advocate thbliberalization of the means test, I do noi overlook the Treasurer's warning that money must be provided to meet the additional cost. That money cannot be con jured out of the air, or created through 3ome fancy method of finance like social credit. Any additional money which hpaid to a person who needs it, and should nave it, can be obtained only by taking it from another person who is in a position to pay it. That is one of the reasons why I have dealt extensively with the incidence of income tax and social service contributions upon the individual and said, that in my opinion the impor tant factor was not the amount of ta> that was paid but the amount that remained in the taxpayer's pocket after payment of the tax. It is the size of that amount which determines whether a taxpayer will be able to provide for the needs of his family. I am aware that we must cut our suit according to the cloth, or in other words, make the best use of the dollars and other foreign currencies that are available to us. We must also, however consider our future industrial expansion. In the past we were abnost entirely a primary producing country, and upon exports of primary products for our well-being. We must face up to the fact that at some time in thefuture the European and other countries which were formerly exporters of primary products will again be competing with us in this field, and possibly in a more vigorous manner than before. If Australia is to continue to be a white man's country and our present prosperity is to be maintained, we must increase our population, and especially our industrial population, which is the largest internal consumer of our primary products. That brings me to the Government's immigration policy. Lastweek-end I visited the displaced persons camp at Bathurst, in which the people who are commonly known as Baits are accommodated for a time so that tbey may acquire a working knowledge of the English language. I desired to see the type of persons who are coming to Australia from overseas and to form an opinion about whether they are likely to he assimilated into our community and become good Australians. If we wish to maintain the standard of living that we have enjoyed during the last few years, we must attract great numbers of migrants to Australia. If the prices of wheat, butter and other primary products fall to their pre-war levels we shall find stated the financial and economic position it difficult to maintain our present prosof the country. It is when we come to perity and standard of living unless our ->wn population is sufficiently large to consume much greater quantities of our primary products than at present. I hope that this budget will be. accepted by honourable members as being honest and equitable and as one that is designed to achieve the. security of the Australian economy. I conclude by saying that it is important that the people mould cultivate a spiritual outlook-and by that I do not refer to a religious revival. I am thinking of the manner in which every Australian should regard the other people in the community. Every citizen should consider the welfare of the man around the corner, whether he lives in a big or a small house. He said that unless those prices continue The TEMPOBABY CHAIEMAN"" i Mr Watkins) -Order! The honourable member's time bas expired. dependent Since the Parliament re-assembled two very important matters have been discussed. The first was the GovenorGeneral's Speech, which was in fact a speech prepared for His Excellency by his Ministers and read by him in the Senate chamber to members of the Parliament. That Speech was fully debated and was, I think, generally accepted as being very uninteresting and uninspiring. It was devoted mainly to eulogizing the efforts of the Government during the past year and it gave little inspiration to the people. We are now discussing the budget, which is designed to give effect to the policy of the Government as indicated in the Governor General's Speech. The budget speech of the Treasurer ( Mr Chifley) closely follows the lines of hie previous budget speeches. The right honourable gentleman is adept at making wise saws and uttering orthodox statements. I have little to complain of in the announcements that the Treasurer made in this and previous budget speeches. As a matter of fact, they might have been made by a member of the 'political party to which I belong. Honourable members on this side of the chamber take little exeeption to the principles that were enunniated by the right honourable gentleman. He expressed very sound views and clearly consider the reasons that he gave for our present economic position that we have some cause for doubt or difference of opinion. The Treasurer endeavoured to convince the Australian public that the sound economic position that he outlined is due almost entirely to the policy that his Government has followed during the years it has held office. He substantially ignored factors over which the Government has no control. I admit that in his speech the right honourable gentleman gave a clear warning to the Australian people. He told them, in effect, that the solvency and the sound economic position of the country is largely, or almost entirelv. bound up with ruling prices, and particularly those paid for our exports. at their present high level severe problems will confront the Government and tbe",55,Temporary Chairman Of Waging Atomic Warfare Are Being
149,Mr Mcbeide (Wakefield) [5.40],"people of Australia. The Treasurer uttered'tliose words of warning,but there is-no evidence in his speech or in the pro: posals that he hasmade to show that he has taken cognizance of his own warning. 1 This is the most inflationary budget ever tO'he presented to the Parliament. If the : right honorable gentleman believes, as I think he does, that the present high prices fbr commodities are unlikely to continue, wei should have seen some evidence of an endeavour by the Government to reduce expenditure as an example tb private citizens. It will be remembered that in the budget of. last year the Treasurer underestimated revenue that he expected to receive. I do not criticize the right honourable gentleman for that, because during that period even private individuals found great difficulty in estimating their income for the current year. I have no objection at' all to a treasurer being conservative in-his estimate of the revenue he expects to receive. Although the revenue collected was £60,000,000 in excess of the Treasurer's estimate, the surplus for the year was only £1,500,000. In addition to underestimating revenue, the right honourable ppntleman underestimated expenditure We are still in the midst of a period percentage. In the first two years of of high prices. In spiteof the warning to which I have referred, the Treasurer ih this budget has estimated revenue at approximately £500,000,000 and expenditure at £509,000,000. If the right honourable gentleman really believes that a recession-he will not admit to a depression -is likely to occur; I suggest that the proper thing to do would be to find some way to reduce expenditure. do not know whether the present estimate of revenue will prove to be an underestimate again, but"" the probability is that it will be. T am satisfied that expenditure is also underestimated. It is interesting to note that the only reductions of expenditure that are proposed are, first, a reduction of £20,000,000 of the amount which is to be expended upon defence; and"" secondly, £25,000,000 on subsidies. I heard the honourable member for Fremantle( Mr Beazley) speaking very glibly on thisquestion of subsidies. He tried to justify the audaciousannouncement' by the Prime Minister during the last referendum campaign, when the right honourable gentleman threatened' the people of this country with the removal of subsidies unless they gave-full powers of price control to the Australian Government. Now for the honourable member fbr Fremantle to suggest thai there was no justification for subsidies at that time is one of' th* most ridiculous proposals ever made in this House. Honourable members will 1 recall the history of those subsidies. They will recall that during the two years of the Menzies regime immediately after the outbreak of the last war, that Government appointed a price-fixing commisby £60,000,000 the sionerfor the purpose of holding down costs during the war period. Honourable members may also recall that during those two years' the action, taken by the Menzies. Government, and the resulting control exercised by the Prices Commissioner, were so successful that increases in items involved in the "" C series index figures was under 10 per cent; On the advent of the Labour regime, prices began to rise rapidly, so that from an increase in the first two war years of under 10 per cent, they increased in twelve month -1 of Labour rule to very nearly the same the Labour regime the increase in prices was over 20 per cent. It was at that time, when the futility of the controls then exercised was evident, that' the Opposition suggested to the Government s policy of subsidizing, the goods listed in the "" C "" series index. That policy had been applied earlier in the war by the British Government. It was noi I until the right honourable member for Cowper( Sir Earle Page) had returned from London, where he had represented this country on the War Cabinet of the British National Government, and had seen the success of the subsidy policy there, and advocated in this House the adoption of a similar plan here, thai the Curtin Government accepted subsidization as a policy. From then on. during the course of the war, costs were reasonably held down: I do not saj that some rises did not occur, but they were very much slowed down by the subsidization policy. It was expected that with the end of the war and with consumption, and purchasing power -",60,Temporary Chairman Of Waging Atomic Warfare Are Being
150,Mr Mcbride.,"reverting from war-time to civil levels die position would be eased and the subsidies would gradually be reduced. Honourable members will also recall that the Prime Minister early last year stated that as a matter of policy the Government was working gradually to reduce subsidies, and as they had reached too high a level during the war, the Government would gradually tail them off. The .Prime Minister in his budget speech last year estimated that an amount of £19,000,000 would be required for subsidies. Suddenly, out of the blue he announced to the country that the Government intended to intensify subsidization of commodities. Honourable members do not require to look very far to realize what had caused the Prime Minister to reverse his previous decision, of this country to see the results. This [t was perfectly clear that the industrial Government has deliberately thrown into policy of his Government has so reduced production in this country, or at least prevented it increasing, that buying preson whose standard of living the "" C "" sure had so grown that prices were skyrocketing. Therefore, instead of the £19,000,000 estimated, the actual expenliture on subsidies was £35,000,000. In spite of that, prices were again increassalaries or property owners. The Going rapidly. At the end of the war price levels, based on the "" C "" index series, had increased approximately 25 per cent, above the 1939 level. They rose in 194617 .to 27 per cent, and in 1947-48 to 35 per cent. In his budget speech last week the Prime Minister said that during the quarter which ended the 3.0th June, 1948, prices had increased by 40 per cent. That .increase occurred notwithstanding that an amount of £35,000,000 was being paid out by the Government in subsidies. In the face of that, the Prime Minister had the audacity to suggest .to the people of this -ountry that unless they gave the Government permanent power to control prices, subsidies would be reduced. The comment made by the honourable member for Fremantle that the advocates of .a ""JSo"" vote at the referendum had suggested that Government control should be ended immediately and that subsidies should be cut off immediately, was completely untrue. J know, from the literature that was circulated during the referendum campaign, and from published advertisements .and broadcast announcements at that time, .that members of the Opposition told the country that while they were opposed to the granting of permanent .powers the Government already, in an act of parliament, held such powers to -the end of the present year, and that the Opposition was willing to support a re-enactment of that act for twelve months and perhaps for two years. There was no suggestion by any member of the Opposition that those powers should immediately be transferred to the States. Hut the Prime Minister and his Government were so peeved, so disappointed, and so annoyed at the decision of the people at the referendum that they decided, willy-nilly, to throw the controls over to the States and to discontinue subsidies. It will be interesting to the people the discard the very people it claims to represent. I refer to the wage earners series index is based, the pensioners and retired persons on superannuation, who are affected much more by the Government's action than are earners of large vernment has thrown these people into an inflationary period in which prices will rise. Then, to cover himself up in the budget the Prime Minister suggests a paltry reduction of taxation of about £20,000,000 for this year, which, in the cases of these people, will mean a reduction of £2 to £5 a year in tlieir tax, whereas increased prices following the Government's action may mean an extra expenditure of £20 or £30 a year ior such people. .Sitting suspended from 6 to 8 p.m. sion of the sitting I had referred to the callous way in which the Government has discontinued subsidies formerly provided in order to keep down the cost ol living, and I had stated that even when subsidies were paid, and the Government had complete control of prices, the cost of living had increased by from 25 to 40 per cent. .It is still rising, rapidly. The Government abandoned tlie subsidy system because it claims that control over prices has been taken away from it. All that .the people said at the referendum",61,Temporary Chairman Of Waging Atomic Warfare Are Being
151,Mr Mcbeide,"Before the suspenwas that they did not desire the Commonwealth to exercise permanent control over prices. The Government had statutory power until the end of December to continue its control over prices, and the Opposition had given an undertaking to support the continuance of the exercise of that power for some years to come. In order to counter the effects of this callous action the Government has made very slight tax reductions, but they will mean very little to tbe working man. The reduction of £1 or £2 in the tax paid by a worker will be swallowed up by increased prices within a month. The Government, in a fit of pique, has thrown its own supporters to the wolves. honourable member. They will be thrown to the wolves at the next election. After that we shall have a Liberal government which will Another reduction made by the Government to counter increasing costs is in the provision for defence and allied services. Last year, notwithstanding that the Government did not complete its programme, it expended £65,0S1,236 on defence and allied services. This year it proposes to expend £50,462,000 for that purpose. A number of statements have been made by the. Prime Minister and other Ministers on the subject of the Government's defence policy. We have been told that the five-year defence programme which the Government has mapped out was decided upon after consultation with Great Britain and other Empire countries. These statements, however, completely overlook the fact that whilst an amount of £250,000,000 may have been appropriate for defence on the scale of costs applicable in 1946, according to the Government's own figures it is totally inadequate at the present time. After all, Australia is only a very small part of the British Commonwealth of Nations, and of the United Nations. During World War II . we were compelled to ask for aid from wherever it could be obtained. N'o doubt the Government is relying on similar ' aid being forthcoming should another world conflict occur. We have heard a good deal about the improbability of war. I should say that no man in this country has done more to influence Eussian aggression than has the Prime Minister. ment. bered that recently the Prime Minister said that the peoples of the world do not desire war. He also said, in relation to the dispute between the allied nations and Eussia, which is now reaching an acute position, that the allied nations should resist Eussian pressure right up to the point of war, but that we should not contemplate risking the holocaust that another world war would bring in its train. We have already had two world wars within a generation and J do not doubt that those wars occurred substantially because the aggressor nation did not realize that Great Britain and its allies would fight. The Kaiser was misinformed as to the attitude be more sympathetic. that Great Britain would take if his armies marched through Belgium. Hitler was misinformed by von Ribbentrop as to the attitude that Great Britain would take if he invaded Poland. Now the Eussians are being told by the PrimtMinister of a British dominion thai we should resist Eussian pressure right up to the point of war.. What greater encouragement could Eussia have than a statement of that kind? In spite of the deteriorating international situation, and in spite of the fact that the United States of America and Great Britain and other countries are stepping up their defence plans, Australians are told that we have a five-year plan which will be put into operation irrespective of what may happen in the international sphere. Defence is being made a political shuttlecock by the Government. We all know that the peoples of the world do not want war. No one likes expenditure on war or on preparation for war; but the Government has a responsibility to the people of this country, and it must face up to that responsibility. Ministers of the Crown are the only people in Australia who know precisely the state of affairs that exists over?eas. Yet in spite of the information they possess they merely stand pat and do nothing.

155,Mr Mcbeide,"It will be rememMinister for Defence and otlier Ministers allow Communists to remain in key posi? tions, the Government does nothing. Consider the utterances made by Communists recently in Brisbane. We all know what the Communists will do during the next war and we also know that there will he no war unless Bussia is the aggressor. The Government, however, does nothing about them. We know that before Russia was attacked by Germany the Communists characterized the war as an imperialistic war, and they did everything they oould to retard Australia's war effort. Tbe Prime Minister said that should war occur these people will not be able to do anything because they will be put behind barbed wire. That is a very smug attitude. the Government before World War II . was over. the Prime Minister has refrained from telling the people is the manner in which our Communist enemies are impeding production in this country. It is all very well for the right honourable gentleman to say that he knows where the Communists are and what to do with them. Why does he not deal with them now, when Australia is in duty bound to make the utmost preparation for war? This Government is refusing to face up to its responsibilities to provide adequately for Australia's defence. Honourable members opposite continually tell the people of this country of the wonderful policy of the Government, which is providing full employment for the people. Having regard to the general scarcity of commodities of all descriptions, and to the lag in maintenance and renovation works during the war years, what policy could have brought anything but full employment in Australia? The Prime Minister, however, has not told us what full employment means. I should like to quote the views on this subject of Professor Copland, who was economic adviser, not only to the Menzies Government, but also to the Curtin and Chifley Governments, and who was intimatelj' associated with our war effort. Professor Copland recently saidThe output of basic materials has increased the Prime Minister peregrinating around very little since 1039, and is now much less than is required to maintain in full productive activity the numbers employed at present. I l would be better to describe the present position as employment of large numbers at a level far below industrial capacity than as full employment. I entirely agree with those sentiments. It is futile for the Prime Minister to talk about the increase of the export of foodstuffs from Australia. The right honourable gentleman did not mention the fact that this country is probably doing less in relation to its capacity to help Great Britain and the allied countries than is any other country in the world which was not directly affected by the war. We know perfectly well that what Professor Copland has said in relation to basic materials is, unfortunately, only too true. The overall increase in production in this country has been extraordinarily small. The latest figures I have seen suggest that the overall increase in the volume of production in Australia since 1939 has been less than 10 per cent. In Canada, where there is not a socialist government, but one which is encouraging industry, enterprise and individual initiative, overall production has increased by approximately 60 per cent. The United States of America has increased its overall production by 50 per cent., and is now said to produce 50 per cent, of the manufactured goods placed on the markets .of the world. It is to the United States of America that Great Britain and the European countries are looking for succour. As an indication of how we lag behind, it is interesting to note that in 1939 black coal production in the United States of America amounted to 389,000,000 tons. In 1947 the overall production of coal was increased to 602,000,000. In Australia the comparable figures are 13,500,000 tons pre-war and 14,800,000 tons in 1947. The increased coal produetion in the United States of America is the kind of increase that might easily have been expected in this country, but instead we have had amendments of the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act and the establishment of conciliation commissioners and boards galore and more and more strikes and less and less production.

It was not until the Prime Minister recently went to England that the golden age began to recede. He then said that Australia would help to its utmost capacity Great Britain and the. other countries that were in great need. that statement ? it is belated. ""We are pleased that at long last, the Prime Minister has told the people the truth. He has also said that the key to tlie situation lies in production. He said it in such a way as to make it appear that it was an original thought that he had just conjured up. We have been saying that for years. But he knew that before and was misleading the people for. political reasons.

What did he-do after he had made that statement? I concede that he made a trip to the coal-fields and tried to impress upon the miners their responsibility to produce coal. I applaud him for that effort, but the results are appallingmore-and more hold-ups-and less and less coal. He has appealed to the primary producers, the one section of the community that is stepping up production in certain, directions. But at tiie same time as he is appealing for production, he is curtailing tbe importation of things most vital to production. Only recently it was reported in the newspapers that the use of petrol was to be further restricted. The Minister for Shipping and Euel (Senator Ashley) has said that thi» had lu ue, because motor car registrations have increased, by 23 per cent, since 1939. He did not tell us that cars registered in the ownership of the Commonwealth had increased' to the 1st January this year by r^orfi th^n 400 per cent. Are any restrictions imposed upon government enterprise? Those who complain about dollar restrictions arecharged, with doing, so. to enabhthemsclves to import luxury cars.

Tax reductions are not quite so great as many people would have liked them to be, but it must be remembered that we are still coping with the aftermath of. war. The results of the last two general elections show that the people realize that Labour has been their friend in peace and war. They were the judgesand they gave most emphatic verdicts in favour of Labour, as they will do so again when they have the opportunity.

In that respect, too, the, budget is a credit to the Prime Minister. Some members of the Opposition do not agreewith a policy of full employment! I cannot understand their attitude-. Ful] employment is. mostnecessary. A man who loses bisjob loses his income and the meansof supporting himself and his family. During the depression, 33 per cent, of the people in New South Wales were on the dole. The stores were chockablock with commodities, the silos:fullofwheat and the paddocks full of sheep and cattle, but in tbe midst of all that, plenty .unemployment was 1 rife in every city of the Commonwealth. The conditions then were a. standing disgrace to the legislature. Goods were plentiful' but money, was lacking. N'ow the people, have prosperity and plenty of purchasing power. Any business man in any, small town in Australia, will tell you that.he is being paid 20s. in the £1 and that practically no credit, h asked for. Contrast that with the depression days whenthousands committed suicide because of despair. It is amazing to bear people, say that' the Governmeni has not donaa good job. Supporters of a Government that, could not conduci the-country's affairs well enough to ensure work, food, clothing and shelter for the people it was supposed to represent ought not to have the audacity tocriticize the full employment policy of this. Government and say that it does not mean, prosperity. Nothing could bf further from the truth. Ask any man the first' thing heneeds and he will say, "" Employment "". The rank and file, who keep the wheels of industry turning, are fully employed to-day: As the Minister for Labourand National Service( Mr Holloway) has said, 100,000 jobs columns of advertisements of jobs waiting to be filled. Tbe argument that the Government's tax policy has retarded production must be far from the truth. Otherwise why should so many firms be advertising for hands? The fact is that labour and materials are not available -The wheat industry has been a political Some honourable members opposite have referred to the decline in our cattle there was a keen debate in this chamber and sheep population. It is true that there has been a decline, but that is because the country passed through three of the worse years of drought in Australia's history. One drought was tbe worse for all time. Sheep and cattle cannot be bred in 24 hours. It takes a long time to develop flocks and herds. In the drought, calves that could have increased the herds were killed. 30,000,000 sheep died. During the war old stock was killed for food for our servicemen. That is why our numbers of cattle and sheep have dropped so steeply. Nature did not give us the opportunity of keeping them at the required level. The former Minister for Commerce and Agriculture ( Mr Scully) had a most unenviable job when he took over the department during one of the worse periods in our agricultural history. The honourable member for Richmond Anthony) had a great deal to say about the shortage of butter. I can understand the decline of production in the dairying industry. People left dairy farms as people left wheat farms because they could not make a "" crust"". Now, however, the Government has granted dairymen a payable price for their commercial butter. The burnt child fears the fire and it was uot to be unexpected that people would be chary of returning to dairying. Honourable members opposite have condemned the Government for its attitude towards men on the land, but I maintain that, in the whole history of Australia, there has never been a more countryminded government than the present Labour Government. entered this Parliament, hardship and poverty were rampant in country districts, and many farmers were going bankrupt; but to-day, it is a pleasure to visit rural areas because the people are so prosperous. Everywhere L go, I hear the men on the land, no matter what their political sympathies, praising the Government's rural programme. Theconnifr. Langtry. try people admit that never before were they so well off. Who is responsible for this? The credit must go to the present Labour Government for introducing organized marketing, and guaranteeing prices for rural products. football for a long time. Not long ago. on the international wheat agreement. The honourable member for Indi( Mr McEwen) led the debate for the Opposition. He delivered a well-prepared speech-prepared , I think, by interests representing the wheat merchants-in the course of which he said that, if the wheat-growers were given the opportunity to exercise a vote on the Moreover, subject, they would turn down the proposed wheat stabilization plan. Unfortunately, the international wheat agreement was not ratified hy certain countries, and it has been abandoned although it would bave provided an unequalled opportunity for stabilizing the wheat industry for the next five years. However, the Prime Minister called a conference of State representatives to institute a .voluntary wheat pool to take the place of the proposed stabilization ( Mr scheme, and the wheat-growers of thi various States have been given the opportunity to vote on the proposal. In Victoria, the vote has already been taken, and the growers have approved the proposal by a three-to-one majority. Obviously, the honourable member for Indi, in opposing the stabilization proposal, was not speaking for the grower? of Victoria. In that State, 11,275 growers voted in favour of the proposal, and only 3,490 against it. Opposition organizations are themselves divided on this issue. The Farmers and Settlers Association is not the mouthpiece of the wheat-growers, but the Wheat Growers Federation is, and it has advocated a "" Yes"" vote in New South Wales, in When I first spite of the opposition of honourable members opposite, and of the executive of the Farmers and Settlers Association. I quote the following press report of proceedings at a recent meeting of the New Sonth Wales branch of the Wheat Growers Federation:"" The degree of unanimity reached between representatives of the State and Federal Governments, and within the Australian Wheat Growers' Federation, upon the Federal wheat proposals can surely permit of little opposition, especially from within the wheat industry,"" said Mr G. H. Evans, president of the referendum campaign, the Government Austtalian Wheat Growers Federation to-day. 'Organized wheat-growers have for many years supported such a plan in principle and during the last three years they have had the opportunity of concentrating on proposals on which ean be built an effective stabilization scheme"", he said. Mr Evans said that Victorian growers had already decided by a three-to-one majority to support these principles. In Western Australia a special conference oi organizations whose representatives had previously opposed such a plan had now supported the acceptance of the Government's latest proposals . . . A large and representative gathering of wheat-growers at Oaklands this week carried with one dissentient a resolution recommending a "" Yes"" vote at the coming ballot on the Federal wheat stabilization plan. Those prescnt included two vice-presidents of the Farmers and Settlers (Messrs, R. A. O'Neill, of Berrigan, and J. M. Wilson, of Balldale), and district council members of the same body, as well as office-holders and prominent nieinbers of the Wheat Growers Union and Victorian Wheat and Wool Growers Association. Most districts of Southern Riverina were represented, and there were some farmers from Victoria. Opposition parties when they were in power, had the opportunity over a period of many years to do something to help the wheat-growers, but they never offered more than 2s. lOd. a bushel for wheat at country sidings. The result of the poll of growers in Victoria has placed beyond doubt what the growers want. They are satisfied w i th the Government's proposal for a guaranteed export price for 100,000,000 bushels, and it is not often that to scheme, which able price for the next five years, growers w ill be able to plan ahead. It is necessary to plan at least twelve months ahead for the growing of wheat, because land must be fallowed, and other preparations made. I commend the Government and the Ministerf or Commerce and Agriculture ( Mr Pollard) for bringing forward a plan which w ill give the growers security, and enable them to produce at a profit. I also commend the Government on its decision to continue to pay a subsidy on superphosphate. Probably 90 per cent, of Australia's agricultural land needs superphosphate, which is used in the growing of onions, potatoes, wheat and lucerene, and for topdressing pastures. During the recent stated that, if its proposals were rejected, the payment of subsidies would be discontinued, but it has wisely decided to continue the payment of the subsidies on superphosphate. I am pleased that it is intended to make payments direct to the growers instead of the manufacturers, as has been the case in the past. TJnder the old system, farmers had to wait a long time for their rebate* from the manufacturers: The Department of Commerce and Agriculture, the Australian ""Wheat Board, and the New South Wales Bailway? Department, as well as the Minister for Agriculture in» New South Wales, have done a magnificent job in shifting last year's wheat crop from the interior of New South Wales to the coast, especially as the quantity to be removed amounted to almost two years' normal crops. M o r e over, fanners had, for the most part, to use second-hand bags. The Government sent a representative to Calcuttai n an endeavour to obtain more cornsacks, but he was unable to get all that were needed. Very little wheat w ill be left at country sidings when the new season begins, and that little w ill all be in bags. The honourable member for Wimmera( Mr Turnbull) has said that the Ministerf o r Commerce and Agriculture should not have any say in the sale of wheat. Can we imagine any Government we have more wheat guaranteeing the price of wheat and not export than that. TJnder this insisting upon having a say in the sale guarantees a payof it? If any honourable member opposite were to guarantee a businessman who required a loan of £10,000, he would insist on having a voice in the management or control of the security. in exactly the same position. Hadi t not guaranteed the producers a price for their wheat, the situation would be entirely different. Honourable members opposite want it both ways. They demand that the Government shall guarantee the farmers a payable price for their wheat, but they object to the Government having any voice in the disposal of the grain or in",65,Temporary Chairman Of Waging Atomic Warfare Are Being

164,Mr Langtry,"The Government is the condudt df the industry. Their attitude is most unreasonable. The administration of the Government and the Australian Wheat Board has been most effective. We can easily criticize what another man does, but when we place ourselves in his position, we often view the matter in a different light. I make no apology for anything that the Government has done for the man on the land, and I compliment it for placing the primary industries on a sound footing. Prosperity is evident in all walks of life. Various Ministers have made a vigorous defence of the Government's actions. Any government is apt to make some mistakes, but the Chifley Government has shown foresight in everything and has done the greatest good for the greatest number of people. The administration of tlie Treasurer during the last eight years has greatly improved the conditions of all the people, whether they be workers, businessmen, primary producers, age ahd invalid pensioners or widows. section of the community is enjoying prosperity unparalleled in our history is a great compliment to the Government whose wise legislation has made that prosperity possible. The Minister for the Army( Mr Chambers), who vigorously defended Australia's defence policy, counselled his critics to talk more about peace and less about war. The Minister for External Affairs (Dr. Evatt) has done everything possible at 'the United Nations to avert another conflict. The honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Spender) frequently criticizes the Minister for External Affairs.

Millions of young men will be slain should the nations resort to atomic warfare. I pray that the Western democracies and Russia will reach a compromise. I do not profess to be an authority on international affairs. The Minister for External Affairs, who is the authority in these matters, is exerting every effort to avert war.

166,Mr Hughes (North Sydney) [8.50].,"-dearly earned and 'richly deserved still -dudes us. While all men cry out for peace, they are feverishly re-arming, l t is a tragic commentary on the folly of mankind, but it is a definite factor that we cannot afford to ignore. The right honourable gentleman has expressed the opinion, which all honourable members mare, that Eussia, although pressing on, loes not want Avar, but is prepared to push its policy as far as it can go with->ut war. In my opinion, that statement describes the situation very crisply. Saturally, we ask ourselves what is it that Eussia can gain by war that it has aot gained and is not gaining by the Mere threat of war? Applying these great things to relevantly small ones, we see the position in the domestic sphere proceeding along the same lines. Men do cot want to strike. Why should they itrike when they can get all that they -vant by the mere threat to strike and by ignoring the law? The right honourable gentleman has told us that the western lemocracies, with whom we are associated, are confronted with a power which they are quite unable to repel. The right honourable member tells us in world affairs, or affect its control of that Bussia could let loose a flood of that area. For although, in body, tht 4,000,000 or 5,000,000 troops, who would Russians would leave, in spirit they spread over the whole of unoccupied would remain, for they have, as is their Europe. We naturally ask why Eussia practice, established powerful Communist does not do that, and, in part, the answer cells which would carry on their work, is that, so far, the Eussians are doing and obey their slightest wish. That is the very well as they are. We watch closely technique of Russia throughout the world. tlie situation as it unfolds in Europe -So although according to the right honorand elsewhere. We see the situation in able gentleman and .as we know Berlin deteriorating daily. As honourable ourselves, Russia members know, the Eussians are occupying one sector of Berlin, and they have is apprehensive of war. Steps are banged, bolted and barred the door in being taken in every country to prepare >rder to prohibit the western powers for it. The Australian Government, like -sending food, and the other necessaries of other governments, has a defence policy. !ifp to the Germans in the western sector It has allocated approximately £6,000,000 of the capital. The Bussians hope that, for use on the guided weapons range hy this means, they will force Germany and general defence research. to accept the Communist philosophy. this, Australia is following the example The Eussians are standing "" p a t "" in of other countries. Britain and America Berlin. They have refused to budge. have expended huge sums of money on Every possible effort has been made to research for the most effective weapons induce them to come to agree to a modus and to assure that their defences ---ivendi with the western powers, whose will be strong enough .to repel, OJ purpose is quite pacific and entirely in to : smash by anticipating them, the harmony with the spirit of the age, which bombs, rockets or other missies that may <eeks the settlement of international .disbe launched against them by an -enemy. putes by an appeal to reason, right and the rule of law. But the Bussians stand there, and no one can shift them. Realizing however, that their .attitude exposes them to a certain amount of odium, the Eussians have notified the world'that they are prepared to evacuate Korea. Now, that is entirely in keeping -with the technique of the Soviet, which masks its unalterable purpose-the domination of the worldwith specious disguises. Eussia affectt to stand out as the champion of liberty and of the oppressed, offering its services to the down-trodden in every land-thrustin g those services upon them when they are a little hesitant about accepting the offer. I am sure that honourable members, and the people of this country, realize the relative significance of Korea and Berlin. While standing "" pat"" in Berlin, from which they cannot be driven, the Eussians offer to evacuate Korea, from whicli they can be driven quitreasily, because forces bf sufficient strength are at hand to expel them. Should Eussia evacuate Korea, it would not make any material difference is -not anxious to provoke a war, the wliole world In We may be sure that Russia is sleeplessly labouring to strengthen her offensive and defensive armaments. IfI were asked what it is that prevents Russia from setting out on its conquest of the world and brushing aside all resistance in Europe, I should say it is the fact that America has the atomic bomb, and that Russia has not. The key to tlu3 present world situation is to be found in those few pregnant words. America has the atomic bomb, and Russia has not. If Russia had it, believe me, it would use it. Whether that be so or not, we must perfect our own defences so that we may be enabled to give a good account of ourselves if we are attacked or take part in any conflict that may be let loose upon the world. The Government has already done something by allocating £6,000,000 for the purposes to which I have referred, but that is not enough. Wars are fought by men disciplined, regimented and trained in the use of the weapons of their time. nizes this, and has set about the task of raising our forces to the level which would afford us a reasonable prospect of giving a good account of ourselves, but so far its efforts bave fallen far short of success. RecentlyI asked the Minister for the Army( Mr Chambers) a series of questions regarding the number of recruits for the Citizen Forces and the Australian Regular Army, [n his reply, the Minister stated that 3,313 recruits enlisted in the Citizen Military Forces throughout Australia in July of this year and that in August the number fell to 2,S07, while the number of recruit* to the Regular Army, which in July of this year was 1,631, fell to 923 in the following month. The Minister further said that at the 8th September last the estimated strength of the Citizen Military Forces and the Regular Army was 8,697 and 10,712 respectively. Those figures, which are most disturbing in themselves, are made doubly so by the Government's very modest target strength of 50,000 for the Citizen Military Forces and the 19,000 for theRegular Army. Tliose figures compare still more unfavorably with the strength of the armed forces of Australia in the months immediately preceeding the outMr Bughes. break of the 1939-45 war. At that timethe Government of which I was a member, being seriously alarmed at the prospect of war, appointed me to conduct a campaign to raise our Militia Forces, which then stood at the paper strength of 20,000, to 75,000. In approximately two months the campaign raised S5,000 voluntarily enlisted men. I ask the committee to compare that with the 8,000 men in the Citizen Military Forces to-day. In November, 1939, after war had broken out in Spetember, the then Minister for Defence was asked what was the strength of the militia forces at the time. He said it was between 55,000 and 65,000, after making allowance for the men in the militia forces who had enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force for active service abroad. Whai is the explanation of this? At the outbreak of the last war there were 85,000 men in the militia forces; now there only 8,000. Are we to assume that that is due to a deterioration The Government recogof the character of the people of. this country? I cannot say. The facts are that tbe response to the appeal to the citizens of Australia to defend then liberties has been paltry and shabby. That brings me to a point that I desire to emphasize. I have always believed in compulsory military training. 1 Military believe that the rights and privileges of citizenship carry with them the obligation that every citizen should fit himself to defend those rights and privileges. In 1901, speaking on the Defence Bill that was then before the Parliament, I proposed that every adult male in Australia from the age of eighteen to the age of 60 should undergo a period of training. After setting out the scheme in detail, I said that what I meant by "" training"" was that a man should perfect himself in everything that went to make an efficient soldier of that day. Compulsory military training was subsequently adopted by the Labour party on my motion and became a plank of its platform. In 1914, war liaving been declared and an election having taken place, that plank was one of the most vital in the platform, and every member of the party was bound to support it. As a matter of fact, we were returned to wage the war to a victorious conclusion. creating all other things as subsidiary to that objective. As honourable members probably remember, in 1917 the conscription issue divided this country. Compulsory training as a plank of its platform was scrapped by the Labour parby and conscription was denounced by it for 25 years afterwards. In 1940 the then Prime Minister pledged himself and his party to oppose conscription in every form, yet in 1941 he introopinion compelled the Government to do duced legislation, which was passed by the Parliament, under which military and industrial conscription became the law of the land, and remained so until the war ended. Once again compulsory military training in Australia, which was vital to the Labour party for so many years, was thrown aside. Recruitment for the Citizen forces ahd the regular army depended on voluntary enlistments. A most expensive and extensive recruiting campaign has been conducted. Use has Seen made of the press and radio stations. The advertisements that appeared and which set forth the opportunities for young men in the forces left nothing to be desired, hut there has been a beggarly response. It is said in a newspaper jailed the Express, about which I kuow very little, that the Minister for the Army expressed the opinion that he was convinced that voluntary recruiting would never succeed in obtaining the required number of recruits. The Minister will inform the committee whether or not he said that, hut the results confirm the opinion that the Minister is alleged to have expressed. Voluntary recruiting both for the Regular Army and the Citizen Military Forces has failed dismally. I have always believed in compulsory military training. I have worked as consistently as any man could to build up the defences of this country. I say that now, when war is looming on the distant horizon, the defences of Australia have sunk to a level that almost moves us to tears. We are bereft of any semblance of an effective defence force. What are we doing about it? War has come almost within hailing distance of our shores. It is raging in Indonesia and Malaya. There are revolts in those countries against the Malaya, a campaign of murder and rapine has been raging for months. Planters have been brutally butchered and administrators in mines and other businesses have been shot. When the planters made an appeal for arms, and some were shipped in the Port of Sydney, the Communist-dominated Waterside Workers Federation banned the vessels on which they had been shipped. When, at long last, incensed publicsomething, it sent arms by air. But not one word of censure was uttered by the Prime Minister against those who had banned the despatch of the arms by sea. I have said, and it has been said many times by others that governments oughi to govern. This Government does noi govern. Its foreign policy like itf domestic policy is shaped by the Communists. As honourable memhers know. Malaya and Indonesia are bastions of Australia. They are strategic posts from which an attack can be launched against this country. As long as they continue under the control of friendly, strong governments we are, at any rate to some degree, cushioned against any swift and fateful attack. But there is war in both Malaya and Indonesia. The Communist press would have us believe the Malayans are fighting for freedom and the right to govern themselves in their own way. That is a right which Australian people freely concede them. But we must make it perfectly clear, that whilst conceding them the freedom to govern themselves in their own way and to provide for their own security, we demand the same rights for Australians. We demand the right to govern ourselves in our own way and to take such steps as we may deem necessary to ensure our security. Malaya is a British possession and Australia is an integral part of the British Empire. We are here by the grace of God and the power which that Empire has exercised on our behalf. We have done somethine. on our part, to help the Empire. The other day a Mr Burns in Queensland, when asked what would be his attitude in the event of war with Bussia, said that the Communists would fight on the side of Bussia. The secretary established governments. In of the Australian Communist party, Mr Dixon, who had a night to think over vlr. Burna's statement, said that Mr Russian., appeal, the Russians are still Burns's view did not represent the congoing to help themjeven if they have to. ddered view of the Communist, party, kill them to do-it.

167,Mr Mcewen'(Indi) [9.261,"I desireThose-items' include-payments forsocial services, payments to the States, expenditure to maintain our defence forces; and repatriation, responsibilities} and essential -.apital expenditurefor the development of Australia. A. study of the categories rf tbe itemsofexpenditure proposed would indicate, that there is no scope for pruning,, but the total amount that the Government intends to collect is exactly the amount required to meet those items of expenditure. How did the Prime Minister and Treasurer ( Mr Chifley) and. bis advisers arrive at the calculations vhich produced those figures of anticipated, returns from taxation ? Naturally, tbey could only have been arrived at by estimating the income expected by individuals and companies, by estimating the urticipated imports to this country and the consumption of goods subject to excise *nd other duties. The advisers of the Treasurer must have carefully cal-isulated the anticipated expenditure, and said, "" Thisis what we expect to collect and this is how we propose to Tfxpend. themoney"". The calculated income of. individualsand: companies in this country is determined, by. the exportincome of the nation more than: by any >ther single factor. So, we have a budget vhich. is constructed, around the anticipated income from. wool, selling, at. 40d., iOd.,. or 90d. per lb., and. from wheat, selling at 12s., 18s. or ISs. 6d. a bushel.. Vs these figures are expressed in. terms of Australian, currency, it becomes obvious at: the slightest glance, that if the prices of wool, wheat, meat, fruit and mgar on the export markets fall substantially, the wholestructure of the budget will be immediately wrecked. IstheGovernment absolutely surethat we shall *jo through next year without experiencing a; fall in the prices of our export products?. If members of the Government are confidentof that they comprise the most optimistic group of people in the. world. If , however, they have some, doubts whether this groat national income will be sustained at that level, then the Treasurer knows that his budget estimates may well not be realized. The Treasurer knows, perfectly well that this income,, which has itsgenesis in our -ixnort sales and becomes taxable in hand after hand, is in currency which is depreciated 2.5' per cent, below sterling Within the last few weeksour sistei dominion, New Zealand, which, took concurrent and identical action with Australia in. depreciating its currency, hat brought its currency to paritywith sterling. No one will doubt that if. during next, year, there is an appreciation of Australian currency and, to that degree, a diminution in the figures of our national income, this budget will be completely wrecked. Taken at its facevalutthe budget is an utterly reckless doom ment. It is reckless to propose items of expenditure each one of which is dependent upon the maintenance of our existing scale of export income. For my part 1 do not believe that the Treasurer ha* based his calculations upon that expectation. That brings oe to the real nub of the. matter. If. the right lionorable gentleman has not been so callously negligent as to prepare and present to this Parliament a budget which is utterly dependent on the maintenance of present export values,, upon, what then does he rely'* The whole history of the Chifley administration of the Treasury shows that the right honourable gentleman is relying on secret reserves, and that this budget' cannot be taken at its face value. The budgel is. a faked document, as wereprevious budgets presented, from, the same sourceThe Government's accounts are faked bee cause incometax is not. beingcollected, I have been the recipient of copies of resolutions passed, at meetingsof various branchesof the Australian. Countrj party complaining that many members cannot get assessments of income tax, noi for, last, year only, but for the previous three, years. Is the Chiflej administration of the Treasury sc inept, that theTaxation Branch delays; the issue, of assessments for three or four years?. I do not believe that it is. It is a, part of thepolicv of the: Treasurer not to collect income tai because uncollected, tax represents oneof thesecret reserves upon, which, ha relies to juggle his accounts: So, I do. not take this budget at its face value. It has been demonstrated year after year that the budgets presented by the Treasurer have not reflected the true accounting position. Just as the budgets have been faked in their preparation, so the treasury, boob ;iave been faked in their ultimate accounting. At the end of the financial year r.here is invariably brought into the Parliament some bill designed to "" cook "" the hooks. In 1947, on the eve of the close of the financial year, the Treasurer produced overnight a proposal to make a -rift of £25,000,000 to the United Kingdom. On the same day as that proposal ivas announced the right lionorable gentleman informed us that defence expenditure totalling £18,000,000, which the budget proposed should be met from loan, was to be met from revenue. In that way £43,000,000 was written out of the books almost had not been done, the financial figures for shown that the Treasurer had collected from the people almost £50,000,000 more than he needed to meet his commitments. That is the way in which the Treasurer has "" cooked "" the books. His action was like that of a storekeeper who "" fixes"" his books by writing down the value of bis stock or by failing to send out accounts. Last year exactly the same thing was done. During the closing period of the financial year a proposal was introduced to the Parliament for the provision of funds for supplementary amounting to £30,000,000 when it was obviously physically impossible to expend the money. This was done solely for the purpose of writing £30,000,000 out of the books. According to the figures furnished by the Treasurer the Government closed the books at the end of the last financial year with a surplus of £1,400,000; but if that faking had not been perpetrated the accounts would have disclosed a surplus of approximately £32.000,000. Because this is a part of the planned technique of the Treasurer, I mistrust the whole of the figures contained in the voluminous document now before us. My mistrust of them is substantiated by the experiences of the past. I am not prepared to accept the right honourable gentleman's figures at their face value. What does £30,000,000 or £50,000,000 mean to him? He is so little concerned about millions of pounds that they just flutter around like nobody's business; but pounds do not flutter around the wage earners of this country like nobody's business. The great thing that concerns the majority of the people at this time of the year is the income tax they will becalled upon to pay. Let us look at thefigures relating to income tax to ascertain, whether this document represents a truebill of the finances of the nation. Thanks to the Treasurer we have been provided with a document showing the amounts of income tax to be paid by -people on various scales of income during the present year, and in order thai honourable members shall not fail to realize the generosity of the right honorahle gentleman, we have also been provided with tables showing the overnight. If that comparative tax levied last year and the highest tax imposed during the war years. 1946-47 would have A wage-earner with a wife and two children may now receive an income of £300 a year and pay no tax at all. A wage-earner similarly circumstanced in receipt of an income of £350 a year will be called upon to pay in income tax only £3 15s. a year. That all sounds very good; but these figures are deceptive. The family man is concerned not only witb what he has to pay in income tax bul also with what -may be extracted by the Treasurer from his pay envelope. A close examination of the budget reveals that estimates although there have been progressive reductions of income tax there has been a progressive increase in total income tax collection on a per capita basis. The per capita collections of direct taxation anticipated in this budget-and of course they will be greater than the estimatewill be approximately 25s. higher than the tax collected two years ago. So, even in respect of direct taxation there is not much consolation in this budget. Direct taxation, however, is the impost most apparent to the uninitiated. Like the conjurer who focuses our attention on the coloured ball in one hand while he secretly performs his manipulative work with the other hand, the Treasurer seeks to focus the attention of the people on income tax reductions, hoping that they will -not see how he is fleecing them by way of indirect taxes. That is the practice adopted by the Treasurer. An examination of the budget reveals that the estimated collections of indirect taxes, including customs and excise duties, primage and sales tax, amount to £19 12s. 8£d. for every man,",73,Temporary Chairman Of Waging Atomic Warfare Are Being
168,Mr Mcewen.,"w m a n and child in the whole of Australia. So the fellow on £6 a week who congratulates himself on having no income tax to pay is not expected to realize^ that he has to pay, according to these figures, £19 12s. 8$d. in indirect taxes. The pay-roll tax is a further form of indirect tax. It is nothing but an indirect tax. It is included in the calculations of every employer as a component of his total employment cost and is passed on to the total cost of his product or service. The pay-roll tax works out at an average of £2 6s. 2^d. for every m«n, woman and child in the community. The two figures combined show that every person will be paying on an average £21 38s. l i d . this year. But the person who buys clothing, furniture or other goods does not pay sales tax, excise duty or customs duty directly. They are incorporated in the cost of the goods that he buys. Those taxes are not merely incorporated in the cost of the goods. Sales tax, excise duty and customs duty become a component wholesale cost, and the retailer does not merely add his profit to the manufactured or production cost of the article he sells. He inevitably adds his profit write-up to the production cost plus the added tax costs, except when the Prices Commissioner has been able to prevent his doing so. And prices control has been given away prematurely by the Government. So the Parliament no longer has that control. The rotailer adds his profit to the sales tax, customs duty, excise duty and pay-roll tax, and to the £21 18s. l i d . , to try to delude the people into thinking which is the average per capita indirect tax levied in Australia under this budget, must be added the average retailer's write-up, which, I am told, ie 33^ per cent. Therefore £7 6s. 4d. a head a year must be added, and, although the Government does not get that money, it is a burden placed on the consumer as a direct result of the Government's policy. That brings the total per capita liability under this budget on these calculations to £29 5s. 3d. a year. But the tax-gatherer has not finished with the consumer who, because he goes to the pictures, the football and, sometimes, the races, has to pay entertainment tax. Every man, woman and child is charged an average of 13 s. 4-Jd. a year in entertainments tax. That brings his total obligation tc £29 18s. 7Jd. a year. Bur. the Government, of course, recognizes that we do not all travel as individuals. This community is made up of married people and families. The table issued by tbe Government shows what a married man with two children will be required to pay in direct income tax; but he will pay. when he buys furniture, blankets, food or whatever he buys, the total of £29 18s. 7£d. multiplied by tbe four members of his family, which means that, under this "" generous "" budget, that taxpayer, out of his £300 a year, will have to pay £119 14s. 5d. in indirect taxes. He will pay it painlessly because he will not know that he is paying it. That is noi the end of it. budget. about whether it is new or old. We have become accustomed to it. I know that the sales tax was introduced by the Scullin Government of which the honourable gentleman was a member. If that is the point that he is trying to make, ] help him to make it. make out that it is new. But it is involved in the budget. It is of no use because a document like this is pushed on to them that a man on £6 a week with two children will not pay any tax. I am removing the misleading intention of the document by pointing out the actual tax burden that he will have to bear. But that is not the end of it, either, because the Government imposed an extraordinarily high sales tax on building material for years, and that became a part of the capital cost of thousands upon thousands of homes in Australia. Many people on lower incomes are paying from os. to 10s. a week more rent than they should have to pay because Mr Chifley's budgets have imposed sales tax of up to 25 per cent, upon building materials and, to that degree, added in perpetuity to the capital cost of homes.",75,Temporary Chairman Of Waging Atomic Warfare Are Being

181,Mr Mcewen,"No. I said that itcontinue subsidies, because= some of tbem are continued in the budget. The truth is; of course, that the unscrupulous methods of Government propaganda in the referendum led the Prime Minister to issue the threat to abolish subsidies. aaid, in effect, "" If you do not vote for our referendum proposals you will lose the subsidies "". The result of the referendum is history. What the people did to the referendum proposals is nobody's business, and the Prime Minister was caught in the mesh of his own threatening words. As he could not allow himself to be made out to be an absolute liar, he had to provide in his budget for the abolition of subsidies. If it were constitutionally necessary to abolish subsidies, why were they not all abolished? that some subsidies have been retained, proves that the Government was under no constitutional obligation to discontinue any of them. The increased cost of blankets, milk, &c, will fall upon the workers as the direct result of a political threat issued by the Prime Minister: during tlie referendum campaign. When we add the burden of indirect taxation to the increased, burden which the workers will have to bear because of the withdrawal of subsidies, it becomes evident that this budget deals a heavier blow to the purchasing power of the workers than was dealt by any other budget since federation. I should like to hear some one try to prove a contrary contention. The Treasurer referred in his budget speech to the dollar shortage. Speaking on this subject six months ago, I said that, unless we were prepared to believe that the volume of our trade with dollar areas was to remain static, we should regard the present acute dollar shortage as merely a passing phase. If a man encounters a financial crisis in hisbusiness affairs, he can, if his business is sound, overcome his difficulties by borrowing. Australia should meet the present dollar crisis in the same way. Instead of doing this, however, the Government is penalizing the community, depressing living standards, retarding production and restricting transport by its pig-headed refusal to accept, a dollar loan. It has even carried its obstinacyto thepoint of exercisingits. authority to prevent private persons and companies from bor rowing in order to finance constructive enterprises. If , in return for whai tbey gave away at international trad*conferences in Geneva and elsewhere. Australia's representatives did notexpeci that we should ultimately be able to sell more in dollar areas, and be in a position to liquidate a dollar loan if one were raised, then Australia was, indeed, "" sold down the river "". If , however, we shall be able, as the result of international trade agreements, to increase our trade with dollar areas, there can be no reason whj we should not seek relief from the present emergency by raising a dollar loan. 1 voiced that opinion in this House sii months ago; and I am still of the sam» opinion. I offered my suggestion as a The fact layman, and I am gratified to observe that it has heen taken up and supported hy those who are better qualified technically than I am to express an opinion on the subject: Works and Housing) [10.7] -Member* of the Opposition have used strange and conflicting terms to describe the presenl budget. In my opinion, it is a sound budget-so sound, indeed, that members of the Opposition have become "" rattled "". and have been unable to attack it effectively. The honourable member for Indi it was a faked budget, and the Leader of the Australian Country party ( Mr Fadden) described it as an ultra conservative document. On the other hand, the honourable member for Wakedirector of Elder, Smith and Company Limited, one of the largest wool-broking firms in Australia, and, I believe, one of the best, said that this was very much tht kind of budget which his own party would have nroduced if it had been in power. As a matter of fact, I believe thai the Opposition's real objection to the budget is that it is too good. They have declared that it is an election budget. I hope that it will be possible to bring down some more budgets of the same kind.

That: ment has, in the words of the Scriptures, given "" here a little, there a little"". When we recall the difncult times through which Australia has passed, when we observe the turmoil that exists in many countries, and when we see the poverty and other people have to contend, we should be thankful that the Commonwealth has had a Treasurer who, during and since the war, has been able to bring down a succession of budgets providing for the continued financial stability of the nation. In this budget, he has provided for present needs and for future -iontingencies. He has put aside an amount of £23,400,000 with which to pay war gratuities which may fall due at a time when prices for wool, wheat and meat may be lower, and our overseas balances may be reduced. It would be very awkward for some future Treasurer, in such circumstances, to be called upon to wealth Treasury. No Commonwealth. find £70,000,000 for the payment of war gratuities. Very properly, the Treamrer, now that the national income is high and our finances are buoyant, has made provision to meet future obligations. He could have taken the easy political way. He could have framed a popular budget designed to catch votes at rhe next election, but, instead of doing that, he has provided for the future as well as for the present. That method of finance is completely sound, and is indicative of the whole financial policy which the Treasurer has followed since he took office. The honourable member for Indi stated that the Prime Minister( Mr Chifley) had threatened the people before the last referendum that if they did not vote in favour of the Government's proposals, he would withdraw the subsidies on many items. That statement is entirely incorrect. able member for Bendigo( Mr Eankin) that the Prime Minister and other -supporters of the Government said with complete honesty, that if the Commonwealth did not possess power to -ontrol prices, it would not allow the States to determine the amount of the subof the subsidy on superphosphate. Thfsituation would be equivalent to a citizen, saying to bis next-door neighbour, "" Youmay write a cheque for an undisclosed^ amount on my account"". The Commonwealth would have been compelled to say to the States, "" Y o u determine the priceinsecurity with which of the articles, and write a cheque for therequired amount on the Commonwealth Treasury "". foreign governments. sible government place itself in the position which I have described? attaches conditions to the grants that i r makes to the States. member for Warringah ( Mr Spender) was Treasurer, he did not allow theS tates to write cheques on the CommonTreasurer, who is responsible for collecting income tax and other taxes, couldallow the States to write cheques on the Commonwealth Treasury to meet the cost of subsidies.

The Government announced that if the referendum were defeated, it would endeavour to continue the payment of subsidies on goods when it waiadministratively possible for it to do so. That promise has been honoured. Eor example, tea is imported in bulk consignments, and the cost of putting it intopackets is so small that the Government was able to say that it was administratively possible to continue the subsidy on that commodity. A similar position existed with butter.

For the reasons which I have given, I contend that the Government has honoured the promises which it made to the people during the referendum campaign. I shall now examine the statement by che honourable meniber for Indi that Australia should borrow abroad in order to meet its dollar deficits. Australia was placed in a most difficult position during the financial and economic depression in the early 1930's because of its inability to meet interest payments on overseas debts. The honourable member for Reid( Mr Lang), who was Premier of New South Wales at that time, was dismissed from office because the State Government would not pay interest on its overseas commitments until the people enjoyed certain conditions. The obligation to meet interest . payments on overseas debts threw Australia into the depths of the economic depression. The honourable member for [ndi advocates a return to the policy of borrow, boom and burst. The Bruce-Page Government borrowed heavily from the financiers in Threadneedle-street, London, until Sir Otto Niemeyer said that Australia's capacity to pay interest on oversea loans had heen exhausted, and that British financiers were no longer prepared to make additional loans to this country. What happened then? The Bruce-Page Government proceeded to raise loans in New York at 5 per cent. When no more money was available at that rate, they mortgaged this country at 6 per cent, and finally at 7 per cent. interest rate at 7 per cent, were raised in America by the Queensland Government, led by the late Mr T. J. Byan. ber for Indi again advocates that Australia should put itself into bond so that our children and our children's children shall be in debt, and shall be obliged to pay tribute to foreign bond-holders. While I remain a member of the House of Representatives,.and Australia enjoys a condition of prosperity, I shall noi allow to pass unchallenged any proposal to foreign bond-holders. The Treasurer believes that we must live within our own income. That policy is sound, and i i will be appreciated by future generations. More than 90 per cent, of the articles required for houses were exempted from sales tax last year, but the honourable member for Indi complained that the retention of sales tax at the rate of 25 per cent, on certain items for building purposes increased the repayment on an ordinary dwelling by 10s. a week. 1 admit that the sales tax must increase the repayment, but the honorahle member's statement that the increase is 10s. a week is fantastic. At the most, the amount of the increase is not more than 2s. a week. In respect of a great majority of houses, it is not more than sixpence a week. The sales tax was introduced by a government which the honourable member supported. The Scullin Government introduced the sales tax. ber has said that the budget is » false one because it is founded on the assumption that the present high prices for wool, wheat, meat and other expon commodities will continue. I invite the honourable member to consider what the position of this country would be if we were obliged to pay interest on overseas loans at a time when the prices of OUT wool, wheat and meat were low. If Australia is not in a position to pay its way in the present period of prosperity, it will never be able to do so. The policy which the Treasurer has adopted is sound and logical. Some members of the Opposition have complained that because of the increased prices of houses, workers will never be able to purchase their own homes. 1 do not propose to cover the sad history of some workers who endeavoured to provide shelter for their families when anti-Labour governments were in office. Naturally, I deeply regret the considerable increase of the cost of constructing houses.

216,Mr Davidson Asked The Minister T W,"0. Will he also discuss with the Treasurer the newspaper's allegations regarding the large amount of dollars soi'iie' of those persons took out of Australia, and make a statement to the House on the matter? honourable member's questions are as follows:1. The Brisbane woman referred to was granted an Australian passport valid for the United States and all British countries in March, 1946. She was, therefore, given all the facilities within the jurisdiction of my department. The Commonwealth Government has no -lontrol whatever over the grant of vises for entry into the United States and this is solely * matter for determination by the American mithorities. 2. As the names of the notorious underworld character and the notorious female have not been given, I am unable to say wliether or not tliey were granted passports. If their names are furnished I will arrange for inquiries to be made into the circumstances of their --a ses. 3. A Mrs. Matilda May Parsons, known as ' T ill y Devine"", was granted a passport in Uigust, 1948, to enable her to visit the United Kingdom. 4. The Passports Act was not designed, and has never been administered, as a measure to restrict the movement of persons because tliey may be of doubtful morals, and, as a matter of -act, it is not necessary thnt a person shall hold H passport to leave Australia. In normal times passports are refused only in exceptional circumstances, such as where it is known that a person is seeking to avoid criminal proceedings, or where it is evident tliat it would not *ie in an applicant's own interests to grant a passport. 5. The Treasurer advises that he has no information of persons taking out dollar funds in excess of sums approved under Exchange Control, but if details of the alleged contraventions are furnished they w ill be investigated. senting the Minister for Trade and Customs, upon notice1. How many Communist publications printed iu Australia are (a) circulated within the Commonwealth, and (b) circulated outside Uistralia, and how many printed outside Australia are circulated within the Commonwealth? 2. What is the estimated amount of newsprint required annually for matter published in Australia by the Communist party? and Customs has supplied the following (6) Crude Oilinformation:1. The information sought by the honorahle member is not available.

There are five'Communist newspapers at present being produced in Australia with an annual usage of under 200 tons ot paper. All of these are circulated within tinCommonwealth and there would be no obstaclt as far as controls in Australia are concerned to their being circulated outside Australia also The number of Communist publications printed outside Australia and circulated witliin tin Commonwealth is not known. In this con nexion the Minister has advised that mam periodicals from non-sterling 'areas imported on individual subscriptions, and all publica tions from sterling areas, are exempt from import licensing, and in any case they are noi examined by the Department of Trade and Customs to determine their political affiliation^ 2.

Information on the coBt of dollars, sterling and other currencies is not available in thc form requested. duction Britain-controlled sources is not sufficient so meet sterling area consumption and che sterling area as a whole is a net importer of dollar petroleum products. For this reason a l l petroleum imports into Auslralia must be regarded as involving a dollar,iomm,itment, irrespective of the source of 'upply. If Australia increases its purchases of .terling petroleum products the quantity available for purchase by other sterling area countries is correspondingly reduced aud they necessarily have to obtain a greater proportion of their requirements from dollar sources. Be-nuse nf this position no attempt is mode to divert Australian imports of petroleum products from dollar to sterling sources and, in Quantity.
