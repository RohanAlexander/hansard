That is not to say that it with on this occasion is that there ought to be a does not take notice of those complaints. There is process whereby a parliamentary committee has ample evidence of the fact that the ABC does try the opportunity to vet proposed appointments to at the operational level to be responsive to the the ABC.

Most other government bodies exist to plaints are likely to be received in relation to the implement or design policies which the Governoperation of the ABC. In the first case there might ment wants to develop or implement. Therefore, be the complaint that individuals are unfairly the members of those bodies ought to be people treated by the ABC.

He made a comdifferent. The Opposition's proposal involves setplaint to the Ombudsman about what he thought ting up the committee.

It is proposed by the GovernThe Dix Committee was of the view that the ment that there be established an Office of ComOmbudsman did have the authority to investigate missioner for Complaints. We find this an these kinds of complaints and simply left it at objectionable innovation. It was not suggested by that. It has now transpired as a result of the in the Dix Committee, and indeed it is unclear where stance that I referred to a moment ago concerning the proposal really came from. There is some the Principal of the Perth Technical College that a great dispute is raging between the Ombudsman somebody appointed to act as a sort of witch and the ABC about whether the Ombudsman hunter for any pro-socialist' views, as he put it, does have powers to deal with such matters. The within the ABC. It was an outrageous suggestion ABC for its part contends that the complaint, at the time that there was that sort of bias within which has been referred to the Ombudsman and the ABC, but there will always be complaints of which the Ombudsman is trying to pursue, is one bias. We are often complaining about the bias which relates to programming and therefore is not within the rural programs of the ABC, but to one with which the Ombudsman should properly suggest that it can be sorted out in this way, by deal. The Ombudsman has tried to clarify his role having a political monitor of the activities of the in his 1980 report in which he says: ABC, is outrageous. That is the role which ought I cannot review programming decisions made by the Comto be performed by the Board of the ABC itself.

For that reason I will be moving of some person. amendments dealing with that point in the Committee stage. There are other matters on which I I think the Ombudsman is perfectly right-in that will be moving amendments but I will leave my restatement. We believe that he ought to have the marks until the Committee stage. authority to investigate not the detailed matters of not the quality of the material that is being broadOrder!
