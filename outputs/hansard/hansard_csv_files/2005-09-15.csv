An’ when I’ve left the driver’s seat, An’ handed in me plates, I’ll tell ol’ Peter at the door I’ve come to join me “Mates”. David Hopkins did bombardment in the Pacific, from the Battle of the Coral Sea to the Philippines. He lost a lot of mates during the Philippines campaign and said that you do not know the feeling until you lose a mate. He read about a prisoner of war on the Burma railway, about his mate, and that was the poem I just read. The reason why I read that is that there was a kerfuffle recently about whether the word ‘mate’ should be used by attendants. Of course it should be. It is part of our lexicon; it is part of our Australian history. It is something we should be proud of. The diggers are the greatest personification of mates. Many mates were lost during the war; people lost their lives protecting their mates. SoI thought it was appropriate to read what David Hopkins had to say. It might be a message to those of the politically correct class to leave the word ‘mate’ alone. It is best used in as many circumstances as it can be. I commend to the House the poem that David Hopkins read out. Medicare: Bulk-billing Banks, Mr Deputy Speaker. It was not long ago that my electorate of Hinkler languished near the bottom of the national bulk-billing rate, but that trend has been reversed in the past year or so-not only have Hinkler’s bulk-billing rates steadily improved but we are now one of the best performing electorates in the nation. The latest bulk-billing figures, covering the 12 months from June 2003-04 to June 2004-05, show a dramatic increase from 52.6 to 66.8-in other words, two-thirds of all people in my electorate can now be bulk-billed. It was the biggest percentage increase of any Queensland electorate and more than double the state average of 6.1. We have beaten many urban seats in lifting our bulk-billing services, and even though we are still slightly behind the state average, we are forging ahead in giving people access to bulk-billing services. This has been a steady trend over time. The electorate’s bulk-billing rates went from 47.7 to 60.5 between the December quarters of 2003 and 2004. It grew again in the next six months to reach a bulk-billing rate of 66.8 in the June quarter of this year. I have worked hard to make sure that Hinkler gets a fair share of doctors. This has been helped enormously by the coalition’s bulk-billing incentive payments and my concentration on areas of work force need. The new structure for GPs, which gives doctors an extra $5.10 or $7.65 for servicing concession card holders and children under 16, has been a real incentive. The consequence of this policy has been that people have more choice and opportunity to bulk-bill. In turn it has contributed to Australia’s bulk-billing rate reaching almost 75 per cent. In fact, in the last quarterly figures two new records were set: firstly, the bulk-billing rate is now 69 per cent in country areas, which our political opponents said would never happen, and, secondly, 81.8 per cent of children are now bulk-billed. That is interesting, isn’t it? Five out of every six kids are now bulk-billed. Ms Hall-Not in Shortland! MAIN COMMITTEE",127,Statements By Members
280,Mr Neville (Hinkler) (9.33 Am),"That was a very good contribution by the member forwith it. These outstanding results fly in the face of the gloom and doom that was predicted by Labor about bulk-billing. In fact, all Labor and Independent held seats in QueenslandCapricornia, Brisbane, Rankin, Oxley, Griffith, Lilley and Kennedy-have experienced increases in their bulk-billing rates. I think it is a very important issue and something we should keep under review, giving Australians a choice of bulk-billing and other services. Fuel Prices tralia people are talking about the rising price of fuel and the impact this is having on their way of life. Everybody has a view as to what should be done about it. People say things like, ‘Cut taxes,’ ‘Improve public transport’ and ‘Put more investment in alternative fuel sources.’ These are just a few of the suggestions doing the rounds at the moment, but the Prime Minister’s ostrich plan is the most astonishing response to the issue to date. His idea to bury his head in the sand and do absolutely nothing about the price of fuel defies belief. I am sure the so-called battlers who are out there in the suburbs are not making whoopee this morning at the news that the PM plans to do nothing. Astonishing as it sounds, this demonstrates just how out of touch the government have become. It demonstrates that they are more interested in pursuing their radical and extreme ideological agendas than in doing anything meaningful and constructive to improve the lives of those who at the last election placed their trust and confidence in the Prime Minister to lead this nation. Instead, all he has done is lead them down the garden path. For the Prime Minister to suggest that he can do nothing to help the lives of ordinary Australians is an insult to the electorate’s intelligence. There is a lot the Prime Minister can do, and the vital first step is to conjure up the courage to confront the problem-to acknowledge it, not to wash your hands of the issue. Labor and Kim Beazley put the Prime Minister on notice over petrol prices in June and put forward a plan to tackle the issue, including such things as applying the competition blowtorch to the industry by strengthening the Trade Practices Act to prevent abuse of market power; having the ACCC investigate petrol prices and report every six months on price movements, particularly in regional Australia; modernising the 25year-old regulatory regime for the petrol sector to promote competition and protect independent service station operators and franchisees; reducing our reliance on imported oil; growing an Australian fuel industry; and providing a real future for the biofuels industry by providing a government fleet market for ethanol blends to set an example and help grow the industry. These are just a few of the positive steps that the government could be taking. The Prime Minister could reduce the pressure on families, could take positive steps forward to do something. It would certainly be better than saying and doing nothing and blaming everybody else. When will the Prime Minister wake up? Australian motorists see the significant price fluctuations week to week and cannot figure out why or how it works. We see wild variations in prices from suburb to suburb that have no reason or common sense. Everybody understands this. Even the ACCC chairman has acknowledged that something funny is going on. John Howard and the government have had nine long years to come up with a plan to address petrol prices and they have done nothing. There is also the issue of the condition of our roads and national highways and the impact that has on our vehicles and the use of fuel, and the issue of public transport.

(Time expired) Victory in the Pacific Day that I had in commemoration of Victory in the Pacific Day on 15 August. I was fortunate to have the opportunity to host a function at the newly built Gold Coast Convention and Exhibition Centre. More than 300 people in my electorate attended the two-hour ceremony, during which I had the opportunity to present commemorative medallions to more than 60 World War II veterans, both men and women, to mark the 60th anniversary of Victory in the Pacific Day. That day, 15 August 1945, was a defining moment in history; it was the day that Japan surrendered to allied forces, ending World War II, which had raged for almost six years. Some 60 years later, on 15 August 2005, it was indeed my great honour and pleasure to join Australian service men and women in celebrating this very significant anniversary. Army, Navy and Air Force cadets ably assisted on the day, and they came from TS Southport, the 222 Squadron and the TSS School Army Cadet Unit, who opened the function with an excellent drill routine and paid their respects to the veterans assembled on the day. This was followed by the Australian national anthem, performed by the Gold Coast brass band. I must pay special tribute to those who fought in World War II and to the acknowledgment of and connection to today’s military that came from the presence of Lieutenant Colonel Iain Cruickshank, who travelled to the Gold Coast from Brisbane to be the keynote speaker on the day. Lieutenant Colonel Cruickshank, as guest speaker, made an outstanding contribution, assessing then and now the differences between the Army as it had been traditionally and the Army as it is today. Lieutenant Colonel Cruickshank has recently returned from the Middle East, where he was the commanding officer of the 1st Australian Army Training Team in Iraq. He has also seen operational service in South-East Asia, Lebanon and East Timor. He was awarded the Conspicuous Service Cross for the role he played in the SO1 operations during the evacuations of the Solomon Islands in 2000. It was a delight to see the faces of veterans and their families light up during the speech by Lieutenant Colonel Cruickshank as he compared the then and now. It was indeed an excellent moment. It is amazing to consider how far weapons have come over the years and the level of training that is now available to those in the defence forces. It makes what I do worthwhile just to go that extra mile to say thank you to the ex-service men and women and to have provided this function as a small way to remember the great sacrifices that were made. We can certainly never repay our veterans. I would like to particularly thank all those veterans and their families who came along. I thank the Department of Veterans’ Affairs and I also acknowledge John-Paul Langbroek, the state Liberal member for Surfers Paradise, who was master of ceremonies. The men and women from the generation of World War II paid the ultimate sacrifice in many respects, and to those assembled on the day I think it is important that we say thank you.

284,Mr Georganas (Hindmarsh) (9.42 Am),"Crime and community safety is a big conurbs without fear. Quality policing is one obvious solution, but more can be done to prevent crime and make communities safer. Some of the most effective strategies can be implemented by local governments. Good urban planning and quick response times to graffiti can make a community feel much safer. In the city of Gosnells, in Western Australia, the Safe City Initiative has led to the creation of a series of community safety strategies. The cornerstone of these strategies is the Safe City Urban Design Strategy. Research showed that some perceptions about what were safe areas and what were dangerous areas within a city were not borne out in statistics. People often feel that quiet streets are nice and safe, but areas that are active are safer because of what is called ‘natural surveillance’-that is, the fact that neighbours look out for one another and that, if you go for a walk at night, you know that you will pass other people on the street and you will feel more safe. From these statistics, it has become clear that the challenge is to create an environment in which people feel okay about wandering outside. Level pavements, decent street lighting and open spaces and parks in which people can congregate become more important, not just because these things help to create a better sense of community but also because they help to reduce criminal activity. As well as fostering significant improvements in urban planning approaches, the initiative has implemented a Safer Seniors program to help elderly residents develop personal safety strategies and to increase their awareness about safety. Likewise, a safety strategy for people with disabilities is being developed. There is a ‘Dob in a Hoon’ campaign to help police apprehend speeding and unsafe drivers, which has also been implemented in South Australia. As well, there is a full-time team of graffiti busters who remove graffiti within 24 hours of being advised it is there. There is research that suggests that such prompt removal is a disincentive to so-called graffiti artists. The main reason for their tagging is so that their peers can see what they have done, so a quick response takes the thrill out of it. As a result, there have been decreases in recorded crime: residential burglary down by seven per cent, property damage down by 12 per cent and drug offences down by 15 per cent. So the city of Gosnells is a great success story. I can think of several councils in the electorate of Hindmarsh which would be delighted to implement a similar project. Unfortunately, that is where the federal government comes in. Funding to local government in total has dropped substantially as a proportion of Commonwealth taxation revenue. As the city of Gosnells has demonstrated, a huge difference can be made to crime rates by local councils through urban planning, but local government cannot make changes on their own. Support from the federal government is essential if such a program is to be implemented by councils around the country. We need to assist our communities to feel safer, to create better communities where people do not feel afraid to leave their homes. This can only be done with the assistance of local government, state government and federal government. (Time expired) Health: Diabetes suffer from diabetes, a serious disease in Australia. Diabetes is a chronic disease, characterised by high blood glucose levels resulting from the body not producing insulin or not using it properly. There are two main types of diabetes.

285,Mr Fawcett (Wakefield) (9.46 Am),"I rise today to speak in support of people whoexcessive thirst and urination, unexplained weight loss, weakness, fatigue and irritability. Diabetes is Australia’s fastest growing chronic disease and is the seventh highest cause of death in Australia. It has some extreme complications-for example, 3,000 amputations for people with diabetes, most of which were preventable. Some 520,000 Australians have been diagnosed with diabetes but it is estimated that for every person diagnosed there is another person who has it but is unaware. This would mean there are well over one million Australians with diabetes, with some 80,000 South Australians known to have diabetes. Treatment is needed to prevent some of the bad health outcomes for people who have diabetes. Treatment is a lifelong course of insulin injections-every day-regular blood glucose level tests, healthy eating and regular physical activity. The injections and tests require a large commitment by sufferers to ensure they access the appropriate kits and the supplies they need. Where those supplies are not commonly available, it takes a large commitment to get them. If we are committed to the health care of people in Australia, we need to make sure that kits are available in appropriately located areas. In the electorate of Wakefield, north of Adelaide, a large number of people suffer from diabetes-from Gawler through to the edge of the Barossa Valley, in the Clare Valley, the mid-north in Virginia and Two Wells. Many people use the township of Gawler as a regional services hub. There is sufficient demand there to justify the establishment of an additional diabetes product supply outlet to service people in the outer metropolitan area and the country areas to the north of Adelaide. I have written to the management of Diabetes SA expressing my support for a subagency in Gawler. I am pleased this week to have tabled in the parliament of Australia a petition in support of a Gawler outlet signed by 2,861 people in the electorate of Wakefield. I call upon Diabetes SA to make a priority locating an outlet in the town of Gawler to serve these people. Education: Student Fees Ms MACKLIN (Jagajaga) (9.49 am)-The Howard government’s legislation which seeks to ban the collection of universal student services and amenities fees has galvanised the opposition, which comes from a vast majority of the higher education community and the general public. Students themselves have expressed their strong opposition to this legislation. In their thousands they have demanded that they be permitted to continue to financially support the provision of vital services: counselling, health and welfare, representation and advocacy, sport and recreation, employment, legal assistance, child-care places, clubs and societies, and so the list goes on. Everyone from vice-chancellors, regional communities, business leaders, sporting and arts communities and, of course, members of the coalition’s backbench want Mr Howard to drop his extreme attack on student services. Students at the St Patrick campus of the Australian Catholic University decided to test the opinions of their fellow students on this extreme anti student services legislation. A petition was circulated to students and the completed petition was sent to me to table in the House. Unfortunately, the petition does not conform to the required format, so I wanted to take the opportunity to draw attention to it today and to congratulate the students for their efforts. This is a relatively small campus but 900 students signed a petition which contained the request that the government and/or the Senate categorically reject all anti student organisation legislation. The students pointed out: ... this legislation is not necessary and will significantly detract from the quality of university life. At our own universityMAIN COMMITTEE the Australian Catholic Universitywe take great pride in providing a caring and supported educational environment. The petitioners further stressed that these features would ‘disappear if you allow this legislation to be ratified’. But the Minister for Education, Science and Training, Brendan Nelson, and the Howard government have been totally deaf to the determined and united pleas from the higher education sector, and those outside, that this legislation would be extraordinarily damaging to the interests of our universities and our students. The response by the education minister to these pleas has been to remain adamant that he will not budge an inch from the very hardline attitude that he has adopted on this issue. He continues to be uncompromisingly ideological. In the Labor Party we have heard the voices of students and members of the university community. We would make sure that services on our university campuses continue. That is why we will press our amendment in the Senate. (Time expired) Telecommunication Technologies Miss JACKIE KELLY (Lindsay) (9.52 am)-On this historic day when the bill for the sale of Telstra has passed from the Senate back to our House, I am very fortunate to have the opportunity to extend the comments I made on that bill. I referred in my speech to a report from Ericsson on the technologies available, and I would like to expand on that, if I can, in the time allotted to me today. The technology option I was speaking about was dial-up on copper. Dial-up on copper allows 56 kilobits per second, at best, if within two to four kilometres of the exchange. But often this is much less in rural areas, so you get something like 2.4 kilobits per second on long lines or lines with pair gains. This type of technology is sensitive to interference from electronic fences et cetera. It is basically used for low-speed internet only. Satellite technology shares approximately 40 megabits per second across all national users. Satellite technology has capacity problems. It is incredibly expensive. You have to put the pieces in place and get a bandwidth-and you pay for that. The fewer customers you have, the more expensive it is. Also, the more users you have, the more downgrading you get in capacity. It provides up to 800 kilobits per second to the subscriber and up to 128 kilobits per second from the subscriber. It is basically for fast internet use only. Satellite technology has some high latency in telephony because, let us face it, it has to go fair up into the sky and back again. Those latency issues are not going to be removed, and it is expensive even though subsidised for remote and some rural services.

(Time expired) Workplace Relations tralians currently receiving welfare payments under this government’s extreme agenda. Surprisingly, in this case I am not referring to the bungled attempt to implement the Welfare to Work program that is more aptly described as the welfare to lower welfare program. I am concerned about the impact that the government’s industrial relations agenda may have on pensioners. Some members may wonder why I would be concerned for the future income security of the most vulnerable in our society when considered through the prism of the industrial relations changes. They may wonder what impact slashing wages and working conditions will have on people receiving age, single parent, disability support, war widows and service pensions. Those among us who are not so out of touch with our constituents will know exactly how the government’s industrial relations obsession may well affect pensioners. Many pensions and other social security payments are benchmarked to 25 per cent of male total average weekly earnings. This means that movements in the wages of working Australians flow on to pensions. This, of course, means that the wage impact of the industrial relations changes will also flow on to pensioners. Government members opposite may scoff at this suggestion and claim that it could not possibly be the case, but they would be wrong on this occasion. Over recent years Australian pension recipients have experienced increases in their pensions at rates higher than the growth of inflation because of real wage growth. Sadly, it is not to the full extent of the much claimed but largely unproven 14 per cent increase that the Prime Minister crows about-but, then again, very few of us have experienced such growth. Future increases in payments to 40,000 pensioners in the south-west of Sydney are at risk because of the government’s extreme industrial relations agenda. More than 22,000 of those live in my electorate. I know this government cares little about the plight of Australian workers and Australian families, but I would have thought it would be willing to leave the poor and the elderly alone. The government’s extreme, unnecessary and unfair industrial relations agenda has managed to produce another set of victims. It is not enough that the government has unionists, building and construction workers and university staff in its sights; now, in a nasty side effect of its so-called reforms, those least able to afford it will also face real cuts to their incomes. While elderly and retired Australians are concerned for the working conditions of their children and grandchildren, they should now start worrying about their own financial futures.

They have destroyed that vista of coastline for at least the next 25 years. These seven unproductive wind turbines were put right on the coast by the vandalism of the Bracks government. They have stolen this pristine area of Gippsland, raping the landscape and denying generations of the future the beauty and benefit that I have had. The Bracks government have vandalised the South Gippsland coast, and I will do everything in my power to stop any further wind turbines going into that area of South Gippsland. 193 the time for members’ statements has concluded. Debate resumed from 6 September. Second Reading That this bill be now read a second time. The purpose of the Defence Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2005 is to make a number of minor amendments to four pieces of Defence portfolio legislation: the Defence Force Discipline Act 1982, the Military Superannuation and Benefits Act 1991, the Defence Act 1903 and the Naval Defence Act 1910. The Defence Force Discipline Act 1982, the DFDA, is amended to redefine which laws form ‘territory offences’ under that act as a result of changes in the criminal law of the Australian Capital Territory. These amendments are considered essential to ensure that this act continues to reflect the range of offences originally intended for its operation. The scope of these offences has been severely limited in recent times by changes to the laws that are referred to in the act. The DFDA imports civil criminal offences into that act as service offences in order to extend the ambit of the act to circumstances that might otherwise not be prosecuted and to give greater efficacy to disciplinary law. The mechanism currently used to achieve this is the incorporation of the laws of the Commonwealth, the ACT Crimes Act 1900 and the ACT Police Offences Act 1930 as they apply in the Jervis Bay Territory. Since the introduction of the territory offence provisions, changes have occurred to the incorporated legislation such that some updating of the DFDA is essential. Most concerning is that the ACT in 2001 and 2002 enacted Criminal Code legislation based on the Commonwealth Model Criminal Code, and since 2002 it has repealed numerous offences from its Crimes Act in favour of the Criminal Code. The net effect of this is that offences such as computer theft, arson and blackmail can no longer be prosecuted by the Australian Defence Force under the DFDA. Furthermore, it is anticipated that offences such as murder, manslaughter and assault will also move to the Criminal Code by the end of 2005. Also of concern is the fact that the Police Offences Act was repealed in 1996, and references to it are therefore ineffective. The proposed bill will remove redundant legislation references and refer instead to the criminal law in force in the Jervis Bay Territory from time to time. MAIN COMMITTEE",134,Statements By Members
288,The Deputy Speaker (Hon. Ir Causley),Order! In accordance with standing order,135,Defence Legislation Amendment Bill No 1 2005
289,Mrs Deanne Kelly (Dawson,"Minister for Veterans’ Affairs) (10.01 am)-I move:The Military Superannuation and Benefits Act 1991, known as the benefits act, is to be amended to repeal part 8 so as to remove the retention benefit currently available for certain Australian Defence Force members of the benefits scheme. Part8 of the benefits act currently provides a bonus of one year’s salary to eligible members of the Military Superannuation and Benefits Scheme who, on reaching 15 years of continuous effective service, agree to complete a further five years service. The Review of Australian Defence Force Remuneration 2001, the Nunn review, considered that issues of attraction to, and retention in, the services would be better suited for determination by the Navy, Army and Air Force service chiefs based on priority needs and linked to capability. An automatic retention bonus rigidly tied up to a number of years of service, at a fixed rate, is no longer regarded as appropriate. Despite the repeal of part 8 of the benefits act, it is proposed that access to the retention benefit would continue for current members for as long as they remain eligible but would not be available to new members joining the ADF after the date of the commencement of the proposed amendments. These amendments are required to ensure that ADF pay arrangements provide an effective, efficient and flexible remuneration framework that is consistent with reforms in the wider public and private sectors. Thirdly, the Defence Act 1903 is amended to change references from ‘investigating officers’ to ‘inquiry officers’ to make it clear that these officers are conducting purely administrative rather than criminal investigations. This amendment is an administrative amendment that is required to improve administration of military justice. The term ‘investigating officer’ appears in both the Defence Act and the DFDA, but has different meanings in each act. The role of an investigating officer as referred to in the Defence Act is to conduct an administrative inquiry into matters affecting the ADF. However, some ADF members believe that officers are conducting criminal investigations because of the use of the words ‘investigating officers’. To remove this confusion, it is considered appropriate to change references in the Defence Act from ‘investigating officers’ to ‘inquiry officers’ to make it clear that these officers are conducting purely administrative investigations. The fourth act to be amended by this bill, the Naval Defence Act 1910, is amended to align the legislation governing eligible ages of Navy cadets with the legislation governing their Army and Air Force counterparts. The alignment of the various laws dealing with ADF cadets to provide more consistency between the respective services is long overdue. The amendment to the Naval Defence Act will provide a uniform maximum entry age of 20 years for acceptance into the ADF cadets and will provide for a person to cease being a cadet at the age of 21 years or such lower age as is prescribed under the regulations. Finally, this bill also contains provisions amending various Defence administrative legislation resulting from the commencement of the Legislative Instruments Act 2003 and the Legislative Instruments (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Act 2003. These are technical housekeeping amendments to remove redundant references to the Statutory Rules Publication Act 1903 and repealed provisions of the Acts Interpretation Act 1900. These amendments do not in any way affect the operation of the Defence legislation referred to in the bill. I present the explanatory memorandum to the bill. MAIN COMMITTEE tion Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2005. The bill makes a number of amendments to Defence legislation, principally dealing with personnel matters, as outlined by the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs. I will not detail the key amendments, but I will note them for the purpose of argument. First, an amendment is proposed to the Defence Force Discipline Act to update its provisions for the inclusion of amendments to the ACT Criminal Code. Second, an amendment is proposed to bring the age limits of Naval cadets, as set out in the Naval Defence Act, into line with those for the Army and the Air Force. Third, it makes some minor technical changes to the terminology of investigating officers and to references to remove some redundant provisions in respect of legislative instruments legislation. Fourth, it removes the current superannuation retention bonus for those who opt to sign up for another five years after 15 years of service. In large part, these are relatively non-controversial matters, but they have implications for current policy, and that is the issue that I will focus on primarily. The policies most relevant are those concerning military justice, recruitment and retention. TodayI want to make some detailed references to those issues. The first amendment, for all intents and purposes, is simply intended to keep the Defence Force Discipline Act up to date. Because the act imports provisions from the ACT Criminal Code for disciplinary purposes, it obviously must be updated in the light of those changes to that Criminal Code. At present, it is clear that it has fallen behind and has been inadequate in many respects. To the extent that this amendment brings the Defence Force Discipline Act into line and makes it consistent, we support the amendment. However, we believe there is an important point to make. To some extent, the amendment assumes that the status quo, with respect to the Defence Force Discipline Act, will remain unchanged-that is, that breaches of defence discipline and criminal law will continue to be both investigated and prosecuted by ADF authorities. However, the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee, in its report on military justice-which was delivered approximately three months ago-strongly recommended that this arrangement be changed. The committee recommended that, other than at times during deployment, all responsibility for breaches of civilian and criminal law within Australia be investigated and prosecuted by civilian police, not by defence police. However, we recognise that the incorporation of the Criminal Code of the ACT into the Defence Force Discipline Act for disciplinary purposes overseas is necessary. In those cases, these provisions of the Criminal Code become the main authority for prosecuting offences. If the government accepts the recommendation of the Senate committee, however, there may be implications for the way in which the Defence Force Discipline Act provides for non-defence criminal offences. But, until the government responds to the committee’s recommendations, we will not know whether those changes will be necessary. In those cases, the incorporation of the provisions of the ACT Criminal Code will, nonetheless, be important. To that extent, we regard this amendment as a housekeeping matter and necessary for the status quo. But it may, as we repeat, require fresh examination after the government announces its response to the Senate committee report. While on this subject, we believe it is worth reiterating some of the committee’s recommendations. The committee recommended that the management of defence disciplinary matters be separated from the investigation and prosecution of criminal matters. Essentially, it is MAIN COMMITTEE",135,Defence Legislation Amendment Bill No 1 2005
290,Mr Mcclelland (Barton) (10.08 Am),"The opposition supports the Defence Legislaan issue of expertise and efficiency. One of the greatest criticisms made in the committee’s report-which was a bipartisan report-was the poor standard of investigation of criminal offences by defence authorities. This was seen as a matter resulting from low levels of skill and expertise in terms of the qualifications and experience of those people entrusted with the responsibility. The committee considered that, given the low frequency of such offences, it was difficult to develop and retain the requisite investigatory skills within the Australian Defence Force. In a world of rapidly-increasing specialisation and outsourcing, where appropriate, to centres of excellence, the committee was of the view that a better job could be done by civil police. That, by the way, is not proposed to absolve ADF members from defence discipline in any way. It simply seeks to bring greater expertise and efficiency to the process. It seeks to have defence disciplinary management confined to breaches of defence discipline which are most relevant on a daily basis to the activities of the Defence Force. That was the unanimous view of the committee. It is a clear separation of function and in effect is no different to the operation of any other part of civil law affecting ADF personnel as private citizens in terms of any laws they may breach when not on active duty. If eventually the commission of a crime is proven, then of course Defence has a clear prerogative to consider that offence and behaviour in the light of its own standards, as may be reflected in internal defence disciplinary measures, but that is a separate issue to the enforcement of criminal law. We certainly hope that the government gives this recommendation very careful consideration. Should it agree with the committee, then of course we will need to re-examine the relevance of this particular amendment that we are dealing with today. Turning to the second amendment, consistency of age provisions for cadets across Army, Navy and Air Force is sensible. That is practical housekeeping. I do want to mention a related matter, however, that was also referred to by the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee in its report on military justice. It concerns the duty of care owed to cadets, many of whom are minors and are away from their homes in circumstances where cadet instructors and staff, we would expect, have special responsibilities. The particular case highlighted by the committee was the tragic suicide of Air Cadet Eleanore Tibble. But for the failure of proper process, she might still be alive today. The saddest things about this case are the well-worn causes of inadequate guidelines and instruction manuals, lack of familiarity, poor training and inadequate codes of conduct. Too often the response made to those shortcomings is that the procedures have been reviewed and rewritten. Too often the bureaucratic response is to close the file in the hope and, in some cases, expectation that the issue will simply fade away. We see that response can have tragic consequences. At the heart of these matters there is only one issue: the fulfilment of a duty of care, particularly to those who are younger and less experienced in both life skills and military skills. It is about the duty of care to everyone, not just cadets. If they are minors, the duty of care is even more onerous and hence the committee’s great concern, as noted in its report. Remedying these concerns cannot simply be achieved by introducing manuals and processes. Real changes come from driving a change in attitude and culture within the Defence Force. I note that there are determined efforts within the Defence Force itself, but again they have to be reflected in appropriate legislative or strucMAIN COMMITTEE tural change which fairly and squarely brings the responsibility to the desk of the relevant government ministers entrusted with that responsibility. In 2004 alarming levels of soldier dissatisfaction were detailed in the Defence attitude survey. These concerns cannot be ignored. This specially prepared study demonstrated that almost one in three military personnel, as surveyed, wanted to quit; more than half of the soldiers asked said that the Army suffers from inadequate resources; and well over two-thirds of ADF personnel felt military values and standards had declined. I therefore urge the government to respond in full to the committee’s recommendations for the institution of better processes for added resources and to drive a cultural change. Until the special duty of care for minors, in particular, is fully heeded and the culture of care is properly instilled, more tragedies like that involving Eleanore Tibble are inevitable. Finally, I wish to address other key amendments concerning the retention bonus. This bonus was introduced in 1991. It provided for one year’s salary to those members of the ADF who switched to the MSBS and who, after 15 years service, opted for a further five years. It was only available to medically fit officers above the rank of major and for other ranks above the rank of sergeant. It was initiated at the time that the DFRDB superannuation scheme was terminated. It was provided only to those who transferred to the new scheme. The point was to encourage longer serving experienced personnel to stay on and resist the temptation to leave for financial reasons. The DFRDB scheme, with its pension and part commutation to a lump sum, was an attractive option in those circumstances. The DFRDB had an immediate pension entitlement after 20 years of service, with an option of commutation of part of that to a lump sum. The bonus then was conditional on transferring to the MSBS. As such, it must be honoured for the small number who remain in service and have not yet exercised their option. To remove it would be unfair, and we agree with the approach taken by the government. That is why this amendment, in effect, grandfathers the bonus for all personnel currently serving, which we recognise is appropriate. It is therefore not to become redundant for some time to come. The review of Australian Defence Force remuneration in 2001 by the Nunn inquiry considered this bonus in some detail. Nunn noted that there were several problems with the bonus. Firstly, during downsizing exercises retention bonuses encouraging people to stay for five years contradicted offers of redundancy. Some who re-signed got the bonus and were then offered a redundancy package; others were not made an offer because they have been paid the retention bonus. Additionally, retention policy began to focus on keeping particular skills rather than on general application. The bonus contradicted that policy as well. For those who undertook a return of service obligation this was not served concurrently but rather at the end of the five-year retention period. Naturally, all this produced friction, inconsistency and great dissatisfaction. More importantly, it interfered with targeted retention and the flexible management of skill-the latter varying widely across services. The one-size-fits-all approach in the MSBS retention bonus proved to be quite counterproductive to those measures which I have outlined, though we recognise it did perhaps have a legitimate purpose at its heart. This brings me to the policy on the issue of retention more generally. The particular provisions, though historical, have proven problematic for the reasons I have outlined but this is not to say that in the future retention bonuses might not be relevant as a tool in retaining skills. Having serving full-time personnel, on leaving the service, enlisting with the reserves is MAIN COMMITTEE also something that legitimately requires consideration. Perhaps bonuses could be more related to the labour market circumstances of the time and not treated as an ongoing condition of service. Clearly, greater flexibility is required and we therefore support the amendment. But at the same time we encourage continued attention to employment and retention incentives where there are serious shortfalls which affect the effectiveness of the ADF. This is not a new problem-recruitment and retention really are the sleeping giants of the defence forces’ ‘future issues to confront’, and indeed to our ability to keep our technological and skills advantage as a regional power. This has been acknowledged not only by the opposition but by members of Defence and several independent sources. On 11 March this year the immediate past Chief of the Defence Force, General Peter Cosgrove, acknowledged the extent of the skills crisis in the ADF when he told a parliamentary committee: ‘I think we share Australia’s issue with people getting into trades; we have to get them in the door.’ General Cosgrove tabled a document at the hearing that listed several key areas where Defence was particularly deficient. These included engineers, surveyors and tradesmen among others. The skills crisis in Australia is not only an important economic issue under this government’s watch; it has become-is increasingly becoming-a serious national security issue. Independent experts have also highlighted the extent of the problem. In their cost of defence post budget report for 2005, the Australian Strategic Policy Institute said, ‘Despite spending $500 million over five years on initiatives to improve the recruitment and retention of military personnel, the process of building up the size of the ADF has stalled.’ Defence cannot recruit as many people as they need-less than 85 per cent of their recruitment targets have been reached in the last six years. In a nutshell, the government has to make careers in the ADF more attractive. I note that the minister, who spoke previously in the Main Committee, has been undertaking some work on this. All we can say is that we have to have an open mind on those measures which will achieve that outcome. Certainly on this side of the chamber we are prepared to support practical measures that support the recruitment and retention of Australians. We believe our Australian Defence Force should be made up of Australians and not foreign soldiers. However, we are sceptical of bandaid fixes and measures which fail to address intrinsic problems. We particularly want the terrible image of the failed military justice system to be fixed. We think that is fundamental to recruitment, not only from the point of view of the desire of competent young people to enter the defence forces but also, quite clearly, to the preparedness of their families to encourage them into what otherwise can be a very satisfying, fulfilling and obviously worthwhile career. Until the government addresses these problems young people will think twice, as will their parents, about a career in the military. The minister has promised to respond to the committee’s report by 16 September. We very much look forward to a positive response accepting all the committee’s recommendations. We believe this is fundamentally a test of leadership at government level. It is also a real test of how serious the government is about having the ADF turn over a new leaf and get serious about its people and the role it can play not only in protecting the nation but as an instrument for developing the young people of Australia. We fully support the bill. ment Bill (No. 1) 2005 is to make some minor amendments to four pieces of Defence portfolio legislation. Before speaking about these minor amendments, I would like to take the opMAIN COMMITTEE",137,Defence Legislation Amendment Bill No 1 2005
291,Mr Somlyay (Fairfax) (10.26 Am),"The purpose of the Defence Legislation Amendportunity to recognise the contribution made to our country by our Defence Force personnel-both those who have served and those who are still serving. I have the honour of representing many ex-service men and women in my electorate of Fairfax, and I am proud of the way that many of these men and women continue the tradition of service by working for their community not just through the local RSL clubs but also through a multitude of community organisations. Yes, our defence personnel are there to protect Australia, but they do so much more than that. They have undertaken very dangerous peace-keeping duties in recent years in places like East Timor, the Sudan, Afghanistan, Bougainville and the Solomon Islands. They provide search and rescue missions such as the one a few weeks ago when the RAAF rescued stricken sailors in the Great Australian Bight. They provide emergency relief, within hours, in times of calamity such as the medical evacuations after the Bali bombings and the incredible assistance rendered in Banda Aceh after the tsunami. We currently have around 1,500 Australian Defence Force personnel deployed on operations around the world. As the Minister for Defence said in his foreword to the booklet Winning in Peace, Winning in War, the rise of terrorism and regional stresses in the last few years has meant that our military forces have had to deal with difficult and complex missions in circumstances and locations previously not considered likely. They are able to mount complex operations, in the face of grave risk, with just a few hours notice. In fighting, in humanitarian assistance and in support of our regional neighbours, the ADF have shown themselves to be a force for good, showing the world the enduring character and spirit of the Australian people. This bill, as I said at the beginning, makes minor amendments to four pieces of Defence portfolio legislation. The first of these is the Defence Force Discipline Act 1982, or DFDA, which is amended to redefine which laws form ‘territory offences’ under the act. These amendments are necessary because of changes to the criminal law of the ACT and the need to ensure that this act continues to reflect the range of offences originally intended for its operation. The Defence Force Discipline Act imports civil criminal offences into that act both to cover circumstances where they might not otherwise be prosecuted and to give greater efficacy to disciplinary law. We are talking here about offences such as computer theft, arson and blackmail. Because of the recent criminal law changes in the Australian Capital Territory, certain legislative references in the DFDA have become inaccurate. The amendments in this bill will remove those redundant legislation references and refer instead to the criminal law in force in the Jervis Bay territory from time to time. In summary, the amendments do not change offences under the act but only amend references to other legislation in the wording of the act. The second act to be amended is the Defence Act 1903. The term ‘investigating officers’ appears in both the Defence Act and the Defence Force Discipline Act, but it has different meanings in each act. The amendment in this bill is to change references in the Defence Act from ‘investigating officers’ to ‘inquiry officers’, to make it clear that these officers are conducting purely administrative investigations, not criminal investigations. Once again, the amendment does not change the focus or meaning of the act in any way. It simply redefines a term to avoid confusion. The third schedule of the bill amends the Naval Defence Act 1910 to align the eligible ages of Navy cadets with those already existing for their Army and Air Force counterparts. This MAIN COMMITTEE means there will be a uniform maximum entry age of 20 years for all cadets-Army, Navy and Air Force-as well as a uniform maximum age when a young person must cease being a cadet. That maximum age will be ‘21 years or such lower age as is prescribed’. Cadets is a Defence sponsored, community based organisation currently involving some 25,000 young people and 2,500 volunteer adults throughout Australia. Air Vice Marshal David Dunlop describes it as a youth development program delivered in a military context. In my electorate of Fairfax we are fortunate to have Army cadets at Yandina, Air Force cadets at Nambour and Navy cadets at Cooroy. The fourth schedule of this bill amends the Military Superannuation and Benefits Act 1991, removing the automatic retention benefit currently available for certain Defence Force personnel. Currently the act provides a bonus of one year’s salary to eligible members of the Military Superannuation and Benefits Scheme who, after 15 years of service, sign on for a further five years. The review of Australian Defence Force remuneration in 2001-the Nunn review-found that the issue of retention would be much better dealt with by the service chiefs, allowing them the flexibility to base incentives on priority needs and linking them to capability, rather than an automatic retention bonus for all, tied to a particular number of years of service. I stress that this change will not affect existing members-only future members. Access to retention benefits will continue for current members for as long as they remain eligible but will not be available to new members joining the ADF after the commencement date of this amendment. The last schedule of this bill simply contains a number of minor technical amendments relating to legislative references in Defence legislation. These changes were made necessary by technical amendments to acts, such as the Legislative Instruments Act 2003, and do not in any way affect the operation of the subject Defence legislation. I commend the bill to the House. the opposition support the Defence Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2005. However, I think it is important to point out that, while we support the bill, like many sections of the community, including sections of the defence community, we are becoming rather frustrated by the inordinately long period of time being taken by the government before it responds to what is considered to be a very good report of the recent Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee inquiry into the effectiveness of Australia’s military justice system. In saying that, I also point out that this is not the only report that has come down in the time of the current government-indeed there have been a number. I think the Senate report, although probably one of the most far-reaching reports, is one of about seven. For instance, we have had the 2002-03 Western Australian Coroner’s investigation of the HMAS Westralia fire; the 2001 Burchett QC inquiry into military justice in the Australian Defence Force; the 2001 Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade report entitled Rough Justice? An investigation into allegations of brutality in the Army’s Parachute Battalion; the 1999 Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade military justice procedures in the ADF inquiry; the 1998 Commonwealth Ombudsman’s own motion investigation into how the ADF responds to allegations of serious incidents and offences; and the 1997 Abadee study into the judicial system under the Defence Force Discipline Act, which Justice Abadee began in 1995. All of these inquiries were outlined in that Senate report. MAIN COMMITTEE",140,Defence Legislation Amendment Bill No 1 2005
292,Mr Edwards (Cowan) (10.33 Am),"As the member for Barton has already indicated,In my view, this is an important report, one that the government should not be delaying its response to. I understand that these are difficult, complex and complicated issues. Nonetheless, they are important issues-indeed crucial issues-not just to the well-being of members of the ADF. It is also important that they be addressed so that the mums and dads of Australia who are giving consideration, with their sons and daughters, to a career in the ADF are given some comfort, encouragement and certainty that these crucial issues which the ADF and the government must address are indeed being addressed. I have no doubt that mums and dads do consider these issues before they encourage their children into the ADF. I think that, until these issues are dealt with, we will continue to see problems with recruitment and retention. We know that these are not the only reasons that there are problems confronting the ADF and its recruitment and retention issues, but they are important ones. Some of the issues that this Senate inquiry referred to-and I intend to go through some of them-were the inordinate delay in investigations of alleged offences, in some cases investigations having gone on for several years; poor quality investigation of alleged offences such as the inappropriate questioning of civilian family members; failure to check easily obtainable exploratory evidence; failure to liaise closely with civilian agencies; a lack of independence in the investigation of alleged offences; failure to obtain and/or act on Australian Federal Police and DPP advice; a lack of independence in the decision to prosecute; poor quality prosecution of alleged offences; inordinate delay in the decision to prosecute; inordinate delay in the trial process; lack of independence in the trial process; lack of impartiality in the trial process; and inordinate delay in the review of trial processes. Ms Gambaro-I raise a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. We are dealing with amendments to the Defence Force Discipline Act 1982, and not once has the member referred to the bill.

I can understand why the government might be a bit sensitive about these issues. They have had almost nine years to address them, and what do we see? We see a bill which just tinkers at the edges of what is, as I have already described, a difficult, complex and complicated issue which the government must deal with. WhatI am saying is that the bill does not go far enough. It does not deal with the core issues which were referred toMs GambaroMr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. With all respect to the member for Cowan, this is a housekeeping bill which deals with some technical aspects on uniformity of age in relation to naval recruits. It deals with civil and criminal definitions of legal offences and it deals with a particular retention issue on reaching 15 years of service. It has nothing to do with military justice. Ms HallMr Deputy Speaker, on the point of order: I point out to you that within the last sentence of the speech by the member for Cowan he referred to the bill three times.

The parliamentary secretary’s view is that his speech is too wide in terms of a housekeeping bill. The member for Cowan canvassed issues, given that it does deal with some criminal justice matters. The precedent in the House, and certainly in the Main Committee, is that where there has been a great deal of debate-as there probably has been on this bill, given the shadow minister has had discussions on a range of defence matters-we would generally have a broader debate. If the member for Cowan cast too wide a net in regard to that, you could seek to bring him to order. At the moment I adjudge that he is in order. I am sure he will take into account your admonition. I think he has made a case as to why he is driving for a wider discussion in this debate. about concluded my speech. The points I wanted to raise in relation to Defence Force discipline are dealt with quite clearly in this bill. BeforeI move off the subject, I refer to paragraph 21, under the heading ‘Disciplinary action’-the matter being dealt with in this bill-in the executive summary of the report on the inquiry into the effectiveness of Australia’s military justice system. Paragraph 21 reads: These submissions and others, described extraordinary delays in the investigation of alleged offences, the failure of investigators to pursue exculpatory evidence, the failure of investigators to disclose relevant material to the accused, the failure of investigators and commanders to advise the accused of allegations at the appropriation time, the failure of investigators and prosecutors (legal officers) to obtain and/or act on specialist advice, the failure of prosecutors (legal officers) to adequately weigh and assess witnesses evidence. The committee is satisfied that these problems did in fact plague some investigations-this point admitted to by Defence in key instances-and the problems are so severe as to constitute systemic failures. The point I am making in relation to this bill is that it does not go far enough. If we have systemic failures in the Defence Force Discipline Act and in its practical application, then we need a response from the government so that this bill can be built on and we can get to the nub, the core, of the issues that need to be dealt with. The bill also makes some amendment to the proposed age limits of Navy cadets, as set out in the Naval Defence Act, to bring them into line with those for Army and Air Force cadets. I believe that the ADF has a duty of care and, once again, the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee referred to the issue of cadets. I do not intend to go into all of the detail of the particular case that it dealt with, but recommendation 38 of the committee’s report, which was a bipartisan report, says: To ensure that the further development and implementation of measures designed to improve the care and control and rights of minors in the cadets are consistent with the highest standards, the committee suggests that the ADF commission an expert in the human rights of children to monitor and advise the ADF on its training and education programs dealing with cadets. It may well be that the amendment in the Defence Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2005 is the start of the ADF and the government addressing the recommendations in this report and some of the important issues that need to be addressed. But duty of care goes beyond just cadets. Duty of care is owed to every member of the ADF. Until we get the matter of discipline right within the ADF, I think we will continue to have retention and recruitment problems.

296,Mr Edwards,"I thank the chair for its reasoned, balanced and wise ruling. I have justyou take a great deal of interest in matters dealing with Defence and that you, like me and other members on this side, are a very strong supporter of our young men and women in the ADF. We want to see these matters addressed. We want to see our members of the ADF given proper support and a proper framework within which they can carry out their very crucial and important day-to-day tasking operations both in Australia and overseas. Until we deal with the real issues confronting military justice, we are not doing them justice or giving them the sort of support that a proper, caring and committed government would be giving to our members of the Australian Defence Force. As I said earlier, the opposition support this bill, but we look forward to the very overdue response from the government which addresses the real matters that this bill should be going to. an opportunity to look at the second reading speech and I note that the Defence Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2005 deals specifically with changes to the Defence Force Discipline Act 1982 and, therefore, I am reinforced in my view that the member for Cowan’s previous argument was germane to the legislation. Ms GAMBARO (Petrie-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence) (10.49 am)Mr Deputy Speaker Hatton, I thank you for your ruling. Having sat in the chair, I know that it is a difficult position to fulfil, and I respect your ruling. I was merely pointing out that, at some stages during his contribution, the member for Cowan was straying from the true intent of the bill. Thank you for your ruling, and I accept it. the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs deals largely with housekeeping measures that update various pieces of legislation within the Defence portfolio. I thank the numerous members who have spoken on the legislation, including the shadow minister for defence, the member for Cowan and the member for Fairfax. I thank the opposition for their support of this bill and for their comments. The Defence Force Discipline Act 1982 will be amended to redefine territory offences under the act as a result of the changes in the criminal law of the ACT. These amendments are necessary to ensure that this act continues to reflect a range of offences originally intended for its operation. The scope of these offences has been severely limited in recent times by changes to laws that are cross-referenced in the act. It is essential that the ADF retain the ability to prosecute a full range of criminal offences, and without this amendment to the definition of territory offences this would not be possible. The ability to prosecute criminal offences acts as both a sword, by ensuring compliance within the minimum standards of behaviour of soldiers when appropriate, and a shield, by ensuring that criminal behaviour is tried in a fair and transparent system when our soldiers are in operations in countries where criminal justice systems may not meet the standards acceptable to the Australian public. The amendments to the definition of ‘territory offence’ are not as a result of or in any way inconsistent with the military justice inquiry report-nor is it an attempt to expand the current circumstances in which the jurisdiction should be exercised.

300,The Deputy Speaker,"Does the parliamentary secretary accept the intervention?Ms Gambaro-Yes. Ms Hall-My question relates to the contribution of the member for Cowan. Would the parliamentary secretary give some indication to the House of when there is likely to be a response to the issues that the member for Cowan raised and, when the response is received, the likelihood of further enhancing this legislation? to give the member for Shortland an answer now. The member for Barton raised the issue, as did the member for Cowan, of the recently tabled report of the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee inquiry into the effectiveness of the Australian military justice system. As advised yesterday by the Minister for Defence, the government’s response to this inquiry has been considered by cabinet and the minister is looking forward to shortly providing a very considered response. I hope that satisfies the member for Shortland. I was going to cover it in my summation, but I thank her for her question. Going back to the bill, the repeal of part 8 of the Military Superannuation and Benefits Act 1991 to remove the retention benefit currently available to certain ADF members of the benefit scheme is required to ensure that ADF pay arrangements provide an effective, efficient and flexible remuneration framework consistent with reforms in the wider public and private sectors. Over time the value of retention benefit as an aid to retention has declined, and previous speakers-the shadow minister and the member for Cowan-have spoken about retention today. This is a very important measure that will make sure that the main exit points from the ADF after four years and eight to 10 years of service are looked at. There are loss rates at each point, and they vary according to the employment group in question. To be really effective, retention initiatives must now target those specific exit and employment group points. They are not always related to military service and condition; they are also related to demographic and skills issues and career path changes. We must recognise that, in contrast, the retention bonus targets personnel with 15 years service and those who are likely to continue serving. That is what this measure has done. The current retention bonus is insufficiently targeted and does very little to assist in reducing those separations at critical points of service. Only members who join the ADF, and therefore the Military Superannuation Benefits Scheme, after the date of legislative change will be affected by these changes. Currently the eligible members will continue to have access to the bonuses as they reach the required level of service. There have been a number of speakers today and they have raised a number of issues, particularly on retention. I am happy to say that the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs is currently engaged in an inquiry looking at retention and recruitment issues. It will be a wide-ranging inquiry. In my position as parliamentary secretary, I am looking at an inquiry into the reserves and what we need to do financially and non-financially to make sure we do not have any further decline in our recruitment in both the regular Defence Force and the reserves. I want to use this opportunity to highlight a number of initiatives taken to make sure we retain our service men and women. We have improved the level of child care. Recently a contract was signed with ABC Learning Centres to ensure that defence men and women have access to child-care centres. The level of living standards and comfort of DHA housing provided to defence men and women has improved enormously. We have also looked at providing employment for spouses in areas such as Puckapunyal and Townsville, through providing MAIN COMMITTEE",145,Defence Legislation Amendment Bill No 1 2005
301,Ms Gambaro,"I was going to cover that when summing up my speech, but I am happybusiness centres or processing centres where spouses are able to access employment-and that is a very important issue to help us make sure we retain men and women in the Defence Force. I am looking forward to what both of the reviews-the review by the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs into recruitment and retention and the review into the reserves-will uncover. But it would be remiss of me to not talk about other issues that affect the defence forces. Not only are there issues relating to financial and non-financial aspects of their service; we also have issues in the private sector that we need to be aware of. We are currently suffering a worldwide skills shortage. Military men and women are highly trained and highly motivated, they possess great loyalty and they are an absolute bonus in anyone’s workplace. We will always have the civilian sector very keen to encourage and recruit defence personnel to come into the civilian sector. There are also demographic changes affecting reserves. Continuous training is provided to members of the Reserve. Typically members have taken four or five weeks annual leave and engaged in all of the training. The tourism industry now tells us that people are taking shorter and more frequent breaks rather than taking their annual leave in one hit, and that impacts on training levels and the continuous training that would normally have been undertaken in the past. So there is a whole pile of demographic things that we really need to consider as well. I know that some of these inquiries will look into the changing nature of work and working families and how that impacts on our defence men and women. I want to touch on one other measure in particular in this bill. This involves minor amendments to Defence portfolio legislation to clarify terminology and eligible ages for ADF cadets. There has been a lack of uniformity, particularly with naval cadets. The bill now clarifies that; it makes the entry point 20 years of age and the exit point 21 years of age. This is in greater uniformity with Army and Air Force cadets. The shadow minister for defence and the member for Cowan both raised issues about cadets. We have improved cadets in a number of areas, including providing greater screening of officers. One of the recommendations they spoke about was providing professional youth councillors for young people in the cadets. We have already engaged a University of Queensland professor. The professor is working particularly with the cadet directorate on youth suicide type issues and other emotional issues that all young people face whether or not they are in the cadets. I commend this bill. These measures are very important. They will ensure that we have effectiveness with respect to issues concerning cadets. Reference has been made to the Statutory Rules Publication Act 1903 and the repeal provisions of the Acts Interpretation Act which have resulted from the commencement of the new legislative instruments regime. I thank all of the speakers who have spoken to this legislation, and I thank the opposition for their support. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Ordered that this bill be reported to the House without amendment. MAIN COMMITTEE Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee Report Debate resumed from 14 September, on motion by Mr Slipper: That the House take note of the document. the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs for allowing me and my colleague Roger Price to join the committee. Both Mr Price and I were originally involved in an inquiry conducted by the former House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs on child custody arrangements. The report, entitled Every picture tells a story, was extremely well received by all groups within our community. There was a great strength of unanimity of the parties as regards the report. I believe it was the wish of the parliament to carry that unanimity into the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. It was important to do that because, whilst the outside players and government institutions may all have their views in this vexed and complicated process, it is the role of members of the House to truly present what they believe to be the views of the Australian community and follow through to ensure that government, the executive and the whole mechanism of government observe the wishes of the Australian people. Mr Price and I were able to help in that regard. We were fortunate in that Mrs Hull, the member for Riverina-the chair of the former House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs-was also a member of the legal and constitutional affairs committee and the three of us were able to provide continuity in terms of the views of that former committee, which prepared what I think was quite a historic document. The committee was charged with looking at the proposed legislation to change the Family Law Act. As people will be aware, there are several elements to the issue of family relationships. It is very hard and it is vexed. It is vicious at times and it is heart breaking at other times to see what people do to each other or what they have to put up with. Sometimes that is not of their own making; sometimes it is through an action of the court or the Child Support Agency-and there are all the other elements that enter into the complexity of the relationship between two people who are separating. The committee had to consider the Family Law Act. The role of the Child Support Agency is dealt with differently and will be responded to by the Minister for Family and Community Services, Senator the Hon. Kay Patterson. Our job was to look at the legal aspects of the Family Law Act. The Attorney-General, Mr Ruddock, provided us with a copy of the draft proposals in response to the previous report. The government has taken some time to respond. I think most people have been quite critical of that, but at the same time they have understood that this is no easy matter. Changes to the Family Law Act are difficult to devise and implement, and it is critical that we as a parliament do not create stress or hardship or unnecessary discrimination to one side or the other in the process. One thing that clearly came through from this report was that the needs of the children be placed paramount in everything that is done, so the best interests of the child are always to the fore in this report and these proposed changes. MAIN COMMITTEE",146,Defence Legislation Amendment Bill No 1 2005
302,Mr Cadman (Mitchell) (11.01 Am),"I commence my remarks by, first of all, thankingAustralia has one of the most interventionist family law acts in the world. There is not another area of administration of which I am aware that offers a court a greater opportunity than Australia’s Family Court has to interfere with and intervene in the affairs of a separating couple. The British system, which is quite similar to ours, does not encourage the court to intervene in these personal affairs to the degree that the Australian system does. So it was the view of the original committee and of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs that the court should be discouraged from unnecessary intervention and that the couple themselves-no matter how painful, how difficult and how traumatic it may be for a couple freshly separated, given all of the problems that separation may have created; it does not matter how difficult it has been-ought to be focused on the future of their relationship with their children. After their separation-even after five, 10 or 20 years timethey remain parents, and their responsibilities as parents and the links that parents have with their children need to be maintained. For the sake of the children-which was a fitting title for the previous report-it is vital that they are considered prime, and, while the court should stand back somewhat, it should still encourage the disengaging couple to think about their kids. It does not matter what they think of each other. They need to think about their children and what is best for their children. That is the theme, the very ethos, of what we are proposing with these legislative changes. I hope the government picks up the provisions that we have put forward in the list of recommendations. One of the key recommendations is: ... section 65DAA be amended to provide that the court shall, in making parenting orders in situations where there is equally shared parental responsibility, consider whether equal time with both parents is in the best interests of the child and reasonably practicable. The concept is and the requirements are that parenting orders be established over a period of 13 weeks by the separating couples so that decisions about the children’s future as to schooling, religious upbringing and all of the things that are of long-term significance to the children are settled and written down. The resultant parenting order is capable of change. It is not a matter of going back to the court and seeking the court’s approval to change the parenting order. If both parents agree that the parenting order needs to be changed, they can go back and try to change it, because children grow, their needs change, people move and new parenting arrangements are made in families. Families move on, they are never static, so parenting plans and parenting orders can change. The parenting plan can often underlie the parenting order. The parenting order is something that the court will implement. The parenting order can be participated in only where there is not violence. Violence removes the person who is violent from the parenting order making process and so from the parenting plan. Where there is equally shared parent responsibility, it is a consideration of the committee that the children should spend, if practical and if possible, equal time with the parents. This is going to be more expensive than a family living together. Most separating couples seem to think that, once separated, they are going to be able to manage just as well as when they were together. That is not true. It is more expensive to be separated. That is not often a calculation that both partners understand. The committee feels that, where practical, where the parents live geographically close to each other and getting the children to school is not a problem, it is very important that the children spend equal time with both parents. In a practical sense, speaking from a male point MAIN COMMITTEE of view, I think many men will have difficulty in meeting that requirement, because they need to provide maintenance support for their children and former wife. But they must be given the opportunity to share equal time with their children if that is feasible. As a starting point, it is a reasonable thing. Across the nation, non-custodial parents, whether male or female, were saying, ‘We haven’t got custody, but we want involvement with our children.’ It is not a gender thing at all. Everywhere in Australia, non-custodial parents, whether male or female, spoke exactly the same words and had exactly the same emotional reaction. So we must try and ensure that a parent has the opportunity of sewing themselves into the future of their child and establishing a full relationship with them. That is one of the goals we aim at, and I believe it is possible. With care as a starting point, and not a mandated process, there is every opportunity for us to be successful in changing the Family Law Act so that that is a consideration. There are complexities in the Family Law Act that we seek to consolidate. The goals and objectives, and a whole range of requirements that need to be considered as people separate, need to be drawn together-and we have suggested that. We have proposed technical changes. The obvious sticking point is that Nicola Roxon produced a dissenting report. Representing the Australian Labor Party as shadow Attorney-General, she was caught between challenging the Attorney and being a member of the committee. I do not think we should encourage that in future. It is not conducive to the well-being of the committee. So her dissenting report is more a political statement than the statement of a committee member. I see that Duncan Kerr, Roger Price and John Murphy have raised some points. They say in their concluding paragraph: In particular, without elevating our concerns to the level of a dissent, we join with Ms Roxon in noting that the committee’s recommendations, if adopted, will provide increased protection, where disputes arise, for the legitimate interests of those parents who want to share care for their children. These were their weasel words of dissent, but there was a general consensus for these changes. We had a lengthy period with the Chief Justice of the Family Court and members of that bench. We also had the opportunity of meeting others in the field, many of whom just want the best for Australian families. We have marked out a way ahead that includes a onestop shop for people to get advice, encouragement and support. They will be able to get advice on what would happen if they decided to contest a decision. They will make the effort to come together for the sole purpose of planning the children’s future and, once that is done, go their separate ways. We want them first of all to think of their children and not of their pet hates and their dislike of each other, which can be so violent at times. We want to safeguard the children. One interesting aspect of statistics that has come through is that blood-related parents are seldom aggressive or violent towards their own children; other people in relationships can be. The way in which we assess violence needs care and it needs to be a proven factor, somehow or other. It is very hard across jurisdictions when we go from the Commonwealth Family Court to a state policing system to establish with certainty what has gone on. The process of making a claim of unproven violence-by hearsay, a subjective comment asserting assault or violence-needs to be dealt with in a better way than it is at the moment. Both women’s and men’s groups who have been spoken to say that there is too much uncertainty. Claims can be made, in fake circumstances, that they are real. (Time expired) Debate (on motion by Mr Baldwin) adjourned. MAIN COMMITTEE Employment, Workplace Relations and Workforce Participation Committee Report Debate resumed from 17 August, on motion by Mr Barresi: That the House take note of the report. tee on Employment, Workplace Relations and Workforce Participation, titled Making it work: inquiry into independent contracting and labour hire arrangements, was tabled in the House on 17 August 2005. The report is a culmination of a great deal of effort by the Employment, Workplace Relations and Workforce Participation Committee. The intention of our inquiry into independent contracting and labour hire is outlined in the terms of reference, but I summarise by saying that we were looking at establishing a clear delineation between employees and independent contractors. Unfortunately, there is an increasingly blurred line between what is, in today’s society, an employee and what is an independent contractor. There are also considerations around the triangular relationship between labour hire employees, host employers and labour hire agencies. For example, where an employee is working with a person who is not directly employing them, who is responsible for the employee’s occupational health and safety? It may, in the end, affect the employee when employed by another off-site. We were looking at the way in which that more complex relationship should be manifested and at recommending to the government ways to clarify the relationship between those three parties. Given the growth of independent contractors in the last 15 years-particularly in the last 10 years-and the growth of labour hire companies used by employers, it is a very important area of public policy. There are some extraordinary deficiencies in Commonwealth law and even in state law. As deputy chair of this committee I embarked on the task with great enthusiasm. The committee works very well. There is good sense and good will amongst the members. The committee is chaired ably by Phil Barresi, the member for Deakin. He chairs the committee well and we have done some productive work in the past on participation in the work force. I look forward to the meetings and there is every attempt by all members to come up with genuine recommendations that we can put to the executive government. Alas, on this occasion there were some significant areas of difference between government and opposition members, but I think there were some very significant matters raised in the dissenting report. Along with three other members of the committee, I played a role in writing the dissenting report in which we distinguished ourselves from the overall recommendations of the committee. I do not want to emphasise areas of disagreement because I think there was an attempt to reconcile differences wherever possible, but at some point I must mention these matters because they are very important to the Australian Labor Party and federal Labor parliamentarians. They are very important matters that affect the way in which employment operates in this country. I do not want to be accused of carping but there were some recommendations that were consented to. In fact, the majority of the recommendations were consented to. Some of them were very good and, if embraced by the executive government, they will be useful. Hopefully, those recommendations will clear up some of the mess. There were attempts to gather proper information about how many independent contractors we now have in this country as a proportion of the entire work force. We also attempted to reach agreement on a definition. I did MAIN COMMITTEE",148,Committees
303,Mr Brendan O’connor (Gorton) (11.17 Am),"The report of the Standing Commitnot agree with the majority view that we should use common law and other indicators to define ‘independent contractors’. My view, and that of three other members of the committee, was that we should start from the basis that we must define ‘an employee’-and then what is not an employee may well be an independent contractor. We should not start from the basis of defining an independent contractor and work backwards to determine who, as a consequence, would be an employee. With respect, I think that that was a fundamental error in the reasoning of the majority members of the committee. The error may well have arisen because of the philosophical differences that we have in relation to these matters and it may also be a result of other matters that have been at play. I think it is incumbent upon me to mention the behaviour of the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations in this particular matter because he treated the committee with some contempt. I do not say that lightly. I think it is a very grave thing to say about a minister who is charged with the responsibility of overseeing a very important area of national public policy-that he acted in a contemptuous manner towards a parliamentary committee. I will indicate now why I believe he did so. The Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations referred this matter to us with terms of reference that we were asked to inquire into. We commenced our inquiry by calling for submissions and then embarked upon a whole range of public hearings to allow those who submitted, and others, to give evidence to us so that we could determine the recommendations we could make to the government. Not long after that referral was made to us, the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations set up his own inquiry, with exactly the same terms of reference, asking almost the same parties to respond to a paper he wrote that was entitled Independent contracting and labour hire arrangements. We had concurrently a parliamentary committee commencing an open inquiry, calling for submissions from all interested parties-from the public, organisations and individuals-on the one hand, and, on the other hand, at the same time, the minister operating a closed inquiry responding to what I have to say was a loaded paper with loaded assertions and questions, giving indications, if you like, as to the minister’s view about particular matters. That paper, which received some publicity-indeed, all committee members were very well aware of it-and the behaviour of the minister, in my view, tarnished the process for us. It had an adverse effect upon our processes and, in particular, upon government members of the committee. It is very unusual, and also very unfortunate, for a minister to refer a particular matter to a parliamentary committee in good faith and then at the same time start indicating his views before the committee has had an opportunity to make any recommendation on those matters. That behaviour was contemptuous, in my view. I made my views clear on that at the time, and I do so now because, without the intervention of the minister and the contemptuous behaviour, we may have found more areas of agreement. I say with all genuineness that I believe this committee operates openly and that people collaborate genuinely on these matters. I have to say for the record that that was a very disturbing intervention-intrusion, if you likeby the minister. But there were a number of recommendations that we agreed to. They do not have a lot of teeth, but there are recommendations about collating information so that we can clarify exactly what is going on and some recommendations about improving occupational health and safety matters and ensuring that the labour hire agency and the host employer understand their MAIN COMMITTEE obligations to employees. There are areas where we agreed. They are not very compelling, and they are not particularly strong recommendations, but, nonetheless, the sincerity with which they were put by all members in the areas in which we consented was important. I am hoping that the government will at least pick up the unanimous recommendations that were put to the minister. As I said earlier, we differed fundamentally because we believe that you have to start by defining an employee. In listening to the evidence, with all the submissions we had and the witnesses who came before us, we found that there is clearly significant misuse of the term ‘independent contractor’. There is an attempt by some employers-and, by the way, it disadvantages employees and other employers-to disguise employment, to dress the employees up as independent contractors, if you like, so that they can defray, so that they can shift what would normally be employer obligations onto those employees. A classic example is this. On Friday, an employee or a group of employees is working for an employer; on Monday they are told they must have an ABN, they must look after their own superannuation and they must insure themselves for workers compensation, because now they are independent contractors. I think most committee members know what a genuine independent contractor is. It is a person who understands that they are in the marketplace and they are trading their labour freely with all sorts of other parties. The relationship between an independent contractor and a principal who needs that labour is clearly a genuine thing. You see that with a lot of highly skilled tradespeople, for example, who set up a business. They understand the risks. There is a downside to being an independent contractor because you do not necessarily have the surety of work. You have to find your own work in the economy and you are responsible for superannuation, insuring yourself and indeed other matters that would normally be the responsibility of the employer. The Labor Party has no problem with those people who have the wherewithal and the wit to set themselves up as a contractor. We have no problem with those arrangements. What we do not accept is allowing employers to set up an arrangement where they force their employees to be an employee on Friday and a so-called independent contractor on Monday. We have suggested a series of recommendations to the minister to properly delineate genuine independent contractors from the bogus independent contractor. We have recommended specific methods for the government to delineate clearly who is a genuine contractor and who is not. The government members failed to accept the recommendations and I dare say the minister will treat us with the contempt he has already treated the committee. We also made recommendations in relation to labour hire arrangements. We think there should be a clear responsibility between the host employer and the labour hire agency. I want to finish by saying specifically that we are very concerned about the proposed independent contractors act. It tries to prevent the Transport Workers Union, which has represented contractors for 80 years, from having the right to represent contractors. It is quite extraordinary when the Australian Football Association and other bodies like that can represent contractors but the employee organisations registered would be prevented from representing their members. That clearly is a deliberate attempt to damage collective bargaining in the workplace. We have recommended specifically that that provision be deleted from the bill before the parliament. There is a whole series of things that have been put forward and I think the government should take them very seriously. (Time expired) MAIN COMMITTEE taking place in the Australian labour market over the last 15 years and, more particularly, that change has been very evident over the past 10 years. It is estimated that there are more than one million Australians-and, in fact, that figure could be closer to two million Australiansworking as independent contractors. In other words, these people are working entirely outside the traditional employment paradigm. Advances and developments of in-home office technology, email, mobile phones, voicemail and a raft of other modern technology mean that Australians can set up microbusinesses that can be run from home or indeed from the back of a car. The office of the past has changed. It no longer needs to be a static stand-alone piece of infrastructure. It is flexible and moveable. The delivery of services to industry has changed. A more modern, flexible work force is evidence of a changing labour force. These are generational changes that were unthinkable 10 years ago-changes that see people wanting to manage their own affairs and their own work environments. There is no such thing these days as a permanent job for a lifetime. The number of independent contractors will just continue to grow as technology advances. The work force is on the move. But, of course, with the growth of independent contractors the challenges of providing protection for the contractors have also grown. The chair of the Standing Committee on Employment, Workplace Relations and Workforce Participation, the member for Deakin, recently tabled a report in the House entitled Making it work: inquiry into independent contracting and labour hire arrangements and I commend the report to the House. The terms of reference for the inquiry were adopted on 9 December 2004 by the committee. The Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, the Hon. Kevin Andrews, requested the committee inquire into and report on issues including the status and range of independent contracting and labour hire arrangements, the strategies to ensure independent contract arrangements were legitimate and the role of labour hire arrangements in a modern Australian economy. It was a challenge, particularly in view of the short period of time for the inquiry to undertake the necessary public hearings and for the report consideration. It was also a challenge in view of the increasing debate that was happening-and is still ongoing-regarding changes to federal workplace relations legislation and the impact any changes may have on independent contractors. However, the committee met the deadlines and members worked together to achieve what I believe to be a credible report with some important recommendations. The 16 recommendations included in the report covered areas such as: the occupational health and safety of labour hire workers and independent contractors; the improvement of access to skill development and training for labour hire workers; the establishment of a voluntary code of practice for the labour hire industry; the need to create greater consistency across federal, state and territory legislation in differentiating between independent contractors and employees; the improvement of access to information to outline the rights and responsibilities of independent contractors; the need to regulate independent contractors under commercial law; and the improvement of access to different dispute resolution procedures for independent contractors. During the course of the inquiry, the committee investigated whether labour hire and contracting arrangements are in some instances being used to evade responsibilities, particularly in the area of occupational health and safety. Significant concerns were reported to the comMAIN COMMITTEE",151,Committees
304,Mrs May (Mcpherson) (11.32 Am),"There is no doubt there has been a quiet revolutionmittee regarding the increased risk of injury for labour hire workers and independent contractors. Some evidence to the committee stated that workplace health and safety of labour hire workers is not as good as that of direct employees. Evidence to the inquiry also indicated there was confusion about responsibilities between labour hire agencies and host businesses. This uncertainty at times meant that either party may not acknowledge OH&S responsibilities. Occupational health and safety issues were of huge concern to me, and I believe that is reflected by recommendations 6, 7, 8 and 9. These four recommendations clearly spell out some guidelines for responsibilities in this area. It is important, in my view, that labour hire companies and host businesses have a clear set of national guidelines to protect the safety of independent contractors in the workplace. These four recommendations cover such areas as training for workers by labour hire agencies and host businesses, monitoring and enforcing compliance with occupational health and safety regulations, improving the collection of data on injury rates for independent contractors so comparisons can be made against direct employees and the development of initiatives to ensure greater understanding among independent contractors and host businesses of respective responsibilities in relation to occupational health and safety. This inquiry was difficult and challenging in the first instance because of the need for greater clarity and consistency in distinguishing between an employee and an independent contractor. There were conflicting views on what constituted a contractor, as distinct from an employee. I felt that it was important to clarify the difference. The committee noted in the report that different definitions of ‘employee’, ‘independent contractor’ and ‘employer’ in Commonwealth and state jurisdictions have been the subject of long standing concern. The report notes that differentiating between independent contractors and employees has required the common law to provide guidance. It was also noted that the courts need to use factors rather than a definition to determine employment status. The huge volume of evidence in this area provided substantial detail on many of these matters, and the evidence is summarised in the report. Careful consideration was given to all the evidence in determining what an independent contractor is, and government members recommended that the Australian government maintain the common law approach to determining employment status and distinguishing between employees and legitimate independent contractors. Overall, as a committee, each of us wanted to ensure that government did not in any way hinder the growth of independent contractors. It was well recognised that a balance between protections and freedoms for independent contractors had to be reached. As more and more Australians set up businesses that see them delivering services to a host of industries as independent contractors, we as legislators must be mindful of not dampening the entrepreneurial spirit. We must put safeguards in place, but those safeguards must not hinder the growth of the independent contractor in this country. We must recognise and embrace the cultural change that is happening in Australia’s labour market. This cultural change is in response to a changing global market, the competitiveness of business and the rise of franchising in this country, but more importantly it is a response to the individual who is choosing how he works and for whom he works. This individual is now taking on board responsibility for his working life. He wants the freedom of working for himself, with the choices that allow him to meet his demands and the demands of family responMAIN COMMITTEE sibilities, hours of work and income needs. This person wants to be independent; this person does not want to work for an employer. In other words, these people have chosen to work as independent contractors because it suits their lifestyle or income preferences. The Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations has indicated that in drafting the independent contractors act, which will be introduced into the parliament later this year, he will actively consider the committee’s report and its recommendations. The minister has further indicated that this government respects the rights of genuine independent contractors to manage their own affairs and to enter into their own agreements with their clients, if that is their preference. The growth of independent contractors certainly warrants the acknowledgement and support of government. Unfortunately for my opposition colleagues, there are now more independent contractors than there are trade union members in the Australian work force. This is a fact that should be acknowledged. It is a stark fact that shows just how much the Australian work force has changed and where it is moving to. As a government we need to protect the rights of independent contractors to work in the way they want, while ensuring the necessary safeguards are put in place so that they are not hindered in delivering the myriad services to industry that are so crucial to the continued economic growth of this country. To all my colleagues on the committee, and I note there are some opposition members of the committee here this morning, my thanks to each and every one of you for the spirited debate during the course of the inquiry. As the chairman of the committee noted in his tabling speech, even though there was dissent along party lines on some of the recommendations, overall there was unified support for the majority of the report, and there was certainly a huge commitment by all to ensure that a useful and informative report was finally tabled in the parliament. I commend the report to the House. Ms ANNETTE ELLIS (Canberra) (11.42 am)-I am pleased to have the opportunity today to make some brief comments in relation to the report entitled Making it work: inquiry into independent contracting and labour hire arrangements, which was tabled in the House very recently. In so doing I open my remarks by first of all putting on the record my thanks to, and my respect for, the committee secretariat attached to this inquiry. I thank each one of them most sincerely for the assistance and guidance they offered to all of us as committee members. I also want to thank all colleagues on the committee, both government and my own colleagues, for the spirit in which the inquiry was conducted. I want to endorse all the comments made by my colleague Brendan O’Connor, the Deputy Chair of the Employment, Workplace Relations and Workforce Participation Committee, who spoke earlier this morning. I do not wish to go over his comments again, but I want to endorse particularly his comments in relation to why we agreed on our side of the committee to put in our dissent to some aspects of the report. Members are extremely aware, and I am very aware, that most reports in this place are unanimous. It is does not happen every day that there are dissenting comments, and so they need to be observed as a serious contribution. We believe there are very good reasons for us to have those dissenting comments included. Having endorsed those comments by the deputy chair of the committee I want to talk about one particular aspect of the report this morning. It relates specifically to, in loose terms, the sorts of sham arrangements that can occur in the labour hire industry and to one case in particular. I wish to highlight this one case for a very clear reason, and the previous speaker, the member for McPherson, just mentioned it. While we are talking about this report there is also MAIN COMMITTEE a debate going on about changes to industrial relations legislation and the Welfare to Work arrangements. There is an interleaving going on between all of these subjects and a connection with this report. The case in point was brought to my attention by my own community in Canberra-a non-government organisation acting on behalf of a client of theirs. I will read some of the very brief submission that was made to the inquiry by this non-government organisation. In part, the submission states: I am bringing this case to your attention for your consideration as it demonstrates the vulnerability of people on the Disability Support Pension in the workplace, when there are not sufficient safeguards to protect their rights. There must be many similar cases across Australia where people on the DSP are subjected to these sorts of practices. Then there is a brief outline of the case. This is also referred to in the report at page 125, paragraph 5.142 and onwards. The case in point concerned a client on DSP for four years who has worked part time as a cleaner since October last year. This person was working 20 hours per week. She rang Centrelink each fortnight and informed them of her income and they adjusted her disability support pension accordingly. The client appears to have a mild intellectual disability. The client was worried about not paying any tax as the employer was not deducting any from her pay. The NGO rang the cleaning agency involved and was informed that the client was a subcontractor with the agency and that she had agreed to all the terms and had signed a contract. The client, however, said that she remembered signing some paperwork but she was not really sure what it meant, as she is not very good with forms. She was clearly very distressed and worried about possibly losing her job. The NGO subsequently sighted the contract that the client had signed but she had obviously no idea what it meant in relation to her employment. The client says she likes her cleaning job and wants to keep it; she does not understand the implications of being a subcontractor, or know what it even is. She receives a weekly pay packet and does not invoice the agency. They ring her and offer her work each week. She has regular customers that she cleans for. Superannuation, workers compensation insurance, holidays et cetera are all issues that obviously need clarification. The point here is that this person thought she was working-and she was-but she did not know that she was being employed as a subcontractor with all the implications that brings. It reached the point where she was asking Centrelink to take out the tax. She had to apply for an ABN. She did not even know how to begin to do the paperwork for an ABN, let alone understand the implications of what it meant. The client subsequently brought in the ABN application and, when the NGO officer asked her whether she understood the form at all, she became distressed and said it was all too much for her. At that stage in the proceedings the service involved was working with the client to investigate options for any other work and any issues with regard to the possible tax debt that this person now faces. I am not certain at this stage where that tax debt is up to. The reason for bringing the matter up is evident. My colleagues on the committee were also very interested in this case. It just shows that when we talk about subcontracting arrangements, employment possibilities and influencing people in a positive way to move from welfare to work, there are many considerations that we must have in mind. It is never quite as simple as many of us would wish it to be. This is not an isolated case. There will have been, will be and will continue to be many instances around the country where people are taken MAIN COMMITTEE advantage of in circumstances such as this. In my view, there has been an avoidance of obligations on the part of the employer-if we can determine that they are the employer under the arrangements to do with identity and clarification in labour hire circumstances. There has been a move by some people to remove themselves from their obligations in terms of their employer status. People like this woman can get very badly caught up in that. She ended up, as I have said, an unfortunate client of the Taxation Office, to whom she had a debt. Heaven knows what other circumstances would have flowed from that. I say to the government, in the most genuine and earnest way, that when we are talking about all these issues to do with people on DSP and maybe some who are not-maybe some who do not have literacy or numeracy skills or have other circumstances to assist them-there are very vulnerable folk out there who can fall foul through no fault of their own of all these things we are talking about. Nothing would make me happier than to see as many as possible of those people who find themselves in circumstances where they need disability support pension to exist financially have a more fruitful life out in the community participating along with the rest of us, but we cannot just sit back and assume that they all have the wherewithal to do that and we cannot just sit back and assume that all employers will do the right thing by them. The majority of them will, but there will be a hell of a lot of them who will not. I am really grateful to the committee and to the chair that we were able to put this example prominently in the report and talk about it at some length. IfI have any disappointment, it is in the fact that we have some dissent to recommendation 15 in the report. While our dissent is clearly outlined in our dissenting report-and it has everything to do with industrial relations-in paragraph 1.23 of our dissenting report, under ‘Opposition to Recommendation 15’, we say: In the event that the Commonwealth successfully implements a national industrial relations system the Australian Government should first clearly define an “employee” by adopting the definition as outlined earlier in this dissenting report. Further more the Australian government should legislate to prevent forms of disguised employment. This case, and others like it, come under this banner fairly well. I strongly suggest to the minister and to the government that when they make changes they seriously consider these sorts of implications. As I said a moment ago, this is only one instance. I am grateful to the agency for making the submission available to the committee. I have to say very honestly that I do not believe one member of the committee disagreed with the notion that we were in general terms putting forward about circumstances such as this. I know all members on the committee would agree with me-and they did at the time-that this is far from a satisfactory arrangement. My fear is just how many others like this are occurring. It is relevant to this report. I am concentrating my remarks purely on this because I think it is so important, and I hope that the remarks that are being made by members opposite on the adoption of the report by the government will allow the government to consider the comments we have made in our dissenting report and why they are there. This is one example that I would like to draw to the government’s attention. the report of the Standing Committee on Employment, Workplace Relations and Workforce Participation titled Making it work: inquiry into independent contracting and labour hire arMAIN COMMITTEE",154,Committees
305,Mr Henry (Hasluck) (11.53 Am),"I am very pleased to have this opportunity to speak torangements. I would also like to put on record my appreciation of the opportunity I was given to participate in this inquiry and also thank the secretariat for the fantastic support they provided over the course of the inquiry. The inquiry brought to light not only a number of issues and a number of challenges in independent contracting and labour hire but also a growth of people wanting this level of independence and choice in their working life, which I support. The report highlights the conditions faced by Australia’s estimated million-plus independent contractors that find themselves under siege by state legislation and union intimidation in many cases and their being poorly served by any federal legal framework under which they can work. This is of particular concern when you consider that in Australia today a significant proportion of the work force is engaged in independent contracting. Indeed, it is a growing phenomenon. Independent contracting has become a lifestyle choice for what is, according to the figures provided by Independent Contractors of Australia, around 28 per cent of the country’s labour force. These million or more hard working men and women are engaged in running home based businesses, providing specialist advice in a range of fields such as marketing consultants, financial consultants, IT professionals, service providers and as subcontractors to the manufacturing, construction and building sectors. They represent a significant sector of our economy. We cannot ignore their needs and the challenges that face them. The report entitled Making it work that is before you contains a summary of the wide range of views on independent contracting and labour hire arrangements that were expressed to the Standing Committee on Employment, Workplace Relations and Workforce Participation during the eight days of hearings that were held across Australia and which were contained in more than 70 submissions that were received. During those hearings, we heard evidence that made it clear that people want to have the choice to be independent and benefit from the flexibility that life as an independent contractor will allow. They want to be, in effect, in charge of their own destiny in their working life. They do not want to be employees, they do not want to be tied to a single employer; they want choice, although many of them may work for a single organisation, business or entity for a period of two or three years-or more or less-depending on what they decide at the time. With respect to labour hire, where people work as independent contractors for labour hire companies and are placed in such work environments as aged care, health, health care, hospitality or tourism entities and organisations-or a range of similar service organisations-we see that, in cases where they have the option to switch to being a permanent employee, on almost all occasions they choose to remain as a contractor because of the flexibility it affords in their individual circumstances. That is not always the case, although I am informed that on all occasions these people are given the option of becoming employees if they are going into a long-term arrangement with a client of a labour hire company. Independent contractors in many ways epitomise the entrepreneurial spirit of Australia and contribute to Australia’s prosperity and the vibrancy of the communities in which they operate. In his speech last week to the Independent Contractors of Australia, the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, the Hon. Kevin Andrews, described independent contracting as ‘one of the most important, yet least commented on, shifts in the history of its labour market’. I agree with this assessment, and I think there is evidence in the report to support that MAIN COMMITTEE sentiment as well. From evidence gleaned by the committee at the hearings, and through briefings from such organisations as Independent Contractors and others, it has become apparent that most trade unions are opposed to the rise of independent contractors and are actively engaged-with the help of some of the Labor controlled state governments that benefit from donations made by unions to the Labor Party coffers-in activities that are designed to force independent contractors back into traditional industrial relations systems. That is not a welcome development and it needs to be addressed. Fundamentally, the Labor Party and the unions seem unable to grasp the concept of independent contractors, because those contractors have little interest in joining the union movement. In this regard, I am strongly of the view that independent contracting represents a commercial relationship between the parties involved and under no circumstances should they be considered as requiring regulation under state industrial relations or workplace relations regimes. I am totally opposed to state deeming measures which seek to treat independent contractors as employees and which reduce the independence of those contractors through prescriptive legislation. There is a certain hypocrisy involved when these Labor controlled state governmentsand the unions that support them-talk about freedom of association when in fact they are actively seeking to reduce the choice and freedom of individuals to operate as independent contractors, putting them back into the industrial relations environment. In my home state of Western Australia the state government has been seeking to effectively deem independent contractors through its industrial relations legislation by expanding the definition of what constitutes an employee to include, as examples, outworkers, labour hire workers and contract cleaners. In Queensland, section 275 of the Queensland Industrial Relations Act 1999 gives the Queensland Industrial Relations Commission the power to declare persons who work under a contract for service to be an employee. Evidence from the ACCI suggested that removing deeming of individual contractors or employers from the Australian system of labour laws and precluding the operation of state deeming provisions should be supported. I support these propositions. The Making it work report tabled 16 recommendations that were supported by the majority of committee members; however, only nine of those were supported by all parties. A further seven minority report recommendations were tabled by the Labor Party members. These alternatives are certainly not supported by the majority of committee members. It is refreshing to see that at least on a number of recommendations there has been crossparty support; however, the differences identified are fundamental and occur in a number of what I believe to be crucial areas. There is certainly cross-party support for recommendations made in relation to statistical data collection, improvements in work safety, achieving consistency in terms of workers’ compensation systems and the development of educational resources. Sadly, but perhaps predictably, the recommendations made in the report which Labor members have declined to support are the very ones that are crucial to ensuring the flexibility of working arrangements enjoyed by independent contractors. Labor, it seems, because of their Tweedledum and Tweedledee relationship with the unions, want to continue to frustrate the use of independent contractors in order to drag them back into the grasp of rigid state controlled workplace relations systems, with many claims of sham arrangements. MAIN COMMITTEE As part of the report, the committee strongly recommended that the Australian government maintain the common law approach to determine employment status and to distinguish between employees and legitimate independent contractors. The common law approach is the common sense approach and has the overwhelming support of the independent contractors of Australia. The Independent Contractors of Australia describe this approach as the bedrock of Independent Contracting. This is not an opinion shared by Labor. The minority report suggests an alternative approach and trots out, in the words of the ICA: ... an incoherent shambles that would create massive commercial confusion and effectively dump known and stable commercial legal systems and relationships. The Labor alternative amounts to a tacit banning of independent contracting and labour hire. Remarkably, it also flies in the face of the acceptance by the International Labour Organisation of the legitimacy of independent contracting. The majority recommendations in the Making it work report are designed to ensure that independent contractors can be treated on a commercial basis as small businesses and thereby take advantage of a whole raft of commercial law protections and remedies offered to other enterprises. Unions that attack and deride the role of the independent contractor do so for selfserving purposes. Conservative estimates put the number of independent contractors at around 1.1 million and growing, while the ICA figures suggest that there may be as many as 1.9 million independent contractors. If that is the case, they now outnumber union membership, which has been on the decline for many years while, in contrast, the independent contractors’ star has been rising. The union movement, in concert with its Labor Party mates, would love to force union membership upon them. Indeed, Labor controlled state governments have introduced legislation to include specific provisions into their industrial relations laws to enable unions to treat independent contractors as though they were employees. Independent contractors add enormous value to the Australian economy and their growth is very much an unheralded success story. But that success has meant that independent contractors have become the target of what is predatory action by the unions and Labor controlled state governments that seek to legislate in the industrial relations system where no regulation is sought by either the contractors or their clients. It is my belief that a party’s freedom to contract must be upheld and that independent contractors need greater certainty in commercial relationships. The majority party recommendations of this report, when taken in concert with the proposed independent contractors act, will ensure that these important tenets are upheld and protected. They will, for example, also prevent unions from seeking orders from the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to impose unreasonable constraints-constraints that have no place in today’s economic realityon the freedom of Australia’s independent contractors to work in Australian workplaces. There is no doubt that labour hire and independent contracting arrangements should continue to develop and grow, providing both flexibility and opportunities for workers and business in the growing and increasingly diverse Australian economy. I commend the report to the House. Ms HALL (Shortland) (12.05 pm)-I rise to support the recommendations made in the dissenting report of the Standing Committee on Employment, Workplace Relations and WorkMAIN COMMITTEE force Participation report entitled Making it work: inquiry into independent contracting and labour hire arrangements. Before doing so, I would like to thank the chair for the very constructive role that he played. It was quite obvious from the start of the inquiry that there would never be agreement on a number of the recommendations. This was recognised by previous speakers, including the member for McPherson. I was disappointed by the contribution by the member for Hasluck because he was not cognisant of, did not give consideration to or did not acknowledge the fact that this was the type of inquiry in which, no matter what happens, you are going to have two different views expressed in the report. That probably goes to the heart of the differences between the two sides of parliament when looking at issues like this. It is important to acknowledge that the chair played a very constructive role and was very mindful of the fact that this was the situation. I would like to thank the deputy chair. He played a very important role in drafting the recommendations in the dissenting report. He worked closely with all the members that supported those recommendations. Finally, I would also like to thank the committee secretariat for the work that they did and the support that they gave the committee. I would like to refer to the final point that the deputy chair made in his recommendation: that he found it ‘disappointing that the secretariat was not sufficiently resourced to assist’ the members that wished to make a dissenting report. All up, I think that as a committee, given the very difficult circumstances, we worked very well together. Those members that did make the effort to attend most of the hearings and inquiries probably learnt a lot about this subject and were able to fully understand the issues from all perspectives. Even those members supporting the body of the report could understand the concerns of the people who did not agree with it and would never support the recommendations outlined in the report. BeforeI go to the body of the dissenting report, I would like to place on record a couple of concerns that I have. My first concern is that the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations released his discussion paper during the inquiry. He actually pre-empted a lot of the findings of the inquiry. I think he sought to influence to some extent the government members that were involved in that inquiry. It really worries me that the discussion paper was released on the day that the committee was conducting hearings in Sydney. We were most concerned by the fact that the minister had released his discussion paper and there was a feeling that, even if it did not influence the members of the committee, it could create the perception that it would. The second concern I would like to place on the record relates to the final stages of the inquiry when we had representatives from the department attend hearings here in parliament. I think we are served very well by those people who work in most departments. I have found on all the committee hearings I have been involved in that when staff employed by departments attend they try and answer the questions that are put to them by members of the committee. And members of the committee are also mindful that there are certain questions that the department cannot answer. I was absolutely horrified on the last occasion that the department came to meet with the committee, before we went to the final stages of our deliberations, when one staff member blatantly refused to answer any questions put to him. He hedged, he ducked, he weaved-and not only from questions put to him by opposition members of the committee but also from questions put to him by members of the government. I thought that that was a very sad state of affairs, and I found it very disappointing, because it put a lot of MAIN COMMITTEE pressure on the other staff member that was there. Really, the point of our meeting with departmental officials is to clarify any points that we may have, particularly at the vital stage just before we go into report deliberations. I feel that it is extremely important for me to put that on the record because that was the first time. I had encountered it on any committee that I have been involved in in this parliament or, for that matter, in the New South Wales parliament. I was quite disappointed. There are a number of dissenting recommendations. Firstly, we do agree with recommendations 1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 13. The recommendations that we disagree with really go to the core differences between the government and the opposition on this issue. The first recommendation that we oppose is recommendation 2, which goes to the definition of what determines employment and what determines independent contracting. The government supports a common law approach whereas we feel, as set out in the dissenting report, the government should provide a new definition of employee and that this definition should clarify the issues and remove the vagaries so as to create certainty for all the parties involved. I thought that that was an eminently sensible approach to take, but unfortunately that was not the majority decision of the committee. NextI refer to recommendation 3 and, once again, the opposition members did not support that recommendation. We felt that there was a need to define independent contractor. A number of our recommendations went to the fact that we really believed that it was important to have those definitions in place. Recommendation 4 refers back to that vital need for a definition of employee. It is proposed to place the onus on those who seek to be independent contractors to establish that they are genuinely running a business. We received a lot of evidence during hearings and through submissions to the committee which showed that that was of great concern to all parties involved in independent contracting or employees. Unfortunately, I feel that this report is not going to address those concerns. I think there will continue to be ambiguity in relation to employees and independent contractors. The common law approach means that people will be forced into situations that could be quite costly. I feel we have let all the parties down. One thing that became very apparent during the hearings was the impact that the increased casualisation of the work force was having on many workers in Australia. One of the sessions I found most interesting was in Sydney when we received evidence from labour hire companies. I was very surprised to find that it is not unusual for a person to be employed by a labour hire company and work with the same employer for a number of years-three, four or five years. The one that astounded me was the employee, employed by a labour hire company, who had been working for the one company for seven years. To my way of thinking, that cannot be justified. The labour hire company advised the committee that quite often companies seek to employ people through labour hire because it is better for their bottom line and for their reporting requirements. People employed by labour hire companies do not enjoy the same conditions as other employees. That extends to being able to secure loans and mortgages and this pervades all areas of their life. This area needs to be addressed. Employers should not be able to abrogate their responsibility to their workers simply from the point of view of meeting the requirements of their bottom line. Another area of great concern in relation to labour hire was occupational health and safety. There was considerable confusion in relation to who bore the responsibility for an injured MAIN COMMITTEE worker-whether it was the host company, the labour hire agency or a joint responsibility. I believe this issue needs to be addressed. I have come across numerous examples within my own electorate of where this confusion has been evident, where host employers have sought to abrogate their responsibility to injured workers. Probably one of the worse cases I have heard of is a worker who had a steel rod rammed through their leg. The employer arranged for that person to be driven to the hospital because they did not want to involve the WorkCover Authority. They had a very questionable safety record and, by taking the worker to the hospital in private transport, sought to abrogate their responsibility. We really need to have proper legislation in place, not to have a voluntary code of conduct, but mandatory registration of labour hire companies. Labour hire companies recognise that there is a need for registration but we need to make sure that any change fits in with recommendation 23. That will make for a better, safe working environment for all concerned. The other issue relates to the TWU-probably one of the best presentations I have seen to any committee in this parliament. Drivers presented to the committee their concerns about proposed changes that will prevent them from being members of the TWU. (Time expired) dissenting members of the Standing Committee on Employment, Workplace Relations and Workforce Participation. While the majority of the recommendations of the committee were agreed upon unanimously, I trust that the government will take notice of the seven additional recommendations contained in the dissenting report presented by Labor members of the committee. Independent contractors and labour hire arrangements are a growing feature of the Australian workplace, and the evidence suggests that there is going to be some growth for some time to come. It is not about to stop-at least according to the evidence presented to the committee. It provides opportunities for employers to shift workers from being employees to being contractors while in effect remaining, to all intents and purposes, an employee. Probably the most disappointing thing about the report is that this failed to be taken up in any serious way. While it was acknowledged as an issue by the dissenting Labor members, the government members failed to pick up probably the single most important thing facing people who have been shifted from being employees to being contractors. The government members have missed a fantastic opportunity to address the concerns of these workers, who are becoming a larger and larger part of the Australian work force. I am a little torn about why this might be the case. On the one hand, it might be that people simply do not understand the concerns of these workers. On the other hand, it is perhaps because government members are actually supportive of the inherent unfairness of the arrangements, given their stance on other industrial issues. But it is most likely to be simply that government members do not care. The government simply does not care about many workers being forced into positions where they have to accept a contracting arrangement for the convenience of their employers. In most circumstances the employees who have quickly become so-called independent contractors are not facing anything different in terms of their work or their relationship with their employer, but they are certainly facing additional uncertainty-additional uncertainty borne out of not being on the books in the same way: as opposed to being on wages, they are there simply as independent contractors. MAIN COMMITTEE",158,Committees
306,Mr Hayes (Werriwa) (12.20 Pm),"I would like to support the recommendations of theOf course, it does not stop there. The former employee, now a contractor, also faces considerable on-costs that once were borne by the employer. The contractor is expected to now make provision for their own superannuation, their own compensation premiums and any other insurance that may be required by the employer or by state or federal statute. While members opposite may say this is a fair thing, I have to say that from my perspective, and from that of the people in my electorate, it is completely unfair. The employer is getting all the benefits in the same way that they did before, but they are now able to avoid the additional on-costs associated with the direct hire of employees. The situation, quite frankly, is probably best described as all care with very little responsibility. In my opinion, this is a key thing that government members missed during this inquiry. Government members had the opportunity to recommend to the minister that, after weighing up all the evidence that was presented to them, there was a case for change. There was the opportunity to adjust what I consider to be these unfair arrangements. There was an opportunity to correct the record in that respect. They had the opportunity to support Labor’s bid to have an unfair situation corrected by recommending changes to the definition of an employee, moving away from a common-law definition and imposing an adjustment to the Workplace Relations Act. Instead, the government members stood firm with the decision to continue the situation in which an employer can get away with removing entitlements, exposing workers to unnecessary and unfair levels of risk, simply by redefining their classification. With the stroke of a pen, everything is removed and nothing is replaced when it comes to many cases of so called independent contractors. As the member for Gorton noted in his earlier speech on the report, there are myriad sham arrangements that have been entered into and taken advantage of by making employees contractors. These sham arrangements create a situation of disguising employment and they are simply unfair to workers who are forced to accept them, forced to take all of the risk and most of the cost-sometimes for very little or no additional return, I might add. These situations are simply wrong and should be stopped. It is not nearly good enough that they be allowed to continue and that people be allowed to take advantage of them, or at least of the results. The government had the chance to change this, or at least put on the record that it is wrong, by supporting a relatively simple amendment to the definition of ‘employee’. This could have been easily achieved through an amendment to the definition of employee contained in the Workplace Relations Act, as outlined in recommendation 2 of the dissenting report. The evidence to the committee was clear. When labour hire and independent contracting arrangements are entered into, the lines become extremely blurred. The lines are blurred not only for the purpose of assigning responsibility but also for the purposes of legal obligations that are created by these arrangements. The blurred lines and changed obligations mean that, at times, workers in these arrangements are far worse off than they ever were when they were direct hire employees. Their protections have been removed, their entitlements have been removed and they have additional on-costs foisted upon them. In most circumstances, when added up, this is all to their detriment. I note that the evidence to the committee showed that there are also concerns about permanency of arrangements, unreasonableness of working hours and the general treatment of the so-called independent contractor being worse than would have been the case had they remained as direct employees. These are serious issues and they reflect a legitimate concern for MAIN COMMITTEE those who are being taken advantage of under often unfair arrangements that they had no option other than to accept. I wonder if this is some sort of sign for the future of all other working Australians. The matters that this report deals with have a direct impact on many of my constituents. I know many of those in Werriwa are certainly concerned about the matters that came before this committee. RecentlyI had the opportunity to hear from and speak with a number of people who are deeply concerned about the government’s approach to independent contractors. These people were not just fearful for their own livelihoods but concerned about the future of their families. During the last sitting fortnight of this parliament, a delegation of independent contractors in the transport industry travelled to Canberra to defend their rights. This group rallied at the front of Parliament House in an effort to bring their plight and their fight to the members of this place. I attended that rally to show my support. Sadly, I have to say, I did not see many members from the opposite side there and that is probably why they are not so willing to participate in this debate. The transport workers also conducted a forum to which all members and senators were invited. The forum gave all of us here the opportunity to hear directly about their concerns. It also gave us the opportunity to hear from a number of experts, including academics in the field and wives and families of these contracted transport workers. While generally productive, the forum was interrupted by the member for O’Connor, who, it would seem, could not help himself when presented with an opportunity to put himself in front of a TV camera. A division having been called in the House of RepresentativesDebate (on motion by Mrs Gash) adjourned. Main Committee adjourned at 12.31 pm MAIN COMMITTEE Dapsone (Question No. 1322) Mr Edwards asked the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs, in writing, on 12 May 2005: (1) When and how extensively has Dapsone been used within the Australian Defence Force. (2) What side effects does Dapsone have. (3) Have tests ever been conducted in Australia to measure the side effects of Dapsone and have the results of these tests been made public; if so, where. (4) Have tests been conducted and results not been made public; if so, why. (5) Has Dapsone been linked to cancer. (6) Do US. Veterans’ studies show a link between Dapsone and brain tumours. Mrs De-Anne Kelly-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: The following answers are provided based on information available to the Department of Veterans’ Affairs. (1) The use of Dapsone as an anti-malarial was restricted to Vietnam. In Vietnam, Dapsone was first used in September 1967 when it became a drug used to treat active malaria. From November 1968 it was used as a malaria prevention drug. This continued until February 1970. During this time it is estimated that 23,400 persons took the drug. (2) Dapsone has a wide range of side effects. These include nausea, vomiting, headache and insomnia. Severe side effects include agranulocytosis, a condition in which the white blood cells die. (3) and (4) No tests have been made on Dapsone by DVA. The Department of Veterans’ Affairs commissioned several studies on the possible health effects of Dapsone. The largest of these was a cancer incidence study, which was released by the then Minister for Veterans’ Affairs in 1992. All studies were based on record searches, not testing of individuals. Two smaller record searches were also made, one of which was concerned with the side effects of Dapsone. They have been available to the public via the library of the Department of Veterans’ Affairs since 1994. Two case reports were published in the Medical Journal of Australia in 1970 and 1971. (5) No. There were suggestions of a carcinogenic effect in some reports several decades ago, but these have not been supported by more recent material. Dapsone is today not regarded as carcinogenic. (6) The Department of Veterans’ Affairs is not aware of any US studies that show a link between brain tumours and Dapsone. Medibank Private (Question No. 1926) Mr Georganas asked the Minister representing the Minister for Finance and Administration, in writing, on 9 August 2005: (1) Can he confirm whether a scoping study is under way or has been undertaken on the possible sale of Medibank Private.

On 16 August 2005 the Minister for Finance and Administration, Senator the Honourable Nick Minchin, announced the Australian Government had decided to review its ownership of Medibank Private and will update the 2003 scoping study. The scoping study update is expected to be completed by the end of this year. (2) The Government is reviewing its ownership of Medibank Private through an update of the 2003 scoping study. The update will include a consideration of the effects of a potential sale on Medibank Private’s customers. (3) The Commonwealth has $85,000,100 in paid up capital in Medibank Private as at 30 June 2005. (4) There is no direct correlation between Current Assets and Member Contributions. Member Contributions are treated as revenue in the year they are received with any surplus derived from the financial year being recorded as Retained Earnings in the Balance Sheet. Total Current Assets for 2003-04 were $1.0 billion and Total Member Contributions for 2003-04 were $2.4 billion.

The letter received by the member for Chifley was sent to all Australian households inviting people to register as potential organ donors on the Australian Organ Donor Register. The letter and brochure enclosed with it referred to several options for people to submit their registration or to gain more information on organ donation, including by: Completing the registration form and sending it to: Reply Paid 711, Hobart, Tas, 7001; Registering online at www.hic.gov.au; Telephone: 1800 777 203; or Visiting their local Medicare office.
