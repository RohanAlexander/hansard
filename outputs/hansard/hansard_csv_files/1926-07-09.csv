45,Mr Fenton,Does that apply to Austagonistic to the spirit of the League of,18,League Of Nations Sevent H Assembly
46,Mr Bruce,"No.that it should not operate u n t i l Germany had entered the League as a member, and there was an implied term, to which all the signatories of the pact had agreed, that Germany should have a permanent seat on the Council of the League. When the matter was considered by the Council, however, it was found that certain nations were not prepared to agree to Germany having a permanent seat on that body unless permanent seats were given to them also. On this subject. I shall not now repeat what I said in this House on a previous occasion, but I stress the fact that it is unfortunate that the admission of Germany to the League was prevented by the action of one, or perhaps two, nations which endeavoured to take advantage of the opportunity to enhance their own status in the League. ""Under the constitution of the League, a permanent member can be added to the Council only by the unanimous consent"" of the members of the Council, and with the assent of the majority of the Assembly. Unanimity could not be obtained in the Council, and, therefore, Germany could not be admitted. Thus the special session of the Leaguei n March proved abortive. All the members of the League recognized that the developments at that session endangered the lif e of the League, and it was decided that the composition of the Council should be reviewed by a special committee. That committee was appointed. It consisted of representatives of the nations that are members of the Council and of the following countries also:-Germany, Poland, Switzerland, the Argentine, and China. The com mittee met on the 10th May, and sat continuously unti l the 15th May. It has presented a first report, which will be considered at the forthcoming meeting of the Assembly. instructed to report to the Assembly1 report will be communicated to members of the League. importance of the matter to be considered by the committee, the Secretariat of the League communicated with all the member States, invitin g them to express their views regarding the composition of the Council. The Commonwealth Government felt that the issue was of such tremendous importance to the League that, as one of the nation members of the League, it should state its views definitely and clearly. Consequently, the following cablegram was sent on behalf of the Commonwealth Government to the Secretariat of the League for submission to the committee :(1) The Commonwealth Government is of thc opinion that the Council should continue to consist of permanent and non-permanent members. (2) As some principle must therefore bo laid down to determine what States shall be permanent memibers, the only one that it appears to the Commonwealth Government practicable and desirable to adopt in present circumstances is to restrict the. permanent seats to the recognized Great Powers. (3) It is desirable that a permanent seat on the Council should be given-to Germany when that country becomes a member of the League. (4) In order that the Council may carry out the duties imposed on it by the Covenant the number of its members' must necessarily be small in comparison with the number of the members of the League. The Commonwealth Government, therefore, feels that that body cannot, with advantage, be increased very much beyond its present size. (5) It is recognized that all the members of the League not permanently represented on the Council should have an opportunity of participating in the work of the Council. The Commonwealth Government, therefore, supports the principle of rotation being adopted as far as it is possible to do so, but at the same time it appears undesirable that a too rigid system should be laid down, as, for special reasons, it may be advantageous for a State to continue to sit on the Council as a non-permanent member for a period more or less long according to circumstances. (6) The Commonwealth Government, while of opinion that, as far as practicable, consideration should be given to geographical divisions in the appointment of non-permanent members of the Council, has grave doubts as to whether any advantage would be gained by a fixed number of the non-permanent scats being allocated in that way. (7) Should any discussion as to the rule of unanimity in respect to decisions of the Council be raised in the course of the committee's inquiries, the Commonwealth Government desires to indicate that it is opposed to any modification of this rule. This Government still adheres to the views expressed in that cablegram, and the In view of the instructions to the Australian delegates to the forthcoming Assembly will be on the same lines. I am not aware how many nations followed the same course, and forwarded their views; but after the committee had considered the opinions received, and had sat for the period I have indicated, it arrived at certain provisional findings which have been submitted tb all the members of the League,",18,League Of Nations Sevent H Assembly
47,Mr Maxwell,W as that committee,19,League Of Nations Sevent H Assembly
48,Mr Bruce,"To the Council, but itsand will form the basis of the discussion at the forthcoming Assembly. The first of the provisional findings of the committee is that the number of non-permanent members of the Council should be increased from six to nine. the event of Germany becoming a permanent member, the Council will consist of fourteen representatives. finding of the committee is that the nonpermanent members should be elected for a period of three years, one-third being elected each year, and that the retiring members should not be eligible for re-election u n t i l three years have elapsed, unless the Assembly, by a two-thirds otherwise. This finding, of course, gives effect to the view embodied in the Commonwealth Government's cablegram that' there should be some elasticity regarding the appointment of nonpermanent members, in order to meet the case of a country which has matters of vital importance under the consideration of the League. If such questions continued for a long period of years, it would be possible for that nation, subject to the will of a two^-thirds majority of the Assembly, to remain on the Council as a non-permanent member. mended that members so re-elected should not exceed one-third of the total number of the non-permanent members, which would mean that only three way. committee has unaoaimously approved of, and has submitted for the consideration of the members of the League, is that three seats on the Council should be allocated to L a t in American countries. Those are the only suggestions put forward, and it is certain that at the forthcoming Assembly, when this matter is considered, some modification of the present composition of the Council will be made. I think that the alteration will be on the lines in dicated in the cablegram sent by this Government. Honourable members may express their views generally on the subject. I remind them that this is an extremely important matter, because the Council is, in a sense, the executive of . the League. It is the Council that carries out the work of the League, whose success depends to a great extent upon -the composition of the Council, and the' performance of its functions by [155] that body with wisdom and discretion. The statement has appeared in the press that Brazil and Spain will both retire from the Leaguei f they are not granted permanent seats on the Thus, in Council. No official information to that effect has been received, and I should be reluctant to believe that the statement is The next accurate. It is, of course, open to any nation that is a member of the League to retire from it at any time, should it so desire; but the method of retirement is laid down definitely in the first article of the Covenant, which provides that a nation may withdraw if it gives two years' notice of its intention to do so. I majority, should declare cannot believe that any nation that is a member of the League, and has been associated with it from its inception, would take the action suggested in these reports. It it be true that any member of the League intends to take up such an uncompromising attitude it is to be deeply deplored, because to do so would be totally opposed to the spirit of conciliation and mutual good-will on which the League was founded It has been suggested that this step has been decided upon to uphold the dignity, honour, or prestige of the nations conB u t the committee has recomcerned. The preservation of a nation's dignity is a matter of importance to it , but we have moved a long way in this regard since the outbreak of the war. The covenant of the League co>uld be re-elected in that displays an entirely different spirit The other suggestion which the from that which existed previously among the nations. Before the war we had treaties of arbitration, and many attempts were made to bring about the peaceful settlement of international disputes; but in every case all questions touching the honour of the nations concerned were reserved. Now, however, the nations which are members of the League have agreed to submit any difference arising between them to arbitration or some other peacef u l method of settlement. This better spirit having arisen, I trust that wiser counsels w ill prevail, and that no nation w ill do anything that is likely to destroy the foundation upon which the League has been built. The representatives oÂ£ the Commonwealth w ill certainly do everything in their power to ensure that Germany shall enter the League at the next assembly, and be given a permanent seat on the Council. The next matter on which I wish exists a division of opinion, however, to touch is the reduction and limion the methods to be followed. tation of armaments. discussed at the forthcoming Assembly, ment must first be proceeded with, and and I desire to give a brief resume of that that will bring about security. what has taken place in regard to this The other group takes the view that extremely complicated matter. 8 of the Covenant of the League proand disarmament will naturally follow. vides that one of tfie chief objectives of These differences have appeared in all the League shall be progressive disarma-the discussions that have taken place. ment and the ensuring of world peace.

Admitting that disarmament depends on security, to what extent is regional disarmament possible in return for regional security? Or is any scheme of disarmament impracticable unless it is general?

All the matters affected by that series of questions are of vital importance, and should be studied by every person who has a sincere desire to achieve our great ideal of disarmament. paratory commission that was appointed divided itself into two groups, one of which was deputed to consider militai-y, naval, and air matters, and the other economic matters.

It may be said quite definitely that our delegates should do everything in their power to assist in formulating any practical scheme that might have the effect of reducing armaaway to render us assistance. ments and strengthening the security of the nations, with the object of maintaining world peace. Another matter with which I wish to deal is the International Economic Conference -There is much that we must consider in connection with it . The proposal to appoint it was made on the 25th September at the last Assembly on the following niotion by the French delegation:The AssemblyFirmly resolved to seek all possible means of establishing peace throughout the world; Convinced that economic peace will largely contribute to security among the nations; Persuaded of thc necessity of investigating thc economic difficulties which stand in the way of the revival of general prosperity and of ascertaining the best means of overcoming these difficulties and of preventing disputes; Invites the Council to consider at the earliest possible moment the expediency of constituting on a wide basis a preA paratory committee which, with the assistance of the technical organizations of the League and the International Labour Office, will prepare the work for The seventh question was-an International Economic Conference. The convening of this conference, under the auspices of the League of Nations, shall be a inatter for subsequent decision by the Council. In December of last year the Council appointed a preparatory committee to draw up a statement of m.atters suitable for discussion at an economic conference. The committee was composed of 37 individuals of different nationalities, and included prominent manufacturers and The precommercial men, economists, and representatives of the technical organizations of the League, the consumers, and the workers.

50,Its Report Mr Bruce,"The honourable memproblems; (2) industrial problems; (3) commerce and marketing problems. has already prepared a report, copies of which were circulated this morning, and I earnestly urge all honourable members to read it . If the committee is merely to collect statistics in regard to these matters and study them academically, there is possibly no danger in such an activity, although I suggest that these subjects could be dealt with academically and statistically without constituting such a committee. But if , as was obviously the intention of those who proposed the economic conference, the League of Nations is to be made responsible for giving effect to the resolutions of the conference, the scheme is most dangerous, and an example of the extremes to which misguided enthusiasts will go. attempt to make the League of Nations go too far and too fast must inevitably have the effect of destroying it . utmost caution and wisdom must be exercised lest a conference which might otherwise contribute to the solution of the world's economic and industrial problems, become a very dangerous instrument, liable to create international antagonisms and breaches of the world's peace, which we all are so anxious to maintain. I do not propose to deal exhaustively with the committee's report, but the questions with which it deals are of vital importance. For instance, under the heading of agriculture, this sentence appearsIt now remains to examine the commodities or classes of commodities which will form the subject of this inquiry. The statement then proceeds to enumerate 22 commodities, including the following which are of particular interest to Australia:-Wheat, , sugar, butter, cheese, f r u it , cotton, wool, hides, and skins. If the committee is to report upon the sources of supply of the world's foodstuffs and raw materials, it will be only a short further step from the apparently innocent collection of these statistics to the rationing of supplies throughout the world. The dangers inherent in such a scheme are so appalling that we must think carefully before we subscribe to any step that may lead to such a development. question which the committee proposes to consider is "" the extent and effect of producers' organizations in countries such as the United States of America, Canada, Australia and India, and other countries where such organizations exist.""' It is hardly necessary for me to emphasize the objections to that proposal. The organiIt zation of producers in a country may be right or wrong. It may have the effect, as we believe it has, of reducing the prices at which commodities can be sold in the world's markets, and thus be of advantage to the consumer as well as the producer-. Others may say that the purpose of sucb organizations is to maintain high prices to the detriment of the rest of the world. This is a matter for internal determination, and, if the League of Nations -attempts to regulate it , the nations of the world will refuse to accept the authority of that body, and coldness and indifference will replace their present enthusiastic desire to help it to effectively discharge its wider and more important functions. In regard to population, it is proposed that Any the committee should collect information upon certain points, includingartificial movements of population; emigration in its various forms, permanent and The temporary; . . . . population density in relation to cultivable areas, natural resources on tlie surface and underground, . . . . legislation affecting international migration in general. Surely a body engaged in analysing and reporting on the density of population i u different countries, tabulating their natural resources on the surface and underground, and describing and contrasting existing economic and industrial conditions, w ill be pregnant with danger to the world's peace. The third commission has prepared a preliminary d r a ft programme regarding commercial matters, which includes liberty of trading and prohibitions of importation and exportation on economic grounds, and "" prohibitions in tended to withhold certain produots from foreigners, or to allow their exportation only in return for corresponding advantages."" I need not dilate upon the dangers that are involved in such an inquiry. The restriction of imports and exports is a matter upon which every nation will demand absolute freedom of action, and the League can only interfere in such matters to its own undoing. I do not say that the League proposes to do these things. We may be told that the preAnother liminary committee of the economic conference is inteuded merely to conduct a desirable investigation with -a view to compiling useful information and making it available to all nations. My answer to that statement is that the League is already engaged upon difficult and complicated problems that cry urgently for a practical solution, and it should not needlessly dissipate its energies by the academic discussion of matters of domestic concern, outside interference with which will be fraught with danger -to the League and to the peace of the world. Another matter of great importance, although it does not appear on the agendapaper of the Seventh Assembly, is the adherence of the United States of America to the protocol establishing the Court of International Justice drawn up in 1920. Australia has ratified it . The Court isopen in principle only to members of the League of Nations; but provision exists whereby the United States may adhere to the Court. America is not a member, but one of her distinguished citizens is a judge of the Court. On the 27th January of this year the' American Senate, on the advice of the Executive, passed a resolution acceding to the protocol, subject to certain reservations. Two are of major importance, and the first isThe Court shall not render any advisory opinion except publicly after due notice to nil States adhering to the Court and to all interested States, and after public hearing or opportunity for hearing given to any State concerned; nor shall it, without the consent of the United States, entertain any request for an advisory opinion touching any dispute or question in which the United States has or claims an interest. The American adhesion is also accompanied by the following understanding :That recourse to the Permanent Court of International Justice for the settlement of differences between the United States and any other State or States can be had only by agreement thereto through general or special treaties concluded between the parties in dispute. I do not wish to deal at length with those reservations,or to say whether they are acceptable. that adhere to the Protocol establishing the Court to say whether they accept the reservations that the Senate of the United States of America has laid down. To enable this matter to be f u l l y investithe Attorney-General, who, as honourable gated by the nations concerned, a meeting has been called for the 1st of September, six days before the opening of the Assembly, and it is most desirable that Australia should be represented at that conference. The Australiau people generally desire that the United States of America should adhere to the Courti f it is practicable for it to do so on any terms that w ill be acceptable to the other nations. Mr Bruce. I wish in conclusion to refer to the ratificationof the international conventions that have been drawn up under the aegis of the League. Some time ago I gave the House information respecting the action that had been taken by the Commonwealth, and, although f t times we have heard it suggested that we have somewhat failed in our duty in this respect, there is no justification for that suggestion. That criticism relates, not to matters concerning the League of Nations itself, but to matters that concern the International Labour Organization and the conventions drawn up by it . Practically every one of those conventions concern industrial matters under the control of the States, and the Commonwealth has always done its part in referring them to the Statesf o r determination and action. Pederal concern about which no action has been taken. ber w ill direct my attention to them they w i ll receive attention. There has been a ratification by the Commonwealth of the convention relating to opium and other dangerous drugs, which was signed at Genevai n February, 1925. Another convention under consideration is the supervision of the international trade in arms and ammunition, signed on the 17th of June, 1925. The only country that has ratified that convention is Liberia; but it is to be hoped that its ratification will be simultaneously made by all the nations which have plant for manufacturing arms and munitions,, so as to bring about the control of this obnoxious and It is for all the nations dangerous industry. The personnel of the delegation which the Commonwealth proposes to send to the Assembly has already been announced to the House. It w ill be led by members on both sides will agree, is peculiarly fitted to be the chief representative of Australia at the League of Nations.

The formation of the League of Nations is the greatest attempt ever made in the world's history to ensure universal peace, and to bring about a better understanding between the nations. This is no party question in Australia, aud should not be one in other countries. Tb is hardly necessary for me to state that the Government takes the work of the League of Nations very seriously. This work is becoming increasingly important and greater in volume. The Government has made effective provision for dealing with it . We must not, however, expect too rapid progress towards the definite solution of all the problems which are being handled by the League. Points of view must be reconciled. Opposition ancl resistance can only be overcome in in these matters by persuasion and patience. plished. way in which the most difficult and complex international questions are now grappled with. This freedom of approach to these questions afforded by the League, which has been substituted for the old system when only too often proposals made by one government were viewed with suspicion and even hostility by others, indicates that great progress has been realized. Problems are half solved when this spirit has been created, and wheu the will to their solution is forthcoming. AVe, as a nation are prepared to do everything in our power to ensure the increase of its prestige and power for the future good of the world. We are clearly of opinion that the f u t u r e success of the League w ill depend upon the moral influence that it w ill wield and upon a proper understanding of its ideals by the peoples of the world. Until the League has behind it the force of public opinion, it w ill not accomplish what is desired of it . Certainly it will never accomplish the ends that we have in view if it attempts to effect its w ill by force and not by moral suasion. Debate (on adjourned.

I move That sub-section 1 of proposed new subsection 48A be omitted. I do this to test the feeling of the committee respecting the granting of pensions to judges. Under the bill, a judge who retires on account of infirmity after five years' service, will be entitled to a pension of one-fifth of his salary, which, in the case of a member of the H i g h Court bench, would be Â£600 per annum. The Arbitration Court judges would receive Â£500, and the chief judge of the Arbitration Court Â£600. Theb ill also provides for an additional pension at the rate of three one-hundredths of salary for each complete year of service after the expiration of five years to the date of the retirement. Therefore, a judge receiving Â£2,500 a year, aud retiring after ten years' service would be entitled to Â£500, plus Â£75 for each year of service after annum. AH i g h Court judge receiving Â£2,500 a year, and retiring after fifteen years' service would receive a pension of Â£1,500 a year, and the Arbitration Court' judges, with the exception of the chief judge, would receive Â£1,250 a year.

The House divided on non-party lines, and decided against that provision. Three members of that Parliament are now judges. Mr Justice Isaacs and Mr Justice Higgins are members of the H i gh Court and Sir John Quick is a Deputy President of the Federal Arbitration Court. I said in my second reading speech that all judges should come under a scheme of superannuation such as that applying to other members of the Public Service, and I see no reason to alter that opinion. Invidious distinctions in the Public Service are undesirable. not make a personal reference to the occupants of the H i g h Court bench. The many debates that have taken place in this House on old-age and-invalid pensions have convinced me that the Government is not so wishful to look after the interests of the workers as of the wealthy members of the community. During the past nine years I have taken part in five or six divisions on motions or amendments by which members of the Labour party have unsuccessfully tried to increase the old-age and invalid pension to Â£ 1 a week, and almost all those who voted against increased pensions for members of the working class are now supporting the huge pensions, up to Â£1,500 a year, provided for in this bill. difference between Â£1,500 and Â£52 a year. Those who are forced by economic circumstances to make application before a magistrate for an old-age or invalid penit is actuarially practicable to determine sion have generally had a long l if e of useful service to the community, but their wages have not been sufficient to enable them to accumulate enough wealth to keep them in their old age. ""When they make their application, they have to answer a large number of intimate questions as to their financial condition and domestic and business affairs. The interrogation, carried out as a matter of course by the presiding magistrate, who has hundreds of such persons to deal with, is often done in a cold and forma l manner, which is not only irritating, but judges was introduced, it also embarrassing, to the old people. We can imagine what the H i g h Court The judges would say if they were subjected many dependants they have, how much money they possess in the bank, whether they have shares in a company, and whether they own the house they live in . If such questions are good for one class of old-age pensioner, they are good for all classes. I do not approve of the present method by which magistrates hear applications for pensions, and I am not satisfied that the investigations are conducted in the right spirit. There are some humanitarian magistrates who know the psychology of the old people, and tactf u l l y cause them no embarrassment or humiliation. I cannot conceive of this Government proposing that H i g h CourtI n saying that, I do judges should be interrogated in the same way. The old-age pensioners who go before magistrates to seek a dole of Â£ 1 a week, which we were nine years in obtaining for them, are so circumstanced that they are forced to apply for the pension; but the economic conditions of H i g h Court judges and Arbitration Court judges should enable them to make provision for their old age. A superannuation scheme has been established by Parliament for other civil servants, and if the judges subscribed to that, it would place them in a sound economic position at the end of their term of service. That scheme is working quite satisfactorily. Public servants contribute so much a year, according to the number of There is a vast units of pension they are entitled to, and the Government contributes an equal amount. It is an invaluable f u n d io those who come under its provisions. If the amounts to be subscribed by, and to be made available to, letter-carriers, and clerks in the Trade and Customs, Defence, Postmaster-General's, and Home and Territories Departments, it is also possible to make the same calculation in respeqt of judges. Isi t because of their high position that it is proposed to treat judges differently from letter-carriers or clerks? Having given them salaries that are more than adequate, there is no reason why we should give them preferential treatment after their retirement. A judge",26,Judiciary Bill
56,Mr Blakeley (Darling ) [12.45],"is only a civil servant, and lie should receive no more consideration in this matter than the humblest public servant. The Ohief Justice of the High Court receives Â£3,500 a year, or Â£70 a week, which should enable him to make some provision for his old age, and, with the benefits of the Superannuation Fund, is all he should expect. Other High Court judges receive Â£3,000 a year, or Â£60 a week. The chief Arbitration Court judge receives Â£3,000 a year, and the other Arbitration Court judges Â£2,500 a year. Their pensions have been agreed to, and just as I protested against the granting of them, I pensions to the High Court judges. There is an extraordinary difference in about payments by the Government to different classes of persons. The Labour Government of New South Wales recently brought into operation a workers' compensation act, and to read the tory press of this country, one would think that a revolution was taking place in that State. About 40 insurance companies have, for political reasons, boycotted the act, and all the "" big guns "" of the tory party have been trained on the Lang Government for providing no more than paltry compensation to workers who are sick or maimed, and to the dependants of those who are killed in the course of their duties. Herald suggests that the workers will deliberately injure themselves in order to obtain compensation. many ridiculous things that are being said. under the act recognizes in only a small degree the services of the worker. The New South Wales Government has been compelled to undertake insurance business, and I have no doubt that the New South Wales Insurance Department, like the State Insurance Officei n Queensland, will control all the workmen's compensation insurance in that State. When those engaged in private enterprise, for partisan political reasons, refuse to carry out their duty to the society which allows them to function, it is time that the State took over the business, and excluded them from it entirely. Those who are attacking the compensation scheme in New South Wales would support such a bill as this. I protest against discriminating between judges and other public servants, and trust that when the vote is taken on the amendment, which I have very much pleasure in supporting, the majority of this Committee will agree to the elimination of the objectionable provision. Sitting suspended from 12.58 to 2.15 p.m. I support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Maribyrnong ( Mr protest against the payment'' of Fenton), because I strongly object to the inordinately large pensions proposed to be provided for members of the judiciary. Judges are generally drawn from the the views of certain people wealthy classes, and they must have been successful as barristers before their appointment. They have probably had remunerative practices at the bar, and they are often shareholders in wealthy companies, so that their economic position is assured. It is unnecessary to provide them with pensions on their retirement equal to half the amount of the large salaries provided under the bill. No ordinary member of the Public Service,, or of the community at large, receives a pension comparable with those proposed to be paid to judges. They can retain their positions even to the age of 70 or 80 years, when nobody would suggest, that they would still be able properly to perform their duties on the bench. Many members of the Public Service are as useful as judges to the community, but they are forced to retire at the age of 65 years on a comparatively small pension, largely provided by themselves. Wheni t is proposed to add a few shillings to the weekly wage of the workers, and reduce their The compensation provided for hours, honourable members opposite almost froth at the mouth; but when thousands of pounds a year are to be handed out to wealthy men who do not need the money, they have nothing to say by way of protest. The House recently refused to remove anomalies in the invalid and old age pension system, particularly those relating to invalid pensions. If the judges so managed their affairs that they were unable to provide for their retirement by means of such salaries-as are to be given them, they would show incapacity for their positions. If they were placed on the basic wage, or somewhere near it,",27,Judiciary Bill

Wales. cerned about that matter. If a State Government takes a particular line of action it is not necessary for this Parliament to follow in its footsteps. In 1918 I stated my reasons for opposing the bill then introduced to provide a pension for the first ' Chief Justice of the High Court, Sir Samuel Griffith, and I see no reason to change the opinion I then expressed. I intend to vote for the amendment, because the salaries originally provided, for judges of the High Court were determined on the distinct understanding that there should be no pensions. The judges accepted those terms, and I see no justification for altering the contract then made. I am in agreement with those honourable members who say that the judges ought to be paid good salaries. In most instances, members of the bar who accept judgeships do so at some monetary sacrifice, but they accept positions of great honour in which, they can serve the community, and in the case of most men, that honour compeusates for the monetary sacrifice involved. ( Mr Latham), for instance, is giving splendid service to the community, and I know that he is compensated for the great financial sacrifice involved by the satisfaction he has of knowing that he is doing so. That knowledge, I am sure, far more than makes up for what he is losing as a barrister. any member of the bar refusing to accept a judgeship because of the monetary sacrifice involved, and I doubt whether there is any instance on record if honourable of a leading member of the bar in any State refusing such an honour on that account. When speaking on the bill providing for a pension for the late Sir Samuel Griffith, I opposed it on the ground that we should first improve the position of those members of the commuI f it were proposed to bring nity who were far less happily situated than judges. I have been trying for some time to secure an increase in the I shall pensions for the blind, who are tremendously handicapped in life; but I have had the greatest difficulty in getting the slightest increase for them. UntilI find a greater readiness to make up to those who lack, I shall certainly not assist on exactly those who are so much better circumstanced. We see too much in life of I am not conthe practice of the giving to those who have. There seems to be something wrong with the social system, since the principle generally adopted is, Whosoever hath, to him shall be given; but whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken away even that he hath."" I shall give the greatest possible assistance to those who are down; but, until better provision is made for them, I shall not vote to give a pension to those who are up. though I did not speak on the motion for the second reading of this bill, and shall not delay honourable members very long in-discussing this clause, I must register my protest against its provisions. It was refreshing to hear the speech of the honwell), in which he referred to the marked disparity between the generosity the Government is prepared to extend to those high up in the scale of society and that shown to the aged and invalid. It has been said in private that this bill has been introduced because of the GovernThe present Attorney-General ment's desire to make changes on the High Court Bench.

Seeing that a constitutional session is to be held at Canberrai n twelve months' time, I submit that the whole question of the power, tenure, and emoluments of the judiciary should be deferred for consideration unti l then. If the Government thinks the matter urgent, it should have taken steps to submit a proposal to l i m it judicial tenure to the people at the coming referendum. In no other part of the B ritish Empire* are judges above the Parliament that appoints them; but here we cease to have any control over a judge immediately we appoint him. I shall not, at the moment, enter upon a discussion of the power vested in the H i g h Court, but it should not be overlooked that the United States of America, upon whose constitution ours is based, is suffering severely because of the enormous power exercised by the members of her Supreme Court. A body of public opinion is steadily growing there in favour of amending the Constitution to prevent the Supreme Courtf r o m exercising a power of veto in interpreting the Constitution. growth of our population our constitutional difficulties are steadily increasing. I do not desire to dip into ancient history, but honourable members know that the Dred Scott judgment of the Supreme Court of America practically precipitated the civil war there. Abraham Lincoln made some remarks which are pregnant w it h wisdom, and could well be applied to our present situation. He saidOur judges are as honest as otlier men, and not more so.

On those grounds, I am opposed to this b ill . I can see no reason why our judges should be allowed the plenary power that they at present possess; but, in any case, I submit that consideration of the whole matter could well be deferred u n t i l the constitutional session is held. of given pension privileges that are not given to other public servants. It would lessen public criticism considerably if the Government withdrew this bill, and provided a contribution superannuation scheme for judges, which would give them a moral right to draw a pension on retirement. Undoubtedly the object of the bill is to induce the judges to retire upon reaching the age of 70 years, or as soon afterwards as possible, and the proposal of the amendment of the honourable member for Macquarie ( Mr. Manning) was to reduce their pension for every year that they remain on the Bench after reaching the age of 70 years.

A few years ago I listened to piteous stories of the straits to which honourable members in this chamber had been reduced owing to the small return they received for their many and great services to the public. Having a faint streak of caution in my character, I -asked them to state their case in black and white, and sign their names to it. That they did, and the document stands on record to this day in proof that they did not believe in equality of reward, but considered themselves men from whom much was expected and to whom not enough was given. I am in favour of justices of the High Court receiving pensions, not out of consideration for them, but because of the benefits which I believe would thereby accrue to the community. With all due deference to the honourable member for Fawkner( Mr Maxwell)., I submit that that is the only angle from which we should view this Under present circumstances men are tempted to retain their positions on the bench .after the fine gloss of their .usefulness has become dimmed.

A judge, Mr Hughes. however, receives a fixed salary, and when he retires his income ceases. The only possible alternative to this bill is a scheme of superannuation. I assume that the Government is not prepared to substitute a superannuation system for the pensions which this bill proposes. If it were, 1 should support such a proposal. The system of British justice, and the methods by which' our. judges are appointed and hold office, is unequalled in Our judges could poison the any part of the world, and its fruits are visible to all men. Reference has been made to the judiciary of the United States of America. A few judges in America besides those of the Supreme Court are appointed for life; but most of them are elected, and anybody who knows the record of America must recognize that there is great room forimprovement in its judicial system. There judges have everything to gain from currying public favour. If the friend of a man exercising authority in a ward or district comes before a judge who owes his position to a party nomination, the ward boss says to the judge privately, "" This man is my friend"" ; and, human nature feeing what is is, the person accused escapes lightly; he takes old Mr Weller's advice and proves an alibi, or something equally useful. But in Australia a judge has nothing ito hope -for or gain from pleasing any individual or organization. Most of the members of the American bar who did me the honour of .receiving me had been judges. Mr Tafit, brother of a f ormer President, was one of them. They were staggered at being told that in-this matter. country the fact that a man held a position of authority, so far from being a recommendation to the court, and am assurance that he -would be treated with leniency, placed him at a disadvantage. The suggestion that we should follow the American example is most unhappy. Our present judicial system is based upon the. independence of the judges, to whom we pay a salary which usually is much less than the income of many a. practising barrister.

I am afraid that a blameless l if e might be pleaded in vain. The honourable member for Eeid( Mr Coleman) said that there was no urgency for this bill . That is an impotent argument.

The Attorney-General has declared that such I do not, and the a proposal would be unconstitutional. The Constitution is a remarkable instrument; it is protean-to-da y one thing, Perhaps he forgets that I to-morrow something else. But I admit that although I was for several years A t -' torney-General of the Commonwealth, many things escaped my notice, and I shall not venture to p it my untutored mind against the mature judgment of the I wonder what sort of honourable member for Kooyong.

Besides, no man should be the judge in his own case, and therefore, the people should be given an opportunity to declare whether or not judges of the H i g h Court should retire at 70 years of age. If there were sufficient members in the Parliament to carry such a proposal, it would become law, and later we should learn whether we had exceeded our legislative authority. In the meantime, I support the bill. The right honourable member for No r t h Sydney( Mr Hughes) referred to equal reward for equal service. I contend that that principle should be applied to this Parliament, because honourable members certainly do not receive a reward equivalent to their service.

The fact are not particularly attractive to the only gentlemen who are qualified to fill them. The rewards of the legal profession are much greater than the remuneration received by H i g h Court judges. That has always been the case in recent times. I am not suggesting to the committeeand I hope that no subsequent speaker w ill say that I have suggested-that the pecuniary consideration is the only one. At all times members of the legal profession . have been prepared to accept judicial pecuniary sacrifice, in order to render public service of a valuable and dignified character. service and the security of the position have weighed with them. While we have been fortunate in obtaining highly competent gentlemen for these positions in the past, these positions are not so attractive as are judicial positions in some of the States, owing largely to the reduced purchasing power of money. Honourable members should recognize that when, in the future, a member of the legal profession is invited to accept a position on the High Court bench, he, not unnaturally, may compare that position with those open to him in the judiciary of the States. Judicial positions in both Victoria .and New South Wales, owing to the provision of pensions and the small amount of travelling required of judges, are much more attractive to men at the age at which tbey are invited to accept positions on the Bench than Federal judgeships. is prepared to make positions on the High Court bench at least as attractive as a seat on the Supreme Court of a State! Tbis bill has. not been brought forward in the interests of the gentlemen at present constituting the High Court. No application has been made by. them for a pension.

If applications were The governing consideration is that all justices of the H i g h Court are, under the Constitution, entitled to hold office for life. The efficiency in which vacancies on the of that court is of paramount importance to the people of Australia. Honourable is that these positions members must recognize that, in the absence of pensions, justices of the High Court, being human, might, not unnaturally, give themselves the benefit of any doubt which might arise in the future as to their fitness to continue to discharge their duties. It is difficult to speak on this subject without appearing to make suggestions in relation to the present occupants of the Bench. I do not do t h a t ; but I say that under the present system it is impossible to be assured of the continued efficiency of the High Court. The positions at a considerable introduction of this legislation will tend to reduce the possibility of evils arising in the future. Honourable members have Their desire to give such referred to an occasion when a special pension was granted to Sir Samuel Griffith, the late Chief Justice of the High Court.

It is impossible for me to give personal details, but I point out that it is not very relevant to multiply by a number of years the annual salary received by any man for discharging public duties. I think that all honourable members will agree that the circumstances which induced Parliament to grant a pension to one. who had rendered very great service to the Commonwealth were indeed regrettable.

Finally, 1 remind honourable members that this bill has been introduced, as a matter of principle. It cannot be charged against the Government that in introducing this legislation it is looking for votes or is serving any powerful interests in the community. have avoided dealing with this question; instead, it took the view that to do so would be to evade a responsibility that it owed to the public. In order to discharge that responsibility, this bill has been introduced. Attorney-General need not have emphasized so strongly the last point of his argument that this is not a matter of vote-catching. No one suggested that it was, and I think he will admit that from all sides of the chamber the bill has been discussed apart from party or personal considerations. I agree with him that we ought not to discuss the question in its application to the judges now on the bench, but there is a principle involved, and on that we have a right to make our opinions known. The Attorney-General attempted to meet the argument about the questions put to applicants for old-age pensions-perslon s who, in most cases, have given many years of service to the community, and whose pensions, if granted, amount to f 1 a week. The only answer of the Attorney-General was that "" It is the law of the country."" Surely that is not an answer. imagine that our laws were like those of the Medes and the Persians-unalterable . If judges, who have served on the bench, are entitled to a large pension, irrespective of the money they possess, and without any investigation being made into their private affairs, so are the workers, who have served this country faithfully and well. The Attorney-General says that it would be an anomaly for us to refuse to pay pensions to judges of the High Reference has Oourt, because we have already agreed to pensions for Arbitration Court judges; but honourable members are not responsible for that anomaly, if it exists. This bill should have been submitted to this House before honourable members were asked to decide the proposal to pay pensions to Arbitration Court judges, which pensions should have been provided for in this bill instead of in the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill. The anomaly, which is put forward as an argument, is not the responsibility of honourable members, who wish to deal with this matter on principle, but of the Government, which has presented this legislation to Parliament in the wrong way. The Attorney-Genejral lattetmpted to Imeet the The Government could easily argument that judges should be brought under the Public Service superannuation fund. The contention of tliose who oppose pensions for judges is that no distinction should be made between judges and other public servants, who are rendering as honourable service to the people of this country. This Parliament ought not to lend itself to any distinction between different sets of public servants. is a difference between judges and other public servants, who are generally appointed to the Service when they are mere boys ? said that the judges were appointed when of advanced years, and that it would be impossible to formulate a superannuation scheme for judges on an actuarial basis. I dispute that, and no one can successfully argue that it is impossible to do a thing that has already been done in the Public Service. We passed a Superannuation Act about two years ago, and applied it to men who, in some instances, were within a month of the retiring age, and were more advanced in years than One would some of the judges. There is also the argument about the judges being few in number; but how does it make any difference whether they are seven or seven thousand? Actuarial calculations can be based on a small or a large number.

I suggest to him that there is only one alternative to that; to pay the salaries that will attract the right men. If this service is so high that we cannot obtain men for the salary we pay, then let the Government say what salary is necessary. Personally, I think we are paying very liberal salaries to the judges. The Attorney-General mentioned, but he did not emphasize the point so strbngly as the honourable member for Fawkner( Mr Maxwell), that there is more than a monetary consideration behind the acceptance of the position of judge of the High Court. a much more noble quality than that. It is a quality possessed by many persons besides judges-the desire to have the honour of serving one's country in a high position. That is a great factor in influencing men to accept such positions. The right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) indulged for a considerable time this afternoon in nothing more than special pleading, without a reasoned argument. He spoke of the arduous duties of the judges, and the trust reposed in them. taken for granted when they wore selected; but I submit that it has nothing to do with their pensions. If the services are higher than the salaries, then raise the salaries; but that is no argument for giving huge retiring allowances to to render any service. ciple of paying high salaries for high services is accepted; but the right honourable gentleman has no right to say that because a man has served so many years he is entitled to receive a reward for as long as he may live. His salary should cease when his services cease, and after that he should be entitled, like other public servants, to superannuation to maintain him for the remainder of his days. The right honourable gentleman told a pitifu l tale about these men; but I point out to the committee that one judge earns in two years as much as the average artisan earns in judges on a superannuation 30 years. If the artisan is expected, out The Attorney-General stressed of his small salary, to make provision for his declining years, it is surely not unsame. It is amazing to hear so many appeals, and so much special pleading, for men who are in the enjoyment of salaries from ten to fifteen times as high as those received by the great mass of the people, who have to pay the taxes out of which the judges' salaries are provided. I do not like to hear this special pleading on behalf of a select few. in the community. I cast no aspersion on any individual, but am prepared to pay my tribute to the high integrity of the men who sit on the bench of this country, although I would not place them on a pedestal and make a distinction in their favour against the rest of the community. The right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) stressed the view that the judges must be made independent, that they are in a position to do harm, and that their honour is at stake. I strongly resent that kind of argument.

The honourable member for Fawkner( Mr and it 'should be remembered that no Maxwell) made a pertinent interjection while the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) was speaking.

He must have judged us by his own standards. Our salaries were raised because it was considered that the services we render were not being adequately remunerated, pensions are provided for us. He also said that judges must be independent, and that he had never voted against increasing the wages of the workers. It is a notorious fact that when he was Prime Minister he actually interfered with the independent judgment of an Arbitration Court judge. Wheni t became known that the ex-President of the He could not Court, Mr Justice Higgins, was favorable to the granting of a 44-hour week, one answerhe amended the act to provide that three judges must determine that question. The determination of that issue was not more difficult than the settlement of a question of wages. Yet the right honourable gentleman tells us that we must make our judges independent, and that he had never done anything to interfere with the industrial conditions of the people. It is well known that his action on the occasion to which I refer was responsible for much of the industrial turmoil that has been experienced ever since. I have no desire to delay the committee further. Our position is a logical one. We say that there should be no distinction between members of the Public Service, and that the superannuation scheme should apply to judges as well as to the ordinary public servant.
