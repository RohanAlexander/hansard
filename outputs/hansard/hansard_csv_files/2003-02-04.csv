There are many stories of communities coming together to help. I had one reminder of that spirit when I met the workers of ActewAGL who worked day and night for nine days to restore power to the Canberra suburbs where power infrastructure had been destroyed. They were delighted to have had the opportunity of helping their fellow Australians. They were supplemented by people from the coalfields areas of New South Wales and from Victoria.

The following answers to questions were circulated: Aviation: Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport (Question No. 44) Mr Murphy asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 13 February 2002: (1) Has his attention been drawn to an article in the Australian Financial Review of 11 May 2001 titled “ACCC shot down over airport price regulation”. (2) Has the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) accepted a Federal Government direction to back Sydney Airport Corporation’s bid to secure an unregulated stream of revenue from non-aeronautical services such as shops and car parking. (3) What cost impacts will this direction have on consumers of (a) aeronautical and (b) nonaeronautical services. (4) Will he furnish a copy of the direction to Parliament; if so, when. (5) What public interest consultation was undertaken in making the direction. (6) Was the Board of Airline Representatives of Australia consulted. (7) What other public interest groups were consulted. (8) Does he agree with the ACCC head, Professor Fels’ prediction that this decision will result in higher prices. (9) What are the policy and moral grounds for the direction to the ACCC. (10) What are the public interest impacts of the decision on (a) consumers of airport services and (b) tenants of privatised airports, particularly service providers such as airline companies, on their profitability. (11) Will the direction have an adverse effect on profitability of airline companies and other service providers due to non-regulation of non-aeronautical services in Australia’s privatised airports. (1) Yes. (2) In assessing charges for aeronautical services at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) in its final decision did not take into account the revenues generated, or costs incurred, in the provision of services other than aeronautical services. (3) An estimation of the effect of the Direction on the calculation of allowable aeronautical revenue was included in the press release issued by the ACCC on 11 May 2001. (4) A copy of Direction No. 22 is publicly available on the ACCC website (www.accc.gov.au). (5) The Government is engaged in on-going consultation with the aviation industry on a variety of matters and is aware of industry views in relation to pricing issues at Australian airports. Upon receipt of Direction No. 22, the ACCC embarked on further consultations with interested parties before the release of its final decision. (6) The BARA provided a submission to the ACCC on SACL’s draft pricing proposal as well as in response to the Commission’s draft decision. (7) As noted in the response to question 5, the Government is aware of a number of interested parties views on airport pricing. The ACCC’s inquiry into the SACL price application involved lengthy consultation that was open to interested parties and the general public. (8) The effect of the ACCC’s decision on charges for aeronautical services is set out in the ACCC’s press release. (9) The Direction was intended to clarify for the ACCC the Government’s view that in assessing prices for aeronautical services at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport the Commission should not take into account the revenues generated, or costs incurred, in the provision of services other than aeronautical services.",105,Notices Ms Burke To Move
110,Mr Costello,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(10) Direction 22, by promoting efficient and commercial operations at Sydney (KSA) Airport is likely to lead to better services for consumers and airlines. (11) Aeronautical related services at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport and the privatised airports are subject to prices monitoring under s.27A of the Prices Surveillance Act. Aviation: Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport (Question No. 47) Mr Murphy asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 13 February 2002: (1) Has his attention been drawn to a media release from the Productivity Commission, dated 24 August 2001, titled “Price Regulation of Airport Services” in which the Productivity Commission recommends as its preferred option a five-year period of price and conduct monitoring for Sydney Airport, with no direct control over that period. (2) If so, (a) upon what policy basis is this recommendation based, (b) upon what policy basis and instruments is the existing regulatory regime of price caps and regulation founded, (c) will he table copies of these policy instruments in the House and (d) will he table the policy reasoning that has led to the recommendation by the Commission that a monitoring regime be initiated. (3) Further to the media release and an article at page 56 in the Australian Financial Review of 25-26 August 2001 concerning the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission’s (ACCC) overall ruling on Sydney’s aeronautical charges, (a) what is the policy rationale for the system of dual till pricing and (b) what impact will a dual till pricing system have on charges for consumers. (4) Does the Commission’s judgment conflict with the ACCC’s overall ruling to increase aeronautical charges. (5) What impact will the ACCC’s decision to increase aeronautical charges by 97% have on the second till non-aeronautical tenants, including shop owners, parking station owners and restaurants at Sydney Airport. (6) Will the 97% increase in aeronautical charges decrease turnover for the non-aeronautical tenants at Sydney Airport due to increased airfares and other charges thus economically pricing out prospective consumers of Sydney Airport services. (7) Will the new two-till system enable the prospective bidders for Sydney Airport’s airport lease to increase non-aeronautical tenants’ rents, thus decreasing profitability for those non-aeronautical tenants at Sydney Airport. (8) Will he provide case references for the court actions referred to in the Australian Financial Review article. (9) Are the terms of settlement between the parties in the litigation matters in the public interest and should be disclosed. (10) In which court did the proceedings take place. (11) Were proceedings in the relevant court closed proceedings. (12) Are the terms of the out of court settlement in the public interest and do they warrant public scrutiny. (13) Do the terms of the out of court settlement directly impact on persons not party to the legal proceedings, including the general public and non-aeronautical tenants of Sydney Airport; if not, why not. (14) Upon what policy basis does the Productivity Commission seek to avoid the currently high level of regulatory involvement. (15) Will he seek to challenge the Commission’s findings regarding its judgment or does he agree with the Commission’s findings; if so, why; if not, why not. (16) Why does the Commission consider the current level of regulatory involvement as high. (17) Will he seek advice from the Commission to explain what is the existing policy of the current regulatory regime. (18) Are aeronautical services for Sydney Airport subject to price surveillance and are aeronautical related services subject to price monitoring. (19) Is Sydney Airport subject to pricing regulation under the Prices Surveillance Act. (20) Is Sydney Airport further subject to the current regulations under the Prices Surveillance Act made in 1997. (21) Would the current arrangements of pricing regulation apply only for the first five years of operation of the lease of Sydney Airport and Sydney Basin airports. (22) Further to the statement in relation to terms of reference No. 5 of the Commission draft report titled “Price Regulation of Airport Services”, (a) what is the policy rationale for the premise that the price caps applied to aeronautical services will no longer operate, (b) what is the policy rationale for applying this regulation for only a five year period, (c) what event or milestone date did the Government contemplate in 1997 that predicated a sunset clause to terminate a price surveillance regulatory regime such as the 1997 regulations and (d) were the regulations instituted with a view to the elimination of price capping in 2002; if so, what is the policy basis to eliminate the price capping provisions in 2002. (23) Did he contemplate in 1997 the sale of Sydney Airport by transfer of the airport lease from Sydney Airport Corporation to a private person; if so, at the time of making his prices surveillance regulation that currently regulates Sydney Airport, did he know that the airport would be leased to a private entity or corporate person who is not the current lessee. (24) In 1996 when the then Minister for Transport and Regional Services made his second reading speech on the Airports Bill 1996, was it stated that Sydney Airport would not be sold until Sydney Airport’s aircraft noise problems had been solved. (25) Did he know whether the pricing regulatory regime must accommodate a financial component that satisfies all policy objectives of Government, including solving Sydney Airport’s aircraft noise problems through the full introduction of the Long Term Operating Plan (LTOP) and the completion of a genuine environmental impact statement (EIS) for Sydney West Airport and the construction of that airport. (26) Does paragraph 8(1)(b) of the Productivity Commission Act state that a general policy guideline of the Commission is to reduce regulation of industry, including regulation by the States, Territories and local government, where this is consistent with the social and economic goals of the Commonwealth Government. (27) Is he able to say whether the LTOP is a Ministerial Direction issued by power given to the Minister for Transport and Regional Services under section 16 of the Air Services Act. (28) Is the LTOP, for the purposes of paragraph 8(1)(b) of the Productivity Commission Act, a social and economic goal of the Commonwealth Government; if not, why not. (29) Is the construction of Sydney West Airport at Badgerys Creek a social and economic goal of the Commonwealth Government, pursuant to paragraph 8(1)(b) of the Productivity Commission Act; if not, why not. (30) Is it reasonable for the Commission to accept submissions at public hearings into the draft report on the Price Regulation of Airport Services, concerning the two relevant social and economic goals of the Commonwealth Government referred to in part (25). (31) Is it reasonable for the Commission to consider these goals when considering the terms of reference to the Price Regulation of Airport Services at Sydney Airport; if not, why not, given paragraph 8(1)(b) of the Productivity Commission Act. (32) Can price regulation be used to administer environmental control of Sydney Airport in meeting the Government’s social and economic goals and fulfilling the LTOP. (33) Does paragraph 8(1)(e) of the Productivity Commission Act state that a general policy guideline of the Commission is to recognise the interests of industries, employees, consumers and the community, likely to be affected by measures proposed by the Commission. (34) Does the Sydney Airport Community Forum (SACF) and its members represent members of the community likely to be affected by measures proposed by the Commission; if not, (a) why not and (b) will he notify the Productivity Commissioner under the powers given him pursuant to subsection 8(2), that the SACF and its members be considered members of the community likely to be affected by measures proposed by the Commission; if not, why not. (35) Is he able to say whether, by virtue of membership of the SACF, members of the SACF constitute part of a statutory committee established under the auspice of the Commonwealth Department of Transport and Regional Services and as such, constitute a formal element of the public interest process of community consultation as established by the Minister for Transport and Regional Services. (36) In fulfilling its obligations under section 8 of the Productivity Commission Act, must the Commission consider environmental and ecological constraints as part of the Act’s general policy guidelines; if not, why not. (37) Will he notify the Productivity Commissioner in writing under the powers given him pursuant to subsection 8(2) that the (a) full implementation of the LTOP and (b) construction of Sydney West Airport before the sale of Sydney Airport as a strategic solution to solving Sydney Airport’s aircraft noise problems, are matters going to the operation of paragraph 8(1)(b) as a social and economic goal of the Commonwealth Government and need to be considered as part of the Commission’s terms of reference in respect to the draft report on Price Regulation of Airport Services; if not, why not. (38) Is the Commission’s scope of inquiry into Price Regulation of Airport Services narrow as it has not been directed to report on whether relevant Government social, economic and other goals are adversely affected, compromised or negated; if not, why not. (39) Is the Commission’s direction of recommendations flawed in that the Commission is not being called upon to identify relevant issues going to social and economic goals. (40) For the purposes of clause 9 of the draft report’s scope of inquiry, do key interest groups and affected parties include the SACF and its members. (1) Yes. (2) (a) The Productivity Commission (PC) stated the reasoning for its recommendations in its inquiry report on “Price Regulation of Airport Services”. This report is available on the PC’s website at www.pc.gov.au. (b) The prices oversight regime is designed to strike a balance between protecting airport users from monopoly pricing and creating the conditions for commercially-driven decisions on the part of the airport operators. The Instruments, which provide the framework for prices oversight at core-regulated airports, are publicly available on the ACCC website at www.accc.gov.au. (c) Refer to the response to 2(b). (d) Refer to the response to 2(a). (3) (a) Direction No. 22 (so-called ‘dual till’ direction) was issued by the Government in order to clarify for the ACCC the Government’s view that in assessing prices for aeronautical services at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport the ACCC should not take into account the revenues generated, or costs incurred, in the provision of services other than aeronautical services. (b) The estimated impact of the ACCC’s decision on charges was set out in the ACCC’s press release of 11 May 2001. (4) No. (5) Aeronautical related services at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport and the other core regulated airports are subject to prices monitoring under s.27A of the Prices Surveillance Act.

111,Mr Costello,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(16) Refer to response to question (2)(a). (17) No. (18) Aeronautical and aeronautical related services at Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport are subject to price monitoring. Further details are contained in the instruments which implement the prices oversight framework. These are available on the ACCC website. (19) Yes. (20) Refer to response to question 18. (21) Refer to response to question 15. (22) Refer to the PC inquiry report on “Price Regulation of Airport Services”, 23 January 2002, and the Government’s response to the report, 13 May 2002. (23) The sale of Sydney Airport was contemplated in 1997, however the timing of the sale was not confirmed until 2001. As you would be aware, in September 2001 the Government decided to defer the sale until 2002. (24) The second reading speech on the Airports Bill 1996, stated that the Government’s election commitments included that Sydney and Sydney West would be withdrawn from the airport leasing process until there is a solution to the aircraft noise issues there. (25) The pricing regulatory regime was not designed to achieve the Government’s policy objectives on aircraft noise and Sydney West Airport. (26) Paragraph 8(1)(b) of the Productivity Commission Act states that in the performance of its functions, the Commission must have regard to the need to reduce regulation of industry (including regulation by the States, Territories and local government) where this is consistent with the social and economic goals of the Commonwealth Government. (27) Yes. The LTOP is a Ministerial Direction issued by power given to the Minister for Transport and Regional Services under subsection 16(1) of the Air Services Act. (28) The Government remains fully committed to sharing the noise generated by Sydney Airport. It is clear that under the Long Term Operating Plan (LTOP) aircraft noise is being shared much more fairly than under the previous Labor Government’s regime. The Plan has re-opened the east-west runway, introduced a much greater spread of flight paths, and provided communities periods of respite through rotating the use of runways. (29) The Government has concluded, after lengthy and careful consideration, that Sydney Airport can continue to meet the growing level of air travel demand and that it would be premature to build a second major airport for the city. (30) The PC concluded its report on 23 January 2002. (31) Refer to response to question 30. (32) There are a number of regulatory controls already enshrined in Commonwealth legislation which ensure that Sydney Airport is operated in an environmentally acceptable manner. The Sydney Airport Curfew Act 1995 imposes a curfew on the Airport. The Sydney Airport Demand Management Act 1997 ensures that no more than 80 movement slots are allocated in any one hour. The Long Term Operating Plan (LTOP) for Sydney Airport, which is implemented under a Ministerial Direction issued under the Air Services Act 1995, ensures that the noise is shared and that the east-west runway is used to the greatest practical extent. The Air Navigation (Aircraft Noise) Regulations require individual aircraft to meet specified noise standards. (33) Paragraph 8(1)(e) of the Productivity Commission Act states that in the performance of its functions, the Commission must have regard to the need to recognise the interests of industries, employees, consumers and the community, likely to be affected by measures proposed by the Commission. (34) Refer to response to question 30. (35) Yes. (36) Paragraph 8(1)(i) of the Productivity Commission Act states that in the performance of its functions, the Commission must have regard to the need to ensure that industry develops in a way that is ecologically sustainable. Where appropriate, this may extend to considering environmental and ecological constraints. (37) No, as the Productivity Commission has completed its review of Price Regulation of Airport Services. (38) No. In addition to the matters specified in its terms of reference, the Commission must have regard to a range of social and economic factors in carrying out its public inquiry functions under the Productivity Commission Act 1998. These include: the need to facilitate structural changes in the economy and to avoid social and economic hardships arising from those changes; a recognition of the interests of industries, employees, consumers and the community likely to be affected by the measures proposed by the Commission; and a need to increase employment and promote regional development. (39) Refer to response to question (38). (40) Yes. Roads: National Highway (Question No. 329) Mr Martin Ferguson asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 14 May 2002: (1) What sum has been, or will be, spent on the National Highway in each year from 1995-96 until 2005-2006. (2) What proportion of these funds has been or will be spent on (a) planning and design, (b) construction and (c) maintenance in each of those years, by State or Territory. The following table shows the amounts spent or estimated to be spent on the National Highway for each State and Territory from 1995-96 to 2005-06, with the amounts split between (a) planning and design, (b) construction; and (c) maintenance. The amounts set out for planning and design are for identified planning studies.

Immigration: Ship Jumpers (Question No. 348 amended answer) Mr Martin Ferguson asked the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, upon notice, on 14 May 2002: (1) In 2000-2001, what has been the cost to shipping companies for ship jumpers who are in detention centres. (2) What was the cost to each shipping company to return ship jumpers back to their country in 2000– 2001. (3) What has been the average time ship jumpers have remained in detention. (4) How many ship jumpers in 2000-2001 lodged immigration applications. (5) In 2000-2001, how many unauthorised ship jumpers had successful migration outcomes and of these, (a) how many were successful protection visa applications and (b) from which countries did they originate. (6) Is it still the case that crew entering Australia by ship are covered under the Special Purpose Visa. (7) Is there a requirement by Australian Customs Service officers to notify his Department of all ship entries and the number of crew on each ship. (8) What, if any, checks are carried out by his Department regarding character issues of any crew on ships. (9) Are any checks carried out against his Department’s movement alert list; if not, why are they exempt. (10) How many migration applications by ship jumpers in the last three financial years were rejected on grounds of character. (11) How many applications for the period 1 July 1996 to May 2001 had successful protection applications and what were the nationalities of these people. In substitution for the answer which appeared in Hansard page 4770 of 27 June 2002: (1) Under the Navigation Act 1912, as opposed to the Migration Act 1958, shipping companies are responsible for the costs of removing crew who desert their vessels. The Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (DIMIA) does not record data on the cost to each shipping company of removal of deserters. (2) See answer to part (1) above. (3) The average time deserters remained in detention in Australia in 2000-2001 was 55 days. (4) In 2000-2001, 3 deserters lodged protection visa applications. (5) Of the 3 deserters who lodged protection visa applications in 2000-2001, (a) 1 was successful and (b) the applicant was a PRC citizen. (6) Yes, crew of non-military ships entering and departing Australia during the course of their voyage are taken to hold Special Purpose Visas. (7) There is no requirement under the Customs Act to notify DIMIA of all ship entries and the number of crew on each ship. However, the Australian Customs Service (ACS) checks details of all crew and passengers on each ship entering Australia against ACS and DIMIA alert lists and reports to (8) ACS checks all crew and passenger lists against ACS and DIMIA alert lists, reports any persons of concern to DIMIA and seeks direction before the vessel enters an Australian port. (9) See answer to (8) above. (10) The Department does not keep separate data on deserters whose visa applications have been rejected on character grounds. (11) For the period 1 July 1996 to May 2001, 9 deserters were granted protection visas in Australia; of these 4 were from Iran, 1 from Algeria, 1 from Turkey, 1 from PRC and 2 were stateless persons. Australian Accounting Standards Board (Question No. 371) Ms Burke asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 16 May 2002: (1) What role does the Accounting Standards Board have in the setting of standards for the accounting industry. (2) Do the standards developed and approved by the Accounting Standards Board apply to the insurance industry. (3) Following the collapse of (a) United Medical Protection (UMP) and allegations that the accounting practices used by UMP were other than standard within the industry and (b) HIH, has the Accounting Standards Board undertaken investigations into this matter; if not, why not; if so, (i) what investigations were carried out (ii) what conclusions have been drawn from those investigations and (iii) have the results and conclusions been communicated to the accounting and insurance industries. (1) The functions and powers of the Australian Accounting Standards Board (AASB) are set out in section 227 of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001. The AASB makes accounting standards for entities required to prepare financial reports under the Corporations Act 2001, as well as for public sector and not-for-profit entities. (2) Entities such as registered general insurers, registered life insurers and medical defence organisations (MDOs) would generally be reporting entities under the Corporations Act and therefore are subject to accounting standards.",112,Questions On Notice

114,Mr Costello,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(3) (a) (i) The AASB’s Urgent Issues Group (UIG) examined issues related to the recognition of claims by MDOs, including claims incurred but not reported (IBNR), that is, liabilities arising from incidents in relation to which a claim has not yet been notified, during 2001. (ii) In June 2002, an Abstract was agreed by the AASB requiring MDOs to account for IBNR liabilities. (iii) Yes. (b) The AASB will consider the need to review AASB 1023/AAS 26 in the light of any further information that may emerge from the HIH Royal Commission or any relevant Royal Commission recommendations. The AASB plans in any event to review its insurance standards in the process of contributing to the development of a standard on insurance by the International Accounting Standards Board. Education: Advanced Diploma of Interpreting and Translating (Question No. 658) Ms Gillard asked the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, upon notice, on 19 August 2002: (1) How many students graduating from the Advanced Diploma of Interpreting and Translating to date have been granted a Graduate Skilled Temporary Visa, subclass 497. (2) Is he aware that the Advanced Diploma of Interpreting and Translating gives graduates a professional accreditation as awarded by the National Accreditation Authority for Translators and Interpreters, yet overseas graduates of this course cannot be granted a Graduate Skilled Temporary Visa, subclass 497 as the course has not been undertaken in English. (3) Does an anomaly exist in that the overseas graduates in the Advanced Diploma of Interpreting and Translating, requiring an advanced level of bilingual proficiency to graduate, are unable to be granted a Graduate Skilled Temporary Visa, subclass 497 as the course has not been undertaken in English. (4) Will he review the Graduate Skilled Temporary Visa, subclass 497, to enable overseas students graduating from the Advanced Diploma of Interpreting and Translating to apply for this visa category considering it is impossible to produce bilingual professional translators completing courses in English only. (1) The Department has no record of an overseas student having been granted a Graduate Skilled Temporary Visa after graduating from an Advanced Diploma of Interpreting and Translating course. (2) The onshore General Skilled Migration (GSM) program was introduced on 1 July 2001. It enables eligible overseas students to be exempted from the recent work experience requirement if they demonstrate that they completed a degree, diploma or trade qualification in Australia with the medium of instruction in English. It is correct that to date the Adelaide Skilled Processing Centre has been refusing GSM applications from overseas students who have an Advanced Diploma in Interpreting and Translating from an Australian institution because they do not meet the ‘all instruction in English’ requirement. (3) The policy intention was to maintain the integrity of the GSM program by excluding overseas students who gain tertiary qualifications in Australia in a Language Other Than English (LOTE), in particular, those gaining qualifications in their mother tongue. It was not the policy intention to exclude interpreters and translators who have a pre-existing advanced level of proficiency in the English language. I agree that it is not appropriate to exclude such persons from the GSM program because they do not meet the ‘all instruction in English’ requirement. (4) My Department has reviewed the policy in relation to Advanced Diploma of Interpreting and Translating courses. I have agreed that such courses meet the requirement that all instruction be in English, for the purposes of the GSM program. Science: Stem Cell Research (Question No. 662) Mr Murphy asked the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 19 August 2002: (1) Is the Research Involving Embryos and Prohibition of Human Cloning Bill 2002 ostensibly a Health portfolio matter; if not, why not; if so, why was it not introduced by the Minister for Health.",115,Dimia If There Are Any Persons Of Concern On A Ship
115,Mr Ruddock,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(2) Is it his understanding that both the Government and Opposition parties in the House of Representatives and in the Senate have agreed that this bill be determined by a conscience vote; if so, what is his definition of a conscience vote. (3) Is he aware that on Sunday, 11 August 2002, there was a public meeting at the Wesley Theatrette, 220 Pitt Street Sydney, attended by in excess of one thousand members of the public; if so, has he been issued a transcript or video/audio tape of the proceedings at that meeting. (4) In light of the overwhelming evidence against the experimentation on human embryos, will he now declare his opposition to this bill and recommend to his parliamentary colleagues and all Members of Parliament in both Houses to do likewise; if not, why not. (5) Does the bill define the term ‘human embryo’; if so, is a human embryo a human being; if not, why not. (6) In introducing the bill, did he state that he could not find a sufficient moral difference between allowing embryos to succumb in this way and destroying them through research that might advance life-saving and life-enhancing therapies. (7) What life-saving and life-enhancing therapies does he refer to with respect to embryonic stem cell research. (8) In light of the overwhelming evidence presented by the various speakers at the Wesley Theatrette on 11 August 2002, are the real gains in medical science in the discovery of the life-saving and lifeenhancing therapies to be found in adult stem cell research; if not, why not. (9) Is he able to say which medical, chemical and other corporations have an interest in this bill; if so, who are those corporations and what are their interests. (10) Which sectors of the Australian and international economy will benefit financially from the introduction of this bill. (11) Has adult stem cell research demonstrated substantial medical advancements in the treatment of (a) regeneration of tissue from heart attack sufferers, (b) paraplegia from damaged spinal chords, (c) sickle cell anaemia, (d) insulin dependant diabetics, (e) regeneration of immunity systems, (f) eye damage and (g) brain cell re-implantation in the partial treatment of symptoms of Parkinson’s disease. (1) Yes. The Bill is a Health portfolio matter. The Minister for Ageing, the Hon Kevin Andrews MP, has portfolio responsibility for this matter. I introduced the Prohibition of Human Cloning and Research Involving Embryos Bill 2002 into the parliament to stand by my commitment to the Council of Australian Governments agreement of 5 April 2002 to introduce Commonwealth legislation by June 2002. The Minister for Health and Ageing has introduced the two new bills, the Prohibition of Human Cloning Bill 2002 and the Research Involving Embryos Bill 2002 into the Senate. (2) I have allowed the Government a conscience vote on splitting the original Bill and subsequently on the Prohibition of Human Cloning Bill 2002 and the Research Involving Embryos Bill 2002. I understand that the Opposition did the same. A conscience vote, or a free vote, occurs when a party has no particular policy on a matter or when a party feels that members should be permitted to exercise their responsibility in accordance with their conscience. A conscience vote is one in which a member is able to vote based on his or her own values rather than party lines. (3) Yes; no transcript or video/audio tape has been drawn to my attention. (4) No. I support the Research Involving Embryos Bill 2002 because I do not consider there is a sufficient moral difference between allowing embryos to succumb and destroying them through research and because I have been advised that ongoing research into both adult and embryonic stem cells will allow all potential therapies to be explored. I have allowed a conscience vote on this issue and therefore have not recommended members vote in a particular way. (5) Yes. Human embryo is defined as a live embryo that has a human genome or an altered human genome and that has been developing for less than 8 weeks since the appearance of 2 pro-nuclei or the initiation of its development by other means. In relation to whether a human embryo is a human being, as I said in my summing up speech of the second reading debate in the House, “there is no one christian tradition that instructs us as to where life starts”. (6) Yes.",116,Dimia If There Are Any Persons Of Concern On A Ship
116,Mr Howard,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(7) I have been advised that research on both adult stem cell and embryonic stem cells could lead to life-saving and life-enhancing therapies for diseases such as diabetes, Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer's disease. (8) I am advised that there have been significant developments recently in research using adult stem cells, however, I have also been advised that we need to pursue both embryonic and adult stem cell research to maximise our chances of discovering cures to diseases. (9) The Bill provides a framework for research. I cannot say what this leads to in terms of the potential interest of medical, chemical or other corporations in subsequent commercial applications. (10) In finding cures and treatments for disease, medical, scientific and research organisations would be required to carry out extensive research and commit a large amount of resources. Those organisations that do find cures and treatments for disease may benefit financially from their work. (11) (a) to (g) I understand that a range of studies, in both adult and embryonic stem cells, using both human and animal tissues has demonstrated the potential of stem cells for the development of therapies for a range of diseases. Aviation: Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport (Question No. 664) Mr Murphy asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 19 August 2002: (1) How many breaches of the Sydney Airport curfew have occurred since 1 October 1998. (2) What are the times and dates of breaches since 1 October 1998. (3) What is the name of the airline company and type of aircraft responsible for each breach since 1 October 1998. (4) Have any fines associated with these breaches been visited on the airline companies; if so, what are the full details, including the names of the airline companies and the time and date of each breach incurring a fine; if not, why not. (5) Will he ensure that all airline companies are fined where a breach of the Sydney Airport curfew occurs which is due to the fault of the airline company; if not, why not. (1) There have been nine breaches of the Sydney Airport Curfew since October 1998. (2) to (4) Details of the nine breaches are as follows: Date Time Name of airline Type of aircraft Fine9 February 1999 11:30pm KLM/Alitalia Boeing 747 Nil 27 February 1999 01:43am Thai Airways Boeing 747 $10,000 27 January 1999 04:37am Capital Jet Charter Cessna Citation525 Nil 21 February 1999 00:19am Capital Jet Charter Cessna Citation525 Nil 21 February 1999 01:12am Capital Jet Charter Cessna Citation525 Nil 18 March 1999 05:26am Capital Jet Charter Cessna Citation525 Nil 24 March 1999 05:21am Capital Jet Charter Cessna Citation525 Nil5 May 1999 11:13pm Olympic Airways Boeing 747 Nil 26 June 2000 11:30pm Lauda Air Boeing 777 $10,000 My Department pursues each breach, depending on advice from the Director of Public Prosecutions, and the outcome of each case, as the Honourable Member is aware, is a matter for the Court’s decision.

117,Mr Anderson,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:Australian Bicycle Council: National Strategy (Question No. 686) Mr Martin Ferguson asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 19 August 2002: (1) Has his attention been drawn to objectives 2.1, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.5, 5.1, 5.4 and 6.4 of Australia Cycling: The National Strategy and the attribution of responsibility to the Commonwealth Government for their implementation. (2) To what extent has development occurred on policies, planning procedures, regulations and initiatives at a Commonwealth level to achieve this strategy aim. (3) To what extent has development occurred on the creation of an integrated cycling network, within and between communities, and the development of a national standard for such a cycling network. (4) How many new and renovated public and private developments, including end-of-trip facilities for cyclists, have been undertaken since the commencement of the National Strategy and where are they located. (5) On which buildings, transport nodes and public places have end-of-trip facilities for cyclists been fitted. (6) Has development occurred on a national public communication strategy to improve the awareness of all (a) road users on how they can better share roads and (b) path users on how they can better share paths; if so, (i) what is the extent of the development, (ii) has the strategy been implemented and (iii) what measures prove community awareness of the strategy. (7) Are cycling aspects taken into consideration during road safety audits and blackspot identification; if so, (a) what cycling factors are considered, (b) who is responsible for considering these factors and (c) where is this consideration documented. (8) Has development occurred on road users behavioural programs or initiatives to improve cyclist safety; if so, (a) what is the extent of the development, (b) how is it being implemented and (c) what measures are there to indicate success. (9) Has development occurred on a national marketing strategy to promote cycling and its benefits; if so, (a) what is the extent of the development, (b) at what cost to the Commonwealth and (c) what measures are there to indicate success. (10) Has data been collected and or research commissioned by the Commonwealth providing information to assist decisions made about cycling issues; if so (a) what does the data or research reveal, (b) where can the information be accessed and (c) what cost has been incurred by the Commonwealth in this data collection and research. (11) What community education programs have been implemented aimed at encouraging adults to cycle and what has been the cost to the Commonwealth of the programmes. (1) Responsibility for the overall implementation of Australia Cycling, rests primarily with the State, Territory and Local Government authorities, which are best placed to determine local solutions and funding requirements. The Commonwealth also acknowledges a shared responsibility with the States and Territories for some of the strategy’s specific objectives. Its contributions to these are coordinated through the Australian Bicycle Council (the Council), which is the body that was established to oversee implementation of the strategy on behalf of all jurisdictions. The Commonwealth also provides the Secretariat to the Australian Bicycle Council. (2) The Commonwealth continues to support development of policies, regulations, planning and procedures that support the National Strategy through its participation in the Australian Bicycle Council. Relevant portfolios also contribute to policy areas such as road safety and sustainable transport, which support the objectives of the National Strategy. For example the Commonwealth is committed to making improvements to road safety awareness and supports the National Road Safety Strategy 2001 to 2010, which commits all governments (Federal, State and Territory) to achieving better safety outcomes for road users, including cyclists. The Department of Transport and Regional Services (DOTARS) has also arranged for a representative of the Australian Greenhouse Office to provide a presentation on their Travel Demand Programme at the July meeting of the Australian Bicycle Council. This provided an opportunity for",118,Dimia If There Are Any Persons Of Concern On A Ship
118,Mr Anderson,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:the Council to identify synergies between Australia Cycling and activities at the Commonwealth level. In addition DOTARS has also recently amended the Bass Strait Passenger Vehicle Equalisation Scheme so that cyclists are also eligible for a rebate for the costs of shipping their bicycle by ferry between the mainland and Tasmania. This decision supports Objective 2 of Australia Cycling by ensuring cycling is valued appropriately in policies and planning. (3) The Australian Bicycle Council has been working to highlight the need to develop nationally consistent standards for the use of coloured bicycle lanes and the development of appropriate signage for bicycle paths. The Commonwealth does not have jurisdiction over the development of cycle ways as State, Territory and Local governments are responsible for the planning and regulation of local roadways including cycling networks. However the Commonwealth continues to support the development of policies to support integrated cycle ways through its participation in the Council. (4) The Commonwealth supports objective 3 of Australia Cycling to promote end-of-trip facilities that encourage increased cycling. However the development of local roads and cycle ways including the establishment end of trip facilities for cyclists are the responsibility of State, Territory and Local governments (in particular Planning and Road Traffic Authorities) and private developers. (5) The Commonwealth does not keep records of all the buildings in Australia that have end-of-trip facilities for cyclists. (6) (a) and (b) The Council has determined its priorities for the implementation of the strategy and has at this stage not commenced development of a communication Strategy for road and path users as these objectives are largely being met by State Governments. For example, there have been Share the Road campaigns in SA, WA, QLD and NSW. In addition Bikewest in WA produced a leaflet called ’Using Shared Paths with Courtesy and Safety’ and the NT has produced a brochure on cycling on the road which included cyclists rights and obligations on the road and how to use shared paths. As mentioned above the Commonwealth also supports road safety measures under the National Road Safety Strategy. The aim of the ten-year strategy is to reduce the national road fatality rate by 40% through the implementation of successive National Road Safety Strategy Action Plans. Priority safety measures for cyclists identified in the current 2001 and 2002 Action Plan include targeted promotion of helmet use, support for school-based education programmes and increased cycle paths and lanes. (7) Yes. (a) The factors to be considered in the assessment of hazardous road locations are outlined by Austroads, the Association of Australian and New Zealand road transport and traffic authorities, in a range of published guides to traffic engineering practice. Of particular relevance are Austroads’ ‘Road Safety Audit’ (Austroads Publication No. AP-30/94 or AP-G30/02), Guide to Traffic Engineering Practice Part4 – Road Crashes (AP-11.4/88) and Guide to Traffic Engineering Practice Part 14 – Bicycles (AP-11.14/99). (b) The responsible road authority. (c) The responsible road authority would typically hold a site assessment and/or Road Safety Audit report. (8) Yes (a) The National Road Safety Strategy Action Plan 2001 and 2002 recognises that bicycle safety will benefit from measures aimed more directly at car drivers, such as alcohol control and speed management initiatives. A key example is the progressive introduction of 50 km/h urban speed limits, which is providing improved safety and amenity for cyclists in many jurisdictions. (b) A proposal to lower the default urban speed limit specified in the Australian National Road Rules to 50 km/h is being developed for submission to Ministers of the Australian Transport Council. The ATSB provided funding of $30,000 in 2000-2001 and advice to assist with the preparation of a comprehensive regulatory impact statement supporting the proposal to introduce 50 km/h urban speed limits. (c) The success of the National Road Safety Strategy will be based on overall long-term reductions in National Road Toll Statistics. State, Territory and local governments are also undertaking individual programs. (9) The Council is undertaking a number of actions to market and promote the benefits of cycling including: Developing a set of key messages that will be used to promote cycling and its benefits. The messages will target key occupational groups such as the police force, town planners and the members of the health profession; Upgrading the Council website to provide more comprehensive progress updates on the status of implementation of the National Strategy and other relevant cycling events; The Council is undertaking a study of national cycling data that will assist in identifying cycling trends. Among other things its is expected the outcomes of this study will assist the Council to more effectively target relevant sectors of the community in promoting cycling; and Developing a banner stand to be used at the Bicycling Australia Show and future events to promote cycling and the National Strategy. (b) DOTARS bears the costs of maintaining the Council website and is also funding the development of a banner stand that will be used to promote the National Strategy at the Australian Bicycle Show and relevant events in the future. (c) The performance measure formally under Strategy 5.1 of Australia Cycling is the community reports increased knowledge about the benefits of cycling. (10) The Council is undertaking a study of national cycling data to identify and compare trends in bicycle use between states and territories and address inconsistencies in data collection methodologies through the development of appropriate guidelines. The Australian Transport Safety Bureau also collects national data on bicycle road fatalities to assist policy makers to monitor safety trends for cycling. (a) The National Cycling Data study indicates some inconsistencies in the data collection methodologies applied between states and thus the results obtained. The Council is developing a discussion paper that will highlight this issue and make recommendations to address this problem in the future. (b) The ATSB data is published in the Road Fatalities Monthly Bulletin and the Road Fatalities Australia Statistical Summary. (c) The Commonwealth bears the expense of maintaining the ATSB data on cycling road fatalities. The expense of the National Cycling Data Study is shared by all jurisdictions. However the Commonwealth Department of Health and Ageing provided the funding for the original guidelines. The Council also undertook a project with Austroads funding to develop guidelines on Forecasting Demand for Cycling Facilities to assist providers in determining future development needs. (11) Relevant State, Territory and Local government authorities are responsible for community education programmes aimed at encouraging adults to cycle. A key example is the adult riders’ course developed by CyclingSouth in conjunction with the Hobart City Council. There are no costs to the Commonwealth associated with such programmes. Immigration: Asylum Seekers (Question No. 692 amended answer) Mr Martin Ferguson asked the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, upon notice, on 19 August 2002: (1) Further to the answer to question No. 348 (Hansard, 27 June 2002, page 4770) concerning ship jumpers, who met the cost of detention and removal of the 18 crew members who deserted their vessels in 2000-2001. (2) Were there incidents of people jumping ships in 2001-2002; if so, (a) how many people did so, (b) what was the cost of detention and removal of these people, (c) how many of these people lodged immigration applications and (d) what was the (i) nature, (ii) outcome and (iii) country of origin of each applicant. (3) How many ship jumpers have been granted protection visas each year from 1996-97 and from July 2000 to May 2001, and of these, are there still some in progress and not finalised. (4) For each of the last 10 financial years, (a) how many ship jumpers were there and (b) what payments under the Migration Act were made by shipping companies for the cost of detention and removal of each ship jumper. (5) Is there a requirement under the Customs Act to notify his Department of all ship entries and the number of crew on each ship; if not, what action has his Department taken to change this in light of the terrorism attacks of 11 September 2001 and the need to protect Australia’s borders. In substitution for the answer which appeared in Hansard page 7075 of 23 September 2002: (1) Shipping companies are responsible for costs associated with removal of crews who desert their vessels. The Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (DIMIA) does not record data on the cost to each shipping company of detention and removal of deserters. (2) Yes. (a) 43. (b) $22,200. (c) 30. (d) (i) 28 Protection Visa applications; 1 Bridging VisaE (BVE) application; 1 Special Category Visa (SCV) application (ii) 15 Protection Visa applications refused; 1 BVE granted; 1 SCV granted; all other applications continue to be processed (iii) Of the persons refused Protection Visas 10 were from Bangladesh, 2 from India, 2 from Iran and 1 from Egypt; the 1 SCV applicant was from New Zealand; the 1 BVE applicant was from Sri Lanka; of the persons whose applications are still being processed 4 are from Iran, 3 from Egypt, 3 from Turkey, 1 from Bangladesh, 1 from Myanmar, and 1 from Pakistan. (3) Statistical reports on deserters are not available prior to October 2000 when new procedures for the recording of deserters were put in place. Of the persons who deserted ship between July 2000 and May 2001, 1 was granted a protection visa, and there are no unfinalised protection visa applications from that time. (4) See answer to (3) above. (a) 2001-02 43 deserters; 2000-01 69 deserters; and 1999-00 65 deserters (b) DIMIA does not record data on the cost to each shipping company of detention and removal of deserters. (5) There is no requirement under the Customs Act to notify DIMIA of all ship entries and the number of crew on each ship. However, the Australian Customs Service (ACS) checks details of all crew and passengers on each ship entering Australia against ACS and DIMIA alert lists and reports to events of 11 September 2001, and continue to be enforced. Civil Aviation Safety Authority (Question No. 790) Mr Martin Ferguson asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 20 August 2002: (1) How many actions were exercised by the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) under Civil Aviation Regulation 269 (CAR 269) in each of the past five years. (2) In how many actions was no further action taken. (3) How many actions resulted in CASA recommendations to the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) for further legal action or prosecution action against operators. (4) Of those recommendations to the DPP for further legal action or prosecutions, how many were proceeded with, and of these, how many resulted in successful prosecutions, failed prosecutions or were withdrawn. (5) How many were appealed and what was the outcome.",119,Dimia If There Are Any Persons Of Concern On A Ship
119,Mr Ruddock,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(6) For each prosecution or legal action, what sum was spent by the commonwealth for each case and what was the cost for each agency involved. (7) For each prosecution or legal action, what sum (a) was recouped from prosecuted operators and (b) did the Commonwealth pay in costs to operators. (8) With respect to CASA’s power to cancel, suspend or vary aviation operators’ certificates under CAR 269, what is the internal CASA process taken to establish the veracity of a planned action before it is proceeded with. (9) At what level of management are decisions under CAR 269 determined. (10) Is each stage of a planned action recorded; if so, where is the file held and is it subject to Freedom of Information procedures; if not, why not. (11) Does the decision making process assess the impact of an action under CAR 269 on the reputation or viability of an operator, or is safety the only consideration. (12) If an action is not proceeded with, or is subsequently stopped or withdrawn, does CASA apologise to the operator or issue any public notice advising that the action will not proceed and offer reasons why; if not, why not. The Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) has provided the following advice. (1) The Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) does not centrally record each action exercised by CASA under Civil Aviation Regulation (CAR) 269. To extract the requested information would require a review of each action commenced by the CASA within the last five years to determine if the action was exercised using CAR 269. CASA is unable therefore to provide the requested information without a significant input of resources. (2) See1 above. (3) Over the five-year period, 123 matters were referred to the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP). (4) Over the five-year period the DPP commenced prosecution action in 67 matters. 21 matters were withdrawn and 58 convictions were recorded. These figures do not amount to 67 referred actions, as some matters that are recorded as being finalised during the period were in fact referred to the DPP prior to the 5-year period. Similarly, some matters that are recorded as being referred to the DPP during the 5-year period are still awaiting assessment. The situation is summarised below. Referred to DPP Summons signed Finalised Withdrawn Acquitted Convicted 1998 12 6 11 5 1999 21 12 30 3 2000 39 19 34 5 17 2001 35 21 41 11 3 27 2002* 16 9 11 2 0 9 Total 123 67 127 21 3 58 * Figures for 2002 are for the period 1 Jan to 31 July 2002 (5) Appeals are handled by the DPP. CASA does not maintain records of the outcome in these cases. (6) (7) Costs of prosecutions and other DPP action are matters for the DPP. (8) Action to cancel, suspend or vary Air Operator’s Certificates is not taken under CAR 269. Such action is taken under sections 28BA, 28BB and 28BC of the Civil Aviation Act. The process followed by the Authority when cancelling, suspending or cancelling an Air Operator’s Certificate is detailed in the Compliance and Enforcement Manual. This manual is available on the CASA website at wwww.casa.gov.au. (9) Delegations under CAR 269 are restricted to General Manager, or higher, level. (10) Yes. Each stage is recorded on a CASA In-Confidence file at the office where the action was commenced. The General Manager, General Aviation Operations also commences a CASA InConfidence file in the event the action results in a recommendation to the General Manager for cancellation, suspension or variation of the licence against which the action was commenced. CASA records are subject to Freedom of Information procedures in accordance with the requirements of the Freedom of Information Act.",122,Dimia If There Are Any Persons Of Concern On The Ship These Procedures Were In Place Prior To The
120,Mr Anderson,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(11) CASA is required to exercise its powers and perform its functions in accordance with the requirements of the Civil Aviation Act 1988. Under sub-section 9A(1) of the Act, CASA must regard the safety of air navigation as the most important consideration when exercising its powers and performing its functions. (12) Before taking action under CAR 269, CASA is required to issue a Show Cause notice. CAR 269 requires that the person receiving a Show Cause notice be given a reasonable opportunity to show cause why CASA should not take the proposed action. In the event that a person provides acceptable reasons why it would be inappropriate for CASA to take the proposed action, CASA will not proceed with the action. CASA will advise the person of its decision and the reasons for the decision. This process is not a public process and CASA does not generally publicise that it has issued a Show Cause notice to a person. It would therefore be inappropriate for CASA to issue any public notice that it is not proceeding with a particular show cause action. Whether or not CASA apologises to the person concerned depends upon the circumstances of each case. Communications, Information Technology and the Arts: Staffing (Question No. 801) Mr Martin Ferguson asked the Minister representing the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, upon notice, on 20 August 2002: (1) How many (a) full time permanent staff, (b) part time permanent staff, (c) full time contract staff and (d) part time contract staff were employed by (i) the Minister’s Department and (ii) agencies within the Minister’s portfolio as at (A) 30 March 1996 and (B) 30 June 2002. (2) For each category of engagement referred to in part (1) and employed by (a) the Minister’s Department and (b) agencies within the Minister’s portfolio, where were such persons located in (i) 30 March 1996 and (ii) 30 June 2002. has provided the following answer to the honourable member’s question: (1) (A) The information sought by the honourable member in relation to part (1) (A) and part (2)(i) of his question is not readily available and I am not prepared to authorise the use of the resources that would be required to provide that information. I am able to inform the honourable member, however, that data on APS staffing as at 30 June 1996 is contained in the Australian Public Service Statistical Bulletin 1995-1996 which is publicly available. The honourable member should be aware, however, that changes in APS functions and administrative arrangements between 1996 and 2002 may render direct comparisons between the data for those years invalid.

Aviation: Maroochydore Airport (Question No. 826) Mr Martin Ferguson asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 20 August 2002: (1) Has the Minister been contacted by Freedom Air in relation to a proposal to conduct flights from New Zealand to Maroochydore Airport; if so, when and what was the Minister’s response. (2) What aviation and customs related charges are imposed by the Commonwealth or Commonwealth agencies on a foreign airline landing at Maroochydore airport. (3) How do these costs compare with the costs for a foreign airline to conduct the same flights to Brisbane airport or Cairns airport. (4) Are there any infrastructure, technical or policy barriers to the operation of foreign airline operations to Maroochydore airport; if so, what are they and what sum would they cost to provide. (1) No. (2) Aviation charges imposed on airlines by Airservices Australia at Maroochydore Airport are for Terminal Navigation Charges (TNC) only. The cost for international and domestic services are the same. (3) Airservices Australia has advised that charges for B737-300 aircraft (56,740 kg maximum take off weight) at Maroochydore, Brisbane and Cairns airports are as follows: Tower Airservices Terminal Navigation Airservices Aviation Rescue and Fire Charge (TNC) Charge per tonne Fighting (ARFF) Charge per tonne landed landed (incl GST) (Incl GST) Maroochydore $7.42 N/A Brisbane $4.96 $1.46 Cairns $8.75 $3.83 (4) From the perspective of the Department of Transport and Regional Services there are no policy barriers to the operation by foreign airlines of international flights to Maroochydore Airport. In respect to the rights of foreign airlines to operate international flights to Maroochydore, the Government’s regional package allows unrestricted access to regional international airports. The regional package is being included progressively in air services arrangements with our bilateral partners. Airports may be designated as international where facilities are available for the formalities incident to customs, immigration, quarantine and other requirements in connection with the arrival in or departure from Australian territory of aircraft. The provision of such facilities is a matter for discussion between these agencies, the airport operator and the airline. Prior to commencement of any international services, Maroochydore Airport would be required to discuss implementing a checked baggage screening program with the Department of Transport and Regional Services.",130,Dimia If There Are Any Persons Of Concern On The Ship These Procedures Were In Place Prior To The
123,Mr Anderson,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:Shipping: Foreign Seafarers (Question No. 828) Mr Danby asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 21 August 2002: (1) Is he able to say whether the productivity level of 25 Ukranian seafarers is equivalent to that of 17 Australian seafarers aboard the CSL Yarra. (2) Is it detrimental to Australia’s security to have Australian merchant ships crewed by foreign seafarers. (3) In times of conflict would Australia’s economic independence be affected without an Australian flagged and crewed fleet. (4) Did Australia use foreign ships to take personnel and materiel to East Timor in 1999; if so, why. (1) CSL makes the commercial decisions in respect of the number of crew and its productivity. CSL, like other ship operators, are required to meet international standards of safety and marine environment protection. The port state control program administered by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority is aimed at ensuring compliance with those standards. (2) Merchant ships with foreign crew members come to Australia to carry our international trade. The Government is working with the International Maritime Organization (IMO) on developing an International Ship and Port Facility (ISPS) Code. This will mean that all ships and ports involved in international trade will be subject to strong security measures, and those that are not compliant with the Code will be prevented from trading. (3) On all advice to me, no. (4) The logistics for the East Timor operation were organised by the Department of Defence. I am advised, however, that both Australian and foreign vessels were used according to the capability and availability of the vessels for the requisite tasks on a strictly commercial basis. North-West Shelf Venture: Revenue (Question No. 850) Mr Fitzgibbon asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 26 August 2002: (1) What are the revenue implications for the Commonwealth of the decision of the North West Shelf Venture partners to allow the China National Offshore Oil Company equity in the project. (2) What are the revenue implications for the Commonwealth of the decision to give China exclusive rights to ship liquefied natural gas from Australia to China. The decisions of the North West Shelf Venture partners to allow the China National Offshore Oil Company (CNOOC) to take equity in the project and participate in shipping LNG arise from a commercial agreement. The Government is not party to the agreement and therefore cannot quantify the revenue implications. Transport: Roads of National Importance Program (Question No. 907) Mr Martin Ferguson asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 16 September 2002: Further to the answer to question No. 330 (Official Hansard, 20 August 2002, page 5279) concerning funding under the Roads of National Importance program, for (a) 2002-2003, (b) 2003-2004, (c) 20042005 and (d) 2005-2006, which projects have been identified in each State and Territory and what sum has been allocated to each project in each of those years.

(2) Has work been undertaken in the electoral division of Wills; if so, what percentage has been completed; if not, when will it be completed. (3) How frequently is the addresses register updated in the electoral division of Wills. ourable member’s question: (1) The Physical Address Register Verification Project does involve Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) staff physically verifying addresses. However, the AEC has not undertaken to visit every address in each division. A pilot Physical Address Register Verification exercise was undertaken in Tasmania resulting in a recommendation that only addresses with street numbering be considered for verification in this manner. Some verification work has also been undertaken in New South Wales and Western Australia. The AEC will be undertaking an evaluation of the Physical Address Register Verification before deciding whether to extend the process nationally. (2) No Physical Address Register Verification work has been undertaken in the Division of Wills and at this stage there are no plans or funding to undertake this exercise in the immediate future. (3) The Address Register is updated in every Division, including the Division of Wills, every time an enrolment form is received for an address that is not included on the Address Register. However, new addresses are only added after the address has been checked as being valid. In most cases, divisions would up date the Address Register each day. Agriculture: Dairy Regional Assistance Program (Question No. 944) Mr Fitzgibbon asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 23 September 2002: (1) What is the total sum allocated to the Dairy Regional Assistance Program.

(2) What was the purpose of each visit?",137,Attachment A
130,Mr Downer,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(1) Based on records held by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the following is a list of Federal parliamentarians who have visited Taiwan in the last 3 years. Providing data beyond 3 years solely for the purpose of answering the honourable member’s question would be a major task and I am not prepared to authorise the expenditure of resources and effort that would be involved.

MP and Mr Alby Schultz MP Senator Sandy Macdonald November 2002 To support the development of economic and other people-to-people contacts with Taiwan. (2) As listed above. Australian Defence Force: Defence Housing Authority (Question No. 961) Mr Edwards asked the Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 26 September 2002: (1) Is the Defence Housing Authority (DHA) planning to make substantial special dividends to the Government instead of improving stock numbers, quality of housing and improvements in singles accommodation; if so, why. (2) Has $84 million in DHA property value been surrendered to the Government for the Sydney Harbour Federation Trust. (3) What difficulties are anticipated as DHA disengages from pre-1996 leases and what strategies are and will be implemented to overcome these difficulties. (4) How many staff does DHA employ, what is the State and Territory breakdown of that staff and what was the corresponding figure for each of the previous 6 years. (5) When is it anticipated to present the proposed amendments to the DHA legislation to Parliament. (6) What are the anticipated risks in the over-reliance on private investor leasing arrangements and what contingencies have been implemented to cover these risks and ensure they are properly managed. (7) What are the salary levels of the Chairman and Director of the DHA and what are the individual areas of expertise they bring to DHA. (8) Is she aware of the concerns of Australian Defence Force families about the continued run down of DHA owned housing stock and what is the Government doing to either halt the run down or address these concerns. (9) What are the repair and maintenance budgets for DHA housing for each financial year from 19992000. (10) How many individual business units exist within DHA and for each, (a) where they are located, (b) how many staff does each have, (c) how many clients does each serve and (d) are they run as separate organisational delivery and profit centres; if so, how (i) are they managed and (ii) are profits distributed. (11) Will she table a copy of the services agreement with her Department under which it is claimed price and risk sharing arrangements, services and payments are being made. (12) Given that the total value of properties being managed by DHA on behalf of Defence is approximately $3.8 billion, of which $1.4 billion is owned by DHA, what is the breakdown of ownership of the remaining $2.4 billion. Mrs Vale-The answer to the honourable member’s questions is as follows: (1) No. (2) Yes (3) DHA seeks to convert 30% of pre-1996 leases to post-1996 leases and replace the remainder of houses required by new stock. The main problem that could arise would be an inability to persuade sufficient lessors. Should this occur, DHA will increase its plans to acquire new stock including direct leasing and increase reliance on rental allowances. (4) 658 staff as at 30 June 2002. The distribution of staff members by State and Territory, and the corresponding figures for previous years were: Date ACT NT QLD NSW VIC TAS SA WA TOTAL 30 June 2002 294 45 96 134 39 2 20 28 658 30 June 2001 204 28 65 97 27 2 16 20 459 30 June 2000 113 21 49 55 22 2 13 15 290 30 June 1999 84 16 42 51 18 1 14 13 239 30 June 1998 84 21 45 63 26 1 12 14 266 30 June 1997 74 22 50 62 33 2 13 13 269 30 June 1996 75 22 50 75 50 3 12 15 302 * Note: ACT staff numbers include Head Office employees (5) It is not possible at this time to indicate a time frame for their presentation to Parliament. (6) Over reliance on private investor leasing would increase DHA’s risk of not having access to sufficient properties in the event that lessors refuse to renew the leases. DHA mitigates this risk by owning certain properties close to military bases where land is not available to replace the houses, and by continually reviewing its reliance on private investor leasing in the light of demand and market conditions. (7) Salary details for Directors are determined and published by the Remuneration Tribunal. Profiles of Directors are published in the DHA Annual Report. (8) DHA regularly consults the Australian Defence Force families on housing needs and it is represented on the DHA Board by the Defence Families of Australia Convener. DHA is continually improving the quality of its stock and its planned increased reliance on private investors through the Sale and Leaseback Program is important in this regard. DHA modifies its risk as indicated in 6 above. (9) 1999/2000 $21.3 million 2000/2001 $29.1 million 2001/2002 $30.7 million 2002/2003 $33.6 million (10) Business Units within DHA: (a) Defence member services: Tenancy Management Property Management Relocation Services Home Owner (b) Sales and Development. (c) Investment Management. All business operations are managed through DHA’s Head Office located in Canberra with regional operations carried out through regionally based Housing Management Centres. As the majority of DHA staff carry out activities for each business line, staff numbers by business line cannot be provided. These business lines are run as profit centres, however, dividend distributions to the Government are made out of DHA’s consolidated corporate results rather than from the business lines. (11) No. The document is Commercial-In-Confidence. (12) The ownership of the $2.4 billion of stock under management is by private investors who lease their houses to DHA on long-term lease arrangements. Health: Breast Cancer (Question No. 966) Ms Vamvakinou asked the Minister representing the Minister for Health and Ageing, upon notice, on 14 October 2002: (1) What was the level of partial and radical breast mastectomy in terms of (a) the number and (b) percentage of total breast cancer patients in (i) 1996, (ii) 1997, (iii) 1998, (iv) 1999, (v) 2000 and (vi) 2001 on a national and State and Territory basis. (2) What was the level of breast reconstruction in terms of (a) the number and (b) percentage of total breast cancer patients in (i) 1996, (ii) 1997, (iii) 1998, (iv) 1999, (v) 2000 and (vi) 2001 on a national and State and Territory basis. (3) What were the waiting times for breast prostheses or forms for patients following a partial or radical mastectomy in (i) 1996 (ii) 1997 (iii) 1998 (iv) 1999 (v) 2000 and (vi) 2001 on a national and State and Territory basis. the honourable member’s question: (1) (a) The most recent data specifically on the number of mastectomies can be derived from the National Hospital Morbidity Database, which provides information about the number of breast mastectomies and all subclassifications for the years 1996-2000. The data collection focuses on hospital procedures rather than individual patients. The following table gives nationally the total number of mastectomy procedures performed, for separations with a diagnosis of primary or secondary neoplasm of the breast (female breast cancer only): 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000 2001 (six months only) 5982 6347 6539 6556 6541 3051 From the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare. Additional data can be found at the following website: www.aihw.gov.au. Data from the year 2001 is not yet available. (b) (i-v) Data published in Surgical management of breast cancer in Australia in 1995 (Hill et al.) found that approximately 49 per cent of women with breast cancer had mastectomy surgery. Women with early breast cancer from non-urban areas were more likely to have a mastectomy (54 per cent) compared to women with early breast cancer from urban areas (44 per cent). This is the",147,Norco Upgrade Of Ice Cream Manufacturing Division Commercial
131,Mr Andrews,"The Minister for Health and Ageing has provided the following answer toonly comprehensive published national data available on breast cancer treatment patterns. It describes each incident of breast cancer notified to cancer registries throughout Australia between April and September 1995. (b) (vi) A direct request would need to be made to each State and Territory cancer registry to obtain any data broken down by State and Territory classification. (2) (a) The most recent data on the number of breast reconstructions can be derived from the National Hospital Morbidity Database, which provides information about the number of general breast reconstructions for the years 1996-2000. Some of the coding systems in use, however, do not specify breast reconstruction following mastectomy. The data are available on a national basis, through the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare at www.aihw.gov.au. Data for the year 2001 is not yet available. (b) (i-v) Data published in Surgical management of breast cancer in Australia in 1995 (Hill et al.) shows women under 50 years of age were more likely to have breast conserving surgery compared with women over 50 years of age. Fifteen per cent of women under 50 years of age with early breast cancer were planning to have or had had a reconstruction. Four per cent of women 50 years of age and over with early breast cancer were planning to have, or have had a reconstruction. Women with early breast cancer from urban areas were more likely to have breast-conserving surgery (56 per cent) compared to women with early breast cancer in non-urban areas (46 per cent). This is the only comprehensive published national data available, describing each incident of breast cancer notified to cancer registries throughout Australia between April and September 1995. (b) (vi) A direct request would need to be made to each State and Territory cancer registry to obtain the data on a State and Territory basis. (3) (i-vi) National data on waiting times for breast prostheses or forms for patients are not collected. State and Territories are responsible for the provision of breast prostheses and a direct request would need to be made to each State and Territory to obtain the information requested. Australian Defence Force: Employment (Question No. 973) Mr Danby asked the Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 14 October 2002: (1) Are members of the Australian Defence Force (ADF) unable to get employment in other Government agencies until they have received a discharge certificate. (2) Is it a fact that in the past members of the ADF could take long service leave and complete police training, then discharge or return to the ADF if their police training was unsuccessful. Mrs Vale-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (1) Section 20 of the Public Service Act 1999 confers on each Agency Head the rights, duties and powers of an employer with respect to APS employees within that Agency. Therefore, within the legal framework supplied by the PS Act, each Agency Head is able to establish certain conditions of employment and service for the Agency’s employees. It is not known what policies other Commonwealth agencies may have implemented with respect to engaging ex ADF personnel in APS positions prior to discharge from full time service becoming effective. In Defence, up until 29 April 2002, it was possible for a discharging ADF member to be engaged in an APS position before the member’s discharge became effective. The member could proceed on paid leave to commence civilian employment while the discharge was being processed. However the policy was changed on the decision of the Secretary and the Chief of the Defence Force, because the Commonwealth Ombudsman questioned the probity of the arrangement whereby an ADF member could be doubly accruing certain Commonwealth employment benefits. If other Commonwealth agencies have implemented similar policies it is because of decisions made within their respective agencies – it is not possible for Defence to impose its policy on other Agencies as each has certain autonomy with respect to employment within the legal framework. (2) I am unable to comment on the employment practices of the various police agencies, both at the State and Federal level. However, members of the ADF have certain obligations under Defence Instruction (General) (DI(G)) Personnel (PERS) 25-2 Employment and Voluntary Activities of Australian Defence Force Members in Off-Duty Hours requiring all ADF members to seek prior approval from their commander before engaging in outside employment in off-duty hours, including during periods of leave. A permanent member of the ADF who is on long service leave, must obtain approval in writing in accordance with DI(G) PERS 25-2 before engaging in paid employment outside the ADF in off-duty hours. The policy lists those occasions where approval is not normally to be given, for example, where the employment would create a conflict of interest with the member’s public duty, where it would interfere with the member’s efficiency or where the employment could bring the ADF into disrepute. ADF members, upon fulfilling their obligations under DI(G) PERS 25-2 Employment and Voluntary Activities of Australian Defence Force Members in Off-Duty Hours, would be able to engage in employment dependant upon the employment practices of the engaging organisation. Of course, ADF members are entitled to return to Defence once their long service leave has expired. Aviation: Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport (Question No. 978) Mr Murphy asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 14 October 2002: (1) Further to the answer to part (8) of question No. 610 (Hansard, 23 September 2002, page 6800), does the privatisation of Sydney Airport mean that there is now commercial pressure to relinquish statutory controls over aircraft movements during both curfew and non-curfew periods at that airport; if so, what is that pressure from the airport lessee company or any other person; if not, why not. (2) Is the same commercial pressure on non-aeronautical services at Sydney Airport that led to the elimination of the pricing surveillance regulatory regime at that airport, the same commercial pressure that will see the aircraft movement and hence the aircraft noise regulatory regime weakened in the future. (3) Does the net effect of privatisation of ownership of Sydney Airport mean the taking away of public ownership of the direct management of Sydney Airport as both landlord and land manager. (4) Does taking away effective management and land interest at Sydney Airport mean the loss of the most effective environmental management device of all, that is, actual ownership of the land; if not, why not. (5) With the passing of title in the airport lease to a private company, is the ability to effectively manage Sydney Airports aircraft noise problems relinquished with the passing of that title; if not, why not. (1) No. The sale of the airport does not change the Government’s aircraft movement cap or noise management policies in any way – the Government retains full regulatory control. Sydney Airport will continue to be subject to the 80 aircraft movements per hour planning cap, the curfew from 11pm to 6am and the noise sharing policy implemented through the Sydney Airport Long Term Operating Plan. (2) The Productivity Commission was asked in December 2000 to examine whether there was an ongoing need for price regulation of airports. The Commission’s final report was provided to the Government on 25 January 2002. The Government accepted the Commission’s recommendation that Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth, Adelaide, Canberra and Darwin airports be subject to price monitoring for five years commencing 1 July 2002. The Government has reserved the right to reimpose price controls if it is found that airport operators were abusing their market power by unjustifiably raising prices. See also the answer to (1) above. (3) and (4) As a leased Federal airport, Sydney Airport remains a Commonwealth place and continues to be subject to the provisions of the Airports Act 1996. The Act is the basis of a comprehensive regulatory regime for land use, planning, building controls and environmental management, which is administered by the Commonwealth. (5) No. See answer to (1) above.",150,Norco Upgrade Of Ice Cream Manufacturing Division Commercial
132,Mr Anderson,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:Aviation: Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport (Question No. 980) Mr Murphy asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 14 October 2002: (1) In his responses to part (2) of question No. 629 (Hansard, 23 September 2002, page 6802) and part (8) of question No. 610 (Hansard, 23 September 2002, page 6800) did he state that he has given an assurance that the Government had no intention of changing its noise policy and residents of Sydney could be confident that the sale of Sydney Airport will not change the Governments noise policy in any way but states that a Government cannot bind the actions of a future government; if so, are these statements contradictory. (2) If so, is it a fact that he cannot and could never give, such an assurance as no Minister nor any Government can bind the actions of a future Government, including this current Government; if not, why not. (1) and (2) The Government’s aircraft noise policy in relation to Sydney Airport was clearly stated at the time of the Airport’s sale. Health Insurance: Medibank Private (Question No. 985) Mr Murphy asked the Minister representing the Minister for Health and Ageing, upon notice, on 14 October 2002: (1) Has the Minister seen a report by Mark Metherell titled “Medibank loss comes at a 13% premium” on page 3 of the Sydney Morning Herald on 28 September 2002. (2) Do many members of Medibank Private face a premium increase of up to 6%, taking the average increase to about 13% for the year, following the Government’s decision to allow the fund to cut discounts; if not, why not. (3) Has the Minister’s attention been drawn to the statement by Nicola Ballenden of the Australian Consumers’ Association that the discount cuts were a premium increase by any other name. (4) Why did Medibank Private make a record $175 million dollar loss in the last financial year. (5) Can the Minister guarantee that the Government will not sell Medibank Private; if so, how; if not, why not. the honourable member’s question: (1) Yes. (2) Medibank Private estimates that 95% of its members (2,650,929) will be affected by the removal of discounts of between 4% and 6%. (3) Yes. (4) Medibank Private released their Annual Report for the financial year 2001-02 on 27 September 2002. This document is available publicly and contains full disclosure of their financial results. (5) The Minister for Finance and Administration is responsible for the scoping study on the possible sale of Medibank Private as announced in the 2002-03 Budget. The Government has not made any decision to sell Medibank Private. Employer Nomination Scheme for Cardiothoracic Surgeons (Question No. 988) Mrs Irwin asked the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, upon notice, on 14 October 2002: (1) How many applications have been received under the Employer Nomination Scheme for Cardiothoracic Surgeons over the past 2 years. (2) What checks has his Department carried out to verify that Australian trained graduates were not available to fill the positions which were the subject of the nominations.",152,Norco Upgrade Of Ice Cream Manufacturing Division Commercial
133,Mr Anderson,The answer to the honourable member’s questions is as follows:,153,Norco Upgrade Of Ice Cream Manufacturing Division Commercial
134,Mr Andrews,"The Minister for Health and Ageing has provided the following answer to(3) Is he aware that qualified Australian cardiothoracic surgeons cannot obtain employment with Australian hospitals in their specialist field. (1) In the 2000-01 and 2001-02 financial years and the first quarter of 2002-03 the Department approved six nominations under the Employer Nomination Scheme for specialist surgeons. The five occupations covered by the six nominations were Neurosurgeon, Orthopaedic Surgeon, Burns Injury Specialist, Associate Surgeon (specialising in abdominal surgery) and Associate Professor of Surgery. Nominations for cardiothoracic surgeons, if there were any under the Employer Nomination Scheme, do not appear to have been recorded as such during 2000-02 or 2002-03 to date. It is possible cardiothoracic surgeons may have entered under other categories, including non-skill related categories such as spouses. (2) Under the Employer Nomination Scheme, labour market testing of the vacant position is required unless the occupation is in short supply at a national level. Occupations on the Migration Occupation in Demand List (MODL) therefore do not require labour market testing. Under this visa class, certification from state or territory health authorities that the occupation is in shortage such as in an “area of need” is required. Labour market testing generally involves placing advertisements in metropolitan and national newspapers and relevant professional journals and lodgement of the position with a Job Network member or other large recruitment agency. The labour market testing must be undertaken in the six months immediately before lodging the nomination. The employer must provide documentary evidence of the labour market testing undertaken, details of any unsuccessful applicants and reasons for not selecting each of the persons. (3) The Australian Medical Workforce Advisory Committee reported on “The Cardiothoracic Surgery Workforce in Australia – Supply and Requirements 2000-2011” in April 2001. The report concluded that: “the cardiothoracic surgery workforce is adequately meeting current requirements. To ensure requirements continue to be met, the Working Party recommends that the number of trainees entering the advanced cardiothoracic surgery trainee program be maintained at approximately five per year. In recent years an average of five trainees graduated from the training program each year.” Industry, Tourism and Resources: Program Evaluations (Question No. 990) Dr Emerson asked the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources, upon notice, on 14 October 2002: (1) What were the outcomes of the evaluations of the Innovation Investment Fund (IIF) and the Commercialising Emerging Technologies (COMET) program that were conducted on behalf of his Department in 2002. (2) What were the specific findings of the evaluations for (a) the Innovation Investment funds program and (b) the COMET program. (3) What is the Government’s response to these evaluations. (4) Are the evaluations publicly available; if not, are there plans to make them publicly available. (5) How many rounds of funding have been offered under COMET since the program commenced. (6) When did each round occur and what sum of money was approved in each round. (7) How many applicatants for COMET were there for each round since the program commenced and how many of these were awarded funding in each round. (8) Of the additional COMET business advisers announced in July 2001, how many have been appointed? (9) Will the number of business advisers be increased from 10 to 17 as announced in July 2001; if so, where will they be located, if not, why not? Mr Ian Macfarlane-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (1) The reports are not yet finalised. (2) See answer to (1) above.",153,Norco Upgrade Of Ice Cream Manufacturing Division Commercial

Health: Outer Metropolitan Doctors Scheme (Question No. 996) Mr Brendan O’Connor asked the Minister representing the Minister for Health and Ageing, upon notice, on 15 October 2002: (1) What is the Government doing to arrest the critical shortages of doctors in the outer metropolitan areas of Melbourne. (2) What incentives will the Government provide doctors to locate in Melton and Sunbury. (3) What assistance will be provided to existing medical services to enable them to attract sufficient doctors. the honourable member’s question: (1) The 2002-03 Federal Budget allocated $80 million over four years to establish the More Doctors for Outer Metropolitan Areas Measure to increase the number of medical practitioners working in the outer metropolitan areas of the six State capital cities. Three programs were outlined to meet the Government’s commitment to outer metropolitan areas. These were: allowing specialist trainees and medical researchers to work in supervised general practice programs in outer-metropolitan areas under the Outer Metropolitan Workforce Shortage (Specialist Trainees and Medical Researchers) Program; requiring doctors undertaking the ‘general stream’ of the general practice training program to undertake a placement in designated outer-metropolitan areas as part of the Outer Metropolitan GP Registrars Program; and allowing non-vocationally recognised medical practitioners who undertake a vocational recognition program and who agree to work in designated outer metropolitan areas to become eligible for higher Medicare rebates as part of the Outer Metropolitan (Other Medical Practitioners) Relocation Incentive Program. The first two programs are scheduled for implementation in early 2003, while the third program is scheduled for implementation later this year. (2) Practices in both Melton and Sunbury will be eligible for the More Doctors for Outer Metropolitan Areas Measure. (3) The Department will be writing to all known eligible practices under the More Doctors for Outer Metropolitan Areas Measure, informing them of the three programs and providing details on how they can participate. It is proposed that assistance will be provided to eligible practices to help locate eligible medical practitioners. The Department also proposes to provide eligible medical practices with suitable support to facilitate a smooth transition for new doctors to outer metropolitan practices. These support arrangements are being developed in conjunction with established medical organisations. In addition, practices in the designated outer metropolitan areas will be eligible for assistance to become Royal Australian College of General Practitioner accredited training practices, which will encourage more practices in areas of doctor shortage to participate in the training of General Practice Registrars.

The NFA is a subsidiary company within the National Farmers Federation. The first payment of $115,560 was made to Nationwide Farmers Inc (NFA) on 30 June 2002. The NFA was not providing a paid service to the Commonwealth. Rather it was acting as a conduit to receive funds into a trust account for an interim period until REFA became an incorporated body and was able to accept the funds itself. Since this time REFA has become incorporated and NFA has passed the payments to REFA accordingly. An exemption from tender was provided on the grounds that NFA was not providing a paid service to the Commonwealth in receiving funds and passing them on to REFA.

147,Mr Andrews,"The Minister for Health and Ageing has provided the following answer toDefence: Navy/Reserve News (Question No. 1030) Mr Danby asked the Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 21 October 2002: (1) Is the Director-General Reserves Navy unable to continue forwarding gratis copies of Navy/Reserve News to former members of the Navy Reserve. (2) If this decision has been made due to budgetary constraints, what are these constraints. (3) Were other funding measures considered before the subscription fee was introduced. (4) If other funding measures were considered, what were they and why were they not implemented. Mrs Vale-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (1) Gratis copies of Navy/Reserve News will continue to be forwarded to all Navy Reserve members, both active and inactive. This arrangement is discontinued once Naval Reserve members retire from the Naval Reserve or otherwise cease to be a Naval Reserve member, with the exception that a limited number of retired senior officers have received and will continue to receive complementary copies. Copies of Navy/Reserve News are otherwise available to any member of the public, including former Naval Reserve members, by subscription. (2) There have been some recent budgetary considerations associated with Reserve News distribution. These are as follows: (a) Prior to 28 May 2001 Reserve News was produced and mailed out to Naval Reserve members on a four-weekly basis. From this date, Reserve News was produced fortnightly, together with the fortnightly produced Navy News and mailed-out fortnightly. (b) In December 2001, production of Reserve News reverted to a four-weekly cycle, but a fortnightly mail-out to Naval Reserve members continued, with a copy of Reserve News being included with every second edition of Navy News. (c) In an effort to rein in the increased distribution costs of a fortnightly mail-out, a four-weekly mail-out containing two consecutive issues of Navy News (one of which includes Reserve News), commenced in September 2002. (d) The initial fortnightly mail-out did result in a greater than planned draw down of available FY 2002/03 Reserve News funds, requiring some internal re-allocation. This re-allocation has been made and production and distribution of Reserve News for the remainder of FY 2002/03 on the basis described in sub-paragraph (c) above is assured. (3) A subscription fee for Navy/Reserve News only applies in the circumstance outlined in paragraph (1). This has always been the case. Means to provide a wider gratis distribution of Reserve News to the community generally and to employers is currently being investigated. This is in line with the recent Government initiated program of enhancements to the Australian Defence Force Reserves. (4) As it is not planned to introduce a general gratis distribution of Navy/Reserve News to former Naval Reserve members, no additional funding measures are necessary for this purpose. Health and Ageing: Accommodation Places (Question No. 1032) Ms Jackson asked the Minister representing the Minister for Health and Ageing, upon notice, on 21 October 2002: (1) Which postcodes or suburbs fall within the South-East Metropolitan Aged Care Planning Region of Perth. (2) On the most recent data, how many residential aged care beds are there in South-East Metropolitan Aged Care Planning Region of Perth. (3) On the most recent data, how many high care and low care residential beds are there in each of the postcodes or suburbs in the South-East Metropolitan Care Planning Region of Perth. (4) On the most recent data, how many of these high care and low care beds, in each of the postcodes or suburbs, are in use. (5) On the most recent data, how many high care and low care beds, in each of the postcodes or areas, have been allocated to the South-East Metropolitan Aged Care Planning Region and are yet to be occupied. (6) Is he aware that 50% of older Australians have to wait more than 1 month and 25% have to wait 3 months or longer to enter a residential aged care home; if not, why not. (7) In each postcode or suburb in the South-East Metropolitan Aged Care Planning Region of Perth, how long do people have to wait for a residential aged care place. (8) Does he intend to implement a key recommendation of the 2001 Two Year Review of Aged Care Reforms and review the indicators of demand for residential and community care; if so, when; if not, why not. (9) Is it government policy that Australians who require residential aged care should be able to access this care in their local community; if not, why not. (10) Can he explain in detail what he means when he states that one of the Government’s major priorities in aged care is to ensure that older Australians are able to access residential aged care. (11) Do Australians residing in the postcodes of 6108, 6107, 6109 and 6110 in the City Of Gosnells in Perth have to move to the postcode areas of 6151 and 6100, some 30 minutes away by car within the South-East Planning Region, to access residential aged care beds; if so why. (12) Is it important for aged people requiring care to be able to access that care within their own local community; if not, why not. (13) Will he rectify the problem of the shortage of residential aged care beds in the City of Gosnells; if so, when; if not, why not. the honourable member’s question: (1) As postcodes and suburbs can overlap Aged Care Planning Regions they are not used in the calculation of aged care provision in a region. An aged care home which is in one postcode area may not be part of the same Aged Care Planning Region as other homes in the same postcode area. Aged Care Planning Regions are based on groupings of Statistical Local Areas (SLAs). In answering the question, place numbers in each SLA will be provided. The SLAs that make up Metropolitan South East Aged Care Planning Region, Western Australia, are: Armadale (C), Belmont (C), Canning (C), Gosnells (C), Serpentine Jarrahdale (S), South Perth (C) and Victoria Park (T).

148,Mr Andrews,"The Minister for Health and Ageing has provided the following answer to(5) Provisionally Allocated Aged Care Places by SLA. June 2002 SLA High care Low care Total Armadale (C) 11 11 Belmont (C) Canning (C) Gosnells (C) 20 53 73 Serpentine Jarrahdale (S) South Perth (C) 3 22 25 Victoria Park (T) Region Total 23 86 109 (6) The Department of Health and Ageing does not collect or keep information on waiting period, the length of time from the date a person chooses or actively seeks to enter residential aged care and the date they actually enter residential aged care. The Department does keep information on entry period, the period of time elapsed between the date a person receives an Aged Care Assessment Team (ACAT) approval for eligibility to enter residential aged care and the date the person actually enters an aged care home. There are a number of factors that impact on the period of time that elapses between the date a person receives an ACAT approval for eligibility to enter residential aged care and the date the person actually enters an aged care home. In May 2002 the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) published a report, Entry Period for Residential Aged Care. The report is a statistical analysis of the elapsed time between an assessment of eligibility for residential aged care and the date of actual entry to residential aged care. The report examines but rejects the use of entry period as a proxy for waiting time and, by implication, as a measure of the accessibility of aged care services. The analysis shows that the supply of services in any particular region has a negligible effect on entry period. An important determinant of a short entry period, the AIHW found, is whether the resident had an ACAT assessment performed in hospital rather than when they were living at home. A longer entry period is also strongly related to whether the resident had previously used a Community Aged Care Package (CACP) or residential respite care. As part of the 1997 Aged Care Structural Reforms, the validity of an ACAT approval for high care admission was extended from ninety days to one year. People do not have to act immediately following ACAT approval for admission to residential care. They have time to visit different homes, consider their options, settle their affairs and make arrangements with the home of their choice before they enter care. As the AIHW report confirmed, increased availability of community care and respite care has a significant effect in delaying entry to permanent care. People are able to remain in the community for longer after they have been assessed by an ACAT as eligible for residential care. On average, recipients of CACPs remained in the community fifteen months longer than other residents did before they entered residential care. Similarly, respite care recipients remained in the community longer. (7) See answer to question six. (8) The Department continues to implement this recommendation. The above-mentioned AIHW report is part of this process. The AIHW was contracted in October 2001 to undertake a multivariate statistical analysis of entry periods to residential aged care. The AIHW was also asked to comment on whether ‘entry period’ is a robust performance indicator of accessibility for the aged care system. As mentioned above, this report was published in May 2002. (9) Yes. (10) The Commonwealth Government is committed to ensuring that frail older Australians have reasonable access to quality residential and community care which will enable them to live in dignity. To ensure an equitable distribution of residential aged care places and CACPs, the Government uses a comprehensive planning framework which aims to provide 100 residential aged care places and CACPs for every 1,000 people aged seventy years and over. This benchmark helps achieve a more equitable distribution of places to regions. This planning framework applies across the whole of Australia in both city and country areas. (11) People assessed as eligible for residential aged care base their choice of an aged care home on a number of factors. These factors include whether an aged care home offers extra services, the location of an aged care home in relation to family or friends, and the accreditation and certification status of an aged care home. (12) Yes. Refer to the answer to question ten. (13) Metropolitan South East Aged Care Planning Region has an aged care which exceeds the benchmark figure of 100 residential aged care places and CACPs for every 1,000 people aged seventy years and over. Australian Defence Force: Fitness Standards (Question No. 1034) Mr Edwards asked the Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 22 October 2002: (1) How many currently serving Australian Defence Force (ADF) personnel have been injured undertaking fitness tests since 1998. (2) What measures have been introduced to prevent the loss of experienced ADF members with 6 years or more service due to injury associated with fitness testing. (3) Have new fitness tests been introduced for Defence force job applicants. (4) Will the new fitness standards preclude some women from military roles that they currently perform. (5) Will the new fitness standards open the way for women to enter into combat roles provided they meet the fitness requirements. (6) Have changes to medical and fitness requirements for instructors involved in the cadet scheme resulted in losses of experienced staff. Mrs Vale-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (1) Injuries related to physical fitness testing in the ADF are not recorded separately and are therefore not available. (2) No specific information is available to suggest that there has been a loss of experienced ADF members as a result of injury associated with fitness testing. (3) All ADF applicants are required to pass a physical fitness assessment (PFA) prior to enlistment. The PFA for the Army was introduced in 1997 and for the Navy and the Air Force in August 2001. The introduction of minimum fitness standards has been a significant factor in the marked reduction in injury rates in recruit training units. (4) A Physical Employment Standards Project is currently underway. The aim is to analyse the ergonomic, human performance and physical capacity requirements for all combat arms in order to develop gender-free, task-based, physical employment standards. The key outcomes are to reduce injuries, provide a more direct linkage of training strategies to the actual tasks being undertaken and inform a range of human resource activities. Until the study is completed and the data analysed no consideration of the possible exclusion of either male or female personnel who do not meet these physical employment standards will be undertaken. (5) Physical competencies are not the only factors that need to be taken into account when considering women for combat roles. A comprehensive range of issues likely to impinge on the effective integration of women into the combat arms needs to be considered in any subsequent policy deliberations. These issues include operational requirements, habitability aspects, medical issues, occupational health and safety issues, posting requirements, social and demographic aspects, psychological issues, fraternisation and personal relationships, overseas military experiences and research, resource implications and community attitudes. (6) Cadet instructors do not have to meet any specific physical fitness standards nor have there been any recent changes to medical standards. Roads to Recovery Program (Question No. 1039) Mr Martin Ferguson asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 22 October 2002: (1) Further to the diagram on page 6 of the Roads to Recovery Program annual report 2001-2002, what are the actual dollars and percentage of total funds used for (a) general maintenance, (b) reconstruction, rehabilitation, widening, (c) sealing, (d) bridges, (e) traffic improvement, (f) constructing a new road, (g) sheeting/resheeting, (h) resealing, (i) drainage, (j) bicycle paths, (k) footpaths and (l) other.

(3) Can a project example be provided for each outcome referred to in part (2). (4) Was there a measure that included the number of jobs created as a result of the Roads to Recovery expenditure, if so what is it and what are the findings; if not, why not. (5) Further to the comments on page 7 that 244 councils will be shielded from the funding changes announced in the May 2002 Budget rephasing of Roads to Recovery funds, (a) how many and which councils were not shielded from the funding changes announced in the May 2002 Budget, (b) by what sum was each such council affected by the funding changes and (c) how long will the rephasing delay the full receipt of each councils allocation.

(4) Neither the Roads to Recovery Act 2000, the Programme Conditions or Guidelines require Councils to give details of employment generated by the Programme because this is not a stated objective of the Programme. However, there is some evidence that the Programme has been a substantial employer, especially in rural and regional areas.

The rephrased allocation for these councils was set at $150,000 which partially shielded them from the rephasing. They were included in the list of shielded councils in the annual report. ** These councils received accelerated payments in 2001 as a result of which the amount remaining to be paid over the life of the programme is less than the rephased allocation for 2002/03 in each case.

(2) What can the Minister do to assist the States in the education of Australian citizens, particularly our youth, of the ramifications and cost to the Australian community of all types of fires caused by arson. (1) The Department of Education, Science and Training does not have any statistical information on bushfires arising from arson. (2) As Commonwealth Minister for Education, I am aware that I need to do my part in assisting the teaching profession to guide young Australians to become good citizens, for example in respecting laws made to protect the community from arson. Providing effective civics and citizenship education is a key to maintaining a strong and vital society in the future. From 1997 to 2000 this Government invested $18 million in civics and citizenship education through the Discovering Democracy programme, particularly to develop quality curriculum resources. A further $13.6 million is extending the programme to June 2004 so that teachers receive professional development to fully embed the programme in schools. The report Citizenship and Democracy Australian Students Knowledge and Beliefs The IEA Civic Education Study of Fourteen Year Olds (Australian Council of Educational Research and University of Canberra) which was commissioned by my Department and published in 2001 indicated that while four out of five young Australians appreciate living in a vibrant, free, independent and democratic society, there are a number of young people who are alienated from society. Education is as much about building character as equipping Australia’s young people with skills. All Education Ministers agree to the National Goals for Schooling in the Twenty-First Century including Goal 1.3 about students accepting responsibility for their own actions. I have commissioned a Values Education Study, which was supported by all State and Territory Ministers of Education at the Ministerial Council on Education, Employment, Training and Youth Affairs meeting in July 2002. Over 600 school applications have been received for grants in response to this study. Many of these schools are working with disengaged youth and are keen to have help in overcoming students’ antisocial behaviour. In early December, I announced the successful schools that will receive up to $7,000 to help them to develop and implement values education in their school. Bushfires (Question No. 1060) Mr Murphy asked the Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government, upon notice, on 22 October 2002: (1) Is it a fact that some 70% of bushfires are the result of arson. (2) What can the Minister do to assist the States in the education of Australian citizens, particularly our youth, of the ramifications and cost to the Australian community of all types of fires caused by arson. (1) While a significant proportion of bushfires or wildfires are suspected to be the result of arson, a consistent national approach to the collection and analysis of bushfire data has not been established. I understand that work is being undertaken by the fire authority members of the Australasian Fire Authority Council to establish the framework for the provision of information of this nature to the Productivity Commission.",196,Phiac Private Health Insurance Administration Council
155,Dr Nelson,The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:,198,Phiac Private Health Insurance Administration Council
156,Mr Tuckey,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(2) There is no doubt that arson is a significant cause of bushfires in all jurisdictions in Australia. In recognition of that, all fire agencies have in place some form of program aimed at reducing the incidence of arson, and most programs focus on juveniles. Primary responsibility for firefighting and crime prevention rests with the States and Territories. In many respects, programs aimed at reducing the incidence of arson fall within the realm of crime prevention and are the responsibility of State and Territory Police Forces, emergency services or National Parks and Wildlife, depending on functional arrangements within the jurisdiction. In terms of more general assistance, Emergency Management Australia, a Division of the Attorney General’s Portfolio, provides funding assistance on behalf of the Commonwealth to improve community awareness of the risks posed by natural and technological hazards. School education, and warning systems and the community are themes under this funding programme. States seeking Commonwealth assistance for specific arson reduction programs can submit proposals to Emergency Management Australia and those proposals will be considered in competition with other disaster mitigation projects for available funding. Notwithstanding the above and its serious implications, statistics arising from the Select Committee investigation into the 01/02 fires in NSW indicate very clearly that 750,000 hectares of NSW National Parks were destroyed by fire and only 2000 hectares of State Forests; this compared to the ratio of the total land areas managed by the two agencies, which was approximately 2 to 1 respectively. In my view, the failure of National Parks and Wildlife Services to practise recognised hazard reduction was a major cause of the magnitude and scope of the fires whatever the initial means of ignition. I condemn both acts of deliberate and or indiscriminate ignition of such fires but forestry management and adequate access routes can ensure that such fires do not do the damage recorded in recent years. Australian Taxation Office: Settlement Deeds (Question No. 1064) Ms Jackson asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 23 October 2002: (1) How many settlement deeds have been received by the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) in relation to the settlement offer issued by the Tax Commissioner for investors in mass-marketed taxeffective schemes, where investors were given until 21 June 2002 to take up the offer. (2) How many ATO staff have been allocated to process settlement applications. (3) What is the timetable set out by the ATO to process settlement applications. (4) When will the ATO process payments arising from accepted settlement deeds. (1) The Commissioner has advised me that approximately 51 400 deeds have been received by the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) in relation to the settlement offer announced on 14 February 2002. (2) There are currently 148 members of staff allocated to process settlement applications. However this number fluctuates according to demand. (3) The plan states that 90% of the deeds should be processed by 30 December 2002. This is dependent on taxpayers providing correct and full information. (4) The ATO is working on a priority basis so that people who have previously paid their debt will have their deeds processed first. The exact timing depends on when the ATO receives all the necessary information. Telstra: Staffing (Question No. 1066) Mr Bevis asked the Minister representing the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, upon notice, on 23 October 2002: (1) How many permanent staff did Telstra hire in (a) 2000, (b) 2001 and (c) 2002. (2) How many apprentices did Telstra indenture in (a) 2000, (b) 2001 and (c) 2002. (3) What funds has Telstra allocated for repairs and replacement of new equipment being installed in remote areas when that equipment comes out of warranty.",198,Phiac Private Health Insurance Administration Council
157,Mr Costello,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(4) How many regional centres, staffed with experienced technical people, did Telstra have in September (a) 1999 and (b) 2002. (5) What was the staffing level of technical people in the Kununurra region of Western Australia in September (a) 1999 and (b) 2002. has provided the following answer to the honourable member’s question: Based on information provided by Telstra. In 1998, Telstra introduced the single Customer Field workforce structure. Multiskilling that followed allowed for traditional technical and lines field staff to become multi-functional, resulting in the whole field workforce being able to work on and maintain the access network. Whilst Telstra has seen reductions in traditional field staff numbers as a result of contracting out installation/maintenance work, these external contractors employ their own staff to carry out this work. Having regard to the above, the following information is provided. (1) Telstra hired the following staff in: (a) 2000 3,402 (b) 2001 1,833 (c) 2002 1,111 (2) Telstra, in line with Australia-wide developments in industry training, now employs graduates from the various tertiary institutions around Australia rather than apprentices. Consequently, Telstra did not take on any apprentices during 2000 to 2002. (3) Telstra does not keep data on expenditure related to warranty issues. (4) (a) In September 1999, Telstra had a centralised structure, with seven regional centres serving specific geographic locations, ie Queensland, New South Wales North, New South Wales South, Victoria, Tasmania, South Australia/Northern Territory and Western Australia. (b) In June 2000, Telstra, to better meet the needs of people in rural and remote areas for reliable, up to date communications services, formed Telstra Country Wide (TCW). As of September 2002, TCW was based in 28 regional centres. (5) Telstra’s network is increasingly digitised and some types of service work can now be undertaken remotely. Moreover, Telstra has invested $20b over the last five years to upgrade the network to a world class standard making it more robust. Telstra’s strategic investment into the network means that fewer staff are required to maintain the network. (a) In 1999 the Kununurra region of WA was serviced by 34 technical staff . (b) In 2002, the Kununurra region was serviced by 31 technical staff. Defence: National Service Medal (Question No. 1072) Ms Jackson asked the Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 12 November 2002: (1) How many National Service Medal applications have been received by the Medals Directorate of her Department. (2) How many National Service Medals applications have been received from applicants in the electoral division of Hasluck. (3) How many National Service Medals have been awarded to applicants in (a) January, (b) February, (c) March, (d) April, (e) May, (f) June, (g) July, (h) August and (i) September 2002. (4) What is the average time taken to process applications for the National Service Medal. (5) How many National Service Medal applications are currently outstanding. (6) What steps has she taken to address the backlog of National Service Medal applications. Mrs Vale-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (1) 130,000.",199,Phiac Private Health Insurance Administration Council
158,Mr Mcgauran,"The Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts(2) Identification of applicants within the electoral division of Hasluck is not able to be computer generated as electorate information is not a required data field for processing applications. A manual search would require diversion of resources now utilised to process applications. (3) (a) As the initial presentation of medals took place on 10 February 2002 to the next of kin of those that were killed in action in Vietnam, no medals were issued in January. (b) February 3,557 (c) March 10,043 (d) April 5,868 (e) May 7,717 (f) June 3,707 (g) July 5,030 (h) August 6,476 (i) September 6,810 (4) 6 months. (5) 65,000. (6) An additional 2 staff have been recruited to assist with the processing of applications. Hasluck Electorate: Centrelink (Question No. 1073) Ms Jackson asked the Minister representing the Minister for Family and Community Services, upon notice, on 11 November 2002: (1) How many (a) activity test and (b) administrative breaches relating to the (i) Newstart Allowance and (ii) Youth Allowance were issued in 2001-2002 to Centrelink clients in the electoral division of Hasluck. (2) What is the total sum of penalties levied in 2001-2002 to Centrelink clients in the electoral division of Hasluck relating to the (a) Newstart Allowance and (b) Youth Allowance. (3) How many Centrelink clients in the electoral division of Hasluck incurred the penalty of having payments withdrawn for 8 weeks in 2001-2002. lowing answer to the honourable member’s question: (1) Limitations exist in providing electoral level breach data using current management information systems. Data is only available by state, Centrelink Customer Service Centre and Centrelink Area Region. Breach data is not extracted and reported at an electoral level and a non conventional data extraction process would be an unreasonable imposition on Centrelink resources. (2) Centrelink is unable to answer question 2. See response to question 1. (3) Centrelink is unable to answer question 3. See response to question 2. Local Government Rangers: Service Medals (Question No. 1074) Mr Murphy asked the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 11 November 2002: Will he consider granting a fifteen year service medal to local government rangers similar to the fifteen year service medals granted to Police and Ambulance Officers and State Emergency Service and Rural Fire Service volunteers; if so, when; if not, why not. The National Medal is awarded for fifteen years diligent service to members of “service organisations” (police forces, the Australian Protective Service and those members of the following services who perform the primary function of the service: fire, ambulance, emergency and correctional services) and to members of certain voluntary search and rescue groups. New organisations can be considered for access to the medal if they meet the strict criteria laid down in the regulations. In the case of new government organisations the criteria are “that the organisation is",200,Phiac Private Health Insurance Administration Council
159,Mr Anthony,The Minister for Family and Community Services has provided the fol,201,Phiac Private Health Insurance Administration Council
160,Mr Howard,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:similar to a service organisation because the primary function of the organisation is to enforce the law in order to protect persons or property and some or all of the members of the organisation are exposed to the risk of death, injury or trauma in the course of performing that function.” The Commonwealth is prepared to consider access to the National Medal for local government rangers. It is a matter for the state and territory governments to demonstrate that the medal criteria are met. Family Law Court: Disputed Property Cases (Question No. 1076) Mr Murphy asked the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 11 November 2002: (1) What is the present average time taken to settle a disputed property case in the Family Law Court. (2) How does this compare with the average time taken to settle a disputed property case in the Family Law Court in (a) 1995, (b) 1996, (c) 1997, (d) 1998, (e) 1999, (f) 2000, (g) 2001 and (h) 2002. (3) Are Family Law Court settlements being prolonged, inter alia, as a consequence of the property price boom, particularly in Sydney; if so, what are the details; if not, why not. I am advised by the Family Court of Australia that: (1) Disputed property cases in the Family Court of Australia can settle at a number of stages between filing of an application and a defended hearing. All cases pass through a resolution phase before moving to the determination phase. Only approximately 6% of all applications filed are determined by a judge after a defended hearing. Selected studies have shown that approximately 80% of cases filed are settled/resolved within six months of filing. The Court implemented a new case management system (Casetrack) throughout 2002. When this system has been implemented for long enough to ensure accurate data collection, the Court anticipates being able to provide more detailed information about the time taken to settle property disputes. In the meantime, it is able to give figures which relate to the small percentage of cases that proceed to a trial. The Court no longer measures averages, as the Portfolio Budget Statement outcomes are measured in percentiles. The 50th percentile for the 2001-2002 financial year for those cases that were listed for a final hearing is 13.5 months for property matters (from filing to settlement). This figure takes no account of the vast majority of cases which are not so listed. (2) The Court’s outcomes are measured in financial years. The following data is available as a comparison to the answer to Question 1. Again, this relates only to those matters listed for trial: 1998-1999: 12.7 months 1999-2000: 14.0 months 2000-2001: 12.5 months The Court adopted comprehensive electronic measurement of matters listed for final hearing in July 1998. Therefore, information for the periods prior to July 1998 is not provided because it would be either incomplete or misleading for the purpose of this question. (3) The Court is not aware of any impact which changes in property prices might have on the time taken to settle family law matters. Health: Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (Question No. 1077) Mr Murphy asked the Minister representing the Minister for Health and Ageing, upon notice, on 11 November 2002: (1) Has the Minister’s attention been drawn to the benefits for diabetic sufferers of the drug Glitazones. (2) When will the Government include Glitazones on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. the honourable member’s question: (1) Yes. (2) Avandia (generic name, rosiglitazone), a drug sponsored by the pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline and Actos (generic name, pioglitazone), sponsored by Eli Lilly are two new oral medi-",201,Phiac Private Health Insurance Administration Council
161,Mr Williams,The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:,202,Phiac Private Health Insurance Administration Council
162,Mr Andrews,"The Minister for Health and Ageing has provided the following answer tocations for the treatment of Type2 diabetes. They are substantially more expensive than other oral treatments for this condition listed on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS). Each of these drugs have been recommended for inclusion on the PBS by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC), the Government’s advisory body on PBS listings, but only for use in a limited group of patients whose diabetes is difficult to control with other oral medications. There is considered to be a strong demand for both Avandia and Actos outside the patient group proposed by the PBAC and a real risk there will be major use on the PBS in the wider diabetic population. If this occurred, use of these drugs on the PBS would not be cost effective and there would be considerable Budgetary costs. The Government has not agreed to list Avandia and Actos on the PBS to this point. However, my Department is continuing to work with GlaxoSmithKline and Eli Lilly to try to find a basis for subsidising these drugs that acceptably limits the Budgetary risks to the Commonwealth. Trade: Automotive Imports (Question No. 1078) Dr Emerson asked the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources, upon notice, on 11 November 2002: (1) What revenue is raised annually from the 15 per cent automotive tariff? (2) What sum is derived from (a) imports of assembled vehicles and (b) imported components? Mr Ian Macfarlane-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (1) It is estimated that in 2001-02 tariff revenue raised on imports of automotive items rated at 15 per cent was $764 million. There are nearly 400 recognised customs tariff classifications that include automotive products, with the tariff rates on these items ranging from 5 to 15 per cent. Around 150 of these items incur a tariff rate of 15 per cent. The estimated tariff revenue is derived from data supplied by Australian Customs Service to the Australian Bureau of Statistics. (2) Of the $764 million, it is estimated that: (a) $496.5 million came from imports of assembled vehicles; and, (b) $267.5 million came from imports of automotive components. Public Sector Superannuation Scheme: Statements (Question No. 1080) tion, upon notice, on 11 November 2002: (1) Is it true that a computer programming or other administrative error caused the issuing of incorrect superannuation statements by the Public Sector Superannuation Scheme (PSS); if so, from what date were these statements wrong. (2) How many people are affected by the error. (3) Will this error result in all those affected having to do revised tax returns and having their tax reassessed; if so, what is the range of additional tax that would be payable by these retirees. (4) Is the Government considering waiving the additional tax payable; if not, who will pay any costs incurred by these retirees as a direct result of the error by the PSS. swer to the honourable member’s question: (1) ComSuper implemented a new computer system for pensions in May 2002. In migrating pensioner data to the new system, ComSuper identified pre-existing errors in the Undeducted Purchase Price (UPP) and Rebatable Pension amounts held for some PSS pensioners. A decision was taken in June 2002 to review the UPP and rebatable pension amounts of all PSS pensioners, to correct any errors found and to advise affected pensioners of the changes. The data was re-calculated from the date of exit for each PSS member. The revised UPP and Rebatable Pension amounts were provided back to 1994.",202,Phiac Private Health Insurance Administration Council
163,Mr Mcmullan Asked The Minister Representing The Minister For Finance And Administra,,203,Phiac Private Health Insurance Administration Council
164,Mr Costello,"The Minister for Finance and Administration has provided the following an(2) Revision of UPP and Rebatable Pension amounts was necessary in 1,723 instances. This affected somewhat less than that number of PSS pensioners as some pensioners had errors in both the rebatable and UPP amounts quoted them. 1273 cases involved errors in the rebatable pension amount (549 overstated and 724 understated). There was an additional 450 instances with errors in the UPP (184 overstated and 266 understated). (3) All affected pensioners were contacted in July and provided with revised information between July and September 2002. Though it is ultimately a matter for the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) to determine, the pensioners were advised of the potential need to contact the ATO for reappraisal of relevant tax returns. ComSuper has supplied the revised data to the ATO. ComSuper is unable to comment on how the ATO will consider these cases. The range of additional tax involving errors in the rebatable pension amounts is: 927 cases (73%) are understood to have a maximum annual tax effect of less than $200. 306 cases (24%) are understood to have a maximum annual tax effect of between $200 and $400. 40 (3%) cases are understood to involve a maximum annual tax variation of greater than $400. The range of additional tax involving errors in the UPP amounts is: 366 cases (80%) are understood to have a maximum annual tax effect of less than $200. 42 cases (10%) are understood to have a maximum annual tax effect of between $200 and $400. 42 cases (10%) are understood to involve a maximum annual tax variation of greater than $400. (4) This question should be referred to the Australian Taxation Office as it falls within their authority. ComSuper will, on request, reimburse reasonable expenses that are incurred by PSS pensioners in submitting amended taxation returns. Hunter Electorate: Centrelink (Question No. 1081) Mr Fitzgibbon asked the Minister representing the Minister for Family and Community Services, upon notice, on 11 November 2002: (1) Is the Minister’s Department planning to relocate Centrelink’s Records Management Unit from Cardiff, NSW. (2) If so, (a) why, (b) to where, (c) how many jobs will be lost in the Hunter, (d) what is the cost of the relocation and (e) will Hunter-based clients not experience delays when seeking decision reviews or pursuing appeal rights as a consequence of the move. lowing answer to the honourable member’s question: (1) Yes. (2) (a) Area Hunter’s current Offsite File Storage facility at Cardiff has reached maximum capacity. Several options were explored in order to identify the most appropriate solution for servicing the Area’s records management requirements into the next decade. Options considered included: 1. Additional file storage racking installed to increase storage capacity of current facility. 2. Additional floor space leased adjacent to current facility (dependent on availability). 3. Relocation of files to Sydney Records Management Unit at Chullora. Based on an evaluation over 10years of information/projections in relation to: Capacity demand/supply. Cost one off/on-going.",203,Phiac Private Health Insurance Administration Council
165,Mr Anthony,"The Minister for Family and Community Services has provided the folRelocation of the RMU to Chullora represented a significant saving to Centrelink of approximately $3 million over 10 years, as well as enabling future capacity. This option also aligned with Centrelink’s strategy to maximise economies of scale in relation to Offsite File Storage by having a number of large facilities that service several Areas within each state. (b) Sydney Records Management Unit, Chullora NSW. (c) There are currently 6 ongoing positions located at the RMU. Options for re-deployment to other Centrelink positions within the Hunter region are being investigated. Temporary (nonongoing) staff have been engaged on a needs basis. (d) The anticipated cost of transferring Area Hunter files to Chullora is $150,000. (e) The current records management unit at Cardiff have service-level agreements with each site in Area Hunter which prescribes request turnaround times. There are also courier contracts in place which contain agreed service standards to support the above agreements. As a result of the relocation, service level agreements will be established between the Sydney RMU and Area Hunter sites to maintain current turnaround times. Courier service contracts will specify overnight delivery services from Chullora, as is the current arrangements from Cardiff. Centrelink does not anticipate any reduction in the standard of service provision to Hunter-based clients. International Labor Organisation: Child Labour (Question No. 1083) 2002: (1) Which OECD member Governments have not ratified Convention 182 regarding the Worst Forms Of Child Labour. (2) What action, if any, is the Australian Government taking to ratify the Convention. (1) Australia (2) The Government is carefully considering the necessary steps to ratify the Convention.

186,Mr Andrews,"The Minister for Health and Ageing has provided the following answer toMr Kelvin Thomson asked the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, upon notice, on 12 November 2002: (1) Further to longline fishing and the threat abatement process for boats leaving Mooloolaba, Qld, what action is being taken to protect the Fleshy Footed Shearwaters. (2) Will the line below which bird mitigation is required be shifted from 30 degrees latitude to 20 degrees latitude. (3) Do any fishing boats fish below the current 30 degrees latitude without bird mitigation. (1) Longline vessels leaving Mooloolaba and fishing south of 300S must use the following seabird bycatch mitigation measures: bird scaring or tori lines which must be used at all times; longlines to be set only at night, when seabirds are generally less active; and no discharge of offal to occur when lines are set or hauled. No mandatory measures, other than the discharge of offal regulation, are in place for vessels operating north of 300S where potential bird by-catch is considered to be low. However, bird-scaring lines must be carried and used where necessary. The only exemption to setting lines at night is for scientific purposes. The Australian Fisheries Management Authority can issue scientific permits to operators where a technique of setting and hauling longlines which does not make the baits and hooks available to seabirds can be demonstrated, or is under investigation. (2) Commonwealth agencies are working to collect further data on bird by-catch north of 300S. An observer program, with high priority given to the area between 250S and 300S is intended to commence in early 2003, and will provide enhanced information. The program will take a further six months at which time the results will be reviewed by experts and government agencies. (3) Refer to (1).

(1) Comments in the press during the Victorian election have suggested this. (2) (a) Yes. (b) All Federal road funding in Victoria is heavily committed to several other large projects including the Craigieburn Deviation ($306 million), the Geelong Road ($120 million) and the Scoresby Freeway ($445 million). The scope for funding for the Deer Park Bypass may not be available for a number of years. Melton: Medical Services (Question No. 1124) Mr Brendan O’Connor asked the Minister representing the Minister for Health and Ageing, upon notice, on 14 November 2002: Given that another medical centre in the town of Melton, Victoria, has declared it will no longer bulk bill patients on Medicare, will the Minister support the Victorian Government’s submission that Melton should be declared an area of high medical need. the honourable member’s question: I have supported the Victorian Government’s submission that Melton should be declared an area of high medical need by classifying the Melton area as a district of workforce shortage. Melton: Medical Services (Question No. 1125) Mr Brendan O’Connor asked the Minister representing the Minister for Health and Ageing, upon notice, on 14 November 2002: Given that the Victorian Department of Human Services has declared the town of Melton an area of high medical need, will the Minister provide relief for the area by utilising the doctors of the Rural Workforce Agency. the honourable member’s question: I have provided relief by classifying Melton as a district of workforce shortage. However, it is extremely unlikely that the doctors of the Rural Workforce Agency of Victoria will be able to be utilised, as the recruitment programs that it manages are restricted to rural areas and Melton is classified as a metropolitan area. Melton: Medical Services (Question No. 1126) Mr Brendan O’Connor asked the Minister representing the Minister for Health and Ageing, upon notice, on 14 November 2002: Given that the Victorian Department of Human Services has declared the town of Melton an area of high medical need, will the Minister help relieve the pressure by giving provider numbers for overseas and locally trained doctors with restricted registration.",228,Gbrmpa And Where Is She Located To Perform These Duties

(3) Did Mr Bolster attach a copy of the DPPs’ media statement titled “Prosecution of Mr Malcolm Colston”, dated 5 July 1999 which details the procedure that the DPP adopted in order to evaluate the application that was made by Dr Colston’s solicitors to discontinue the prosecution because of the alleged terminal illness.

(8) Did any of these doctors also express the view that Dr Colston was terminally ill; if so, how many.

197,Mr Williams,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(8) Yes, 7. (9) No. Colston, Former Senator: Criminal Proceedings (Question No. 1129) Mr Murphy asked the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 14 November 2002: Further to the reply to part (2) of question No. 1154 (Hansard, 9 May 2000, page 16100), why did he believe that there was insufficient public interest to justify the release of the medical reports of the two eminent and independent medical specialists who examined former Senator Dr Malcolm Arthur Colston in May 1999 in relation to his fitness to stand trial on twenty-eight charges of defrauding the Commonwealth through travel rorts. My decision to refuse release was based on the following considerations. The medical reports contained sensitive personal information about Dr Colston. The medical reports were in the possession of the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions which was subject to the provisions of the Privacy Act 1988 in relation to any disclosure of personal information. The Act also applied to me in my capacity as a Minister. The Information Privacy Principles contained in the Privacy Act provide that personal information, subject to certain exceptions, should not be disclosed. The Privacy Act included an exemption which would allow disclosure with the consent of the subject of the information but it was improbable that Dr Colston would give his consent. Other Privacy Act exemptions relating to protection of the public revenue and law enforcement were inapplicable. The reports could have been considered for release under the ‘authorised by law’ exception in the Privacy Act (as the release would be covered by Parliamentary privilege) but that exception did not compel disclosure. On balance the public interest did not weigh in favour of public release of the reports. Colston, Former Senator: Criminal Proceedings (Question No. 1130) Mr Murphy asked the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 14 November 2002: Further to his reply to parts (2)(b), (3) and (4) of question No. 1573 (Hansard, 30 August 2000, page 19795) and in light of the flawed conclusions reached in May 1999 by the two eminent and independent medical specialists who reported on the state of health of Dr Malcolm Arthur Colston for the purposes of the Director of Public Prosecutions, will he now make public the content of those reports for the purposes of the public interest or for the purposes of protecting public revenue; if so, when; if not, why not. The Information Privacy Principles contained in the Privacy Act 1988 provide that personal information should generally not be disclosed. Accordingly I am not able to disclose the personal information contained in the reports unless one of the exceptions in the Principles applies. The Privacy Act includes an exemption which would allow disclosure which is reasonably necessary for the purpose of protecting the public revenue. However, it is not reasonably necessary to publicly disclose the reports in this case there are other measures in place to protect the public revenue in relation to the use of official government travel entitlements. The reports could be considered for release under the ‘authorised by law’ exception in the Privacy Act (as the release would be covered by Parliamentary privilege) but that exception does not compel disclosure. A decision whether or not to release the reports subject to parliamentary privilege involves a balancing of competing public interests. The public interest is not established because something is “of interest to the public” a higher standard is required, something that is of serious concern or benefit to the public rather than merely of individual interest. I accept that two considerations to be weighed in the balance in this case are the public interests in the proper administration of justice and in the scrutiny by Parliament of the decisions and actions of the DPP. In arriving at a balance of public interest in a particular case, it is necessary to consider whether the public interest considerations in disclosing the information outweigh the public interest in government agencies protecting the privacy of sensitive personal information in their possession. In this instance the balance favours a decision to refuse public release of the reports.",231,Gbrmpa And Where Is She Located To Perform These Duties

199,Mr Williams,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:Colston, Former Senator: Criminal Proceedings (Question No. 1131) Mr Murphy asked the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 14 November 2002: Further to the reply to part (7) of question No. 1925 (Hansard, 2 November 2000, page 22122) that it was of major importance that the public’s confidence in such basic institutions as the Parliament and the courts be a paramount consideration in the Director of Public Prosecution's (DPP's) decision to decline to proceed with the prosecution of Dr Malcolm Arthur Colston in July 1999, how can the public’s confidence in the Parliament and the courts be now restored, particularly in light of the numerous media ston and the DPP’s handling of this matter since 1999. The DPP has indicated previously that it would, if necessary, review the matter and is presently conducting a review. Colston, Former Senator: Criminal Proceedings (Question No. 1132) Mr Murphy asked the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 14 November 2002: (1) Further to the replies to part (19) of question No. 2376 (Hansard, 22 May 2001, page 26749) and part (12) of question No. 2622 (Hansard, 25 September 2001, page 31446) and in the knowledge of the flawed conclusions of the two eminent and independent medical specialists who examined Dr Malcolm Arthur Colston in May 1999, will the Director of Public Prosecutions now obtain copies of all of the medical tests, reports and clinical notes associated with all of the admissions for medical treatment afforded to Dr Colston at Wesley Private Hospital, Brisbane since 1999; if not, why not. (2) Will the DPP obtain copies of all Dr Colston’s medical records held by doctors and institutions who have treated him since July 1999; if not, why not. (1) The independent experts retained by the DPP have assessed medical tests conducted on Dr Colston. (2) See (1). Colston, Former Senator: Criminal Proceedings (Question No. 1133) Mr Murphy asked the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 14 November 2002: (1) Did he see a report by Scott Emerson on page 1 of The Australian on Wednesday, 13 November 2002 titled “Snappers and salad keep Colston going”. (2) Did he see where Mr Charlie Economou, Manager of Kenmore Plaza Seafood confirmed that former Senator Dr Malcolm Arthur Colston regularly walks, talks and drops into Mr Economou’s fish and chip shop and that Dr Colston’s regular fare is Greek salad and two snapper and that either Dr Colston or his sons pick up a phone order made to Mr Economou’s shop. (3) Will the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) interview Mr Economou with a view to obtaining more information that may be helpful to the DPP in establishing the level of activity of Dr Colston in relation to his visits to Mr Economou’s shop since July 1999 and Dr Colston’s capacity, or otherwise, of standing trial on twenty-eight charges of defrauding the Commonwealth through travel rorts; if not, why not.

203,Mr Williams,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:Health: Motor Neurone Disease (Question No. 1136) Mr Murphy asked the Minister representing the Minister for Health and Ageing, upon notice, on 14 November 2002: (1) Is motor neurone disease a fatal degenerative neurological condition affecting nerve cells which control muscles which in turn enable human beings to move, speak, breathe and swallow. (2) With the progress of motor neurone disease, do the nerve cells eventually degenerate and die. (3) Is the average period between diagnosis and death from motor neurone disease approximately three years. (4) Is Rilutek the only disease-modifying drug licensed for the treatment of motor neurone disease. (5) Is the Minister able to say whether more than 50,000 patients worldwide have been treated with Rilutek to date, with the latest data showing a life-extension of up to one year for sufferers of motor neurone disease. (6) Does Rilutek cost patients suffering with motor neurone disease approximately $900 per month. (7) Is the Minister able to say whether the Motor Neurone Disease Association of Victoria Inc. has been told that most sufferers of motor neurone disease cannot afford the cost of Rilutek. (8) Will the Minister do everything possible to have Rilutek listed on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme immediately so that motor neurone disease sufferers can afford to use the drug and, as a consequence, increase their life expectancy; if not, why not. the honourable member’s question: (1) and (2) I am advised that the term ‘motor neurone disease’ refers to a group of degenerative neurological conditions of which amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (or ALS) is the most common form and arguably the most devastating of these disorders. The progression of ALS involves damage to, and death of motor neurones, leading to weakness of the muscles, eventual paralysis and death. (3) The illness is progressive, with a median survival of three to five years. (4) Rilutek is currently the only drug registered for the treatment of ALS. (5) I have received correspondence from the Motor Neurone Disease Association of Victoria Inc. containing this information. (6) Yes. (7) The Motor Neurone Disease Association of Victoria Inc. has indicated that most of its patient members are unable to afford this drug. (8) Proposed new listings of medicines on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) are assessed by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC), the Government’s independent expert advisory group on PBS listings. A medicine cannot be subsidised via the PBS unless the PBAC makes a recommendation to do so. In assessing an application for listing an item on the PBS, the PBAC is required to take into account the medical effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and safety of the medicine concerned compared with other available treatments for the condition. An application to list Rilutek on the PBS was considered by the PBAC at its meeting held on 5-6 December 2002. Details of the positive recommendations made by the PBAC are normally made available on the Department of Health and Ageing’s website within 16 working days of each meeting. Defence: National Service Medal (Question No. 1138) Ms Jann McFarlane asked the Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 14 November 2002: (1) Did her predecessor and the Prime Minister both issue press releases on 26 April 2001 announcing the Anniversary of National Service 1951-1972 Medal (ANSM) and stating that Australians who elected to complete their national service obligations as members of the Citizens Military Force (CMF) under the 1965-1972 national service scheme would be eligible for the medal.",233,Gbrmpa And Where Is She Located To Perform These Duties
204,Mr Andrews,"The Minister for Health and Ageing has provided the following answer to(2) Is she aware that the ANSM section has told people who served in the CMF that they are ineligible for the medal. (3) How many people who served as members of the CMF have applied for a National Service medal. (4) How many people who served as members of the CMF had their applications rejected prior to 30 October 2002. (5) Were the Declaration and Determination under the Anniversary of National Service 1951-1972 Medal Regulations which appeared in Gazette No. S409 on 30 October 2002 introduced to clarify the guidelines for the medal. (6) Will people who were notified by the ANSM section that they were ineligible for the medal prior to 30 October 2002 because there were no guidelines on CMF service, be notified that they will now receive the ANSM; if so, when. (7) Why did it take so long for the regulations to be introduced. Mrs Vale-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) Yes. (3) There have been around 130,000 applications received for the medal, but to research the exact number of CMF applications would require diversion of resources now utilised to process applications. (4) None, they were all put aside pending the Regulation to include CMF service to be eligible for the ANSM. (5) Yes. (6) No. However, their applications will now be processed expeditiously. (7) The matter did not arise until about May 2002 when it was discovered, while assessing the first of the CMF applications received, that CMF service could not be included for the award of the medal under the existing regulations. Parliamentarians: Personal Computers (Question No. 1141) Mr Andren asked the Minister representing the Minister for Finance and Administration, upon notice, on 2 December 2002: (1) Do (a) government Departments and (b) the offices of Members of Parliament have a choice about the personal computers that are provided to them for their daily use? (2) Were (a) Amiga, (b) Atari, (c) Be, (d) Linux, (e) Macintosh, (f) OS/2 and Windows 98/98/NT2000 computer operating systems considered for ordinary day-to-day use by staff members of Members of Parliament and in government departments?

(4) Which operating system was shown to have the lowest total cost of ownership? (5) What security issues were considered and which operating system was shown to be the most secure? (6) Is the operating system that was selected susceptible to viruses and what costs were factored in to manage this issue? (7) How significant was user productivity in the choice of personal computers and which ease-of-use studies were used to inform this decision? (8) Are government offices able to request personal computers with alternative operating systems to those supplied? swer to the honourable member’s question: (1) (a) Commonwealth departments are individually responsible for determining the infrastructure and operating systems that they use.

205,Mr Costello,"The Minister for Finance and Administration has provided the following ansibility and take account of their business requirements, which vary considerably across the Commonwealth. (b) No. The information technology arrangements in the Electorate Offices of Members of Parliament are provided by Finance through an outsourced arrangement with Computer Sciences Corporation Australia Pty Ltd (CSC). The Department leases the Electorate Office IT equipment from CSC under the terms and conditions of the contract. This equipment is selected from a limited range specified by CSC and is refreshed on a regular basis. Information technology services provided to Members of Parliament while based in Parliament House are provided by the relevant Parliamentary Departments. (2) Not all systems listed were considered as the requirements of Members of Parliament in both their Electorate Offices and Parliament House are complex and as a result the Commonwealth was required to provide a system that could demonstrate value for money whilst also meeting the needs of both these environments. The IT environment is based on a configuration that utilises a highend industry standard, providing a significant degree of compatibility and functionality. Selection of non-industry standard systems would increase costs for the Commonwealth in terms of capacity, security and maintenance. (3) Yes, however, to meet the diverse needs of the Electorate Offices, software packages must be compatible with the Parliamentary computing environment. Hence the selection of software must provide the necessary levels of security and flexibility, as provided for in high-end industry standard software. (4) A total cost of ownership analysis for each system listed in (2) was not completed as not all systems met the business needs of Electorate Offices. Factors such as compatibility, ease of use, security, and technical support must also be considered. In addition, there is a requirement on the Commonwealth to observe government procurement policies when sourcing IT products. (5) When selecting an operating system, the Commonwealth is required to abide by the security standards set out in the Commonwealth Protective Security Manual produced by the Attorney General’s Department, and all other relevant legislation, including the Australian Communications-Electronic Security Instruction 33 (ACSI 33). (6) No computer system is free from virus attack. The Commonwealth upholds the policies as defined by the Commonwealth Protective Security Manual in the management of its IT environment. The Department evaluates all software to assess its vulnerability to attack prior to installation. Risk mitigation strategies are developed to minimise virus attacks and these costs are factored into overall system support and are difficult to separate. (7) When assessing the software and hardware requirements of Electorate Offices, consideration is given to both the business needs of Electorate Offices and its users. In recognising the importance of user productivity, the department provides training appropriate to the Electorate Office IT environment. (8) See (1) (a) above. Aviation: Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport (Question No. 1146) Mr Murphy asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 2 December 2002: Further to the reply to question No. 494 (Hansard, 16 September 2002, page 6308), how soon after 31 December 2003 will the figures relating to forecast air-traffic movements to and from Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport be made public. Under the Airports Act 1996 (the Act) the Sydney Airports Corporation Limited (SACL) is required to submit a draft Master Plan (MP) for Sydney Airport to the Minister by 31 December 2003.

(6) Has the DPP asked Dr Colston whether he will voluntarily submit himself for fresh medical assessment; if so, what was the date of this request and was it made in writing or oral; if not, why not. (7) Has Dr Colston agreed to submit himself for fresh medical assessment; if not, why not. (8) Has Dr Colston refused to submit himself for fresh medical assessment; if so, why. (9) Has Dr Colston, his lawyers, treating doctors or anyone else, attempted to place any conditions on the DPP in relation to Dr Colston’s preparedness, or otherwise, to be medically assessed afresh by competent medical specialists who have never previously examined him; if so, what are those conditions. (10) Have any medical appointments been arranged for Dr Colston to be examined by competent medical specialists who have never previously examined him; if so, what are the dates on which these new medical appointments are to take place; if not, why not. (11) Has any person from the office of the DPP conducted a face-to-face interview with Dr Colston since 1 July 1999; if so, on what dates and what were the outcomes of the interviews. (12) Why is the review of Dr Colston’s case by the DPP taking so long to finalise. (13) When does the DPP expect to make a decision on whether or not Dr Colston is fit enough to stand trial on twenty-eight charges of defrauding the Commonwealth through travel rorts. (14) Will the review of Dr Colston’s case by the DPP since July 2002 be concluded before January 2003; if not, why not. (1) Yes. (2) In July 2002. From an independent medical specialist. (3) The DPP considered that given the passage of time a further review should be carried out. (4) The DPP requested an assessment of Dr Colston’s fitness to stand trial. (5) The DPP requested that Dr Colston attend to be examined which he has done. The medical assessment is not completed and the DPP has requested Dr Colston’s further co-operation. (6) In July 2002 the DPP requested in writing that Dr Colston attend for an independent examination. (7) See (5). (8) See (5).

207,Mr Williams,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(14) The DPP does not expect the review to be completed before January 2003 as it is not expected that the specialist’s assessment will be completed by that date. Colston, Former Senator: Criminal Proceedings (Question No. 1150) Mr Murphy asked the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 2 December 2002: (1) Did the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP), in providing evidence to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee on 20 November 2002 concerning the progress of the DPP’s third review of the case of Dr Malcolm Arthur Colston’s capacity to stand trial on twenty-eight charges of defrauding the Commonwealth through travel rorts, state, inter alia, that the reason the matter was discontinued around April 2001 was the considered opinion of a number of medical experts that Dr Colston was not fit to stand trial, not that Dr Colston was about to die. (2) Did the DPP further state that there were some pessimistic prognostications but the fundamental basis for the advice and the opinions which caused the decision to be made around April 2001 was Dr Colston’s fitness to stand trial, not his pessimistic outlook. (3) What was the nature of the medical or other evidence that came to light around April 2001 that ston only had months to live. (4) What changed the DPP’s mind around April 2001 that Dr Colston was not about to die. (5) What specific prognoses in relation to Dr Colston’s fitness to stand trial led the DPP to discontinue proceedings against Dr Colston. (6) What is the relationship between the prognoses of the hitherto terminal illness of Dr Colston and his fitness to stand trial. (1) The DPP discontinued the prosecution of Dr Colston on 5 July 1999 and stated that it was the assessment of all the specialists that Dr Colston had a terminal illness and his condition was such that he was unfit to stand trial and there was no prospect that he would be fit to stand trial in the future. The DPP’s review of this matter in 2001 confirmed this was the case. (2) This statement related to the decision to discontinue in July 1999 and its subsequent review in 2001. (3) See (1). (4) See (1). (5) The assessment that Dr Colston was unfit to stand trial and there was no prospect that he would be fit to stand trial in the future. (6) See (1) and (5). Colston, Former Senator: Criminal Proceedings (Question No. 1151) Mr Murphy asked the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 2 December 2002: (1) Further to his reply to question No. 862 (Hansard, 24 September 2002, page 7159), did the Director of Public Prosecutions, in providing evidence to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee on 20 November 2002 concerning the taxpayer-funded travel since July 1999 of former Senator Dr Malcolm Arthur Colston, state, inter alia, that one must draw the distinction between someone sitting in a plane seat and travelling and someone being able to sit in a court from 10 o’clock in the morning when the court starts, with a break in the middle of the day, and finishing at four o’clock and being able to concentrate on the evidence, give instructions to the instructing solicitor and counsel and being able to concentrate through that period of time for the estimated duration of the trial.

(1) Yes. (2) Sitting hours are a matter for the court conducting a trial, not the DPP. Social Welfare: Age Pensions (Question No. 1152) Mr Murphy asked the Minister representing the Minister for Family and Community Services, upon notice, on 2 December 2002: Further to the reply to question No. 920 (Hansard, 14 October 2002, page 7551), will the Howard Government review the assets test as it impacts on pensioners who own their own home and also own only one modest investment property; if so, when; if not, why not. lowing answer to the honourable member’s question: There are no plans at present to review the assets test as it impacts on pensioners who own their own home and also own investment property. A pensioner’s own home is exempt from the assets test. The net asset value of an investment property is assessed as an asset, consistent with other types of investment, that is the market value of the property, net of any loan secured against the property. The assets test is designed so that people with substantial assets, apart from their home, use the assets (either directly or to produce income) to meet their day-to-day living expenses before calling on the social security system for support. Centrelink provides a free and independent Financial Information Service (FIS) to assist pensioners in better understanding social security payments and provisions and the broader investment market. Pensioners can make an appointment by telephoning Centrelink on 13 23 00. Environment: Dolphins (Question No. 1154) Mr Kelvin Thomson asked the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, upon notice, on 2 December 2002: (1) What is the Government’s stance on the issue of dolphins being harvested for food. (2) What action has the Government taken to protect dolphins in Australian waters from fishing. (3) What action has the Government taken internationally to protect dolphins from fishing. (4) What representations has Australia made to (a) Japan and (b) the International Whaling Commission regarding fishing for dolphins in Japanese national waters. (1) The Government is strongly opposed to the harvesting of dolphins for food, and does not condone it in any circumstances. (2) The Government has established the highest level of protection for all cetacean species (whales, dolphins and porpoises). The Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act) established the Australian Whale Sanctuary in the Australian exclusive economic zone. The EPBC Act protects all cetaceans occurring in the Australian Whale Sanctuary from threatening processes that include some fishing practices. The EPBC Act makes it an offence to kill, injure, take, trade, keep, move or interfere with a cetacean within the Australian Whale Sanctuary. Under the EPBC Act, all Commonwealth fisheries and State fisheries with an export component are required to employ methods to avoid killing or injuring protected species such as dolphins during fishing operations. The Government requires all major Commonwealth fisheries to implement bycatch action plans to address this issue. The plans will require fishers to take all reasonable steps to ensure that cetaceans are not killed or injured as a result of fishing and that fishing activities do not, or are not likely to, adversely affect their survival or recovery.",238,Gbrmpa And Where Is She Located To Perform These Duties

211,Mr Anthony,The Minister for Family and Community Services has provided the fol,239,Gbrmpa And Where Is She Located To Perform These Duties
212,Dr Kemp,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:Under the Natural Heritage Trust, the Government has provided over $140 000 over the past three years to develop further methods of preventing the incidental capture of marine mammals. The results of this research, which is investigating the effectiveness of acoustic ‘pingers’ in warning marine mammals (particularly threatened dolphin species and dugongs) of the presence of potentially hazardous nets, should inform future efforts to protect dolphins in Australian waters. (3) Internationally, Australia leads the campaign for better protection of whales and dolphins in our region. Australia recently initiated discussions with our South Pacific neighbours to develop a South Pacific Arrangement on Marine Mammals under the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (the Bonn Convention). The first meeting to develop the Arrangement will be convened by the South Pacific Regional Environment Programme in Apia, Samoa from 3-5 March 2003. The Arrangement will have as its aim the protection and conservation of marine mammals such as dolphins, and their habitats in the region, through actions nominated by South Pacific nations themselves. Furthermore, Australia was instrumental in banning driftnet fishing, which posed the single greatest threat to dolphins (resulting in the hundreds of thousands of deaths annually). (4) (a) Japan In December 2002, I asked Australian delegates who were meeting with Japanese officials to raise our concerns about the treatment of whales and dolphins. While the Japan Fisheries Agency, which has direct responsibility for cetacean matters in Japan, did not attend the meetings, key environment and foreign affairs officials were left in no doubt about Australia’s commitment to the full protection of whales and dolphins. (b) International Whaling Commission (IWC) The Government believes that the IWC, as the body responsible for cetaceans, is the appropriate forum to discuss the welfare of dolphins internationally. We have called on all members to honour Resolution 1991-5 (calling for information on small cetacean stocks subjected to significant directed and incidental takes), and Resolution 2001-13 (urging Contracting Governments to provide such information to the Scientific Committee and to respond to recommendations for action to conserve small cetaceans). Japan has not complied with these requests, on the basis that in its view, the IWC has no competency over small cetaceans. The world’s largest direct kill of any cetacean (whale, dolphin or porpoise) is the annual harpooning of up to 18,000 Dall’s porpoises off Japan. Australia has consistently voiced our opposition to this hunt. In 2001, at the IWC’s 53rd annual meeting, Australia strongly supported a resolution which urged the Government of Japan to halt the directed takes of Dall’s porpoises (pending a full assessment by the Scientific Committee). At the 54th meeting in May 2002, Australia joined other IWC members in criticising Japan for continuing the mass slaughter of Dall’s porpoises in defiance of the IWC resolutions, and for refusing to submit data on the hunt to the Scientific Committee. United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (Question No. 1156) Mrs Crosio asked the Minister representing the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women, upon notice, on 2 December 2002: (1) Further to the Minister’s letter to me regarding the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women on 25 November 2002, otherwise known as White Ribbon Day, has the Government reconsidered its opposition to the signing of the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women. (2) Have 75 states signed, and 47 states ratified, the Optional Protocol; if so, what are the reasons behind the Government’s decision to not sign the Optional Protocol, considering the role Australia has played historically in fighting for the improvement of women’s rights globally. (3) Was Australia a member on the UN Commission on the Status of Women (CSW) from 1983 until 1990 and again from 1993 until 1996; if so, why has Australia not been a member of the CSW since 1996. Mrs Vale-The answer to the honourable member’s question to the Minister representing the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women is as follows: (1) The Government has not reconsidered this decision. (2) These figures are correct as at 18 October 2002, as stated on the UN website. Between March and August 2000, the Government undertook a review of Australia’s interaction with the UN treaty committee system. On 29 August 2000, the Government announced it would not sign the Optional Protocol to CEDAW while its concerns with the treaty committee system remained. (3) Australia was a member of CSW between 1983 and 1990 and from 1993 until 1996. The Government reviews its membership of UN committees on a regular basis. Seeking membership of a UN committee requires a ‘whole of government’ resource commitment and must be balanced with competing priorities. Australia will shortly take up membership of the Commission on Human Rights and this will be a major focus for Australia’s engagement with the UN committee system. Job Placement Education and Training Program (Question No. 1157) Mr Fitzgibbon asked the Minister for Children and Youth Services, upon notice, on 2 December 2002: (1) Has the Newcastle based Centacare Job Placement Education and Training (JPET) program been defunded following a recent tender process. (2) Was a proposal for a Centacare JPET program based in Maitland also unsuccessful despite the fact the area has high unemployment. (3) Is the process of evaluation of all tenders throughout Australia for the JPET program to be reviewed; if so, (a) how will tenders be assessed during the process and (b) will tenders be judged on evidence of past achievements or what the agencies say they would do. (4) Has the number of placements decreased in the recent tender process; if so, by how many. (1) and (2) Negotiations are still being undertaken in relation to the provision of JPET services. Until the process has been completed we are not in a position to provide further details as to the successful or unsuccessful applicants. (3) (a) (b) As the result of a complaint, a review of the process was announced on Friday 8th November and will be completed by 31 January 2003. The review is not about reassessing all the applications but investigating the specific complaints made about the business allocation process. (4) A similar number of young people will continue to be serviced by JPET services. Veterans: Gold Card (Question No. 1158) Ms Hoare asked the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs, upon notice, on 2 December 2002: (1) Does the Government plan to merge her Department with Centrelink. (2) Is she aware of the unique status of veterans. (3) What is the future of the Gold Card. Mrs Vale-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (1) No. There are no plans to merge the Department of Veterans’ Affairs with Centrelink. (2) Yes. I, with the Government remain committed to those who have served and currently serve in the defence of Australia. The unique status of veterans is recognised and preserved by the work of the Repatriation Commission, which, through the Department of Veterans’ Affairs, serves members of Australia’s veterans and defence force communities, their war widows/widowers and dependants through programs of care, compensation, commemoration and defence support services. (3) The Government is committed to the future of the Gold Card and has no plans to reduce its status in the Australian community. The Gold Card is issued to Australian veterans, war widows/widowers and dependants, who under the Veterans’ Entitlements Act 1986 are entitled to the full range of health care services funded by the Department of Veterans’ Affairs.",239,Gbrmpa And Where Is She Located To Perform These Duties
213,Mr Anthony,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:Veterans: Gold Card (Question No. 1159) Ms Hoare asked the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs, upon notice, on 2 December 2002: (1) How many Gold Card holders are there in Australia. (2) How many services have been provided to veterans in 2002. (3) What percentage of services to Gold Card holders were bulk billed in 2002. Mrs Vale-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (1) 282,017 (as at 30 September 2002). (2) The total number of services for all treatment types paid by the Health Insurance Commission (HIC) on behalf of the Department of Veterans’ Affairs (DVA) for the 2001-02 financial year was 17,297,046. This is comprised of the following: Gold Card treatment (veterans) 10,841,804 Gold Card treatment (war widow/widowers) 6,005,917 White Card treatment (veterans) 449,325 The figures above represent services by all providers (general practitioners, specialists, private hospitals and allied health providers) but do not include public hospitals. (3) The term bulk billing is not normally used in describing a feature of the DVA/HIC system of payment for medical and allied health providers. When a veteran or a dependant Gold Cardholder receives treatment, the client’s details are recorded on a claim form which is forwarded to HIC, which pays the provider, on behalf of DVA. The Department’s registered Local Medical Officers receive 100% of the Medical Benefits Schedule fee for medical services. General practitioners who are not registered to DVA receive 85% of the Medical Benefits Schedule fee, plus 60 cents. Similarly, when the holder of a White Card receives treatment for an accepted war/service caused condition, the provider is paid by HIC for that treatment on behalf of DVA. This is the method by which the Department pays for the vast majority of services provided to veterans by medical and allied health providers and would represent over 99% of payments. Immigration: Woomera Detainees (Question No. 1160) Dr Lawrence asked the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, upon notice, on 2 December 2002: (1) What action is being taken regarding allegations of abuse by three former Woomera security guards accused of assaulting and bashing thirteen year old Afghani, Zihar Sayed. (2) Have the three men in question been found since failing to appear in court on 5 September 2002. (3) Is he able to say whether the (a) Australian Federal Police or (b) Director of Public Prosecutions is responsible for locating the men. (4) Is he also able to say whether the men are still employees of Australian Correctional Management. (5) What measures has the Government put in place to ensure children in detention are protected from physical and emotional abuse. (1) I can confirm the charges against two of the officers were dropped at the proceedings on Monday 25 November 2002. However the charges against a third officer remain. A warrant for his arrest was issued by the Magistrate on 25 November 2002. (2) Although charges were laid by the AFP, summonses were not served on the three officers. As the three men had not been served with the summons, they were not required to attend the hearing in September 2002. (3) The AFP is responsible. (4) One of the officers for whom charges were dropped remains employed with ACM. (currently not working at an Immigration Detention Facility).",241,Gbrmpa And Where Is She Located To Perform These Duties
214,Mr Ruddock,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(5) The Department takes it duty of care to all detainees, including child detainees seriously. The Immigration Detention Standards specify that “9.2.1 Unaccompanied minors are detained under conditions which protect them from harmful influences and which take account of the needs of their particular age and gender 9.3.1 The special needs of babies and young children are met 9.4.1 Social and educational programs appropriate to the child’s age and abilities are available to all children in detention 9.4.2 Detainees are responsible for the safety and care of their child(ren) living in detention 9.4.3 Where necessary, help and guidance in parenting skills is provided by appropriately qualified personnel 9.5.2 Arrangements are made, wherever practicable, for children to be born in a hospital outside the detention facility. If a child is born in a detention facility this is not recorded on their birth certificate 9.5.3 Where a nursing infant is with its mother in detention, provision is made for the child to be cared for by the detainee.” While in the detention environment, parents retain the responsibility and primary care role for their children. They are supported in this regard by the program and welfare services provided by the Detention Services Provider which are available to parents. Incorporated into this support is the development of a case management plan for each child. Both Departmental and Detention Service Provider staff monitor children in the detention environment and report to the relevant Child Welfare Authorities any incidents or situations that may place a child at risk. In addition, both the Department and the Detention Services Provider are required to comply with any State/Territory Child Welfare laws. The Department works cooperatively with welfare authorities where any investigation is to be undertaken. DIMIA signed an MOU with the South Australian Department of Human Services on 6 December 2001. The Department is currently negotiating MOUs on child welfare matters with NSW, SA, WA and Vic. The Northern Territory has also expressed an interest in having an MOU. Defence: Visiting Warships (Question No. 1162) Mr Kerr asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 3 December 2002: (1) Is the Minister able to say whether a visit of a US nuclear powered warship proposed for the port of Hobart in or around late December 2002 has been postponed or cancelled. (2) Has there been any recent review of security issues relating to the visit of US warships to Australian ports since the (a) attacks in the USA on 11 September 2001 and (b) targeting and bombing of Australians in Bali on 12 October 2002. (3) Have those events or other events of a similar nature affected the assessment of risk associated with such visits; if so, what is the new assessment of risk. (4) Given Australians’ heightened security concerns since those events, if visits proceed will the docking arrangements remain the same as those applying in the past; if not, what will be the new arrangements. (5) Will the exclusion area around any visiting vessel be the same as in the past; if not, what exclusion area will be established. (6) Will the arrangements for monitoring any exclusion area remain the same as in the past; if not, without disclosure of the detail of operational security matters, what different arrangements will be made. This question falls within the portfolio responsibilities of the Minister for Defence and the Minister for Justice and Customs. Defence: Visiting Warships (Question No. 1165) Mr Quick asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 3 December 2002:",242,Gbrmpa And Where Is She Located To Perform These Duties
215,Mr Downer,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(1) Further to questions Nos. 1161 to 1163 asked by the member for Denison, will the arrangements for shore leave for the crews visiting Hobart remain the same as for recent past visits; if not, without disclosure of any detail relating to operational security issues, how will the arrangements change. (2) Will additional measures be taken that will have an impact on the ordinary activities of residents and visitors to Hobart during any future visit. (3) If so, what will those measures entail and what activities will they affect. (4) Has there been any recent assessment of the availability of appropriate infrastructure and resources to deal with an actual or threatened major terrorism incident directed towards such vessels, or the crew of such vessels on shore leave while the vessels are visiting Hobart; if so, what were the conclusions of the assessment; if not, will an assessment be undertaken. This question falls within the portfolio responsibilities of the Minister for Defence and the Minister for Justice and Customs. Colston, Former Senator: Criminal Proceedings (Question No. 1169) Mr Murphy asked the Attorney-General, upon notice, on 3 December 2002: Further to his reply to parts (3) and (4) of question No. 678 (Hansard, 11 November 2002, page 8680), did the medical report of the state of health of the former Senator Dr Malcolm Arthur Colston, dated 9 February 2001, indicate that Dr Colston was terminally ill; if so, (a) was the medical condition from which Dr Colston suffers and reported on in the report the same medical condition that the independent expert eminent medical specialists reported on in their reports of 14 and 19 May 1999 and (b) did the 9 February 2001 report indicate (i) any improvement in the state of health of Dr Colston; if so, to what extent; if not, (c) was the medical condition reported on in the 9 February 2001 report another medical condition which developed since May 1999 and (d) is this medical condition a terminal illness. Yes. (a) Yes. (b) (i) No. (c) No. (d) See (c). Car Industry: Federal Approach (Question No. 1172) Mr Danby asked the Minister for Trade, upon notice, on 3 December 2002: (1) Is he able to say whether the Minister for Finance and Administration represented the Government at the opening of Holdens V6 engine plant in Port Melbourne on 30 October 2002. (2) Is he able to say whether the Minister for Finance and Administration echoed the sentiment of the Victorian Premier in congratulating the construction workers for building the plant on time and on budget. (3) Is he also able to say whether the Minister for Finance and Administration told the 800 people gathered at the opening of the new plant that this kind of cooperative relationship between workers and management would send a message to car headquarters in Detroit and Tokyo. (4) Does he agree with this approach and will he rule out introducing divisive industrial caveats into federal assistance for the vehicle building industry where cooperation, not coercion, has resulted in the highest ever levels of exports, employment and productivity. The Minister for Trade did not attend the event cited in the question and is therefore unable to provide an answer to the points raised in the question. Immigration: Parent Migration (Question No. 1175) Mr Martin Ferguson asked the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, upon notice, on 3 December 2002: Under existing parent visa categories for parent migration, how many (a) onshore and (b) offshore applications are there (i) in total and (ii) by country.",243,Gbrmpa And Where Is She Located To Perform These Duties

Immigration: Visitor Visas (Question No. 1192) Mr Danby asked the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, upon notice, on 4 December 2002: (1) How many visas have been issued to visitors from Saudi Arabia each year over the last 10 years. (2) How many of those visas have been issued to individuals who expressed an intention to teach religious studies in Australia. (3) Have any visas been denied to such individuals; if so, on what grounds. (4) Were any of the applicants for visas known to be supporters or teachers of extreme Wahabi-ist, alQaeda, or JI doctrines; if not, were any background checks done to establish this. (5) Is he able to say for how many Muslim (a) institutions and (b) religious schools in Australia the Saudi Government provides funding. (6) Is he able to say what conditions are attached to the funding; if so do any of the conditions relate to the content of the teaching. (7) Is he aware of any Australian Islamic Schools that receive Saudi funding and that mandate the teaching of the radical Wahabi-ist, al-Qaeda, or JI, doctrines rather than other moderate forms of Islam. (8) Is he aware of any teachers who have received visas and who teach radical Wahabi-ist, al-Qaeda doctrine in Australia. (1) Detailed records of persons granted Visitor visas by citizenship prior to 1996-97 are not readily available. Since 1996-97 to 30 September 2002, 8,237 persons from Saudi Arabia have been granted Visitor visas. The breakdown by program year is as follows: 1996-97 907 1997-98 837 1998-99 996 1999-00 1040 2000-01 1730 2001-02 1746 2002-03 (YTD) 981 (2) Since 1996-97, religious worker visas (subclass 428) have been granted to two persons from Saudi Arabia. The religious worker visa is granted to applicants who are sponsored by a religious organisation in Australia that directly serves the religious objectives of the organisation. The role undertaken by such visa holders may involve teaching or more of a pastoral care role. (3) Data on this is not readily available. (4) Persons who apply for visas to enter Australia as religious workers are required to provide information on their backgrounds and skills relating to the approved sponsorship. This information is checked and confirmed prior to a visa being granted. All applicants are required to meet public interest criteria, which includes being assessed by the competent Australian authorities as not being a risk to Australian national security.",247,Hksar Of The Prc 589 170 759
221,Mr Ruddock,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:On the basis of information provided and background checks conducted, my Department is not aware of any of these applicants being known to be supporters or teachers of extreme Wahabi-ist, al-Qaeda, or JI doctrines. (5) Information on this matter is not generally held by the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (DIMIA). (6) Information on this matter is not generally held by DIMIA. (7) Information on this matter is not generally held by DIMIA. (8) No. Veterans: Entitlements (Question No. 1193) Mr Bevis asked the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs, upon notice, on 4 December 2002: How many former employees of Qantas Empire Airlines engaged in forward operations in World War II have had their service accepted as qualifying service for service pensions or other veterans’ benefits. Mrs Vale-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: Staff employed by Qantas who were appointed to the Royal Australian Air Force Reserve during World War II have eligibility for disability compensation pension coverage under the Veterans’ Entitlements Act 1986 (VEA). Those who served overseas or incurred danger from the hostile forces of the enemy between 3 September 1939 and 15 August 1945 have qualifying service and would be eligible to apply for the service pension and other benefits. The number of veterans involved is not readily available, as my department’s database does not identify Qantas employees as a specific group. Additionally, some Qantas former staff may have enlisted for full-time service in the Australian Defence Forces during World War II. They likewise enjoy normal veteran entitlements but again, my department’s database does not identify former Qantas employees as a specific group. Immigration: Transit Visas (Question No. 1198) Mr Martin Ferguson asked the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, upon notice, on 5 December 2002: (1) Are seafarers applying for, and are eligible to be issued, a transit visa to enter Australia to join their ship at an Australian port; if so, how many transit visas have been granted for this purpose in each of the past 10 years. (2) When were transit visas first introduced and under what legislation or regulations. (3) Were seafarers immediately eligible for this visa for ship crew changeovers. (4) What visa did seafarers access for ship crew changeovers before transit visas were introduced. (5) What was the stated purpose of transit visas. (6) Who is eligible to apply or be issued with a transit visa and what is the cost of obtaining a transit visa. (7) Which other visa categories are available with no cost to lodge an application. (8) What arrangements does his Department have in place for seafarers to apply for transit visas. (9) Are transit visas in an electronic form; if so, how does Customs identify them at the airport for clearance purposes. (10) Are foreign crew leaving Australia by air required to apply for visas upon departure; if so, under what visa category. (11) Does his department process these applications and what criteria are applied to assess applications. (12) What checks, if any, does his Department carry out before issuing these transit visas and do they include a check against his Department’s Movement Alert List; if not, why not and are there any other visas for which these checks are not required. (13) How do Customs officers at the airport determine that the transit visas are for seafarers and what additional documentation, if any, are seafarers required to prove that they are joining a ship. (14) Do the transit visas for this purpose have any conditions and what, if any, checks are carried out by either Customs or his Department to determine that the conditions of the transit visa have been met. (15) Do seafarers require a passport to apply for a transit visa. (16) What measures, if any, does his Department, or any other Department or agency, have in place to ensure compliance with the transit visa requirements that the seafarer join their ship within 72 hours, and how many times has this requirement been breached in each of the past ten years. (17) What is the penalty for breaching the visa requirement and are visas cancelled as a result; if not, why not and which other visas are exempt from cancellation for breaching the conditions. (18) What visa category is the seafarer on when they board their ship and what is the process for receiving that visa. (19) If a seafarer leaves their ship in an Australian port, what visa are they on and how long are they eligible to be on that visa while away from their ship. (1) Yes. Seafarers may apply for a transit visa to join their ship, and providing they meet the criteria for the grant of a transit visa as set out in the Migration Regulations, will be eligible. The table below shows the total number of transit visas granted since 1994/95 (earlier data is not available). The figures include transit visas granted to persons wishing to transit Australia to another country as well as seafarers joining their ship. I do not have a breakdown of the data. 2002/03 up 1994/95 1995/96 1996/97 1997/98 1998/99 1999/00 2000/01 2001/02 to 31/11/02 Total grants 17757 20976 20281 19478 23111 25656 30975 34408 17872 (2) Transit visas were prescribed by legislation in the Migration Regulations 1989, although the transit visa regime existed in one form or another prior to these Regulations coming into effect. (3) Prior to the commencement of the Migration Regulations 1989, seafarers were able to access transit visas for ship crew changeovers. Their eligibility for the visa would be assessed against the criteria or policy that existed at the time. (4) A transit visa regime has existed in one form or another since Australia introduced migration controls. Prior to the existence of the current transit visa, seafarers accessed transhipment visas or endorsements for ship crew changeovers. (5) Transit visas are temporary visas permitting the holder to travel to and enter Australia on 1 or more occasions and to remain in Australia no longer than 72 hours on each occasion. The visa is granted to persons intending to enter Australia : (a) to pass through Australia in transit to another country; or (b) to pass through Australia in order to join a non-military ship as a member of its crew. (6) All non-citizens are eligible to apply for transit visas. A transit visa will be granted if all the criteria set out in the Migration Regulations are met. There is no cost involved in lodging an application for a transit visa. (7) Several other visa categories do not attract a visa application charge. These include, but are not limited to, certain ETAs, certain student visas, certain bridging visas, border visas, emergency visas, confirmatory visas and offshore humanitarian program visas. (8) Seafarers requiring a transit visa may apply at the nearest Australian High Commission or Embassy. (9) Transit visas are electronically recorded. The evidence of the visa is provided as a paper label affixed to their passport. They can be identified on arrival at an airport by the visa label. (10) No. Foreign crew signing off their vessel for repatriation by air will have a “sign-off” stamp placed in their passport by the Customs clearance officer as they leave their ship. This identifies them as departing crew at the airport on departure. They continue to hold their Special Purpose Visa for the period specified in the maintenance letter signed by the master of the vessel (to a maximum of 30 days). (11) Not applicable, see answer to 10 above.",262,Acyte Biotech Pty Ltd 2001 02 Sydney Nsw Sydney Nsw
222,Mr Ruddock,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(12) All applicants for transit visas are checked against DIMIA’s Movements Alert List, and nationals of selected countries are further checked for security purposes. In addition, checks are made that the applicant is a genuine seaman seeking to join a ship in Australia as a member of crew. (13) When applying for a transit visa and on arrival in Australia by air, it is a legislative requirement that seafarers present a valid passport or seafarer’s identity document. Further, it is a policy requirement that on application and on arrival at an airport the seafarer also present the following details as provided by the shipping agent: the names of the persons joining the vessel as crew; the names of the persons they are replacing; the name of the vessel; the date of arrival in Australia of the persons to be visaed; the port and date they are expected to join the vessel; and if they are not the vessel’s owner, a copy of the request for crew from the vessel’s agent in Australia which contains the details of the crew members applying for visas. On arrival in Australia, seafarers must also present their transit visa as evidenced in their travel document, and complete an incoming passenger card. (14) The following conditions apply to all transit visas: The holder must enter on or before the date specified by the Minister for the purpose and Conditions 8101 (the holder must not engage in work in Australia) and 8201 (while in Australia the holder must not engage, for more than 3 months, in any studies or training). Any one or more of conditions 8501, 8514 and 8516 may also be imposed. Condition 8501 requires that the holder must maintain adequate arrangements for health insurance while the holder is in Australia. Condition 8514 states that during the visa period of the visa, there must be no material change in the circumstances on the basis of which it was granted. Condition 8516 states that the holder must continue to be a person who would satisfy the primary or secondary criteria, as the case requires, for the grant of the visa. (15) No. Under current legislation transit visas can be evidenced in Seafarer’s Identity Documents when the holder is travelling to Australia to join their vessel. (16) There are no specific measures to ensure seafarers join their ship within the validity of their transit visa. As with all visa holders, if seafarers overstay the validity of their visa they become unlawful non-citizens liable for detention and removal. My Department does not maintain separate statistics on how many seafarers fall into this category. (17) If any of the visa conditions are breached, the visa may be liable for cancellation. (18) Seafarers may arrive in Australia by air as holders of transit visas. They then have 72 hours to sign-on to their vessel, at which time they are taken to hold a Special Purpose Visa by operation of law. Australian Customs Service (ACS) Officers attend vessels where such a crew change occurs to verify the seafarer’s identity and ensure his or her details appear on the crew manifest. (19) If a seafarer leaves their ship in an Australian port without the permission of the master of the vessel they are considered to be a deserter and their Special Purpose Visa ceases at midnight of the day on which they desert. If a seafarer permanently leaves their ship in an Australian port with the permission of the master they continue to hold their Special Purpose Visa for the period specified in the maintenance letter signed by the master (to a maximum of 30 days). If such a seafarer wishes to remain longer in Australia for tourism or other purposes, they are required to apply for the appropriate visa. Environment: Australian Greenhouse Office (Question No. 1202) Mr Murphy asked the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, upon notice, on 5 December 2002: (1) Further to his reply to part (1) of question No. 931 (Hansard, 16 October 2002, page 7904) regarding the cost of implementing the Kyoto Protocol, (a) what are the (i) highest and (ii) lowest estimates of the implementation costs, (b) how were the estimates derived and (c) what are the Government’s assumptions about the nature of international climate change action post 2012. (2) Further to his reply to part (2) of question No. 931 regarding a strategy intended to ensure cuts to Australia’s greenhouse emissions, (a) which State governments, local governments, business groups and community groups have the Government worked with in recent months to develop this strategy and (b) has the development of the strategy been completed; if not, why not; if so, what is that strategy and when will it be implemented. (1) (a) The Government estimates that the annual costs of implementing the Kyoto Protocol range from a low of 0 to a high of 0.4 per cent of GNP at 2012. These estimates are based on economic modelling undertaken by Warwick McKibbin (McKibbin Software Group) and the Australian Bureau of Agriculture and Resource Economics; (b) the assumptions underpinning these estimates are fully documented in reports by both modellers and are published on the AGO website http://www.greenhouse.gov.au; (c) the nature of international climate change action post 2012 is inherently uncertain, and the Government makes no assumptions about the nature of action post 2012. (2) (a) In developing the Climate Change Forward Strategy, the Government is working with all State and Territory Governments, a wide range of business and industry groups and the National Environmental Consultative Forum representing peak environmental organisations. The Government will also be consulting with the Australian Local Government Association and other relevant groups as necessary. An attendance list of the initial government-business dialogue meeting was attached to my media release of 20 August 2002 and can be viewed on the AGO web site. As noted in my reply to part (2) of question No. 931, which was provided in mid October 2002, the forward strategy is currently being developed. Progress on development of the Strategy is documented in media releases, articles and information on the AGO website. Immigration: Migrant Resource Centres (Question No. 1206) Mr Laurie Ferguson asked the Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs, upon notice, on 5 December 2002: (1) Since March 1996, how many Migrant Resource Centres or Migrant Service Agencies have had their core funding withdrawn by his Department. (2) In respect of each centre, what (a) was the name of the centre, (b) was the date of effect of the withdrawal of funding, (c) were the local government areas previously covered by the centre, (d) was the federal electorate division in which the centre was located and (e) are the details of alternative service delivery arrangements, if any, put in place by the his Department. (1) Three Migrant Resource Centres (MRCs) have had funding withdrawn. Core funding of two other MRCs will cease early in 2003. (2) The details for each Centre are outlined below. (i) Cairns Migrant Resource Centre Service Agreement ceased 31 March 1998. Covered the Local Government Areas (LGAs) of Cairns, Mulgrave, Johnston, Cook, Mareeba, Eacham, Tully North, Cardwell, Douglas, Atherton, Atherton tablelands, Etherage and Herberton. Federal electorate of Leichhardt. Migrant Settlement Services (Centacare Cairns), a new Migrant Service Agency (MSA), was established. A Service Agreement was signed with the new agency in June 1999. In the interim period before the MSA was established, the Community Settlement Services Scheme (CSSS) grant to Cairns Migrant Resource Centre continued to be funded, to ensure continued service delivery in the Cairns area. (ii) Brisbane Migrant Resource Centre Service Agreement ceased 30 June 1998. Covered the LGAs of Brisbane City, Ipswich, Redlands and Pine Rivers. Federal electorate of Brisbane. Multicultural Development Association, a new MSA, was established. A Service Agreement was signed with the new agency in June 1999. In the interim period before the MSA was established, the Australian Red Cross and the Multicultural Pastoral Care were funded to provide services, to ensure continued service delivery in the Brisbane area.",264,Acyte Biotech Pty Ltd 2001 02 Sydney Nsw Sydney Nsw
223,Dr Kemp,The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:,266,Acyte Biotech Pty Ltd 2001 02 Sydney Nsw Sydney Nsw
224,Mr Hardgrave,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(iii) Inner West Migrant Resource Centre Service Agreement ceased 30 June 2002. Covered the LGAs of Ashfield, Burwood, Concord, Drummoyne, Strathfield and Leichhardt. Federal electorate of Grayndler. Anglicare, Auburn MRC and Chinese Australian Services Society are funded to provide services until 30 June 2003, to ensure continued service delivery in the Inner West. The Department is currently developing a long-term strategy to determine the most effective method of settlement service delivery in the Inner West. (iv)Migrant Resource Centre of Central Australia Service Agreement for MRC core funding will cease 31 January 2003. Covers the statistical sub-divisions of Barkly and Central. Federal electorate of Lingiari. From1 February 2003, the MRC will re-constitute itself as Multicultural Community Services of Central Australia (McSCA) and will receive funding until 30 September 2003. This will ensure continued service delivery in the Alice Springs area. The McSCA will have the opportunity to apply for funding in the next CSSS round which will be advertised early next year. (v)Northern Metropolitan Migrant Resource Centre Service Agreement will cease 1 March 2003. Covers the statistical sub-divisions of Hume and Moreland. Federal electorate of Wills. Migrant Resource Centre North East and Migrant Resource Centre North West will receive additional funding to provide services to migrants in the Hume and Moreland areas. The Department is currently developing a long-term strategy to determine the most effective method of settlement service delivery in the Hume and Moreland areas. Veterans: Home Care Program (Question No. 1207) Mr Murphy asked the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs, upon notice, on 9 December 2002: Will she include regular lawn-mowing services under the Veterans’ Home Care program for veterans who are in receipt of a 100% General Rate disability pension; if not, why not. Mrs Vale-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: The Veterans’ Home Care (VHC) program is not an entitlement based program like most other veterans’ programs, but a fixed budget program like the Home and Community Care program. Pension rate is not a determining factor in the assessment for services, as VHC services are provided to Gold and White cardholders based on need that is assessed by the VHC Assessment and Coordination Agency. Funding levels are set in order to assist a greater number of veterans and war widows/widowers with essential low level support to meet their basic living needs. The focus of VHC home and garden maintenance is to minimise environmental health and safety hazards that impact on the veteran. It is intended to address one-off safety hazards rather than provide routine home and garden maintenance activities. Although some VHC Assessment Agencies approved regular lawn mowing during the first year of the program’s operation in 2001, the approval of this service is not within the scope of the VHC guidelines. Veterans are expected to maintain their current arrangements with family members, social networks and private providers. It is not intended to interfere with these arrangements, or to substitute for private service provision. Australia Post: Security (Question No. 1211) Mrs Crosio asked the Minister representing the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, upon notice, on 9 December 2002: Has his attention been drawn to the comments of the Prime Minister regarding a proposal, for security reasons, for people to produce photographic identification when posting parcels; if so, how will the Government implement the proposal, given that a large proportion of the community do not have access to photographic identification. has provided the following answer to the honourable member’s question based on advice received from Australia Post: Australia Post has advised that from Monday, 16 December 2002, as a result of a direction from the Department of Transport and Regional Services (DOTRS), customers will be required to provide proof of identity when lodging overseas mail. This is to meet newly introduced DOTRS cargo security requirements. Identification can take the form of a photo ID such as driver’s licence, passport or a signature that can be verified by a credit, debit or social security card. In addition, confirmation that the individual concerned and his/her work or home address are personally known to Australia Post staff will also be an acceptable form of ID for lodgement purposes.

Aviation: Laser Anti-missile Defence System (Question No. 1212) Mr Danby asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 10 December 2002: (1) Has his attention been drawn to recent reports of a new laser anti-missile defence system developed for commercial airliners. (2) Is he or his Department making any inquiries about Qantas and other Australian commercial airlines acquiring such a system; if not, why not. (3) Is the government considering purchasing this type of system; if not, why not. (4) Is the government considering requiring commercial airliners to purchase such a system; if not, why not. (1) Yes. (2) My Department liaises with specialists in the Department of Defence and with Qantas on such matters. (3) Yes. (4) The purchase of such equipment is a matter for the airlines whilst the Government’s aviation security regime does not mandate the deployment of such technology. The threat environment for Australian aviation is kept under constant review by the Government, in consultation with airlines and airports. Environment: Kyoto Protocol (Question No. 1222) Dr Emerson asked the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources, upon notice, on 11 December 2002: (1) Does it state in the Government’s action agenda for the renewable energy industry titled “New Era, New Energy” that another significant opportunity for the industry would be provided if the Kyoto Protocol is ratified and an emissions trading system implemented.",266,Acyte Biotech Pty Ltd 2001 02 Sydney Nsw Sydney Nsw
225,Mr Mcgauran,"The Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts",268,Acyte Biotech Pty Ltd 2001 02 Sydney Nsw Sydney Nsw
226,Mr Anderson,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(2) Is it the case that the Government’s refusal to ratify the Kyoto Protocol means that the Australian renewable energy industry cannot be part of such a trading system, denying it job-creating opportunities. (3) Is it also the case that Australian firms in the renewable energy and environment industries are looking to relocate offshore to other countries which have ratified the Kyoto Protocol, such as New Zealand, to be part of such an emissions trading system. Mr Ian Macfarlane-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (1) No, there is no such statement in the Renewable Energy Action Agenda “New Era, New Energy”. (2) Until the Kyoto Protocol comes into force, it would be premature to assess the impact of nonratification on the Australian renewable energy industry. The Government already provides significant assistance to the renewable energy industry via the Mandatory Renewable Energy Target, and through the funding of some $377 million for programs to support the commercialisation and deployment of renewable energy technologies and related industry development. These measures are driving the rapid growth of our renewable energy industry and creating many jobs in urban and regional Australia. The Mandatory Renewable Energy Target alone will stimulate a 60% increase in renewable electricity generation over a decade equivalent to two Snowy Mountain Schemes. The Target has already stimulated $200 million of investment in new renewable energy projects, as well as the upgrading of existing generators. An estimated $2-3 billion of additional investment in renewable energy will be stimulated over the life of the Target. (3) I am not aware of any Australian firms that have decided to relocate offshore because of the Government’s decision not to ratify the Kyoto Protocol yet. The Government’s Mandatory Renewable Energy Target is actually attracting foreign firms to establish operations in Australia, as demonstrated by the decisions of leading international wind turbine manufacturers such as Vestas and NEG-Micon to invest over $100 million to establish local manufacturing facilities in Tasmania and Victoria. Environment: Australian Greenhouse Office (Question No. 1230) Mr Kelvin Thomson asked the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, upon notice, on 11 December 2002: (1) Has his attention been drawn to comments by the former head of the Australian Greenhouse Office (AGO), Ms Gwen Andrews, that the Government’s own economic studies show that promising to meet the Kyoto target while not ratifying the Kyoto Protocol was not an optimal policy position because it shuts Australia out of the trading mechanism and opportunities which the Protocol establishes. (2) Will the Government accept the advice of the former head of the AGO. (1) and (2) It is wrong to infer that the economic studies released by the Government show that the Government’s position on the Kyoto Protocol is not an optimal policy decision. Those studies show that, while the overall economic costs to the Australian economy of ratifying the Kyoto Protocol and meeting the 108% target could be relatively small, the longer-term impacts beyond 2012 are important to the overall assessment of the Protocol. These have been particularly relevant to the Government’s decision not to ratify Kyoto at present. The Kyoto Protocol creates obligations for Australia that are not imposed on many of our competitors. If these arrangements continued over the longer term, industries could be driven overseas by competitive pressure. Since the industries concerned would be seeking to avoid the costs of the greenhouse constraints they would face in Australia, the global environment would be unlikely to benefit. The costs to the Australian economy and Australian jobs could be considerable. The real issue is how Australia is positioned over the next twenty to thirty years to respond to a carbon-constrained world. Through its forward strategy on climate change, the Government is mapping out the optimal transition path and in doing so providing longer-term certainty to indus-",268,Acyte Biotech Pty Ltd 2001 02 Sydney Nsw Sydney Nsw
227,Dr Kemp,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:try. This strategy will ensure that Australia maximises opportunities to build competitive advantages in emerging technologies, while minimising costs associated with stranding existing assets. The Government is also engaging in a dialogue with business to examine how we can secure convenient access for Australian business to carbon credit projects under the Protocol and promote Australia’s greenhouse technologies and expertise. Environment: Australian Greenhouse Office (Question No. 1231) Mr Kelvin Thomson asked the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, upon notice, on 11 December 2002: (1) Has his attention been drawn to comments by the former head of the Australian Greenhouse Office (AGO), Ms Gwen Andrews, that the most recent figures show greenhouse emissions are now projected to exceed 1990 levels by 14%, which is 6% more than the Kyoto target and double the blowout predicted in August. (2) Do these projections show the Government’s strategy to curb greenhouse gas emissions to be a failure. (3) Has Ms Andrews’ position as Chief Executive Officer been advertised since she left the AGO in May 2002. (4) When will the Government replace Ms Andrews. (1) The comments attributed to Ms Andrews are not correct. Greenhouse data released by the government in August 2002 projected Australia would increase emissions to around 111 per cent of 1990 levels by the end of the next decade. Without greenhouse actions being taken by the government emissions would grow to 122 per cent of 1990 levels, and even more without reductions in emissions from land use change. These emissions projections were based on analytical work conducted in 2001 and 2002. Emissions projections are being updated with the next edition planned for late 2003. Draft updated analyses for the stationary energy and fuel production sectors have been provided recently to stakeholders for comment. The aggregate picture for the next edition of greenhouse emissions projections can only be assembled once analysis have been completed for all relevant economic sectors. (2) No. The latest projections indicate that Australia remains on track to save 60 million tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions annually by the end of the decade. (3) and (4) No. Mr Howard Bamsey is serving as Chief Executive of the AGO Comcar: Employees (Question No. 1234) Mr Martin Ferguson asked the Minister representing the Special Minister of State, upon notice, on 11 December 2002: (1) Further to the answer to question No. 1116 (Hansard, 4 December 2002, page 9560), has Comcar undertaken any meetings in the NSW Southern Highlands in 2002; if so, (a) what was the purpose of the meeting, (b) when and where was it held, (c) who attended the meeting and (d) what was the total cost. (2) What security checks are made on individual drivers employed by companies providing contract driving services to Comcar. ourable member’s question: (1) Yes. (a) COMcAR undertook a planning, review and training workshop. (b) The workshop was held at Sutton Forest, NSW in July 2002. (c) Twenty-three Department of Finance and Administration staff attended the workshop including three drivers, three regional supervisors, three State support staff and 14 staff from the ACT. (d) $14,818.18 (or $644 per participant). (2) Standard industry practice is that Police checks are done on all hire car drivers prior to engagement.",269,Acyte Biotech Pty Ltd 2001 02 Sydney Nsw Sydney Nsw

229,Mr Abbott,"The Special Minister of State has provided the following answer to the honRoads: Calder Highway (Question No. 1242) Mr Gibbons asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 12 December 2002: (1) Further to the answer to question No. 967 (Hansard, 9 December 2002, page 9751), (a) what is the distance still to be covered in road work required for completion of the duplication of the Calder Highway after the present work being done on the Carlsruhe upgrade is finished. (2) What is the estimated total cost of the work still remaining to be done and what cost would be incurred by the Federal Government if it paid 50% of the cost. (3) Is the Federal Government committed to meeting 50% of the remaining cost of completing the Calder Highway duplication. (4) Is the Calder Highway the only Roads of National Importance project which the Federal Government maintains is a State arterial road and for which the Federal Government maintains the completion date is solely a responsibility of the State Government. (5) Given that in the answer to question No. 967 he specified the sums the Federal Government is committed to in regard to the Craigieburn Bypass, the Scoresby Freeway, the Geelong Road and the Murchison East Deviation, why has a similar sum not been specified as a Federal Government commitment to the continuation and completion of the Calder Highway duplication. (1) The planning estimate for the remaining duplication works, between Kyneton and Ravenswood, is a distance of approximately 43kms. (2) The Victorian Government’s estimate of the remaining total cost is $330 million. (3) The Victorian programme is fully committed at present and there is little scope to commit additional funding in the near future. Should additional funding become available in the 2003 Budget, funding for the Calder Highway will be considered in the context of the whole National Highway and Roads of National Importance programme. (4) The decision to complete the duplication of the Calder Highway from Melbourne to Bendigo by 2006 was a unilateral decision made by the Victorian Government. While the Federal Government will assist Victoria in meeting its funding strategy, through the Roads of National Importance programme, the Calder Highway nonetheless remains a State arterial road and, as such, the responsibility for meeting the duplication strategies rests solely with Victoria. (5) Victoria receives a favourable share of Federal road funds. Funding committed to Victoria by the Federal Government for 2002/03 was directed to those projects that were identified by the Victorian Government as those with the highest priority, taking into account current commitments, budget constraints and competing national demands on Federal road revenue. Aviation: Australian Airports (Question No. 1251) Mr Murphy asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 12 December 2002: (1) Further to the answer to question No. 671 (Hansard, 14 October 2002, page 7532), was the fact that Australian national airports are strategic assets considered as a factor prior to the direction for the scoping studies for the sale of those airports. (2) If so, what was the briefing given by the Commonwealth Government to those persons responsible for the scoping study and ultimate sale of Sydney Airport and other airports with respect to security impacts, including risk to management exposure in the management of counter-terrorist measures. (3) What will be the impacts on the operation of Australian national airports with respect to the administration and implementation of counter-terrorist measures within those airports. (4) Were the partial sales of Telstra to Singapore Telecom and Qantas to Singapore Airlines equally prevented due to perceived security risks.",270,Acyte Biotech Pty Ltd 2001 02 Sydney Nsw Sydney Nsw

231,Mr Anderson,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(1) Yes. The decision to privatise Australia’s Commonwealth-owned airports was taken by Cabinet, and a broad spectrum of stakeholder issues were considered in that process. All Commonwealth Departments, including the Department of Defence, contributed to the decision making process. (2) & (3) Australia’s privatised airports remain strategic assets. The Commonwealth retains ownership of them, with the sale being over their operating lease only. The obligations of airport owners and operators, including aviation security and counter-terrorism measures, are imposed by the Airports Act, Air Navigation Act, and subordinate Regulations and apply regardless of ownership. The Commonwealth Government has established a legislative package providing for a series of minimum standards for the security of civil aviation from, to and within Australia. The Commonwealth’s role derives from its ratification of an international treaty, the “Chicago Convention”, concluded on 7 December 1944. (4) Questions relating to the sale arrangements and processes that applied in the privatisation of Telstra and QANTAS should be directed to the Minister for Finance and Administration. Immigration: Pre-Qualified Institution Program (Question No. 1257) Mr Martin Ferguson asked the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, upon notice, on 12 December 2002: (1) Which education providers have participated in the Pre-Qualified Institution (PQI) program each year. (2) How many places were allocated to each education provider for each participating country each year. (3) How many PQI visas were issued for each education provider for each participating country each year. (4) How many overseas students from the participating countries who are not sponsored under the PQI program were enrolled at each of the participating education providers each year. (5) How many student visa applications that were given PQI status for each participating education provider were rejected each year. (6) Were any sanctions sought from an education provider where the provider did not meet the agreed performance standards contained in the Memorandum of Understanding; if so, what sanctions were sought and from which education providers. (1) A list of education providers who participated in the PQI Program from its inception as a pilot program in 1999 until the expiry of the 2002 MoUs on 30 November 2002 is provided at Attachment A. (2) The number of places allocated to each education provider for each participating country for each year of the PQI program is provided at Attachment A. Allocations are provided by country and by education sector. Some education providers are eligible for PQI in more than one country and education sector. (3) The number of visas issued for each education provider by sector and by country in 2001 2002 is provided at Attachment A. The number of visas issued for each provider is not readily available for 1999-2000. However, as an indication, the number of applications lodged by each provider for each participating country for 1999 and 2000 is provided at Attachment A. (4) The number of overseas students from the PRC, India, Pakistan and Vietnam who were enrolled at PQI-eligible education providers, but who did not enter under the PQI program, is not readily available from departmental systems. (5) The number of PQI student visa applications that were refused during the 2002 and 2001 PQI program years is provided at Attachment A. Refusal data for the 1999 and 2000 PQI program years by provider is not readily available. (6) During the 1999 Pilot of the PQI Program, training and assistance was given to education providers and no sanctions were issued. The MOU was amended in 2000 to allow for a PQI provider who breaches the conditions of their MOU to either have their PQI status suspended or cancelled.",271,Acyte Biotech Pty Ltd 2001 02 Sydney Nsw Sydney Nsw
232,Mr Ruddock,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:Clause8 sets out behaviour, which may lead to the suspension of PQI status: incomplete PQI applications exceed 2 in number, or 5 per cent of the allocated quota; or more than one PQI application is lodged containing fraudulent or misleading documentation; or the number of refusals for PQI applications exceed 10% of the quota allocation; or the on-shore student visa cancellation rate is equal to, or more than, half the average for all providers; or the non-compliance notices issued rate is equal to, or more than, half the average for all providers; or a student is cancelled for breach of a student visa condition relating to attendance or academic performance, where a non-compliance notice for that student was not previously issued by the provider; or the provider exceeds more than once, the number of sponsored applications they are permitted to lodge in accordance with their allocated quota. Under clause 9 of the MoU, a PQI provider may have its PQI status cancelled if: a second breach under clause 8 of the MoU occurs; or a provider, or its nominated agent, has, in Australia or any other country, advertised or marketed itself, or suggested or implied that it had the formal approval of DIMIA or the Minister or that it has special government or Commonwealth approval of any kind or in any other way suggested that it is an organisation that has formal ties with the Government of the Commonwealth of Australia; or its CRICOS registration is lost or suspended; or it has provided false or misleading information with regard to its application for PQI status. 2000 PQI Pilot The following education providers failed to achieve the benchmark 90 per cent of sponsored applicants being assessed as bona fide and had their PQI status withdrawn from the 2000 PQI pilot. Six providers were in the Secondary Schools sector, two in the ELICOS sector and two in the VET sector: ACT Department of Education and Training; Australian School of Tourism and Hotel Management; Griffith University English Language Institute; Ivanhoe Grammar School; John Paul College; Kingswood College; Martin College; NSW Department of Education and Training; St Joseph’s Nudgee International College; and the Sydney English Language Centre. 2001 PQI Program In the 2001 PQI program, two ELICOS providers had their PQI status suspended for lodging more than one application that contained fraudulent documentation and one provider had its PQI status cancelled as a result of advertising the PQI program. The providers were: Melbourne Language Centre status in the PRC was suspended (reinstated on 27 September 2001); Billy Blue Schools status in the PRC was suspended (reinstated in April 2002); The University of Newcastle had its PQI status for PRC cancelled in December 2001. Agents with a connection to the provider had advertised the provider’s PQI status. 2002 PQI Program During the 2002 PQI program, Alexander Language School had its PQI status suspended for 6 months, commencing in April 2002. The provider had lodged more than 1 application that was refused on the basis of fraudulent documents. The provider was invited to re-join the program in October 2002. In 2002, the Kooralbyn International School had its PQI status cancelled as a result of its closure. During 2002, 11 providers were under investigation for lodging more than one application containing fraudulent or misleading information. However, suspension proceedings ceased with the expiration of the 2002 MoUs. Attachment A PRE-QUALIFIED INSTITUTION – LIST OF PROVIDERS This is a list of all providers who were granted PQI status at the beginning of each PQI program year, their PQI allocation and the number of applications lodged. Some providers may have subsequently withdrawn or been suspended or cancelled. Please note: that the lists are broken down by country by education sector, as some education providers are eligible for PQI in more than one country and education sector; the statistics for 1999-2000 have been manually compiled from returns from overseas posts and there may be slight discrepancies with other published figures; and the PQI program year generally runs from November to the following November when MOUs with providers are reviewed and renegotiated. 1999-2000 PQI ALLOCATIONS BY COUNTRY AND PROVIDER People’s Republic of China Applications Applications lodged Sector Provider PQI

the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, upon notice, on 12 December 2002: (1) Further to the answer to part (3) of question No. 984 (Hansard, 14 November, 2002, page 9042), could he provide figures as requested for a range of engines that would be typical for the Australian fleet. (2) Further to the answer to part (6) of question No. 984, what average fuel consumption for Australian vehicles does the Government regard as achievable in (a) 5 years, (b) 10 years and (c) 20 years. (3) What measures will the Government adopt to achieve these targets. (1) As I advised in my original responses, carbon dioxide emissions in vehicles are a product of the efficiency of the engine and the greenhouse intensity of the fuel. This is regardless of the specific engine technology used. The 2001, CSIRO/RMIT report ‘Comparison of Transport Fuels’, available on the Australian Greenhouse Office website, provides a discussion on this issue. (2) Targets for national average fuel consumption for passenger vehicles are currently under negotiation with industry. (3) Government has a range of initiatives underway to reduce national average fuel consumption. These include: voluntary fuel consumption targets with motor vehicles producers, fuel consumption labelling on new vehicles, and annual publication of a fuel consumption guide. In addition, the post-2005 automotive assistance package announced on 13 December 2002 includes a $150 million R&D fund specifically for vehicle manufacturers investing in new and innovative technologies. Education: Scholarships (Question No. 1270) Mr Andren asked the Minister for Education, Science and Training, upon notice, on 12 December 2002: How many tertiary students received scholarships, including Commonwealth scholarships, in Australia for the 2002 academic year and what is the breakdown of this number according to the per annum amount of scholarship received. My Department does not collect data on institutional and other scholarships for tertiary study. DEST only collects data on Commonwealth-funded scholarships. Final data for 2002 as reported by the universities through the Higher Education Student Statistics Collection administered by my Department is not yet available.

234,Dr Nelson,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:Australian Postgraduate Awards (APA) – 5,425 students in 2001. Full-time APA students received a stipend of $17,609 in 2001 and are eligible for other allowances. An APA scholarship can be held for a maximum of three and a half years. International Postgraduate Research Scholarships (IPRS) – 1,200 students in 2001. IPRS students receive a tuition-fee waiver scholarship to cover the cost of their annual course tuition fee for a maximum of four years, with tuition fee levels varying by academic discipline. Merit-Based Equity Scholarships – 1,640 students in 2001. These scholarships provide recipients with a HECS exemption for an undergraduate course to the maximum duration of that course. Immigration: Managing Migration Kit (Question No. 1272) Ms Gillard asked the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, upon notice, on 12 December 2002: (1) Why was a decision taken to produce the “Managing Migration” kit recently launched at Parliament House. (2) Who made the decision. (3) What were the costs of production and distribution of all the materials in the kit. (4) To whom will the kit will be distributed. (5) What were the costs of staging the launch itself, including refreshments. (1) My Department suggested to me that there would be benefit in preparing an information kit about managing migration and border control issues which could be used by Federal Parliamentarians in their electorate and Parliament House offices when responding to inquiries from their constituents. It would also be useful information for foreign diplomats in Australia when briefing their home governments. (2) I approved its production. One thousand copies were produced and I am pleased to inform the House that the kit has been very well received as an exceptionally useful information resource. (3) The kit was written and produced by my Department. The cost of production was $39,508.70. Distribution was handled in-house by my Department. Those kits sent to my Parliamentary colleagues were hand delivered to Parliament House, and incurred only the cost of $68 for a courier between Belconnen and Parliament House. Distribution to other addresses cost $572. The contents of the kit were translated into Spanish, French and German, incurring a cost of $47, 460.60 for translations. (4) The kit has been distributed to all Commonwealth Members and Senators and all Ambassadors of foreign missions based in Canberra, the Premiers and Chief Ministers of all States and Territories, members of the Ministerial Council on Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, other committees and Tribunals associated with my portfolio. In addition, a number of refugee advocacy and lobby organisations received copies, ensuring that they had accurate and timely information to hand. Copies of the kit have also been sent to offices of my Department in Australia and overseas through normal government channels. (5) I was pleased to launch the kit on 12 November here at Parliament House. The total cost of staging the launch was $5042.75, comprising $3835.50 for catering for 150 people and room hire, and $1207.05 for the technical support. International Organisation for Migration (Question No. 1275) Ms Gillard asked the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, upon notice, on 12 December 2002:",278,Total 85 5 1 Total All Sectors
235,Mr Ruddock,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(1) Has the Government allocated $75.4m to support international organisations, such as the UNHCR and the International Organisation for Migration (IOM), for the detention, processing and subsequent removal of people in transit countries. (2) It is reported in The Advertiser on 2 October 2001 that an IOM spokesman confirmed that IOM never used force to effect removals; if so, what does “subsequent removal” mean. (3) What is the purpose of these funds. (4) What is the nature of the arrangements that have been made with the IOM. (1) In the 2002-03 Budget, the Government committed $75.4m over four years to combating illegal migration and people smuggling through the interception of illegal movements in transit countries. This measure is aimed at: increasing the capacity of authorities and international organisations in transit countries to detect and intercept illegal people movement ($16.2 million); and providing support to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) for accommodation and processing of people who have been intercepted en route to Australia ($59.2 million). (2) In accordance with its Charter, the IOM facilitates removals only if they are voluntary. The reference to “subsequent removal” is that voluntary removal by IOM occurs only after any matters that arise related to refugee protection have been dealt with by UNHCR. Under the informal regional cooperative arrangements in place with several countries in the region, the IOM assists those who volunteer to return to their country of origin or country of prior residence. Australia funds IOM for the cost of their voluntary return. (3) As stated in my response to question (1), the purpose of the funds is to: provide assistance to increase the capacity of authorities and international organisations in transit countries to detect and intercept illegal people movement; and provide support for IOM and UNHCR for accommodation and processing of people who have been intercepted en route to Australia. (4) The arrangements in place between Australia and the IOM for dealing with those intercepted in transit countries are: the IOM takes responsibility for the movement (where required) of detainees, their accommodation and sustenance and their health and welfare needs. Australia funds the IOM for these activities; where a detainee raises protection concerns, the IOM refers the case to the UNHCR for assessment; the UNHCR assesses any such claims and if the UNHCR finds the person not to be a refugee, or if no protection claims are raised, the IOM assists those who volunteer to return to their country of origin or country of prior residence. Australia funds IOM for the cost of voluntary return. Immigration: Overseas Posts (Question No. 1278) Ms Gillard asked the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, upon notice, on 12 December 2002: (1) Is his Department examining ways to cut costs at Australia’s overseas posts; if so, which posts and programs are being examined for reductions. (1) In recent years a number of electronic and business redesign initiatives across a range of visa programs have been introduced to improve client service outcomes and the cost effectiveness of my Department’s overseas operations. This includes processing of Skilled, Business Skills, and Parent migration applications in Adelaide and Perth. New technology and service delivery arrangements have significantly reduced the need for clients to attend Australian visa offices in many countries and have all but eliminated the need to continue with over-the-counter services at some Australian missions. In addition, some resources have been redirected to high risk environments to enhance integrity of entry programs. The Department has progressively been reviewing its overseas operations. This review is examining current and future resourcing requirements to best deal with the impacts of the above service",279,Total 85 5 1 Total All Sectors

237,Mr Ruddock,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:delivery initiatives. In August 2002, visa operations ceased in Stockholm and in October 2002, in Dublin. I have recently decided to move resources from Los Angeles, close the DIMIA office, and consolidate visa operations in Washington, which will occur over the next six months. New Australia-based positions have been established in Dhaka and Dubai. Reviewing overseas operations is an ongoing process and I will be looking at the case for resource changes at other overseas posts as business methods change and work pressures and priorities shift.",280,Total 85 5 1 Total All Sectors
