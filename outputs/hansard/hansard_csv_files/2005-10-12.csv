A cynical outsider needed and identified by the experts out and might suggest that this is actually a political accessible to the community.

Until recently it was believed that the F3 link to Branxton would cost about $320 million to construct. Alas, when you keep putting off a project because of funding cuts, the project gets more expensive. I have been warning for a while that the project costs were blowing out, and it has now been confirmed that the cost of the project has blown out to some $750 million. The Commonwealth government say: ‘We are committed to this road project. Some $253 million has been earmarked within AusLink. Therefore, our slate is clean.

309,Network. This Is Not A Net Benefit To The New The Speaker,"Order! It being 8 pm,Wednesday, 12 October 2005 ----Mental Health Week and to touch on a few issues related to that. It is important to reflect on the overall costs of mental health to the community. We know from an Australian National Survey of Mental Health and Wellbeing that 20 per cent of adult Australians experience a mental health problem, 14 per cent of children and adolescents experience mental illness and three per cent of adults have a serious mental illness. If you look at mental illness in terms of the total disease burden in this country, you will see that it is roughly 13 per cent. It represents roughly 30 per cent of the non-fatal disease burden. Clearly, it is a very significant problem. If you look at the suicide rate for last year, you will see that it was 2,454 people. A significant majority of those people committed suicide as a consequence of their mental illness. One would think, given the scope of this particular problem in the community, that governments of all persuasions would be putting bucket loads of funding into solving this issue. Unfortunately, as I continue to report to this House, funding across all levels of government for mental health is about seven per cent of the total health budget. We have a massive problem: some 2,454 Australians committing suicide per year, mostly as a consequence of this particular problem, yet seven per cent of the total government health budget across this country is spent on mental health. I think that is a disgrace, particularly when you look at countries like New Zealand that spend roughly 14 per cent of their health budget on mental health. I would like to think that we would lead New Zealand in a whole range of areas-we trumpet that. So we are behind other First World countries. Many other First World countries spend between 10 and 14 per cent of their total health budget on mental health. The fact is that 62 per cent of Australians who have a mental health problem cannot access mental health services. Of the 38 per cent who do, most will see a GP. They are the gatekeepers for our mental health system. Unfortunately I report to this House today that, if you look at the Better Outcomes in Mental Health program that helps doctors treat people with mental illness, you will see that it had an underspend of $63 million. This was a $121 million program over four years to help GPs provide better mental health outcomes to patients-the some 38 per cent of people who access those services. The fact is that, in commemorating Mental Health Week and looking at the mental health of Australians, when we look at government inaction and underspending on this issue, for the least advantaged in our community, it is a national disgrace. We have to do something about it or more Australians will die. (Time expired) Lucas Heights Reactor visit ANSTO’s Lucas Heights research station and be given a tour of that facility.

The current reactor generates many of the treatments for cancer patients in Australia at a lower cost than if we were to import products from overseas. After my visit, I am more than ever convinced that the new Lucas Heights reactor plays a critical role in the treatment of many of the health problems of Australians and is critical in solving future health problems. In order for the new reactor to be licensed, the government faces a fairly serious time line to find a possible site for a nuclear waste repository. The government needs to act to ensure that Australians in need of pharmaceuticals do not lose that access. A critical part of the licensing condition for the new OPAL reactor-the open pool Australian light water medical and research reactor-at Lucas Heights is that Australia must have in place a store for our own reprocessed fuel due to the mandatory return of waste from Scotland and France. If a decision on a site for waste management cannot be made within a matter of months, Australia will no longer be allowed to produce radioactive isotopes that are used in hospitals in every state and territory of Australia. For that reason I am very keen to see a decision made very quickly on the location of a suitable repository. My visit to ANSTO was extraordinarily interesting and extraordinarily well conducted. I would particularly like to thank the director of ANSTO, Dr Ian Smith, and all his staff for the wonderful efforts they made to show me around the place. (Time expired) Iraq number of people concerned about the prospects for any kind of peaceful future for Iraq in the near term and to repeat a number of questions that have been put to the government in relation to this issue both by the opposition here in the parliament and by the public and my constituents. It is critical that we not be distracted by cheap politicking from the essential features of the Iraq engagement nor from the fact that this war, which the Howard government took us into, was against the wishes of a majority of Australians. That this military engagement was based on a lie remains a great shame; that it breached the norms and accepted principles of international law is to our discredit. The decision of the Howard government to participate in that most serious of national undertakings without thinking through the consequences that flow from committing troops to the far side of the world without a strategy for engagement or exit is increasingly exposed as short-termism of the worse kind. It is to the great credit of Australia’s service men and women that the engagement has been conducted with great courage and skill, but it is a matter of phenomenal luck that, throughout the war in Iraq, our personnel have been relatively unscathed-and we must fervently hope this remains the case. Tragically, it has not been so in relation to US personnel nor the region generally. These men and women are poorly served by the downpour of cliches that pass for debate from government members on this issue. It seems that members opposite are completely unaware of the international dynamic that led to the war and the increasingly intractable problems that the war has spawned. Central to the Iraq question-especially in light of the growing need for additional resources to be applied to antiterrorism measures and the predicted shortfall of $1 billion per year in the defence budget identified this week by the Kokoda Foundation-is the question of why the government does not simply throw away the neocon MAIN COMMITTEE",156,Statements By Members
313,Mr Garrett (Kingsford Smith) (10.16 Am),"I rise to add my voice to the growingphrasebook and square up to explaining what is happening now in relation to Australia’s ongoing involvement in Iraq. The British Joint Intelligence Committee made it plain in its assessment of February 2003 that the threat from al-Qaeda and associated groups would be heightened by military action against Iraq. This was confirmed by AFP Commissioner Mick Keelty before the government pulled him into line. The French Ambassador remarked only this morning that France’s stance on the war was right and Australia’s wrong. Notwithstanding the upcoming referendum on an Iraq constitution, it is difficult to conceive of anything other than increasing instability, terrorism and violence in Iraq. That is to be hugely regretted. So it is time for the government to explain clearly what it now means by ‘getting the job done’. Are there conditions and a timetable for troop withdrawal? What will our response be if civil war breaks out across Iraq? What in the interim will be done in relation to the pressing, serious shortfalls in security capacity in our region? Those are the questions for the Prime Minister and the foreign minister, and we demand an answer. (Time expired) St Vincent de Paul Society equipment grants through which the residents of La Trobe were able to secure $25,000 in funding. One of the recipients was the St Vincent de Paul Society in Upper Ferntree Gully, which received over $2,000 through the round of volunteer small equipment grants. St Vincent de Paul received the grant for an electric heater and 400 reusable food parcel carry bags. It is important to note that any funding these organisations receive must go back to the people they are there to help. Therefore they cannot purchase products like this for their own organisation. I am very glad to say that the Howard government was able to assist them with their needs. I met with Gordon Veerasawmy, Judy Atu, Allan Bailey, Dennis Buckley, Bev McNamara, Connie Bala, Elsie Johnson, Wally Johnson, Brother Michael, Peter Springfellow, Vivian Springfellow and Adele Paterson on 27 August this year to discuss local issues and congratulate them on the valuable contribution they make to the local community. The society exists primarily to provide home assistance to the poor. It understands their personal need for as much assistance as its resources will allow. I am thrilled that the society was successful in its application under this grants scheme as it acknowledges the hard work and dedication of these local volunteers. Each of the society’s members works tirelessly on a voluntary basis, providing one-on-one assistance for the people of our local community who need the most help. Each month they assist approximately 30 people through their efforts. The provision of an electric heater and reusable food parcels carry bags will make a significant difference to the services they provide to the local community. This organisation may not have been otherwise able to afford these items. On a final note, I would like to make special mention of Gordon Veerasawmy, who went above and beyond the group’s responsibilities recently after I received a call for help from Merv and Elaine Vincent, who had an old stove they needed removed but were unable to do it themselves. My office contacted Gordon to see if there was anything the society could do. Gordon, with the assistance of Dennis, quickly went to the house, removed the heater and took it to the tip.

314,Mr Wood (La Trobe) (10.19 Am),"I rise to tell the House about the great volunteer smallgroup. Again, I wish to strongly thank this organisation for the fantastic work they do in the local community. Telecommunications Ms KATE ELLIS (Adelaide) (10.22 am)-There is significant concern within our community about the installation of mobile phone towers in heavily populated areas. This concern is especially serious when towers are installed near sensitive areas such as schools, kindergartens and hospitals. TodayI rise to reaffirm Labor’s commitment to strengthening the regulatory policies governing mobile phone towers and highlight the shambles created by a government unable to show leadership over a dispute between local councils, communities and the growing telecommunications industry. Battlelines have been drawn in the Australian suburbs, with communities fearing the effects of mobile communication towers on their health and councils and telecommunications at each other in the courts seeking clarification over legislation. This crisis was highlighted again to me the other day when I met with some residents of Goodwood who were concerned over potential health risks associated with a mobile phone tower that has been built, without community input, on a building next to a local primary school. Although it had been modified after pressure from the community and local councils, people were still concerned about health risks and the inability of local councils to significantly alter the construction of these towers. Unley City Council Mayor, Mr Michael Keenan-a very good and hard working mayor, I might add-is so concerned about telecommunications companies simply bypassing council planning regulations that he tabled a report at the Unley City Council meeting that led to a motion financially supporting a legal battle that has now reached the High Court. He believes the council has no option but to add their support, for, if successful, telecommunications companies will have a legal precedent to bypass local council processes in the future. Telecommunications companies are arguing in the courts that they are exempt from council planning processes due to the Telecommunications Act. Local councils consider the towers constitute a development issue and are therefore under their jurisdiction. In the latest round, the Supreme Court ruled in favour of the councils, though granted leave for the telecommunications company to appeal the decision in the High Court. This is a problem that could have been easily solved by simple legislation and some government leadership, instead of lengthy court battles. Labor released a policy at the last election that would have directly confronted this issue, promising to introduce stricter guidelines, give support for local council procedures and continue to listen to and act on the concerns of local communities. I want to reaffirm this commitment and call on the government to implement Labor’s initiative and provide some leadership on the issue. I pledge to my constituents in Goodwood-and, indeed, to all of the constituents in Adelaide-that I shall continue to fight for the rights of local communities when it comes to the placement of mobile phone towers in our neighbourhoods. I would also like to pledge my support to Mayor Michael Keenan and the Unley council for the action that they are taking to stick up for the residents of Adelaide. Kingston Electorate: Gambling Facilities sue which is facing my electorate: the location of a new gaming facility with up to 40 new MAIN COMMITTEE",158,Statements By Members
315,Mr Richardson (Kingston) (10.25 Am),"I rise today to talk about a very important ispoker machines in the suburb of Morphett Vale. This is a suburb which is already highly saturated with clubs and pubs. Straight opposite the proposed site is an RSL eternal flame site along with the Morphett Vale Memorial Bowling Club and the Morphett Vale Football Club. According to local welfare groups which are dealing with the issue of problem gambling at a grassroots level, this particular suburb already has a higher than average rate of gambling addiction, associated social problems and family breakdown. This is an area which has been targeted by Club One. The proprietors have lodged the development application with the City of Onkaparinga because its high level of problem gamblers will ensure higher profits. These unscrupulous operators are targeting the area with no thought for the social consequences and without concern for the lives, families and communities they will destroy. There are houses within 80 metres of this proposed pokie parlour whose occupants enjoy a pleasant and peaceful lifestyle. If this new gaming facility is to be approved, their lives and the value of their homes are about to deteriorate. The late-night trading hours applied for-up to midnight during the week, 2 am on Saturdays and midnight on Sunday nights-are absolutely disgraceful. There is limited parking available on this site already, and with the additional customers to the site people will be parking in the side streets and in front of these homes. The extra noise and vehicles at midnight or at 2 am are certainly not what the residents in that area are looking forward to. I initially doorknocked and within two hours I had obtained 500 signatures to a petition which has now been lodged with the City of Onkaparinga council. Since then I have collected a further 2,000 signatures to the petition to ensure that this proposed pokie facility does not go ahead. I would like to thank the residents and concerned citizens of the southern suburbs for their commitment to saying enough is enough. As a former police officer within the southern suburbs, I have seen first-hand the problem effects of gambling and what it does to a poor socioeconomic area such as the southern suburbs. We are fighting for this one to ensure that it does not go ahead for the people of the southern suburbs and for the people of Adelaide. Nuclear Waste Storage to the last federal election and prior to the last Northern Territory election, Brendan Nelson, the Minister for Education, Science and Training, announced three possible sites for nuclear waste repositories in the Northern Territory. As I said earlier, this was despite undertakings given and promises made prior to the last federal election. Since the announcement in July, Territorians of all political flavours have rallied in their opposition to the proposal. They have rallied in seeking information and clarification from the Commonwealth about what is proposed. They want answers to fundamental questions such as: is the Territory the safest place to store nuclear waste and is it scientifically demonstrated to be the best option? What they learnt subsequently is that it is not. The most preferred sites are in New South Wales, in National Party and Liberal Party seats. Has the decision to place nuclear waste in the Territory been a political convenience? Of course it has, as evidenced by the fact that the most preferred sites are in fact in New South Wales. They want answers to these questions and to the observation made by Brendan Nelson: … why on earth can’t people in the middle of nowhere have low level and intermediate level waste? You can imagine the anger of the people of the Northern Territory when they heard that, particularly the traditional owners of the country which has been identified as a possible site. MAIN COMMITTEE",159,Statements By Members
316,Mr Snowdon (Lingiari) (10.28 Am),"On 15 July this year, despite promises made priorThere are three sites: one to the north-west of Alice Springs, one to the north-east of Alice Springs and one to the south-west of Katherine. People are angry at the failure of the government to take them into its confidence, consult with them and talk to them about what it was proposing. The Central Australia Community Alliance has been formed to oppose a proposal for nuclear waste facilities. This alliance is made up of members of political parties, environment groups, Indigenous organisations and traditional owners, as well as local government. One of its first actions was to organise a public meeting to hear the views of the community before a panel of representatives of local government, Territory government and environment groups. I was also on the panel as the federal member. The meeting prepared a list of questions which was forwarded to Brendan Nelson. Of course, we have had no response. Three hundred people attended this meeting. I am pleased to say that, since this initial public meeting, the community has conducted a very successful Hiroshima Day rally, based on their opposition to the expansion of the nuclear industry but most particularly the proposition of nuclear waste dumps in the Northern Territory. Finally, last week Lhere Artepe, the Aboriginal corporation representing traditional owners, held a march and meeting in Alice Springs. This rally was supported by the Arid Land Environmental Centre, the Australian Conservation FoundationA division having been called in the House of RepresentativesSitting suspended from 10.31 am to 10.35 am statements, I want to apologise to the member for Lingiari. IfI had been more on guard, I would have let him finish the 17 seconds remaining for his statement. Council and the Alice Springs Town Council gave the Indigenous perspective on the opposition to the dump. The campaign continues and Territorians are united in their resolve to prevent the government imposing nuclear waste facilities on the Northern Territory without the agreement of the Northern Territory government or the community. Cowper Electorate: Telecommunications this House is an important milestone for telecommunications in this country. The $3.1 billion Connecting Australia program-providing $1.1 billion for mobile phone and broadband and $2 billion for the Future Fund to ensure that regional Australia gets excellent telecommunications services not only now but into the future-is vital to the future of this nation. The government realises that, if we are to have competitive small businesses, quality educational services, good health services and economic development in regional and rural areas, we need to have telecommunications infrastructure that is going to support that. Telecommunications is playing very much the role that the railways did in the 19th century in providing opportunities for business in more isolated areas. I would like to comment on some new facilities that have been installed in my electorate. The mobile phone tower near the small town of Bowraville in the Nambucca Valley will mean not only improved telecommunications services for the locals but also greater convenience and safety for people who are perhaps working out on farms by themselves, and tourists will be able to travel throughout the Nambucca Valley and still be in contact with their offices.

Another tower has been installed in the town of Maclean. When it is fully commissioned, it will provide improved CDMA and GSM services for the town of Maclean, the area of the Pacific Highway near the town and areas in the west of Yamba which have suffered from poorer mobile phone services than would be ideal. SoI am delighted to see these two towers, in particular, being installed in my electorate in response to the telecommunications needs of the people in the electorate of Cowper. A tower was also recently installed in upper Macleay, near the town of Bellbrook. Despite there being a relatively low population density in that area, this tower is providing much needed mobile phone communications in a sparsely populated area. This was supported by the government. This tower would not have been there except for the telecommunications policies of this government to ensure that people in regional and rural areas have equity of access to telecommunications services. These services are vital if we are going to expand our business opportunities in those areas. They are vital to the safety of the people of the upper Macleay Valley and are vital in providing equity of opportunity for people who want to live right around this country. The government recognises the fact that there is a role for government in providing services which would not be provided on a commercial basis. The government believes that it should be spending taxpayers’ money not on subsidising phone companies but on providing telecommunications services which would not be viable on a commercial basis. in 60 seconds, but I propose to allow the member for Port Adelaide to have the whole three minutes-and I thank the member for Gellibrand for reducing her speech to accommodate that. Public Transport for Gellibrand as well. On 21 September I was asked by the business groups of the western suburbs of Adelaide to give an address to their meeting-a non-political speech on humour, public transport and the history of transport in Port Adelaide and the western suburbs. It was a fascinating exercise to delve into the history of public transport in South Australia and make some comparisons in the modern context with what goes on today. It was interesting to find out that South Australia built the first railway from Adelaide to Port Adelaide but the railway sleepers were set longitudinally, not at right angles. Of course, on the first trip with all the dignitaries on board, the obvious thing happened. The rail also had no ballast and so the locomotive ploughed a 30-metre furrow through the ground. It was a very embarrassing start. It is interesting also to note that in 1860 the frequency of the services from Port Adelaide to Adelaide was 20 minutes. That is better than it is today. In the 1950s the transport system from Port Adelaide to Adelaide ran every two minutes in peak period. That is far better than it is today. There are some principles about public transport in Australia that only one city, today, has ever followed. I will come to that in a moment. Trains are most useful for long distances, speed, and they need to run at a frequency of at least 15 minutes. Trams are most useful and MAIN COMMITTEE",161,Statements By Members

It is interesting in a modern context that only one city in this country fulfils the trifecta of good public transport principles and that is Melbourne. Perth and Brisbane have excellent modern electric rail systems but little else. They have one-way streets and an overreliance on buses and a very poor public transport system. Adelaide is showing some signs of moving in the right direction by extending its only light rail system and hopefully joining it in-as the people in Melbourne did with Port Melbourne and St Kilda-to the rail network. It is interesting that the biggest and the smallest cities in Australia, Sydney and Hobart, have absolutely the worse public transport. They do not follow any principles whatsoever. In Sydney, their rail system is in trouble. They have no tram system to speak of, there is an overreliance on buses and they rely on one-way streets. Hobart, the smallest city in Australia, does exactly the same. Why, God only knows. It is hard to admit sometimes as a South Australian that the Victorians have actually got it right in public transport. Whenever you hear criticism of Victorian public transport I hope that it is made in the context that they are correct. agreed to in the House earlier, the time for members’ statements has concluded. Second Reading Debate resumed from 14 September, on motion by Mr Ruddock: That this bill be now read a second time. Ms ROXON (Gellibrand) (10.42 am)-The Telecommunications (Interception) Amendment (Stored Communications and Other Measures) Bill 2005 does have a long history, which I will take some time later in my speech to go through. The bill before the House now introduces a number of amendments which will tidy up the act, extend provisions for the use of intercepted material and provide that certain agencies are now eligible to access the powers granted under the act. The bill adds an additional paragraph into the act allowing that the prohibition against interception would not apply in relation to the interception of a stored communication. I will go into the definition of ‘stored communication’ in some detail. Essentially, the bill before us today seeks to implement five measures. Firstly, it will extend the use of intercepted material for the following currently eligible authorities: the New South Wales Independent Commission Against Corruption; the New South Wales Inspector of the Police Integrity Commission; and the Queensland Crime and Misconduct Commission. The bill will correct anomalies concerning these bodies which will enable them to have effective use of intercepted material. This will allow those bodies to use lawfully obtained intercepted material to the full extent envisaged by the Telecommunications (Interception) Act. Additionally, it will allow the Inspector of ICAC, the Inspector of the Police Integrity Commission and the Crime and Misconduct Commission to similarly receive and use lawfully obtained intercepted material to the extent that other eligible authorities are permitted to under the interception act. Secondly, it will expand the list of eligible state authorities by two, adding the Victorian Office of Police Integrity and the New South Wales Inspector of the Independent Commission Against Corruption to the list. Under the amendments, these state authorities will now be able MAIN COMMITTEE",162,Statements By Members
322,The Deputy Speaker ( Mr Lindsay),"Order! In accordance with the resolutionto access the act’s powers, allowing them to receive and use lawfully obtained intercepted material for the purpose of the investigation of police corruption and misconduct. This is partially the outcome of a settlement between the Commonwealth and Victoria and it is contingent on the enactment of certain legislation by Victoria, which I will discuss later. The legislation will not operate if suitable arrangements and legislation are not in place in Victoria within the relevant time frame. Thirdly, this bill will extend provisions allowing access to stored communications without a warrant for an additional six months. Essentially, this will allow the status quo to continue for the following six months. A ‘stored communication’ is defined in the bill as a communication that is stored on equipment or any other thing, but does not include communication stored on a highly transitory basis such as voice over IP or any other communication where the storage is merely transitory as an integral part of the technology used in its transmission. This exception will have effect for 18 months. There was an original 12 months proposed in an earlier bill and an additional six months extension to the sunset clause. Within this time a review of the act is to be undertaken. The time frame of 18 months for the review is appropriate given the far-reaching recommendations of the Blunn review, the complex nature of the Telecommunications (Interception) Act and the even more complex nature of modern telecommunications technology. There are a number of recommendations made by the review of access to stored communications. The government has requested an additional six months to consider changes to the interception act and we believe that this is appropriate given the complexity of the issues at hand. We accept that the extension of the sunset clause is necessary to allow the government additional time within which to properly assess and respond to the substantive findings and recommendations of the Blunn review. This review was constituted in March this year and completed in August. Fourthly, the bill will clarify the expression ‘officer of state’ to include all members of police services of that state. Under the previous legislation there was uncertainty as to whether police officers were covered. The amendments clarify this and it now means that it will be a permitted purpose under the act for the state police to pass lawfully intercepted material to a body established to investigate alleged misbehaviour of a member of the police force. Finally, this bill will remove references to the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 consequential to the enactment of the Legislative Instruments Act 2003. The amendment in this section will clarify that, when the minister makes a declaration under section 34 of the interception act, the minister is creating a legislative instrument. The effect of this will be that such declarations will fall under the definition of a legislative instrument that is present in the Acts Interpretation Act 1901. As I mentioned earlier, the bill will add the Victorian Office of Police Integrity to the list of organisations with access to the powers under the act. The Victorian Office of Police Integrity, upon its establishment in November 2004, was initially refused a grant of these powers under the act by the federal government. The reason given for the refusal for the grant of powers was an apparent conflict of interest by the Victorian Ombudsman who was responsible for both running the new body and also, in his role as Ombudsman, the oversight of such powers. The Victorian government has agreed to introduce appropriate oversight amendments and, in accordance with this, the current bill grants interception powers to the OPI for 12 months MAIN COMMITTEE from the assent of this bill. Within that time frame the Victorian government has agreed to enact the oversight legislation or face the loss of those powers if it does not do so. This represents a significant win for the Bracks government of Victoria and a significant cave in by the Howard government. The extension of the telecommunications interception powers was first called for by Premier Bracks some time ago and the Bracks government has to be congratulated for being able to now resolve this issue. I would also like to congratulate the Howard government for backing down from its original position and agreeing to the request made by the Victorian government. Despite initially resisting the call from the Bracks government for alterations to the act, it has subsequently decided to act on the recommendations of the Victorian state government. It is refreshing to see that the government, in this instance at least, has not allowed its extremist ideological predispositions to interfere with its common sense. The bill will assist state agencies in their fight against corruption and as such should be supported. The Labor Party is supporting the bill with the extension of the sunset clause by six months. The Labor Party, as I have mentioned, has supported the extension due to the extensive nature of the Blunn review. The review identified the need for a comprehensive and overriding legislative framework to deal with access to telecommunications for the purpose of security and law enforcement. While speaking on this bill, I must note that this is the third bill that the government has introduced to sort out the issue of stored communications under the act. An initial bill providing for amendments to the act was introduced in 2002. Its intent was to remove the requirement for a telecommunications interception warrant where a stored communication could have been accessed without the use of a telecommunications line. A colleague in the Senate, a member of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Committee, has advised me that the committee recommended the opposite to this proposal in 2002 and recommended that such data did require a TI warrant in order to be accessed. As a result of the good work of that committee, the provisions of that bill were withdrawn by the government. Then a second bill was introduced which largely kept intact the powers to access a TI stored communication without a warrant but introduced new provisions to distinguish between messages which had been accessed by the recipient and those that had not. Under the regime of the second bill, a message could be accessed without a warrant if it could be accessed without the use of a telecommunications line and it had already been accessed by the recipient. This second bill had further provisions for accessing a message where it had not already been accessed by the recipient but where access could be gained with equipment that the intended recipient could have used and this did not require the use of a telecommunications line. However, practical difficulties became evident with the second bill. Evidence was heard by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Committee that it would be difficult for an internet service provider to ascertain what had been accessed by the recipient and what had not. Furthermore, there was significant confusion: differing accounts from the Attorney-General’s Department and the Australian Federal Police as to whether powers already granted to the Federal Police allowed access to stored information without a warrant. The Senate committee further recommended, firstly, that the legislation be deferred until there was agreement between the AFP and the A-G’s department on the operation of the TI regime and, secondly, that MAIN COMMITTEE the bill be amended to provide for a review of its operation and consideration of whether stored communications should be exempt from the review. The provisions in the second bill which covered the stored communications exception to the interception power were to have a period of effect for 12 months from the date of the commencement. The Attorney-General also proposed that within that time a review of the act would be conducted. At that time the committee accepted the undertaking with the caveat that any review would be public, that it would seek submissions from the public and that its findings would be made public. The Blunn review accomplished both of these goals in seeking public submissions, which are now publicly available. The government did not ultimately proceed with this second bill. Instead it has introduced this third bill, which is before us today. Labor is prepared to support this bill, although its history is a little tortuous, for the reasons that I have outlined. I commend it to the House. Before resuming my seat, I would like to record my thanks to my colleague Senator Ludwig and, for its work, the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee, which seems to have handled this issue in great detail on many occasions and has done good work for the government in doing so. communications (Interception) Amendment (Stored Communications and Other Measures) Bill 2005. Most honourable members would be aware that the purpose of law enforcement agencies has always remained purely and simply to investigate and arrest those who break the law. A civilised society requires sanctions for those who breach the rules of that society; therefore, it is important that law enforcement agencies are given the appropriate tools to enable them to carry out their duties in the community interest. SoI suppose you could say effectively the law enforcement agencies are the goodies and in some respects they are trying to catch the baddies. But over the years the changes that have occurred to technology have made new tools available to criminals and it is therefore important that crime fighters are able to stay up with the game. Often there is debate in the community as to where the balance should be between individual rights and the need to give law enforcement agencies the tools they require to do their job in an appropriate way. Thus, this is becoming a more and more complex area of legislation and the incredible intricacies of new technologies are well beyond the comprehension of many, and it is very interesting to see the way in which the technological knowledge of our community is galloping ahead at an ever-increasing pace. The purpose of the Telecommunications (Interception) Amendment (Stored Communications and Other Measures) Bill 2005 is to ensure that some simple legal weapons are available to the various state organisations charged with investigating corruption and protecting the integrity of public positions. Among the modern documents that are now often integral to the investigation of corruption and are required during court proceedings are stored communications. This issue of equipping our crime fighters is a very important one, so earlier this year the Attorney-General, Mr Philip Ruddock-who in my view is one of the very best ministers this government has-appointed Mr AS Blunn AO to investigate the legislative framework that regulates access to stored communications. That report has been completed and its recommendations are being digested by the department. They will also obviously be considered by the government. I think most honourable members would agree that this should be carried out thoroughly.

Mr Deputy Speaker, you will be interested to hear that this was a measure that was first introduced courtesy of the Telecommunications (Interception) Amendment (Stored Communications and Other Measures) Bill 2004-that is last year-along with a sunset clause that would see this valuable crime-fighting provision lapse in mid-December this year. I have to say that I am one of those people who often have a concern that after more than 100 years of Federation we have accumulated on our statute books many laws that are really no longer required. It takes omnibus bills from time to time to clean up some of those irrelevant statutes and remove them from the statute books. An increased use of sunset clauses might mean that our legislation would automatically tidy itself up and not require amendment by omnibus bills, which so often will amend large numbers of acts of this parliament in one hit. Today’s bill simply extends the provision, which would have lapsed in mid-December this year, for an extra six months to mid-June 2006 while the analysis of Mr Blunn’s recommendations on access to stored communications is finalised. I am pleased to hear the shadow Attorney-General, the member for Gellibrand, indicate that the opposition is in fact supporting this bill. The bill will enable better use of intercepted communications by those organisations involved in the investigation of corruption. These include-and I think most members are probably aware of them-the Crime and Misconduct Commission in Queensland, the Office of Police Integrity in Victoria, the New South Wales Independent Commission Against Corruption and the New South Wales Inspector of the Independent Commission Against Corruption. These bodies already had some provisions available to them under the interception act of 1979, but they were restricted in the way that they could use intercepted documents. The Telecommunications (Interception) Amendment (Stored Communications and Other Measures) Bill 2005 corrects that problem. Thankfully, unacceptable incidents of public servants behaving corruptly are rare. Any such behaviour by officials, police and any number of other government workers only serves to destabilise our communities, undermine our democracy and bring about a sense of alienation from and disillusionment with the political process. Corruption, once it begins, can quite often lead to further, even bigger crime: commercial fraud, money laundering and organised crime. Not surprisingly, the bill currently before the House will also usher in several other minor changes. It will clarify the definition of an ‘officer of the state’ in that it will come to mean any officers of any of the state police forces-I think they call themselves police services these days-as well as civilian employees of those police services. These employees already came under the guidelines of the act and the bill serves to clear up any uncertainties. This feature also serves to remind all employees involved in the investigation of crimes, and the bringing to justice of those who commit crime, that they are also not above the law. While Australia might be seen to be relatively free of corruption in official positions compared to other countries we hear some quite appalling stories about, there have been documented cases in the past of which Australia ought not be proud. MAIN COMMITTEE This bill gives law enforcement agencies further clout to be able to fulfil their vital functions of weeding out the bad eggs and successfully bringing them to justice. I commend the Attorney on this legislation and commend, in particular, the Telecommunications (Interception) Amendment (Stored Communications and Other Measures) Bill 2005 to the Main Committee. munications (Interception) Amendment (Stored Communications and Other Measures) Bill 2005. I am also pleased to note that the opposition supports this bill. The purpose of the bill is to extend for six months provisions allowing access to stored communications without a warrant under the Telecommunications (Interception) Act 1979. This bill also adds the Victorian Office of Police Integrity to the list of eligible authorities able to obtain telecommunications interception warrants for law enforcement purposes and allows various state bodies that are already eligible authorities to make greater use of lawfully obtained intercepted material. The Telecommunications (Interception) Amendment (Stored Communications) Act 2004 introduced into the interception act the concept of a ‘stored communication’ and provided that a stored communication could be intercepted without the need for a telecommunications interception warrant. Access to such communications could therefore be obtained by other lawful means, such as a normal search warrant. The amendments also included a provision to the effect that any information obtained from intercepting a stored communication was not lawfully obtained information for the purposes of the interception act-that is, the information was not subject to the restrictions on use imposed by the interception act. The amendments were intended as an interim measure pending a thorough consideration of how best to regulate access to communications in the everchanging world of technology. As an interim measure the amendments included a 12-month sunset clause, meaning that the provisions will cease to operate on 14 December 2005. Since 1994 there have been four major reviews dealing with telecommunications interception. These were the 1994 review by MrP Barrett into the long-term cost-effectiveness of telecommunications interception; in 1999, a review by MrD Boucher of interception arrangements under section 332R of the Telecommunications Act 1997; the 1999 review by MrP Ford of telecommunications interception policy; and the 2003 review, by MrT Sherman AO, of named person warrants and other matters. The latest review-the Anthony Blunn review of 2005 into the regulation of, and access to, communications-invited submissions from the public and, in particular, from parties which had demonstrated an interest in the previous reviews and in the legislative processes related to the Telecommunications (Interception) Act. Mr Blunn was asked to review the policy options for the regulation of access to telecommunications, with particular emphasis on new and emerging telecommunications technologies, having particular regard to protecting the privacy of users of the system. Mr Blunn was also asked to consider and comment on the ongoing appropriateness of the current telecommunications interception regime and, if relevant, alternatives for the lawful access to content; the protection of information systems from attack by means of a telecommunications system, including the use of intrusion detection systems and other measures; the cost implications, including cost recovery mechanisms; and any other issues as they arose from the review. MAIN COMMITTEE",166,Telecommunications Interception Amendment Stored Communications And Other Measures Bill 2005
324,Mrs Vale (Hughes) (11.01 Am),"I appreciate the opportunity to speak on the TelecomMr Blunn has now completed the review of the regulation of access to communications and has made a number of recommendations in relation to stored communications. These recommendations need to be fully considered and, where appropriate, implemented in order to ensure that the interception act is able to meet the demands of new and emerging technologies. This bill will therefore extend for six months the operation of the provisions dealing with access to stored communications. By way of background, the current access regime is regulated through the provisions of the Telecommunications Act and the interception act. Very broadly, the Telecommunications Act, insofar as it is relevant, regulates the networks that carry or are capable of carrying communications. The scheme of the act is built around a structure of licensed carriers and carriage service providers which constitute the network. It concentrates on the obligations of those carriers and carriage service providers and associated persons in relation to accessing that network. Access is dealt with in parts 13, 14 and 15, which respectively deal with the protection of communications, the national interest matters and cooperation with agencies. Importantly, part 13 provides, among other things, that eligible persons must not disclose or use any information accessed in the course of employment that relates to the content or substance of any communication that has been or is being carried by a carrier and carriage service provider, the service supplied or the affairs or personal particulars of another person. There are, however, a number of exceptions, including in relation to content or substance where disclosure or use is required in connection with the operation of an enforcement agency under a warrant or in any other case as required or authorised by law. More broadly, disclosure of information or a document but not in relation to content or substance is expected where disclosure is certified by an authorised officer as reasonably necessary for the purposes of national security, enforcing the criminal law or a law imposing a pecuniary penalty or protecting the public revenue. Part 14 of the Telecommunications Act builds on part 13 in requiring carriers and carriage service providers to do their best to prevent telecommunication networks and facilities being used to commit offences and to give authorities such help as is reasonably necessary for the purposes of (1) enforcing the criminal law and the law imposing penalties, (2) protecting public revenue and (3) safeguarding national security. Part 15 provides the structures through which the obligations in relation to interception are imposed on carrier and carriage service providers. For those purposes, interception consists of listening to or recording communication in its passage over a controlled network or controlled facility. The interception act deals only with the interception of telecommunications passing over a telecommunications system. Other than as provided, the act makes it an offence to intercept such communications. For the purposes of the act, interception consists of listening to or recording by any means a communication passing over a telecommunications system without the knowledge of the person making the communication. There are a number of exceptions to the prohibition against interception. For law enforcement purposes, the most significant are those related to stored communications and to interceptions under a warrant. The interception act is now expressed to exclude stored communications. The relevant amendment is sunseted and, unless some action is taken before 15 December 2005, the provisions will lapse. Currently, access to the content or substance of communications stored within the system is achieved by a general search warrant obtained under releMAIN COMMITTEE vant Commonwealth or state law which is executed under the provisions of part 13 of the Telecommunications Act, which prevents disclosure of content other than as prescribed. According to Mr Blunn, there has been no increase in the number of complaints about access to communications since the passage of the stored communications amendment. Prior to the amendment, it would appear that there were many very different views about the application of the interception act to stored communications. The review turned on the interpretation to be given to the words ‘passing over the telecommunications system’ and therefore to the issue of at what point a communication commenced and ceased passing over the system and ceased to be subject to the act. In relation to when a communication ceases passing over the system, there are at least three competing views: (a) when the message has been received-that is, read by the intended recipient, (b) when the message reaches the recipient’s receiving terminal and (c) when the message is stored, in the sense that it is at rest-that is, it is not being automatically processed by the telecommunications system and has reached the address from which it can be directly accessed by the intended recipient. Also, according to Mr Blunn, prior to the amendment to the interception act a number of agencies were acting on the understanding that, even then, the third view was the position at law and on that basis were accessing stored communications other than by an interception warrant. The amendment had the singular advantage of settling that issue, at least for the time being. If the amendment lapses by the operation of the sunset clause, nothing will have been settled and the previous unsatisfactory and uncertain position will be restored. This legislation not only extends for six months the provisions allowing access to stored communications without a warrant under the Telecommunications (Interception) Act but also makes amendments to the interception act to (a) make the Victorian Office of Police Integrity and the New South Wales Inspector of the Independent Commission Against Corruption eligible authorities for the purposes of the interception act, thereby allowing them to receive lawfully obtained intercepted material for the purpose of fulfilling their statutory obligation to investigate misconduct, including corruption; (b) enable the New South Wales Independent Commission Against Corruption and the Queensland Corruption and Crime Commission to use lawfully obtained interception material for the purpose of their statutory function of investigating corrupt conduct and to use the material in proceedings under the Independent Commission Against Corruption Act 1988 and the Crime and Misconduct Act 2001 respectively; (c) enable the New South Wales Inspector of the Police Integrity Commission to use intercepted material for the purposes of fulfilling its statutory function in relation to the conduct of the Police Integrity Commission under the Police Integrity Commission Act 1996; (d) clarify that the expression ‘officer of a state’ includes all members of the police service of that state; and (e) make technical amendments arising from the enactment of the Legislative Instrument Act 2003. It is important that the current provisions be extended, allowing a thorough consideration of how best to regulate access to communications in the ever-changing world of technology advancement, especially in view of the increasingly uncertain world in which we now live. I look forward to the government’s response to the Blunn review and I commend this legislation to the House. MAIN COMMITTEE terception) Amendment (Stored Communications) Bill 2004. The amendment bill at hand, the Telecommunications (Interception) Amendment (Stored Communications and Other Measures) Bill 2005, provides for a six-month extension to provisions in the original bill, allowing law enforcement agencies to access stored communications without telecommunications interception warrants being issued under the Telecommunications (Interception) Act 1979. The original amendment bill contained a 12-month sunset clause which would have seen the provisions cease operation in mid-December. The sunset clause was put in place to give the government time to consider the recommendations of an independent assessment of these changes. The bill before the House today adds a six-month extension to that sunset clause, giving the government additional time to consider a review of the regulations on access to stored communications. The review compiled by Anthony Blunn was presented at the introduction of the bill. It provides for a wide-ranging examination of where we are coming from, and where we are heading, in terms of regulating access to all forms of communication for investigative and security purposes. The purpose of the original bill was to rebalance our law and order needs with the everevolving communications sector. The technology we use to transmit communications is a very important aspect of the work of agencies charged with the security of this country. It will have profound ramifications for the investigative processes of our law enforcement agencies and those who seek to profit from crime. Mr Blunn’s wide-ranging report indicates that the government has, on the whole, struck the right balance between enhancing the powers of our law enforcement agencies and enhancing the privacy rights of citizens. But the government also needs to consider the supplementary issues Mr Blunn raised in his report. Hence the need for a six-month extension to the provisions of the original bill. By amending the original legislation the government is seeking to give our law enforcement agencies modern-day powers to tackle modern-day criminal activity. The amendments put forward by the government and reviewed by Mr Blunn update the powers of law enforcement agencies, giving them tools in the fight against crime and corruption. Specifically, the changes will benefit a number of anticorruption agencies, as the previous speaker, the member for Hughes, mentioned. These include the New South Wales Independent Commission Against Corruption, the New South Wales Police Integrity Commission, the Queensland Crime and Misconduct Commission and the Victorian Office of Police Integrity, all of which use intercepted material in the investigation of corrupt conduct. For these agencies to do their jobs to the best of their ability, their investigative powers must keep pace with communications technology. Since the Telecommunications (Interception) Act commenced in 1979, more than 25 years ago, our methods of communicating have changed quite dramatically. When drafted, the act had only to cover live communications such as telephones, telexes and the like-where the content of communications was spoken or transmitted in real time and not able to be retained and stored in any manner, which, of course, is the case today. Accessing a stored electronic format of these communications was not possible in that era because messages could only be transmitted in a transient or temporary fashion. The review author, Tony Blunn, found that the language and detail of the Telecommunications (Interception) Act 1979 is becoming increasMAIN COMMITTEE",168,Telecommunications Interception Amendment Stored Communications And Other Measures Bill 2005
325,Mr Neville (Hinkler) (11.13 Am),"Last year I spoke on the Telecommunications (Iningly limited in accommodating new and emerging technologies through industry development and responding to the needs of security and law enforcement agencies. To paraphrase Mr Blunn, we face an entirely different scenario today, as any of us who use mobile telephones, pagers or palm pilots would know. We no longer have to wait for a wired message to come through. Today we have instant communications in the form of email, text messaging, picture messaging and paging. Using these modern-day communications, individuals can draft, edit, write and store messages and information before sending them to the recipient. This new technology has changed the way we work, interact and communicate with our friends, families and contacts, but it has also created an ever-widening implication for intelligence gathering, investigative practices and national security. Until the introduction of the Telecommunications (Interception) Amendment (Stored Communications) Bill 2004, the interception of communications stored on new technologies such as text messages and emails was prohibited without a telecommunications interception warrant. Under the amended bill’s 12-month sunset clause, law enforcement agencies have been able to access stored communications with a standard search warrant rather than a telecommunications interception warrant, which has closed an ever-widening loophole in the legislation and helped keep pace with our ever-evolving communications technology. This is a crucial tool in fighting crime and terrorism, giving law enforcement agencies the power to access messages and other communications otherwise hidden from scrutiny. An extract from the Australian Strategic Policy Institute’s recent publication, Local Jihad: radical Islam and terrorism in Indonesia, illustrates the existing conundrum very well. Under the heading of ‘Measuring success against terrorism’, the report says in part: The most obvious standard measure of successand they are referring there to success against terrorismis the absence of a terrorist attack. The problem with relying on that measure is it’s based on past acts rather than future possibilities. Just because an attack has not happened yet does not mean that one isn’t currently being planned-9/11 and the London bombings are evidence of that fact. Being able to proactively prevent a terrorist attack or simply compile evidence for investigation or prosecution of a crime by accessing stored messages, such as emails and text messages, is a necessary evolution in our laws. One issue flagged in the Blunn report, which we as legislators must be mindful of, is the protection of privacy. Normally in these matters I would rather err on the side of privacy, but I recognise that we are in a much different environment today and we have to take on would be terrorists and the like with the best tools at our disposal. To some extent, privacy has to be compromised-hopefully, not on a long-term basis but certainly until we are through this very difficult time. Mr Blunn underlined the fact that privacy concerns must be a fundamental consideration when drafting legislation for security and law enforcement purposes. The government acknowledges that our ability to communicate freely and with a measure of privacy is one of the most fundamental tenets of our democracy. I am confident that this matter, along with the other recommendations in Mr Blunn’s review, will be at the forefront of the minister’s mind when considering the contents of the report. I think this extension is warranted, and I commend the bill to the Main Committee. MAIN COMMITTEE for Hinkler for his very thoughtful contribution, and I also thank the members for Hughes, Fisher and Gellibrand. I understand there were some unwarranted comments by the member for Fisher, who tends to want to flatter me, but other than that I am pleased at the general support for this measure. CanI just say that the Telecommunications (Interception) Amendment (Stored Communications and Other Measures) Bill 2005 regulates the use of interception and intercepted material by law enforcement, national security and a number of dedicated anticorruption agencies, and the regulatory regime ensures that there is a balance between protecting the privacy of those who use Australia’s telecommunications systems and the legitimate need to fight organised crime, threats to national security and corruption. This bill will of course continue for a further six months the provisions that deal with stored communications, pending our deliberations on the recommendations of the report in the Blunn review, presented to the House earlier in this debate. I thank the member for Gellibrand for her indication of support for this extension and her acknowledgment that these are complex issues and that the time to implement them ought to be available. The bill also includes important amendments to enhance the way in which anticorruption agencies are able to access and use lawfully obtained intercepted material. The bill really does send a very strong message that corrupt conduct by persons holding public positions is simply unacceptable and backs this message up with enhanced investigatory tools for anticorruption agencies. The anticorruption agencies, of course, that will benefit from the changes include the newly created Victorian Office of Police Integrity and the New South Wales Inspector of the Independent Commission Against Corruption. Other agencies that will benefit are the New South Wales Independent Commission Against Corruption, the Queensland Crime and Misconduct Commission and the New South Wales Inspector of Police Integrity Commission. There is one issue in which I think some inappropriate observations were drawn by the member for Gellibrand about the amendments in relation to the Victorian Office of Police Integrity. The amendments here will only commence if the Victorian government legislates to provide satisfactory accountability and oversight arrangements for the office. It is important to understand the issue that has been a very live issue here where the Victorian government resisted appropriate independent scrutiny of some potential use-forinterception material that was to be given to the Ombudsman with one title but to be supervised by the Ombudsman simply wearing another cap. For us that was totally unacceptable. It would be unacceptable to any fair-minded person that Caesar should investigate Caesar, yet that is what Victoria had in mind, and it persisted. Victoria could have had in place effective telecommunications interception for its police anticorruption agency if it had been prepared to put in place effective, independent monitoring of those arrangements. I would not want to say in relation to this measure that Victoria has backed down; I would want to say that Victoria now intends that its measures will be compliant with a regime that I think any fair-minded person in this House and certainly in the Senate would expect. In fact, I think I would have been seen to be derelict in my duties if I had been prepared to see the interception powers used-powers which are very intrusive-without adequate independent verification and scrutiny. I am surprised that Victoria, which preaches in relation to these matters-and I notice it was a Victorian member, the member for Gellibrand, who MAIN COMMITTEE",171,Telecommunications Interception Amendment Stored Communications And Other Measures Bill 2005

SoI am disappointed that she suggests that this bill is in some way a backdown; it is not. These measures will only operate for Victoria when they have put in place the appropriate independent scrutiny. SoI make the point: the amendments in relation to the Victorian Office of Police Integrity will only commence if the Victorian government legislates to provide satisfactory accountability and oversight arrangements. That has always been our position. I am glad that Victoria has seen fit to come to the party. The bill will also ensure that intercepted material may be used in the investigation of misconduct by members of state and territory police forces by ensuring that state police fall within the definition of an officer of the state. The anticorruption measures of this bill indicate very clearly our commitment to fight against corruption. I commend the bill to the chamber. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time.

As members of the House are aware, the purpose of this bill is to amend the Customs Tariff Act 1995 by ensuring that customs duty is not payable on goods that are described as of a non-commercial character being brought in by non-Australian citizens who are family members of participants who are attending the Commonwealth Games in Melbourne in 2006. The bill is not contentious, because it exempts the imposition of a customs duty on goods. Any exemption from a customs duty or other impost, whether a tax, levy or other instrument of government revenue, is always welcome. Obviously, the loser, if one can call them that, is the long-suffering Australian taxpayer. Indeed, the Attorney-General and member for Berowra, the Hon. Philip Ruddock, said, in his second reading speech on this bill, on Wednesday, 14 September 2005: It is expected that Commonwealth Games participants and officials will bring with them a variety of goods that are to be used in a non-commercial manner. These will include give-aways, hospitality samples and other consumables that will be used for team promotion and for cultural and hospitality activities. Clearly, the intention of this legislation is to recognise that the financial benefit to Australia of the imposition of a customs duty on such non-commercial goods imported into Australia is outweighed by the national policy impact of the impost during such an auspicious event as the Commonwealth Games. Members of the House see in an instant the wisdom of exempting such goods from customs duty, yet how does this parliament regard the situation of goods upon which a duty is prescribed under the customs import regulations and which are clearly imported for commercial profit but which are systematically hidden from the Australian CusMAIN COMMITTEE",173,Telecommunications Interception Amendment Stored Communications And Other Measures Bill 2005
328,Mr Murphy (Lowe) (11.29 Am),"I rise not only to speak in support of the Customs Tartoms Service with the sole and substantial intent of defrauding the Commonwealth of its revenue? What do members of the House and the general public say about those cheats who deliberately import, by the container load, shipment after shipment of goods, deliberately failing to declare the quantity or understating their price with the sole and substantial purpose of defrauding the Commonwealth of its revenue by refusing to pay the prescribed amount of duty? May I speak for all in this parliament and all law-abiding Australian citizens in saying that no-one likes a cheat. No-one likes to see two importers of goods upon which an import duty is payable, one abiding by the law and the other not abiding by the law, and then see the wrongdoer not only profit as to his or her criminal and civil liability conduct but also compete unfairly against the other importer who is paying his or her customs duties and declaring the goods to the Customs Service, Quarantine and other agencies-in short, doing the right thing. With these precursors in mind, I wish to bring to the attention of members a reported judgment in the Supreme Court of New South Wales, Common Law Division, involving the CEO of Customsv Ozzy Tyre and Tube Pty Ltd and Lorene Khamis [2005, NSWC at 948] before Justice Stephen Rothman. This judgment was handed down only three weeks ago, on 25 September 2005. I bring this case to the parliament’s attention today because of the size of the sums and the audacity of the defendants in attempting to defraud the Commonwealth of its revenue and otherwise evade Commonwealth law. Ms Lorene Khamis is a director of Ozzy Tyre and Tube Pty Ltd. The statistics of this case are quite staggering: (1) eighteen shipments of motor vehicle tyres, wheels and parts from 18 December 1998 to about 24 March 2000, (2) a finding by the Supreme Court on the total of unpaid duties, equalling a reported $255,000 and (3) the total of fines imposed by the Supreme Court being a staggering $3,237,000. However, the case does not end there. What is even more staggering is a fact reported in the Australian on 26 September 2005 in a news article by Vanda Carson entitled ‘Judge slams hot-rod deal’: A director of Australia’s largest hot-rod wheel and tyre supplier has been fined $3.5 million for smuggling car accessories into the country and defrauding Customs. … … … Justice Stephen Rothman lamented the fact that the plea-bargain-deal allowed her to avoid punishment. Customs chief executive John Mansfield has agreed not to pursue Ms Khamis or her company for the $3.5 million provided she pays $255,000 in unpaid duties. The judge said there would be no deterrence from breaking the law if importers caught evading duties were only punished by having to pay the duty they should have paid in the first place. Before getting to the heart of this deplorable situation, I wish to remind the parliament of the threefold primary roles of the Australian Customs Service. I cite page 14 of the Australian Customs Service annual report of 2003-04 under the title ‘Vision and Roles’. Customs has three principal roles: to facilitate trade and the movement of people across the Australian border while protecting the community and maintaining compliance with Australian law to collect customs revenue efficiently; and to administer specific industry schemes and trade measures. MAIN COMMITTEE Let us now apply the outcomes of the Ozzy Tyres case to the three primary roles of the ACS. Has the ACS in the Ozzy Tyres case facilitated trade and the movement of people across the Australian border while protecting the community and maintaining compliance with Australian law? I say no. Yes, the Customs chief executive officer did commence civil litigation against those defrauding Customs and the Australian taxpayer of our revenue and, yes, the Customs chief executive officer did obtain a judgment from the Supreme Court of New South Wales. However, what is inexcusable is the fact that, after the judgment three weeks ago, he let these smugglers go. He let these persons convicted of their civil liabilities go, releasing them of a liability to the Australian taxpayer of some $3.5 million. Let us go to the second prescribed role of Customs-that is, to collect customs revenue efficiently. AgainI ask the House whether it believes, in light of this Supreme Court of New South Wales judgment, that the ACS has collected customs revenue efficiently, including those fines and penalties accruing from failure by persons liable to pay that revenue. AgainI say no. The ACS, as agent for the Commonwealth, was owed $3.5 million in fines and simply allowed the defrauding smugglers to walk away. What does that all say about the governance of the ACS? Again, I can only reiterate the words of Justice Rothman, who with total clarity notes the complete collapse of any final fear and deterrence in the hearts of the wrongdoers. Through you, Mr Deputy Speaker, let me say to the Attorney-General today what this judgment means for community protection and for compliance with Australian law. First, the action of the Customs chief executive officer in reaching this sweetheart deal with the director of Ozzy Tyres and with Ozzy Tyres as a body corporate is one of the most destructive decisions in the history of the Australian Customs Service, in my opinion. Far from protecting the Australian community, including those legitimate participants in the Australian tyre retail and distribution industry, the deal struck between the Customs CEO, Ozzy Tyres and one director of that company has dealt a fatal blow to the confidence of legitimate importers of any kind. In other words, those who do the right thing will be abandoned, while those who smuggle, cheat and defraud will walk away without any final punishment. In short, the message is out: do the wrong thing and you will get away with it; do the right thing and you will be flogged. Put in simple terms, wrong is right; right is wrong. For several years Ozzy Tyres deliberately imported goods with the sole intention of undermining the customs revenue collection system. When they were eventually caught, they pleaded that they could not pay the penalty and were simply let off. Let me now quote from the tyre industry journal, Australian Tyre Dealer. On page 13 of edition no. 4 of volume 14 of Australian Tyre Dealer-the August-September 2005 issue-is a full one-page glossy advertisement for Ozzy Tyres, titled ‘Ozzy Tyres wants you’. This advertisement describes Ozzy Tyres as ‘one of Australia’s leading tyre and wheel companies’. The advertisement goes on to boast that ‘Ozzy Tyres prides itself on only dealing with trusted and respected wheel manufacturers and has exclusive supply agreements with some of the biggest wheel companies in the world.’ Allow me to bring to the attention of the Attorney-General the impact of Ozzy Tyres on its competitors. As a result of Ozzy Tyres’s conviction for being a smuggler and a defrauder of Commonwealth revenue and its breach of several sections of the Customs Act-too numerous MAIN COMMITTEE to mention here today-Ozzy Tyres has radically undercut the price of its competitor distributors. ourable member opposite would consent under the standing orders to answer a question. ment (Commonwealth Games) Bill 2005. While I know that the member opposite feels very passionately about the subject he is currently addressing, I wonder whether he would be able to show us how the matter of Ozzy Tyres in some way comes within the purview of the Customs Tariff Amendment (Commonwealth Games) Bill 2005, given the fact that the purpose of this bill is to allow entry of certain goods relating to the Commonwealth Games. duty is not payable on goods that are described as being of a non-commercial character. I am talking about a case that was brought to my attention last week by a constituent who is very concerned about the implications for the tyre industry across Australia. It is a very important public interest matter. I appreciate that my colleague and friend the member for Fisher was not here at the start of my contribution, so I will make that concession. But this is a very important matter which I believe is germane to the debate, and I would like the Attorney General, through you, Mr Deputy Speaker, to follow up this particular case. I am afraid that Ozzy Tyres effectively got off scot-free in this particular matter. It is to the detriment of other operators in the industry that these people can just continue to operate and not pay the ultimate penalty, which they should. Perhaps if the member listens to what more I have to say, he will appreciate the relevance of it. I would hope that he would advocate on behalf of the concerns of my constituents and all those honest, law-abiding people in the tyre industry across Australia to see that this sort of thing does not happen again. Quite plainly, the principal in this particular matter is continuing to operate, and that is at the expense of all those law abiding citizens who are operating within the industry. order or do you have a question? deign to answer a further question. to be kept short. and I would like to see it in the other chamber as well.

I see clearly that it is a public interest matter and I would be grateful if you would let me continue. The member for Fisher was not here originally but, as I said earlier when he entered the chamber, he would want to pursue this with the Attorney-General and make sure that this case never recurs. may be very important, there might be other forums available for the presentation of the topic being canvassed. If the member for Lowe could in some way tie his remarks to the bill, that would be acceptable. leave to continue my remarks. The DEPUTY PRESIDENT-You do not need leave, Member for Lowe. Please continue. unfairly undercut the price of tyres, wheels and other motor vehicle parts at the expense of their competitors. In short, Ozzy have profited by their dishonesty and their breaches of Australian Commonwealth law. The damage to the tyre industry in Australia could not be more catastrophic. Ozzy’s competitors have been wrongly accused of forcing prices up. They have lost market share and ultimately gone into bankruptcy or insolvency. As a direct consequence, the legitimate retailer and distributor channels are being seriously undermined and Australian industry is being destroyed. This type of conduct is part of the grey marketing scourge being visited upon Australia today. Is this what the CEO of the Australian Customs Service calls protecting the Australian community and maintaining compliance with Australian law? The border protection of Australian industry in matters such as the Ozzy Tyre scandal is a matter that cries for justice. In this case there is a desperate need for the ACS to be fully staffed and equipped to monitor and prosecute those smugglers and other wrongdoers. Australian industry deserves lawful protection and I am sure the government wants to do something about it. Grey marketing is a serious matter. Figures are scant but it is estimated that only three per cent of container terminals are actually inspected by Customs-that is, 97 per cent of all containers are not inspected. What does this say about smuggling and the importation of dangerous goods in the terrorist environment that we are experiencing at the moment? Australia is currently a wide open target for grey marketing. In the Ozzy Tyre case we have the benefit of one finding of 18 smuggled shipments. It is hard enough for the plaintiff lawyers to gather the evidence, issue the subpoenas, build the case and lead to a successful finding of civil liability; it is lamentable that the CEO of Customs could let the convicted wrongdoers off the hook entirely, calling upon them to pay no more than what they were bound to pay anyway. What the Ozzy Tyre case represents is that the ACS is weak on enforcement. In my view, the government makes Australia a laughing MAIN COMMITTEE",177,Customs Tariff Amendment Commonwealth Games Bill 2005

344,Mr Murphy,"Let me continue. By simply refusing to pay customs duties, Ozzy havestock for those who would attempt to defraud the Commonwealth of its revenue and make more and more audacious breaches. ‘You must pay your taxes and duties, but only if you want to.’ That is the message. Equally, the message is that if you do not want to pay taxes and duties then it is okay. That is what I am concerned about. I fear that the government’s response to the New South Wales Supreme Court’s judgment will be to refer this matter to some committee seeking amendments to the Customs Act or some other legislation-because this is how it is usually done. Such a problem is usually referred to some committee so the government is seen to be doing something when in fact nothing might change. I want to see something change in this particular case. The CEO of Customs in this case had obtained a conviction. There was nothing more to do than enforce the court’s judgment. If the defendants could not pay then bankrupt them. That would leave the legitimate businesses, who are doing the right thing, to trade with a measure of relief and in the knowledge that there was some protection of their interests. However, sadly this is not the case. I urge the Attorney-General to take action to ensure that justice is done in this case. A good start would be to examine why only civil litigation was commenced and whether the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions has been briefed for possible criminal action against the defendants. A second thing the Attorney-General can do is to call in his CEO of Customs and have him show cause for conduct that has the Australian tyre industry tearing its hair out in despair at the moment. I am advised that the arrangement between the CEO of the ACS and Ozzy Tyres is ‘good at law’ and still stands. This is an appalling precedent and a disgraceful outcome for Australian industry and all those Aussie battling family businesses that this government purportedly represents. The law in this area is inadequate in that it permits only a pecuniary punishment. I recommend that the Attorney-General expand the range of permissible penalties, including incarceration and community service orders. In this case, yet again, we have a situation where a director has placed the assets out of reach of her creditors, arrogantly pleading that she is impecuniousbeing a family business-meaning that she simply cannot pay the $3.5 million due to the taxpayers. Let me tell you that by her conduct she has ruined other honest industry operators. That is why I am bringing this to the attention of the parliament. Her conduct is selfish. If she or the company cannot pay it should be placed into administration or made insolvent. Why should Ozzy’s competitors and the Australian taxpayer pay for a convicted criminal and civilly liable conduct? Why should we jointly and severally permit these serious breaches of customs law to be rewarded whilst Ozzy continues trading and expanding its business? How is it that Ozzy is able to place full-page advertisements in major journals, such as the Australian Tyre Dealer, boasting that it is so successful that it is expanding and calling for more franchises, when it is supposed to be impecunious? This is the point I am making: these people are clearly corrupt. In concluding, I caution on a disturbing point. As I mentioned, grey marketing is rampant in a multitude of import industries, particularly high-volume consumables. Examples also include computer media such as floppy disks, CDs and other computer components. Other industry examples include cosmetics and clothes. The list is almost endless. All these types of goods are imported largely without rigorous regulation. Equally, there is an active industry in the recycling of import companies that are fly-by-night businesses and operators, making it MAIN COMMITTEE difficult to prosecute any one entity. On behalf of my constituents and people in this industry and similar industries, I am demanding greater regulatory control. I urge the Attorney-General to demonstrate leadership and to govern by taking the matter of Australian industry protection seriously and beginning to punish those who flagrantly abuse our customs laws while destroying Australian industry. I further urge that there be an increase in Customs forces, with particular reference to container searching and inspection so as to increase the absolute number of containers searched from the current statistics of three per cent. I ask my friend and colleague to take the circumstances of that case back to the Attorney-General, who might not be aware of it, and ask him to follow that up with the CEO of Customs. It has certainly left a very sour taste not only with my constituent in the tyre industry but also with all his colleagues in the association that represents the tyre industry. They would like something to be done about it. I am sure they will appreciate me bringing it to the attention of the parliament, and I hope that something good comes from this, notwithstanding the issue-which I understand-raised by the member for Fisher in relation to its direct relevance to the bill before the House. toms Tariff Amendment (Commonwealth Games) Bill 2005. Referring to the remarks made by the honourable member for Lowe, I think the appropriate minister is probably the Minister for Justice and Customs. He would religiously read the Hansard, but I would like to make the point at the outset that, because I have a high regard for the member for Lowe, I did not take a point of order on relevance on this. I could see that he felt very strongly about the subject and, even though-as you pointed out, Mr Deputy Speaker-there could well be better or more appropriate forums for him to raise those matters, we chose not to take a point of order on this occasion. Next year, starting from 15 March, Australians will once again relish the chance to show the world what we are made of. That of course is the date of the opening ceremony of the 2006 Commonwealth Games, which will be held in Melbourne. Representatives of the 71 Commonwealth nations will converge on the capital of Victoria for 11 days of physical competition in pursuits such as athletics and swimming through to basketball, boxing, cycling, shooting, rugby sevens, weight-lifting and so on. But international sporting events are today much more than just sports events. They are held alongside cultural extravaganzas and festivals that celebrate the diversity of the world. The Customs Tariff Amendment (Commonwealth Games) Bill 2005 aims to bring about a very sensible situation which will remove duty and tariff barriers that would potentially detract from the celebratory aspect of the Commonwealth Games. Honourable members will be interested to know that the bill will provide duty-free entry to Australia of items that are of no real commercial value but that are brought into our country by non-Australian members of the Commonwealth Games family for purposes related to this sporting and cultural celebration. These goods would include those needed for cultural and hospitality functions, samples, promotional items and also giveaways. Goods such as alcohol, tobacco, motor vehicle parts, television cameras and radio broadcasting equipment will not be eligible for the concession. Honourable members would be aware that Australia is not new to hosting international sporting events. For instance, Melbourne hosted the Olympic Games in 1956, the CommonMAIN COMMITTEE",178,Customs Tariff Amendment Commonwealth Games Bill 2005
345,Mr Slipper (Fisher) (11.52 Am),"I am pleased to be able to join the debate on the Cuswealth Games were held in Brisbane in 1982 and the world saw Australia through new eyes when we hosted the Sydney 2000 Olympics-and it is really hard to believe that five years have now elapsed since that wonderful event. Australians showed the world at Sydney, and also at Melbourne and Brisbane, what we can do when we work together, and the world was impressed. The world was impressed not only at the smooth operation of those events, particularly the Olympics, but also by our people-our volunteers, our bus drivers, cabbies and general citizens-who all shared the patriotism and excitement that the games brought. Who will ever forget the words uttered by the then President of the IOC, Juan Samaranch, when he described Sydney in 2000 as ‘the best games ever’? With Australians now counting down the days to the Melbourne Commonwealth Games, the government is determined to reduce the legislative restrictions that may in any way hamper these games from becoming an equal runaway success. While the desire to be triumphant on the international scene is an overwhelming one, the Customs Tariff Amendment (Commonwealth Games) Bill 2005 will not-and I stress will not-usher in a free-for-all import environment for anyone to abuse. I cited a moment ago a number of items that will not be eligible for the relaxed provisions. These provisions outlined in the Customs Tariff Amendment (Commonwealth Games) Bill 2005 are similar to provisions created for the Sydney Olympic Games and also the Paralympics. The Paralympics in 2000 were also an outstanding success. These provisions will remain in force for a period of six months from 1 January, a period that allows plenty of time for our visitors to be able to bring their items into Australia to prepare for the March event. The Australian government are proud of our achievements at Sydney and we are committed to providing a platform for similar success at Melbourne. Melburnians are mad about their sports and that in-built vigour is already generating community-wide aspirations for a successful Commonwealth Games in 2006. The Australian government feel the same energy, and this bill further indicates our strong commitment to the success of the Melbourne event. Customs laws include a number of pre-existing concessions for personal effects and equipment that are directly required by officials and athletes involved in the games itself, but while in Australia these athletes, coaches and family members from the various Commonwealth countries will also have first-hand experience of our hospitality, our laid-back, comfortable way of life, our tolerance of others and our determination to put on a cracking good show. AndI do hope that many of those Commonwealth Games visitors take advantage of the opportunity of travelling to Queensland, to the Sunshine Coast and to other parts of our nation to appreciate that Australia has a lot more to offer than simply being an outstanding games organiser and an outstanding sporting nation. I see the Attorney-General in the chamber. In an earlier speech I said that, in my view, he is one of the best ministers in the government. He is here, his time is important, so I will not continue to talk at length. I just stress that the provisions of the Customs Tariff Amendment (Commonwealth Games) Bill 2005 will help achieve the outcome the government seeks and will help ensure that the Melbourne Commonwealth Games are a real success. I am very pleased to be able to commend the Customs Tariff Amendment (Commonwealth Games) Bill 2005 to the chamber. of the member for Fisher. I thank him for his generous remarks. I do not think they are deMAIN COMMITTEE",180,Customs Tariff Amendment Commonwealth Games Bill 2005
346,Mr Ruddock (Berowra,"Attorney-General) (11.59 am)-I did hear earlier the remarksserved, and I am sure members of the opposition do not think they are deserved, but I value his role as a constructive barracker and appreciate the spirit in which the remarks were offered. The Customs Tariff Amendment (Commonwealth Games) Bill 2005 is an important measure, and I am glad that it is being supported. Obviously, the amendments to the Customs Tariff Act to provide duty-free entry for goods for use in, or for purposes related to, the Melbourne Commonwealth Games will be an important adjunct to the success of the games. The goods will include giveaways and hospitality samples. Concessions will not apply to alcohol and tobacco products or extend to importations of a commercial nature. The existing provisions under the customs legislation relating to personal effects and temporary importations will also be available for the purposes relating to the games. I would have thought the opportunities to speak on this legislation would have been fairly limited, but I am told that the member for Lowe was able to range quite widely on customs matters generally. I should just take the opportunity to say in relation to his comments about the extent to which containers are examined in Australia that I am surprised, given the spirit in which this bill is being considered and because of the security situation, that he would not have acknowledged that container examination issues are taken very seriously by this government. The inspection of containers in Australia compares very favourably with the quantum and percentages that are effected in the United States and in Canada. Very extensive container examination facilities have been installed in Sydney, Brisbane, Melbourne, Adelaide and Fremantle. In addition, I am told that the customs container examination process is among the world’s best in volume, speed, cost and system capability and that more than 98 per cent of containers are back at the wharf within the free storage period. So it is a good news story, and that ought to be appreciated. From time to time issues are raised in relation to customs matters. The member for Lowe wanted to raise a matter which is before the courts. I imagine that, if there were relevant issues that ought to be put, it would be more appropriate to have approached the Comptroller of Customs and his officers to put a view. He could have done that. I am advised that on this issue the Australian Government Solicitor and Customs are aware of the matter. The case does raise quite complex issues. I understand that the presiding judge commented on the lack of alternatives to the outcome in this case, which has arisen only recently. My colleague the Minister for Justice and Customs will be briefed on the issues raised and the government will consider whether changes to the law are required. I do not know that it needed to take up the full amount of time that it did. I would prefer in a matter of this sort that the bill proceeds expeditiously. I am grateful for the support that has been given for the bill’s passage, and I commend the bill to the chamber. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Ordered that this bill be reported to the House without amendment. MAIN COMMITTEE Employment, Workplace Relations and Workforce Participation Committee Report Debate resumed from 17 August, on motion by Mr Barresi: That the House take note of the report. ing Committee on Employment, Workplace Relations and Workforce Participation report Making it work was adjourned I mentioned that these concerns are the very concerns that the Transport Workers Union made so clear during its campaign to heighten awareness of the plight of independent contractors that has prompted action on my part. In an effort to put a set of rules in place that will allow independent contractors a fair go at negotiating fair agreement with large organisations, the member for Hunter and I have co-sponsored a private member’s bill that will amend the Trade Practices Act to allow small businesses to access collective bargaining. Just because independent contractors are treated like business operators does not mean they carry with them all the clout that would ordinarily be associated with a business operator. It is important that the Trade Practices Act reflects this. Already this year we have had amendments to the Trade Practices Act that do nothing but exacerbate the problem that people like the transport workers I met in Canberra are currently experiencing. Their right to have a union collectively bargain with large companies on their behalf has been removed under the guise of reform. This government says that these workers-and at the end of the day they are workers, not necessarily just business operators-have the right to negotiate, but bear in mind that many are often forced to negotiate with the large and sometimes internationally based organisations for whom they work. It is like asking a goldfish to negotiate with a shark and expecting that the goldfish will have a fair chance of not being eaten. It is a ridiculous expectationone that everyone knows is well beyond reality-which contractors such as these transport workers and other independent contractors face on a daily basis. The private member’s bill that I co-sponsored seeks to rebalance the process by allowing small business operators to collectively bargain. I know that members opposite may claim that the recent decision of the ACCC means that in truth it is still permissible, but these are exceptions rather than any general rule. The private member’s bill seeks to strengthen the bargaining position of small businesses by allowing them to get together to bargain as a collective without the cumbersome, time-consuming and inefficient authorisation processes that currently exist through the ACCC. This is the sort of thing that, quite frankly, small businesses want. This is the sort of thing that would help them out immediately, and it would certainly be a greater weight off their minds than whether or not they can unfairly sack somebody without repercussions. I congratulate the Labor members of the committee for their dissenting report, but I also congratulate all members of the committee on the amount of common ground that was found. I look forward to the government taking these matters seriously by adopting a number of the recommendations that were agreed to. Dr EMERSON (Rankin) (12.08 pm)-I indicate my support for the private member’s bill that the members for Hunter and Werriwa are moving. It is soundly based in practical terms MAIN COMMITTEE",181,Customs Tariff Amendment Commonwealth Games Bill 2005
347,Mr Hayes (Werriwa) (12.04 Pm),"Before debate on the House of Representatives Standand philosophically because it is based on our assertion of the right of all working Australians to be able to bargain collectively. We certainly know that independent contractors in the transport industry are very hard working Australians. The irony, of course, is that the government is amending the Trade Practices Act to allow small businesses that supply products to large businesses-most particularly small firms supplying, for example, large retail chains-to bargain collectively. It seems to me that, if it is good for the government to do that in relation to suppliers to large retailers, surely it is similarly important and right that workers in the transport industry have the same basic right. It astonishes me that, day after day, week after week and year after year, the government claims that every Australian has the right to bargain collectively. This is just untrue. It has been untrue since 1996. Yet the former industrial relations minister, now the Minister for Health and Ageing, told a Vietnamese worker who was locked out in the Morris McMahon dispute that, if they wanted a collective agreement, they had every right to ask for it. What he did not say is that the employer has every right to refuse it. That is the truth of the matter. Those working Australians who seek to bargain collectively and who seek a collective agreement have nothing more than a right to ask the employer to agree to that. The employer, under that legislation, has a right to say no. I say that a right vetoed is no right at all. I will not speak for long on this committee report entitled Making it work. I do want to commend the member for Gorton, the Deputy Chair of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Workplace Relations and Workforce Participation. The main report is of very substantial value, I must say; the dissenting report, even more so. Point 1.3 says: It was accepted by all Committee members that there were genuine independent contractorsand we all accept thatbut an inordinate amount of evidence suggested that many workers were being forced to work as so called independent contractors in order to avoid taxation or traditional employer responsibilities, such as superannuation contributions or workers’ compensation insurance. This is just another case in this industry of the government using the tax system-using whatever it possibly can-to encourage people to set themselves up as independent contractors where, in many cases, they are not. A lot of revenue is being forgone as a result of that, but so obsessed is this government with busting unions and busting collective arrangements that it is prepared to allow the taxpayer to bear the burden of that. I commend the member for Gorton, and I commend this report. with some very important matters. I would like to add some brief remarks to those that have been made by the member for Rankin and the member for Werriwa. This is a matter of growing importance in our economy, with a growing incidence of independent contractors and labour hire employees. One of the great questions is how this phenomenon is being driven. Is it being driven by individual contractors seeking increased flexibility in their working lives and in their business arrangements and therefore incorporating themselves and seeking to work as contractors? Alternatively, is it being driven by companies seeking increased flexibility from their employees, asking that they incorporate themselves and therefore changing the employment relationship so that these people are no longer technically employees although they are, MAIN COMMITTEE",183,Committees
348,Mr Bowen (Prospect) (12.12 Pm),"Making it work is an important report which dealsof course, employees in the real world? Both elements are at play here. This happens both ways. One of the big questions is: what is the overriding factor? I have to say that the majority report is disappointing in that it does not make a more satisfactory distinction between genuine independent contractors who deserve support in their arrangements and what are in effect labour hire or contracting arrangements which are driven by the employer to gain more flexibility from the employee in a way which is not necessarily to the employee’s benefit. This report does make some useful recommendations in relation to people who are genuine independent contractors. This is a growing sector of the economy, and we need to do everything we can to support these people. In particular, I refer to recommendation 13, which calls on the Office of Small Business to develop more resources to support independent contractors in ‘setting up a small business, financial and reporting requirements, dispute resolution options and business management practices’. As I say, I think the biggest inadequacy in the majority report is its failure to deal in any meaningful way with problems facing labour hire employees, many of whom only work in such circumstances because it is the only form of employment available to them. Working for a labour hire company can be a very precarious existence. Between 75 and 95 per cent of labour hire workers are casually employed. Of course, this means that they can have very irregular hours of work, no sick leave and no annual leave. Some would say they get a higher hourly rate. Sometimes that is true and sometimes it is not. The minority report makes a very interesting recommendation in relation to the registration of labour hire companies. The report notes: The Committee received evidence from labour hire companies and unions suggesting the need to register labour hire companies. It was contended that many labour hire companies were not competent to be legally recognised as labour hire companies and therefore it was considered that a register be established to ensure that business conducted by labour hire companies meet an appropriate industry standard. The most interesting thing out of that is that some of those submissions were made by labour hire companies themselves. I dare suggest that the labour hire companies that made those recommendations to the committee are the genuine ones that are sick of their good name being sullied by the operators out there who exploit their workers and give the other labour companies a bad name. I am not saying that all labour hire companies are a bad thing. Employment by a labour hire company suits some people. There is no doubt about that. But some labour hire companies are exploiting their employees, and the more reputable labour hire companies are sick and tired of their good name being sullied. So they, together with trade unions, have suggested that a register of labour hire companies be established. That is a recommendation taken up by the minority on this committee but not, alas, by the majority. I do not think that the majority report deals anywhere near adequately with that issue. The Victorian parliament’s Economic Development Committee found that one quarter of Victorian businesses use labour hire companies and three per cent of Australian employees are employed by labour hire companies. So this is an important matter. Of course, we have seen growing flexibility in the Australian labour market over the last few years, and that is not a bad thing; it is a very good thing. But we need to ensure that labour hire companies operate in such a manner that the rights and conditions of their employees are protected. MAIN COMMITTEE In relation to independent contractors, I referred earlier to the matter of whether an independent contractor makes the move to that form of employment for reasons to do with the flexibility of the employer or of the employee. I was drawn to the submission to the inquiry from the Transport Workers Union which talked about the degree of practical independence of most independent contractors in the transport industry. Of course the transport industry is dominated by owner-drivers or, to use another form of words, independent contractors. The Transport Workers Union pointed out that the degree of independence enjoyed by most owner-operators in the day-to-day exercise of their business is minimal, to say the least. They said, for example, that most owner-drivers-in fact, they say almost all, without exceptionperform work for a single transport operator. They perform work at the behest of that operator, in accordance with very specific priorities including specific delivery pick-up priorities set by the directors and management of that operator. They are usually required to hold themselves available to perform work for a single contractor, thus rendering them unavailable for anyone else. They take direction from that operator on a day-to-day basis, as if they were employees of the operator. They are required to paint or otherwise mark their vehicles in their operator’s colours and/or insignia and they have little or no power to set the price-rather, they take the price they are given. In other words, anybody seeing a truck or a van drive past with the colours or logo of a courier company-or some other sort of transport operator delivering goods on behalf of that operator-would, if they thought about it, quite fairly assume that the individual driving that truck or courier van was an employee of the company. In the vast majority of cases they are not an employee; they are independent contractors who happen to work for only that company and are required by that company to work for only that company. They work a roster set by that company, their days and hours of work are determined solely by that company and they have a payment rate set by that company. They do not negotiate with the employer, the parent company, and say, ‘Here’s how much we’ll deliver your parcels for.’ The rate is set by the company and all the contractors get paid exactly the same rate. There are no independent negotiations. There is no force of supply and demand to say, ‘HereI am, an extra-flexible individual who is able to work for a transport company and I will do it as an independent contractor.’ They are in effect, if not in law, employees of that company, of course. This brings me to representation. There are 12,000 Transport Workers Union members in New South Wales who are independent contractors. They, like many people in many other industries, like to be represented in negotiations. If they were employees, despite the government’s proposed workplace relations changes, they could of course be represented by their trade union. Until recently as independent contractors they could be represented by their trade union, but this government is taking that right away. The only possible explanation for that is ideology. There is no explanation in terms of rational policy, there is no explanation in terms of rational economic thought; there is an explanation in terms of ideology. This committee received evidence regarding the actions of the government in limiting the right of independent contractors to engage a trade union to bargain on their behalf. The government is fine with independent contractors being represented by bodies such as the Pharmacy Guild or the various players associations across the country-the cricket players’ association, the football players’ association. That is not prohibited by law, but this government is opposing the right of these people to be represented by a group which happens to MAIN COMMITTEE be a trade union. We hear often that this government is in favour of choice, unless you are an independent contractor who wishes to be represented by a trade union. In that case you have no choice. Recently, together with other honourable members-the honourable member for Werriwa might have been there-I attended a seminar in Parliament House put on by the Transport Workers Union where independent contractors talked about how they would like their trade union to represent them. To their credit, some government members came and listened. I know the members for O’Connor and Gilmore were there. They heard the cases put by the independent contractors who said, ‘We work very hard, we need somebody to stand up for us and we choose the Transport Workers Union.’ Nobody could fail to be moved by some of those cases. These people work very long hours for rates of pay which are not high by any standard. They are simply seeking to have somebody represent them in their negotiations. What is wrong with an independent contractor choosing a body which also represents employees to represent them in negotiations over contracts? This government has refused that to happen. One of the most moving speeches at that seminar was, I thought, from the wife of an independent contractor who told the audience that she already rarely sees her husband. She does the bookwork for the operation and on a day-today basis they are trying to make their small business work. They wanted to get into small business and they are happy to do that; all they want is a bit of help in negotiations, some support from their union. I do not think that is an unreasonable request but apparently the government thinks it is an unreasonable request and that is a sad thing. Moving on, the committee makes some useful recommendations in the field of occupational health and safety, such as recommendation 7, which suggests that the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations and the Workplace Relations Ministers Council develop initiatives to achieve greater understanding and that they more clearly delineate responsibilities among various governments for occupational health and safety for independent contractors-and, of course, amongst various agencies within the government. I support that recommendation. Occupational health and safety is a very important factor for everybody, including independent contractors. In conclusion, this is an important report but it is a disappointing report in many respects. The majority report does not make an adequate distinction between genuine independent contractors, small business people who want to make a contribution to the economy and people who feel that, simply to make a living, they are being forced into incorporating small business and into becoming independent contractors. I would regard labour hire employees as a completely separate category. These employees might pack shelves, work on the wharves or carry out a whole range of manual work. They are not independent contractors in any meaningful sense of the word. They are casual employees who can only get jobs at labour hire firms. They work long hours and do not get great rates of pay to compensate them for the loss of sick pay, holiday pay et cetera. They are not independent contractors in any meaningful sense of the words. I think the majority report could have dealt with the issue of labour hire employees much better and made much better recommendations on support and protection for genuine labour hire workers. Debate (on motion by Mr Neville) adjourned. MAIN COMMITTEE Debate resumed from 18 August, on motion by Mr Howard: That this House: (1) notes that 15 August 2005 (VP Day) marks 60 years since the Japanese surrender which ended World War II; (2) recalls with profound gratitude the heroic achievements and sacrifices of those Australians who served in the defence forces during the war, as well as those who contributed on the civilian front; (3) particularly remembers the thousands of Australians who lost their lives or were wounded in the conflict, and especially recalls the suffering of so many Australians taken as prisoners of war; (4) whilst never forgetting those who suffered during World War II, acknowledges the strength and importance of the post World War II relationship between Australia and Japan; and (5) resolves that Australia’s efforts should always be directed to ensuring that a conflict of that magnitude never occurs again. moment for Australia as a nation and also for Australians as a people. Japan’s surrender to the allied forces did not only mark the end of World War II; it also heralded a new era for Australia. It saw an era too where we were reconciled with the Japanese nation, which has gone on to be our greatest trading partner since. That having been said, it was a very testing time for this country. We were a young, vibrant nation. We had faced and overcome enemy attacks on our own soil. For the first time in our history mainland Australia was bombed by enemy forces. Shipping was attacked by midget submarines in Sydney Harbour, Townsville was bombed and, of course, there were the infamous raids on Darwin, and there were raids right across Northern Australia-80 of them in all. Our people faced the prospect, though we did not know it at the time, of a possible invasion through Papua New Guinea. It was a time of great uncertainty and fear. We are geographically isolated, with a huge border to secure and a very small population. As I said, Australia was a young nation, and it certainly faced its biggest threat. At the start of the Pacific war we were barely 40 years old as a nation, and we were about to be bloodied for the second time in 27 years-or, if you want to go back to 1939, when World War II started, we were going to be bloodied for the second time in 25 years. If it had not been for the heroic and sustained fighting that took place throughout the Pacific-including on the Malay Peninsula; in Singapore; in Timor; on the Kokoda Track; at the Battle of the Coral Sea; later, with our American colleagues, at the Battle of Midway; in the Solomons; on Savo Island; at Milne Bay; and, later in the war, during the trek back towards Borneo-it is probably fair to say that we would have faced a very uncertain future. At Milne Bay, the Japanese were defeated on land for the first time in generations. That was an important moment not just for Australia but also for America and for all the allied forces, both those in the Pacific and those in Europe. Australian troops had already earned respect throughout the world in various theatres of war. We do not have to dwell on them, but we remember such things as the Battle of Britain and the North African war, in which Australians distinguished themselves at places such as Tobruk. Of course those who supported the war effort were not just those who served in uniform; many served at home in semimilitary capacities, in, for instance, the Women’s Land Army and the Civil Construction Corps.

349,Mr Neville (Hinkler) (12.27 Pm),"Mr Deputy Speaker, 15 August 1945 was a seminalvolunteered to serve in the Red Cross, CUSA and several other organisations. They played their part in making the war effort a significant one. At the end of World War II, Australia’s population stood at only seven million. Throughout the course of the war one million Australians saw some sort of war service. When you think about it, one in every seven Australians seeing some form of service is quite a remarkable effort. Thirty thousand of the brave Australian soldiers who served in World War II ended up as prisoners and some suffered unimaginable hardship in places like Changi and on the Burma railway and the Sandakan death march. Another 40,000 troops were killed in fighting. In the Pacific alone-and that is what really resonates with us as Australians-more than 9,000 Australians were killed, 8,000 were taken prisoner and 14,000 were wounded or injured. That was quite remarkable for a young nation. Believe it or not, I still have recollections of World War II. I was a very small child, but I can remember my father picking up troops hitchhiking along the road. I can remember the shopkeepers snipping the little tickets from the ration cards. I can remember the black cardboard that we used to have to put on our windows. I can remember some cars with various forms of carbon burners on the back to extend the life of petrol. I can remember the day the war ended. My parents and next-door neighbours partied right through the night and we walked home across the paddock between the two properties as the sun was coming up. During that party we went down to pick up someone from the movies-or ‘the pictures’ as they were called then-and people were walking around the streets painting ‘VP’ in whitewash on the windows. Those images come flooding back. It must have been a very trying time, especially in the period from late 1941-around the time of Pearl Harbour and what happened immediately afterwards down the Malay Peninsula-through to September 1942. That was the period of greatest peril. When you think about what happened in that period, Australia really was in danger. We thought the Battle of the Coral Sea was the invasion fleet coming for Australia-in fact, it was aimed at taking Port Moresby. Nevertheless, that was a great turning point, as was the Battle of Milne Bay, which I referred to earlier, and subsequently the Americans engaging the Japanese at Midway. Of course the war did not finish in September 1942. It was a long, relentless grind for the next three years. We saw some dreadful things happen: the sinking of the Centaur, the machine gunning of Australian nurses and, as I referred to before, things like the Sandakan death march. The first Australians who went into battle in the Pacific theatre, believe it or not, were the RAAF. They undertook bombing along the coast of Malaysia, particularly aimed at Japanese shipping. Their first contact was at a place called Kota Baru, along the Malay Peninsula. From then, right through until the campaigns in Borneo at the end of the war, Australians were continuously serving somewhere in the Pacific. It brings a whole flood of memories back to many people and it causes us to reflect on some of the values-the fortitude, the strength, the sacrifice and the bravery-of the troops and of citizens who contributed to the victory. Those emotions shine through when you have these presentations of medals. I was quite surprised at the depth of emotion that was still evident in the people who received those medals. A lot of them had many service medals and I thought that for many of them this would be just another medal but, no, it was a very moving return for many of them to 60 years ago. Those same people lived through the horror of losing family members and friends, particularly the war widows, and that was also a very moving MAIN COMMITTEE experience. Some people never quite got over that-as, I suspect, some people will never quite get over the horrors of the two Bali bombings we are commemorating today, because that is not someone dying of sickness or slowly fading away; that is sharp, brutal and indiscriminate. When the war did end, as I said, people were going around the streets putting ‘VP’ on the windows and waving flags. Then there were the tickertape parades, and I suppose the most iconic symbol of that time was the dancing man with the hat in the air in front of the tram in Sydney, which has now been captured, I noticed the other day, on the dollar coin. So, 60 years on, those sorts of images still resonate with us. As the euphoria faded away, Australians marked the end of the war with services and family gatherings celebrating peace and remembering the dead. There were some for whom the war did not end quite then. There was one group I will always admire. They were the guys who were brought in to disarm ordnance in about 1944, and they continued to do that right through until 1947. I used to get very angry that some of them did not get active service recognition. People told them: ‘You never faced the enemy. You were never in mortal danger.’ Good God! They had to take the plates off encrusted sea mines and dig out unstable landmines and the like, and with any trip, any slip of the spanner or the screwdriver, they could have been blown to kingdom come. So the war did not end for them or for many who went to Japan with the occupation forces. They fulfilled a role of what I suppose we could say was the start of the rebuilding of Japan and reconciliation with that country. I think the best way we can honour Australians who served in the Second World War is to remember why they had to fight for their country and to learn the harsh lessons of history. We must also remember that freedom carries a high price. It is not guaranteed and it must be vigilantly defended by each generation, sometimes in different ways. As we have celebrated this morning, and even in a bill that we discussed just a few minutes earlier, we have to be prepared to face new dangers in different modes. Had World War II ended differently we would not have the privileges we enjoy today. Now more than ever Australians must remember the service and sacrifice of previous generations and honour the contribution that many brave people made to this nation. electorate did not cease with the conclusion of services on Sunday, 14 August. The following Monday, in fact, I had the opportunity to present commemorative medals to a number of veterans. In a special ceremony attended by members of veterans’ families, and representatives indeed of the Ingleburn RSL, I had the opportunity to present medals to, spend time with and listen to the recollections of a number of World War II veterans-and listening to them from very much a different perspective. I was struck by the sheer determination that those who lived through the war expressed when they spoke about it. Deep within each of them. I could sense the fierce determination that was clearly so central to each of them making it through those hard times. Each of them had a story to tell-an act of bravery or of sacrifice-but they felt it was nothing more than anyone else was doing under those same situations. These are brave people who faced war up close and personal. The experience was nothing like the view through the remote camera lens that we tend to view conflict through today. Those who survived the war, and, tragically, those who did not, saw the war directly, sometimes with the enemy not more than a few metres in front of them. But each of them, in their MAIN COMMITTEE",188,Victory In The Pacific
350,Mr Hayes (Werriwa) (12.40 Pm),"by leave-The commemorations of VP Day in my own way, is quite humble about their contribution. While they might not think that their individual contributions were significant or anything particularly special, that is certainly not the case. While they might play down their contribution, I was more than pleased on that day to be in a position to make sure that it received fitting tribute. I was pleased to be able to share the day with them, to learn more of their experiences, to share in their stories and, quite frankly, to pay tribute to them. Much is made of the celebrations surrounding ANZAC Day each year, and rightly so, but it is also very important that all Australians had the opportunity to reflect on what is probably an equally significant day in Australia’s war history. It is worth recalling the words of the then Prime Minister, Ben Chifley, some 60 years ago, when he said: Let us remember those whose lives were given that we may enjoy this glorious moment and may we look forward to a perch which they have won for us ... Let us remember those whose thoughts, with proud sorrow, turn towards gallant loved ones who will not come back. Nothing can fully repay the debt we owe them, nor can history record in adequate terms their deeds ... The ceremonies that took place over that weekend in August, not just in my electorate at Ingleburn but throughout the country, were a fitting time to reflect on the achievements and sacrifices of Australians who served in the defence of our nation. The ceremonies not only were a means to mark an important anniversary of a country coming to age but were reflective of the ongoing debt of gratitude that today’s Australians have to Australians of that generation. The number of veterans may be dwindling, but I am sure that the memory of their contribution to our country will always be remembered-and I put that very clearly. Lest we forget. Sitting suspended from 12.45 pm to 4.01 pm Ms LIVERMORE (Capricornia) (4.01 pm)-Today in the Main Committee I would like to join with other members of the House in speaking on the 60th anniversary of the end of World War II. This is particularly an opportunity to commemorate Victory in the Pacific, which marked such an important point in Australia’s history, and one to which many brave and patriotic people from my electorate contributed. I wish particularly to refer to the battle honours of the second 42nd infantry battalion and, of course, to the men from all over Central Queensland who came together and formed this famous battalion. I could not speak about the 42nd without acknowledging the original 42nd Battalion, which was formed in 1915 and saw action during the First World War in France. During these actions the men of the first 42nd won 152 decorations for valour. It was on 23 September 1939 that Lieutenant Colonel JEG Martin received authority for the enlistment of recruits for a special expeditionary force. The area from which the troops were to be drawn was from Gladstone to Mackay in Central Queensland. Once formed, the 42nd Battalion was ordered into camp at Yeppoon on 4 October 1939. In September 1940 men aged 20, 22, 23 and 24 years went into camp, and the local newspapers announced that the Pacific was teetering on the brink of war. It was a Saturday afternoon when news of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor came through to the 42nd Battalion camp at Yeppoon, and most of the troops were on leave. To those who remained in camp over the weekend fell the huge job of transforming the camp to a war footing. For example, the rows of orderly tents had to be struck and moved into a dispersed pattern some distance apart and, where possible, under trees. Antiaircraft pits were MAIN COMMITTEE manned on picturesque Wreck Point and an observation group was stationed on North Keppel Island, just off the Central Queensland coast. That Christmas, one day’s leave was granted, and it was the last Christmas dinner most of the troops were to eat at home for many years. In March 1942 the battalion struck camp at Yeppoon and moved to join other battalions at Tiaro near Maryborough to form the 29th Brigade. Parents, wives, families and sweethearts were left behind and there was no way of knowing when or if they would be reunited. From all reports, though, spirits were still high amongst the men while they were stationed at Tiaro. As is the way of young men from Central Queensland, the 20 miles to Maryborough was not far enough to keep them away, even though there was no transport because leave to Maryborough was not permitted. Nonetheless, many a young lad was seen hitchhiking, and on one occasion 60 men sat astride one log on the back of a truck into town. It was on one of these visits that the so-called battle of Maryborough took place. Some well-known Central Queensland footballers were said to have featured in this incident and the story of the altercation between them and the locals at a downtown cafe was the main topic of conversation amongst the troops for some time. Later that year, however, the battalion moved to Townsville before they finally embarked on the Duntroon and Taroona in January 1943 and sailed to New Guinea. The men of Central Queensland were off to war. War is rightly denounced as a savage and loathsome exercise. Under its inescapable demands, men are plucked rudely from an ordered, sheltered life and thrust into unfamiliar and often horrific surroundings. However, this war did present some compensating features, for its harshness and crudity brought out those qualities of grit, comradeship and quiet heroism for which this World War II generation of Australians is so renowned. It is quite remarkable how few of these men resented the demands made of them when they finally returned to our country. Rather, there was a desire to perpetuate the comradeship and to honour the memories of fallen mates by returning to Australia and working to make it a strong and prosperous country-and one that we are lucky to live in today. I am very proud to continue today to give voice to those desires of the men from Central Queensland who gave so much. I wish here today to perpetuate their memories and the esprit de corps of the 42nd, which was to stand them in such good stead throughout their long and bloody New Guinea campaigns. The first battalion of the 29th Infantry Brigade to make contact with the enemy was the 42nd Battalion. This was on 13 August 1943, when patrols from B Company ventured into enemy territory on the slopes of Mount Tambu and were fired upon. They returned the fire and were very satisfied with being acknowledged as the first of the battalion to see action. But the battalion’s baptism of fire occurred a few days later, on 16 August. The fight started at 9.30 in the morning and lasted for an hour and a half. I want to recount that action to the House as it is recorded in the history of the 42nd Battalion. A patrol from B Company came under enemy fire. Hanging onto his stuttering Bren gun, George Eddlestone caused screams and wails of the most hideous kind to emerge from the enemy pits as he spluttered them with .303 bullets. Regardless of the risk he was running, Eddlestone kept his gun blazing. Bullets whined over his head and chewed up the ground on each side of him and behind, but still the Bren gun kept firing. Then the Bren fell silent. Eddlestone rolled over, shot through the heart. Enraged by the killing, huge Bill Green stood his whole six foot three inches and yelled at the top of his voice: ‘Come out and fight! Come out MAIN COMMITTEE or I’m coming in to get you.’ No-one expected Green to carry out his threat; not until they saw him streak up the ridge towards the perimeter. The enemy was all around him, but he did not care. He swore and yelled at them at the top of his voice and all the time his Owen gun was pouring out a stream of bullets. Eventually he fell to a burst of light machine-gun fire. No man died more bravely than Bill Green. His action was an inspiration to the whole battalion and he is rightly remembered as one man who knew no fear. The men from Central Queensland were now out there fighting and dying together. The men of the 42nd Battalion went on to serve their country and their battle honours include New Guinea, Milne Bay, Buna, Salamaua, Lea and Bougainville. It is not possible to list here the names of every individual from Central Queensland who served but I must place on record that they were everywhere-in the Air Force and the Navy and other Army unitsand of course there were women serving as well. And let us not forget those who stayed at home and worked, waited and worried. But it was the 42nd Battalion that was Central Queensland’s own and its story is so much a part of the story of Central Queensland. To continue the story, as the war drew to its bloody conclusion the men of the 42nd were still there. On 25 July 1945 an A Company security patrol ran into a booby trap and Privates MH Davids, MJ Timbs and EJ Smith were killed. Then, sadly, on 28 July Private SW Craker of B Company was killed just days before the Americans dropped the first atomic bomb on Hiroshima, thereby ending the Second World War. The battle record of the 42nd Battalion deserves to be acknowledged. No prisoners from the battalion were taken by the Japanese. The bodies of all the battalion’s dead were recovered. Every wounded man was picked up by his comrades and taken back to safety. The 42nd Battalion never lost a battle and never failed to carry out its task. Its battle casualties were severe and exceeded casualties from illness. Individual decorations were numerous-in fact too numerous to mention here. The last entry in the battalion diary was made by PrivateJ Rickarts on 29 October 1945, when he recorded ‘C in C’s parade held’. For the men of Central Queensland the war was over. Everyone looked forward to the postwar world: to home, old friends and old surroundings. Some were home quickly while others were further delayed. Most soldiers were unprepared for civilian life and therefore it often did not supply all the contentment that had been expected. Many found it was not so easy to settle back into the old routine-or rather what was now the new routine. For some it was the noise of a plane that would bring back visions of a crowded troop train. They again felt the weight of a rifle, experienced the smell of a jungle track or felt the sting of a mosquito bite. For each one the return was different, but gradually the men of the 42nd Battalion settled down to make Central Queensland what it is today. A meeting was held on 14 March 1946 and the second 42nd Battalion Association was formed. Elected to that committee some 60 years ago was the association’s current secretary, Malcolm Barker. On 25 April, ANZAC Day, every year for the past 60 years, the people of Central Queensland have gathered to stand and say thank you to the men of their own 42nd Battalion as they march together again, each man wearing with great pride his own 1939 to 1945 star, Pacific Star, 1939 to 1945 war medal and 1939 to 1945 Australian Service Medal. The men of the 42nd are indeed welcome home. outstandingly good speech. It was a great contribution to this parliament and a moving memoMAIN COMMITTEE",190,Victory In The Pacific
351,Mr Hatton (Blaxland) (4.11 Pm),"I congratulate the member for Capricornia on anrial to the members of the 42nd from Central Queensland. We should do this more often. The 60th anniversary of Victory in the Pacific has allowed us two things that we have not had in the time that I have been in the parliament. Firstly, it has allowed a memorial exercise on the actual day, or days surrounding that, to be held in our electorates, with the government funding that to the tune of $10,000. Secondly, government funding for each electorate is expanded by the resources of the local community. I want to thank the members of my community who took part in that and so well supported it. We had our memorial on 21 August, a week after most of the other celebrations, so as not to get in the way of the official ceremonies for our RSL people who were involved and also because ours was centred on Bankstown Airport. It was organised by the Australian Aviation Museum at Bankstown in conjunction with the local RSLs. What they were able to do was bring together World War II aircraft, buses, trucks and Army vehicles. Indeed the aircraft were not only Australian; there was also a Japanese Zero and an American Mustang there. It was a very special thing and that is why we had it a week later. Barry Thompson and the incredible volunteers at the Aviation Museum at Bankstown did an extraordinary job in bringing together people from all over the city of Bankstown and possibly even further. More than 1,500 people went through the Aviation Museum at Bankstown on the day. I was there throughout the day and I made the centrepiece of the day the presentation of medallions to some of those people in the electorate who were eligible to receive them. SomeI still have to present to people because they came in a number of different batches. In fact, I have started to initiate today the presentation of the remainder of the medallions. I think the most appropriate thing is to present them on 11 November in conjunction with the Bankstown RSL at their memorial for those who fell at Gallipoli and to do it in such a way, if they are agreeable, as to have a twinning of World WarI and World War II-a remembrance of those who fought and died in Europe and, in particular, in this case, in the Pacific to save Australia. There are those who argue now that there was never any intention whatsoever by the Japanese to invade Australia-that they had no plans, that they made no effort, that the Brisbane Line was unnecessary and that we just got a bit upset and shaken about because a few Japanese submarines came into Sydney Harbour and there was a bit of an attack on Darwin. They argue that those troops who were in Papua New Guinea, on both sides of the current border, and those troops who came down through the Kokoda Trail had no intention of ever moving into Australia-they were just going to park themselves in Papua New Guinea and Irian Jaya and not do anything in relation to Australia at all. There are some significant historians who argue that-that there was no further intent. I think the only thing that would have stopped the Japanese during World War II from going any further was the fact that this is such a massive continent and they would have had the question of supply lines and also of what their major strategic objectives were. I have very little doubt, based on the historical evidence I have seen and based on what I have heard from my family and from the people who fought in that war, what they thought the intent of the Japanese was, because we took them on in the Pacific. The Prime Minister at the time, Mr Curtin, who was entirely against conscription during the First World War, not only saw the necessity, given Australia’s danger, to embrace the conscription of Australians during the Second World War-because the very survival of the naMAIN COMMITTEE tion depended on it-but also had to break the fundamental military ties with the United Kingdom because Mr Churchill, as Prime Minister, demanded that Australian troops go to the Middle East and fight, as we had fought in the Middle East, in France and in the Low Countries during the First World War, acting under imperial government orders. We went to war in World War II under imperial government orders. Australia did not take advantage of the fact that, as a result of the Balfour Declaration, Australia could have signed up to the Statute of Westminster in 1932 and would not have been at war automatically. What did the conservative governments at the time do? Absolutely nothing, and we were automatically at war in World War II as part of the British Empire, as we were automatically at war in World War I. Curtin made a fundamental decision. Faced with the extremity that Australia found itself in-faced with the collapse of Singapore, the British bastion in the Asia-Pacific area, and faced with what he found in the Battle of the Coral Sea where the Americans were brutally brought into the war by the attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941, after confronting the Japanese and their heavy march not only through the islands of Asia, the Pacific islands and the archipelagos of Asia but also through Burma and on the march through into India-Curtin made a fundamental decision that he would ensure that Australian troops were here to guard and protect Australia and to fight in the Pacific to ensure our national safety. This is the fundamental linchpin of all future Australian policy. It broke our link with the past, with Britain, and it fundamentally reordered Australian foreign policy on a completely new basis. It is the foundation of our relationship with the United States, forged in the Battle of the Coral Sea, and it is the foundation of modern Australian policy and of an independent Australian foreign policy directed by Australians to the protection of Australians. That was necessary if you look at the conjunction between World WarI and World War II. World War I, which is commemorated in Australia every year and is commemorated through ANZAC Day and also through November 11, is one part of the picture, but a far bigger picture for Australia is what happened during the Second World War and the impact that total war had on every Australian citizen at home and abroad. But that war was made during the First World War. The First World War saw the total destructions of the great empires of the past. It saw the breaking up of the Austro-Hungarian Empire; it saw the effective destruction of the British Empire, but people just did not realise it until World War II happened; and it saw a Japan become one of three countries on the rise politically, economically and militarily from 1870 on. Modern Germany was forged under Bismarck’s ‘blood and iron’ policy and its ability to train its people scientifically and to build its chemical, rubber and steel industries. Similarly, the United States, from 1870 on after the American Civil War, constructed an entirely new, modernised economy. Modern Japan was the third part of that. From 1870 to 1900, Emperor Meiji forged a new Japan by copying Western models, copying the United States and Germany. During the First World War, that new Japan was an ally of the United States, Great Britain and Australia. What went wrong? Why did we end up fighting a militaristic, fascist Japan during the Second World War? Essentially, not only did you have the complete destruction of those old empires but in their place in 1919 the Treaty of Versailles. Woodrow Wilson, an isolationist American President, joined with Clemenceau, Churchill and others to construct the world on the basis of small beginnings, of small, so-called democratic states-in some cases, real democratic states; in others, an attempt to be democratic states. One of the countries created in 1924 was IraqMAIN COMMITTEE and we know what problems we are in now when we get to the dissolution of one of the countries that was created after the fashion of the times. The creation of Czechoslovakia, the Sudetenland and myriad other small countries was an attempt to break up all of those empires and parcel them into small, democratic states but with a League of Nations that had no power to actually enforce peace within the world. What was seen in 1921 at the Washington Naval Conference was a determination that the United States and Britain, as the leading maritime powers in the world, should have a particular ratio that advantaged them vis-a-vis Japan. Japan got the message. They were told that, as an Asian power, they could not hope to come to pre-eminence in the Asia-Pacific region. They turned from allies of ours into a country that became dominated by militarists, who saw the future as a grab for power against the domination of the Pacific by the United States. They constructed their whole policy on speed of attack, which they demonstrated against the US in the attack on Pearl Harbor. Their approach in the Pacific was similar to the Blitzkrieg approach the Germans had developed-surprise, speed and devastating power. The Japanese moved very quickly through what they saw as the corrupted British, Dutch and French empires of the Asia-Pacific region and supplanted them extremely quickly. They then moved towards Australia with great haste and established themselves in Papua New Guinea and what is now Irian Jaya, then part of the Dutch empire. They were on a launching platform to either isolate Australia or, given what they did in Darwin-though they did not tell us during the war-make the first inroads to literally invading Australia. The men and women of Australia found themselves embroiled in a war that they did not ask for and found themselves automatically part of the British Empire effort again. Out of a population of four million in the First World War, 800,000 Australian soldiers signed up and 60,000 lost their lives. The population had increased to only about seven million, I think, by the time of the Second World War. We had more than a million men at arms during the war, pledged to Australia’s defence. It became a literal defence of Australia. Apart from the brilliant work done by the 8th Battalion in the siege of Tobruk and the important work done in Operation Torch later, Australia’s fundamental area of operation was the Asia-Pacific as part of a combined force under the leadership of General MacArthur which attempted to take back the islands and the countries of the previous Western European imperial powers in the AsiaPacific region. They did that, firstly, by holding the line and winning the Battle of the Coral Sea and the Battle of Midway and, secondly, through might and main and sheer hard, brutal work in New Guinea and Irian Jaya, confronting the Japanese soldiers and beating them back. They did it through the work of people such as Brett Collins in my electorate, who was stationed in Irian Jaya in a malaria infested, dengue fever infested area, where the 6,000 Australian soldiers who were sent there were told afterwards, when they had survived, that the expectation was that they would last a very short period of time because there were more than 100,000 Japanese soldiers bearing down on them. They did that through people like Doug McNally, who was in a position where he had to go from island to island intercepting Japanese code material, getting it down, breaking it, translating it and feeding the information back to Australian forces, including those forces at Bankstown airport who plotted our defence in the Pacific. Not one single Australian individual either at home or overseas could escape the effects of this total war. It was the conditioning of the Depression generation in Australia. It is right, fitting MAIN COMMITTEE and just that we salute all of them for what they went through to defend us in extremity. (Time expired) Ms GEORGE (Throsby) (4.26 pm)-I am pleased to be able to use this time to make some comments on the motion moved in the House by the Prime Minister, marking the 60 years since the Japanese surrender at the end of World War II. It was a most significant event in our nation’s history, for it was the first time that Australia came under threat of a direct attack. Out of a small population of some seven million people, almost one million Australians were mobilised in the war effort, both directly and indirectly. But it went beyond that: indeed the whole country was geared to supporting Australia’s effort. It was at that time that thousands of women for the first time entered the paid work force, often in heavy industry in the jobs that were left vacant by men who went to serve their nation overseas. Many women worked in a vast range of supportive and essential roles, such as those in the Women’s Land Army. The 60th anniversary of the end of the war provided the opportunity to recall our profound gratitude for the heroic achievements and sacrifices of those Australians who served in the defence forces and Merchant Navy during the war and all those who contributed on the civilian front. My generation is indeed a blessed one. We were spared the loss of life and suffering that touched so many families of our parents’ generation. We should not fail to recognise that 40,000 Australians lost their lives in that war and that 8,000 prisoners of war died in horrific circumstances in places like Changi and on the notorious Sandakan marches. These memories help in our resolve to ensure that the world lives in peace and that a conflict of this magnitude never occurs again. We recall the 55 million people around the world who lost their lives. So too do we recall the dropping of the atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, graphically illustrating the destructive capacity of nuclear weapons and the dangers they pose for the survival of mankind. Much to our regret, our fears of the potential deadly force of nuclear weapons have more recently been reawakened. Many people do not realise how real the threat was to Australia. Lives were lost in Darwin, which felt the brunt of 60 or so air raids, as did other towns such as Broome in the north-west. Even Sydney Harbour was not spared, with the incursion of Japanese midget submarines and the loss of lives on the HMAS Kuttabul. What stood out for me in the commemoration in my electorate was the large number of young people who were very keen to participate and learn the lessons of history. It is much the same at every ANZAC Day service that I attend as well. In the time that I have available this afternoon I would like to take the opportunity to acknowledge the fine efforts of many people who worked on a voluntary basis in my electorate on that day to provide a fitting commemoration to mark the 60th anniversary of the end of the war. I begin by acknowledging the support of the federal government for a range of activities that we undertook and the financial assistance that was provided and the members of my staff who worked to ensure a very successful weekend of commemoration. The commemoration started on Saturday, 13 August, with the service march organised by the Port Kembla RSL subbranch. In particular, I thank Mr Ray Wetherall OAM, the president of that subbranch, and Angus Campbell, who took upon himself the coordination of the parade. And what a parade it was, with the Illawarra Pipe Band, the city brass band, the cadet units, the Light Horse troops and students from the local schools. MAIN COMMITTEE The main address on that day was delivered by Major General Brian Howard, who saw distinguished service in Vietnam. That evening the celebratory and commemorative atmosphere continued at a splendid dinner dance which involved many of our local community members. The next morning I was indeed honoured to present 65 commemorative medallions to World War II veterans, widows and widowers. Although it was disappointing that not all the medallions were processed in time for all the recipients to be granted their awards, those who were there on the morning were very pleased to have had their services acknowledged in a timely manner. On Monday, 15 August-VP Day-the morning began with the laying of wreaths at Shellharbour City. I participated along with the mayor and councillors of the Shellharbour local government area and representatives of all the local RSL subbranches. The Albion Park RSL subbranch organised an exhibition of ‘show and tell’ memorabilia from World War II. Local students were invited to Centenary Hall, and it was estimated that some 900 students passed through the exhibition on that day. It provided the ideal opportunity for surviving World War II service people and community members to meet and talk with our younger generation. I am sure that the interaction on that day helped lead to a better understanding of Australia’s role in the war. I place on the record my thanks to John Foran, President of Albion Park RSL, and Peter Ellis, Secretary of the Albion Park RSL, for this wonderful initiative. The commemorative events ended with a service on that day at the Warilla RSL subbranch. Their event involved representatives, again, of local schools and members of the Bass and Flinders Day Club. Each school was presented with a book for its library as a memento of the day. I thank President Keith Clemmett and Secretary Mary Clarke for their efforts in organising this event, which also displayed memorabilia from the era. You can see, Mr Deputy Speaker, from the acknowledgments I have made that indeed one of the highlights in the electorate for me as local federal member was the fact that we were able to garner that level of support, enthusiasm and activity to mark a very important day in our nation’s history. As I said earlier, I think what was really remarkable was the number of young people who were enthusiastically involved and who interacted with the older generation so that they, too, could appreciate the significance of those events in shaping our nation’s history and our identity. I also acknowledge the coverage that we received in the local media and, in particular, I want to conclude my comments by quoting some recollections of local veterans of VP Day, as reported in our local paper, the Illawarra Mercury. Former RAAF pilot Norman Gadsby, aged 82, recalled in his words that VP Day was indeed ‘worth a few sherbets’. He recalled: I was down in Melbourne when we got the news. We just went out and celebrated; it was an incredible day and a very long night. His wife, Joyce, was working at a building supplies store in Wollongong when word came through, and she recounted how people danced up and down the main street of Wollongong. Another recollection comes from George Shelton, aged 81. Steaming towards Japan on the British aircraft carrier HMS Indomitable was George-then a young man-who said that the jubilation he experienced, along with his mates, on the ship was tempered when he arrived in Hong Kong to be confronted with the horrors of Japanese prisoner of war camps. He said: MAIN COMMITTEE If you can imagine skeletons covered with skin-it was one of the worse days of my life. Noel Chapman, who served with the RAAF, reflected: These days have become important for the whole community, and in particular young people. That’s good because there’s not many of my mob left. In conclusion, I commend the Prime Minister for allowing members an opportunity to record their impressions, their thanks and their pleasure at the fact that their communities, through a wide range of activities across the nation, were able to come together and reflect on the significance of Australia’s involvement in the Second World War, the joy and some of the downsides of that experience, which really came to the fore on a weekend of great celebration and commemoration in the electorate of Throsby. in a personal and a national context. On ANZAC Day in 1949 I was almost five years old. At about half past four in the morning my mother woke me up. I think it was freezing cold. It was raining and it was windy. I very unwillingly went down with her to the train at the railway station at Largs North, where I lived, and caught the train to Adelaide. We walked to the Cross of Sacrifice and I attended my first dawn service, mesmerised-probably very confused-about what was going on. My mother, I could see, was very unhappy. I did not quite know how to deal with that. After the ceremony at the Cross of Sacrifice we walked down Pennington Terrace to North Terrace to the war memorial. In the war memorial in Adelaide you walk downstairs and all the names of the South Australians who died in the Great War and the Second World War are there. My mother went to the wall and rubbed her fingers along a series of names. She came to the last name, that of her brother, Reg Tuxford, who died in Corby in France in 1917. He was only a very young man. In fact, he lied to get into the Army. He was not allowed to join in South Australia, so he hitchhiked his way to Melbourne and did it from there. At that time my mother’s family had cousins-the Vincents and the Barnes. Not one of them who went to World WarI ever came home-not one. So a whole generation of relations of my mother were killed in World War I-all in France. My father’s family also served in France-every one of them came home alive and uninjured. In the Second World War my father’s family served in Tobruk, El Alamein and New Guinea, like many other families. Fortunately, they all came home, but some were very badly affected by their experiences in the Second World War. Each ANZAC Day went by and on one occasion, as I was sitting on the train, I remember a 10 shilling note being on the floor of the railway carriage. Enthusiastically-we were not very rich-I picked it up, gave it to mum and said, ‘Someone’s lost 10 shillings.’ She said, ‘You can have it.’ The next year it was a pound. The following year it was maybe another pound. When I was about 10, it was £10. That was half my parents’ wages. It took me all of that time to wake up to the fact that there was a guy who was always seated in the carriage who always lost money. It was perhaps his reward for my putting up with going to ANZAC Day. I continued to go to ANZAC Day and I continued to observe the characters of the generation who fought in the Second World War. There are three very special generations of Australians and South Australians. The first are the people who came to South Australia and founded the fledgling colony. They were brave, MAIN COMMITTEE",193,Victory In The Pacific
352,Mr Sawford (Port Adelaide) (4.36 Pm),"I would like to put my remarks this afternoongutsy people and we will never again see the like of those people in this country-or in the world. The second generation of very brave people were born in the period 1880 to 1910. Remember, at this time we thought the Russians were coming. To defend ourselves, we built forts along the coast of South Australia with great cannons. These people went through a worldwide depression in 1890 and the poverty right around the country in those days was appalling. In that context, there was a fellow called William Rooke Creswell, originally an Englishman, who came out to Australia to be the commander of the South Australian colonial ship the Protector, which fought in the Boxer Rebellion and served in World War I. I think it now forms a reef off the coast of Queensland, unfortunately. My Uncle Dave was the chief petty officer on the Protector-tough old cuss. William Rooke Creswell was a brilliant person. He became and is known as the father of the Royal Australian Navy. He became Sir William Rooke Creswell. Prior to 1910, all the Australian ships were part of the Commonwealth Naval Forces. He formed the Royal Australian Navy in 1910 and became a rear admiral. Interestingly, we have never adequately remembered him, and a lot of other people of that generation. Then comes the group who fought in World War II, the group we commemorate today. Remember they were children in the twenties, a time that was perhaps similar to today’s times when people lived the high life. Debt was huge. People were borrowing money on no collateral. Of course, the inevitable happened. When greed dominates economies, they go bust. So we had a depression and this generation lived through the Great Depression. In Adelaide thousands of people and their families were living in little shanties made of corrugated iron, cardboard and paper, living on the banks of the River Torrens. WhereI lived, people were living in the sandhills-not just one or two but hundreds of people. It was not a great time. Jobs were very difficult. In my grandparents’ house there were 14 men. Only two workedmy father and my grandfather-the other 12 were supported by that family. The bravest person who ever put on an Australian uniform was Thomas Currie Derrick, ‘Diver Derrick’, who grew up in Exmouth Road and Bucknall Road, Exeter, just around the corner from where I live. He could not get a job either. Like my father, he went up the River Murray in search of jobs: very poorly paid, with poor accommodation, but they got a feed. Diver Derrick came back and so did my father. My father was too old to serve in World War II and too ill, unfortunately, but Diver Derrick did. He served in El Alamein and got a DCM. He should have been awarded a VC, but he got a VC at Sattelberg in New Guinea. I will not go through his exploits but they are unbelievable. The Army tried to keep him out of the final days of World War II, but he wanted to be with his mates, and up in Borneo in the last days of World War II unfortunately he lost his life. We have not remembered him adequately in Port Adelaide either. There is a little street and a park, which I opened. He is regarded by all the military as the bravest person ever to put on an Australian uniform and we have not adequately remembered him. These people lived through tough times. Compare World War II with World War I-four years in the trenches blowing each other to smithereens, not gaining a yard. In World War II, Hitler was in Paris in six weeks. He was walking down the Champs Elysees six weeks after the invasion of Poland. It is almost amazing to say that they were in Paris in six weeks. Then, of course, there was the evacuation of the French and allied armies from Dunkirk. It was absolutely unbelievable, but it put the fear of God into everybody in the Western world. MAIN COMMITTEE We had the Battle of Britain, where many Australians served and lost their lives. There was El Alamein, Tobruk, Crete, Greece, the shock of Pearl Harbor, the bombing of Darwin, the bombing of Sydney, the fall of Singapore and the sinking of the Repulse and the Prince of Wales. My mother tells me that in the streets of Adelaide people were just petrified. Forget the historians who are trying to rewrite history; people believed that the invasion was only months away. The Philippines fell, MacArthur came to Australia and John Curtin made a plea to the United States of America. There was the Battle of the Coral Sea, the Battle of Midway and the Kokoda Trail, and here is a generation that survived all of that. They are now in their eighties and nineties. All of us have been to celebrations with these people. On the week before VP Day this year, I unveiled a plaque at the Port Adelaide Naval Association in memory of all the merchant seamen and Royal Australian Navy and Royal Navy personnel who lost their lives in World War II. On the 15th, I attended the Port Adelaide and Semaphore RSL to view a display of all the news clippings, souvenirs and memorabilia of World War II. It brings you back to earth. In many ways it is like going to a hospital and seeing someone fighting for their life. It puts your trivial worries, the worries that sometimes we blow out of proportion, into context. This is a generation that did other things too. After the war they participated in probably one of the greatest postwar reconstructions this country has ever seen. It happened under a Labor government. We have failed to replicate in any way that reconstruction of the late 1940s and early 1950s. But, more importantly, we also had a social contract on employment that the community fought for and both governments actually supported. In fact, it was a move around the world. I suppose it was the basis of the welfare state in the United Kingdom and of a different approach in the United States and Europe. It has not lasted long. There is a frightening and striking similarity between the signs in the 1920s of where a world got incredibly into debt and could not control it and the indicators of today, but that is for another day. In the next two weeks, like other members, I will be continuing to present Victory in the Pacific medallions to members of my community. I have been quite surprised: there have been about 1,900 in my electorate. Most people want them presented, and that has created a bit of a backlog for us. I think I have four presentations next week-one every morning! By the time you include friends and family it is a big function. Next week we will be based at the Port Adelaide and Semaphore RSL, assisted by Peter Davidson, the president, his committee and all his hard working members, who are putting on the lunch. AllI have to do is front up-I have the easy part-hand out the medallions, give a speech and thank everybody, and probably thank the younger versions of my parents’ generation for what they did. When I talked about the Port Adelaide Naval Association I forgot to thank Harley Doyle and his hard working executive for organising for me to unveil the plaque at the naval association. There is a bit of a sad touch to it all. One of my great supporters was Percy Lawrence, aged 86. On ANZAC Day and on Remembrance DayI used to have to share my time between Port Adelaide RSL and the Naval Association because of family connections. I could not be at both places at the same time, so when I could not be at the Naval Association, Gundi Lawrence, who was an old merchant navy person-he went into the Royal Australian Navy and served on the Wilcannia-would lay the wreath on my behalf. Unfortunately, Gundi recently passed away. He lived a rich life; he was a wonderful man. We remembered the matters of the victory MAIN COMMITTEE in the Pacific at his funeral, which was one almost bereft of grief. It was actually a celebration of this great man’s life. To Gundi and to Billie and the boys-Russell, Trevor, and Neville-I say thank you very much. (Time expired) Ms KING (Ballarat) (4.51 pm)-I was honoured and somewhat humbled to celebrate Victory in the Pacific Day in my electorate alongside local veterans. I would like to use this speech to personally thank all of the RSLs in my district for making this year’s VP Day celebrations both memorable and enjoyable. Commemorating 60 years since VP Day is a stark reminder that, without the sheer guts and determination shown by men and women of this country during World War II, I would not have the opportunity to stand in this place today. Growing up, I have always had an ardent interest in history and I know that 3 September 1939 was a day that the world will never forget. The battles fought during the Second World War defined the world in which we now live. It would be six years before Australia and the world were at peace. War with Japan was pivotal to the war effort, which brought the war to our very doorstep. World War II took Australians to virtually every corner of the world. Nearly one million men and women served in the armed services or merchant navy. From my own district, over 8,700 people who were born in Ballarat served in the Australian war effort-over 6,000 served in the Army; over 1,500 in the RAAF; 281 in the Royal Australian Navy; and nine in the merchant navy. We are not known for being surrounded by sea! Kim Beazley described the men and women who fought in the First and Second World Wars as ‘our toughest generation’ and he is absolutely right. Australians were involved in many conflicts, which took the lives of many of Australia’s finest citizens. They served on two fronts: at home and overseas. When we look at the history of the war and the efforts being made by Australians across all areas of battle, and when we reflect on the fact that Australia was one of the nations hit hardest by the Depression, it is an enormous tribute to the men and women of that generation that we rose out of that. During the war in the Pacific, we essentially defended and saved ourselves, and we emerged from that war a different nation and a very different people. There was no nation whose people were more mobilised than the Australian nation. In this country every man and woman was turned to by the government and those responsible for organising the war effort. In my electorate I have the fortune of having a fantastic group of veterans, who organised a number of events across the electorate to commemorate VP Day. I would like to thank in particular the Bacchus Marsh RSL which invited me to the Soldiers Memorial Hall on 15 August. Even the downpour of rain could not dampen the day. We moved the ceremony inside the hall, which was packed with veterans’ families, friends, local school students and community leaders. They were joined for the first time by the Ballan RSL. It was a fitting tribute for the day to see these two sub-branches there together. As part of the proceedings I presented local veterans with their World War II medallions. We then enjoyed an absolutely delightful afternoon tea. Ballarat Legacy held a special luncheon on the Friday before VP Day, and I hear that a very good time was had by all. The RAAF Association in Ballarat, in conjunction with ex-servicemen’s clubs, organised in Ballarat a VP service on 14 August. That coincided with the military history group’s re-enactment of several battles and they had a number of military personnel and military equipment out at the airfield. MAIN COMMITTEE The service at Ballarat was attended by the Ballarat, Buninyong, Sebastopol, Ballan and Creswick RSLs, alongside other ex-service organisations. Local veterans turned out in force, as did the Ballarat community, to recognise the sacrifices local veterans made for their community and their nation. However, the day was marked by a sombre note. Arthur Lealand, who was 81, collapsed during the commemorative service and, despite the best efforts of local bystanders and paramedics, he died shortly afterwards. I had met Arthur on a number of occasions and had spoken to him just before we marched off that morning. Arthur was absolutely ecstatic-there is no other word to describe his mood on that day. He was brandishing with pride the baton that was used to conduct the band at the signing by the Japanese of their surrender. Arthur was there, and he had arranged for the baton to be used at the opening of our Australian ex-POW memorial in Ballarat and for it to be specially used in Ballarat at the VP Day anniversary. He came up to the mayor, David Vendy, and me to show us the baton and his contribution was formally acknowledged at the service. Unfortunately, Arthur collapsed shortly after and, as one RSL member said to me, ‘When I heard the Last Post playing I looked over at Arthur and I hoped that somehow he heard it and he went to rest.’ I had the pleasure of meeting Arthur’s brother Colin the next day at the Daylesford RSL commemoration where he was the guest speaker. He told me that Arthur was a staunch Ballarat Legacy member and, by all accounts, a handy batsman. He also told me, somewhat wryly, that Arthur was the youngest of the three boys who had all made it home from the war, and that he had broken ranks somewhat by dying before the other two. Family and friends have said that Arthur could not have asked for a more fitting final salute than to be surrounded by mates during such a historic anniversary. Mr Lealand will be sorely missed, and I would like again to pass on my condolences to his family and pay my respects to the marvellous contribution Arthur made to this country and to our local community. It was at the Daylesford RSL ceremony where I had the pleasure and honour of meeting Arthur’s brother Colin and where Colin was the guest speaker. He gave a heartfelt and thoughtful speech. Again, as with all the VP Day commemorations in my electorate, it was great to see the whole community participating in the proceedings. The Clunes community also held a VP commemoration and lunch, and from all accounts it was a wonderful turnout involving all of the community, young and old alike. The VP Day commemorations held across my electorate were a fitting commemoration to all those who served in the Australian defence forces during our country’s hour of need, and much thanks is owed to all the hard work of the local RSLs who spent many hours organising the events. I, unfortunately, do not have the time to thank all of the people involved individually, and I do not want to leave anybody out, but I would simply record my thanks to all those involved. Your contribution and service is a credit to your RSLs, ex-service organisations and the local community. I, like other members here who are commemorating VP Day, have a number of medallion presentations to conduct. I will be doing my next one on Friday, and also several next week as we break from parliament. They are wonderful occasions and I think the medallion is a fitting way of recognising the 60th anniversary of Victory in the Pacific. I do have to say, though, that I have had a number of constituents talk to me about their disappointment about the criteria for the allocation of the VP medallion, particularly those families who have quite recently lost their World War II veteran, and they would like to be able to have the medallion in their MAIN COMMITTEE family. I have of course, and I am sure other members of parliament have done the same, written to the minister to ask for some reconsideration of that. In my own family’s case, the only boy remaining in my mum’s family died just recently and, as she is the sole survivor of the family, I know personally from her that it is something she would very much like to have in the family to be able to commemorate not only his war service but also her brother who died at the age of 21 in the Pacific. SoI think, whilst we are here commemorating VP Day, that perhaps there are some family members who are somewhat disappointed about not being able to have the medallion in their family and in their family history. I also, just very briefly, want to talk about an experience I had most recently. Whilst we are talking about Victory in the Pacific and the 60th anniversary of VP Day, this year is also the 90th anniversary of World WarI and of the ANZAC Cove landings. Two weeks ago I had the opportunity to visit Gallipoli for the first time with Mount Clear College students and teachers, and the Mayor of the City of Ballarat. The college has developed a sister city relationship with Gallipoli High School and, through the wonderful work of a teacher, Ian Simpkin, has developed a cultural exchange between the two schools. It was incredibly moving to be at the site and, I think, probably even more moving to be able to be there when there is not a large crowd; when the silence of the sea and the silence of the site itself really give you an indication of what an incredible place it was to land. One of the things I wanted to comment on is what has happened to the site in the course of the last 12 months. The teachers who were there with me have been to ANZAC Cove on four separate occasions. The roadworks that have been undertaken at that site, regardless of what spin the government wants to put on it, have irrevocably changed that site forever. To paraphrase, one of the teachers said to me: ‘I look out at this cove, and I have photos from 90 years ago and photos from last year. Over the course of those 90 years, the shape and the skyline of that cove had remained unchanged. The wonderful thing about being at that site is that when you look out you see almost exactly the same image that those boys landing 90 years ago saw.’ He was able to show that. He had those photos and he could see that. But when we were there two weeks ago he said: ‘I can no longer say that. These kids who I’m bringing here today will no longer see the same sight that those boys who landed at this site 90 years ago saw. It has changed.’ The thing that I was shocked by, it being my first visit there, was that, whilst the Turkish authorities have clearly sought to accommodate the requests of the Australian government to improve vehicle access, it is less clear just how much oversight, if any, the Australian government had over that process. The Turkish authorities have done what they were asked to do, but when you look at the site you see that great excavations have happened. There is still soil dumped on the cove itself and there has been no replanting at the site. I must say, there desperately needs to be some remedial action taken to get that site at least back into a condition where it does not look as though it is a building site. It is a war memorial. I understand there is a parliamentary delegation leaving to go to Turkey on the weekend, and I would encourage members of that cross-party delegation to look very closely at the site and make their own assessment. I understand that a Senate report is just about to be handed down and I would expect there are some critical comments in that as well. I would really encourage that parliamentary delegation to look very closely at the site, because there does need to be some attention paid to that and there needs to be some work done. I think that whilst we MAIN COMMITTEE are here commemorating the 60th anniversary of VP Day-an incredibly important event to commemorate-we have an equal responsibility to make sure that those war memorial sites are not just something we pay attention to when there are cameras on us and when there is a big crowd there on commemoration days. They are in our custody forever and we need to take great care when we do anything to those sites. Ms HALL (Shortland) (5.03 pm)-It gives me great pleasure to rise to speak on the motion before us today. The Second World War was, like all wars, a defining time in Australia’s history. It is really interesting to reflect on war and the part that it has played in Australia in bringing the nation together and forming our culture. After all, it was in 1915 at Gallipoli that all the newly federated Australian states came together as a proud nation. The Second World War also played a very significant role in the history of Australia, because it was the first time that Australians had to bunker down and fight on the ground to protect their own country. That was a very different way of looking at war. Previously, war had always been something that happened a long way away from Australia, but in the Second World War we were protecting our own shores. Every man, woman and child in the country joined the battle to save Australia. Australia was drawn into the war in the Pacific, in our own region, when we and the British colonies in Malaya and Singapore came under threat. It is also important to reflect on the fact that there were almost a million Australians-both men and women-who served in the Second World War. As well as the men and women who served in the actual conflict, there were many people who protected our home shores. There was the Women’s Land Army, established to encourage women to work in rural areas. Whilst the men were away fighting the war on foreign shores, the women were ensuring that those men had the food, the clothes and the equipment that they needed in that war. Like the other members of this parliament, I have been working closely with the veterans community. When we were organising our Victory in the Pacific celebrations, I had a committee that worked very closely with me. On that committee were representatives from all RSLs within the electorate: Peter Moss from the Doyalson-Wyee RSL, Joe Hayes from the Pelican Flats RSL, Roy McDougall from the Catherine Hill Bay RSL, Doug Wallace from the Swansea RSL sub-branch and Hughie Winter from the Belmont sub-branch. Peter Moore, the President of the Toukley sub-branch, also worked with me, particularly in the presentation of my first round of medallions. This committee helped me decide on the best way to allocate the $10,000 that the government provided for each member and their electorate. I would have to say that the choice was excellent. Money was given to Doyalson RSL for a very special commemorative function and to the combined Belmont-Swansea-Pelican RSL and the Catherine Hill Bay sub-branch for a similar sort of function. Out of the $10,000, money was allocated to purchase a Victory in the Pacific DVD for every school in the electorate. Those RSL sub-branches are going to help me distribute those at presentations within the electorate. So you can see just how important a role they played in the electorate and the celebrations and how I would be lost without the assistance that they give me-not only then but on all occasions. They are a very vibrant group, very caring about the welfare of all ex-servicemen within the electorate, and they are a group that provides support to them and their families at all times. On this occasion, they provided support and assistance to me. MAIN COMMITTEE When I was looking at the celebrations, how they affected people and what people thought when they heard that victory had been declared and that the war was over, I spoke to my mother. She said that she was standing in the kitchen preparing her breakfast. It was 7.45 in the morning. Next thing she knew, a friend burst in the back door and said, ‘The war’s over! The war’s over!’ Within about half an hour, the whole house was filled with friends and the celebration began. SinceI spoke to her, I have also spoken to many of the people who have attended the celebrations that I held throughout the electorate. One woman worked in the accounts department in a firm in Sydney. You may remember those machines that punch cards. They had been saving all of the little circles that had been punched out of the cards, and when they heard that the war was over they gathered these bags of confetti, went to the windows and threw the confetti out. And so the celebration began. Another person was in hospital in Singapore, and there was someone on a ship and a woman driving in a car-she and her husband were together. They were just overcome by the joy of the occasion. This is something that we probably find a little bit difficult to understand, because this had followed the Depression-as other speakers have said-where there had been extreme deprivation. It was a time when people in Australia had done it hard and battled in a way that I have never had to battle and that my children have never had to battle. I know that in the Depression my grandfather bred chooks. Those chooks were used to sustain his family. They grew things to eat in the garden, whereas these days most people just walk to the supermarket and buy those things. So it was a totally different time-a time when Australians had been poverty stricken. It was a time that followed the Great Depression, but even given that hardship Australians had the resilience to fight and work to save our nation. It is also important to note that the Second World War was a time of massive industrialisation. As I said before, it was quite often the women who moved in. We produced our own equipment and food. We fought the war and we fed and equipped the people who fought in it. My father-in-law did not fight in the war; he was required to stay at home. He was a radiographer and his job was to X-ray all the bombs to make sure that everything was properly manufactured. So there were so many different ways that people contributed to the war effort. As I mentioned, Australian women ran Australian industries. It was a time of great change for the women of Australia. They had to work in munitions factories while the men were on the Kokoda Trail. It is important to mention here that Kokoda is considered Australia’s most significant campaign of the Second World War. It was there that Australians halted the Japanese advance into Australia. It was a defining moment in Australia’s nationalism-as was the battle in Darwin-when the nation was saved from invasion. It was defining because Australia was under threat and we fought and saved our nation. At a local level, each year we have a commemorative service at Norah Head on the Central Coast. We are commemorating the effort that the Merchant Navy made to Australia’s war effort. On that day we remember the many people who lost their lives at sea. We particularly remember the sinking of the Nimbin and the Iron Chieftain just off the coast at Norah Head. It is a very poignant ceremony each year, and it is interesting that the entire coast of New South Wales-I say New South Wales because that is the area I am familiar with-is littered with ships that were sunk during the Second World War. We do not realise just how close to home the war was. MAIN COMMITTEE My mother tells me that she was out on Sydney Harbour on the day the Japanese submarines pulled up. She had had to travel from Manly to Sydney. She has shared with me the feelings that existed at that time. Another friend, Lachy Watkins, helps me out a lot when it comes to veterans ceremonies. When I am down here, he invariably represents me. Except for last year when he was at Gallipoli, which was a very special time for him, he has accompanied me on every ANZAC Day ceremony I have attended whilst I have been in the parliament. He was in the 2nd/33rd Infantry Battalion and served in New Guinea, Moratai and Borneo. He was at the bottom of Shaggy Ridge. He still wakes in a sweat at night, shaking from the memories of that war. He says the memories are always with him. He says that, no matter what, he cannot forget what happened there; it is forever with him. The terrain in New Guinea was formidable and difficult and combat was often in torrential rain. There were more deaths from tropical disease than from combat fatalities. One description I read of the area described it as one of ‘swift-flowing mountain streams, dense, dank rainforests and almost vertical mountainsides’. Our troops who were there suffered from extreme sleep deprivation and inadequate shelter, food and medical supplies. They battled constant wetness, knee deep in mud, and the tortuous terrain of the Owen Stanley Range. They had to contend with the worse tropical diseases. They were ordinary, everyday Australians. They were Australians from my region who worked in the mines. They were Australians who, after the Depression, were battling to care for their families. Above all, they joined together as proud Australians to defend our coastline. We as Australians should be very proud of them. We as Australians are very proud of them-not only those who fought in New Guinea but also those who fought Hitler in Europe. Their role and contribution was enormous. They were involved in every aspect of the war in Europe. As a nation, we are very proud of them. We are also very proud of those who fought the battle at home-the women who were involved in providing the equipment, food and munitions that our soldiers needed. Australia salutes and thanks all those who fought for Australia in the Second World War. Ms PLIBERSEK (Sydney) (5.18 pm)-World War II ended on 15 August 1945. We have recently had the opportunity to express our gratitude to those who served in the Second World War, to honour those who are still with us and to commemorate those who fell. In announcing the end of the war against Japan on 15 August 1945, Prime Minister Chifley said: Fellow citizens, the war is over. The Japanese government has accepted the terms of surrender imposed by the allied nations and hostilities will now cease. The reply by the Japanese government to the note sent by Britain, the United Nations, the USSR and China has been received and accepted by the allied nations. At this moment let us offer thanks to God. Let us remember those whose lives were given that we may enjoy this glorious moment and may look forward to a peace which they have won for us. We can only imagine how much relief and how much joy was in the hearts of people hearing the words that war was now over, yet how much sadness there must have been for the people that they had lost and the sacrifices that they had made. Some one million Australians served during World War II and almost 40,000 of them were killed. Many more people were injured during the war and 30,000 were taken prisoner. For every one of those who did not come back, there is a family who still grieves. For those who did come back, changed by war, there was a lifetime of readjusting. I think we should also remember that, although Australians suffered during this war, the peoples of every nation suffered. That is the problem with war. MAIN COMMITTEE Less than a week before the cease-fire, many Japanese people were killed in the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki when those new and deadly bombs were dropped. I think it is worth remembering that those people too-women, children and noncombatants-died in a terrible way at a terrible time in our international history. The war ended and soldiers returning had all sorts of difficulties in readjusting to their civilian lives. Many of the women who had taken up the burden of working in the factories and on the farms had enjoyed their new-found competence and freedom, and suddenly they were expected to drop all their new skills and return to the home to raise families. They certainly loved their families, but the war had shown them that it was possible to do more-to do work that benefited the community and brought income into the family as well as raising their children. Just as many of the soldiers had difficulty readjusting to their lives as civilians, I think many women had difficulty in adjusting to the idealised life that was set out for the 1950s housewife. Recently in my electorate we had a ceremony to honour those who served Australia and the allied nations. We had a morning tea on Friday, 12 August at the Australian National Maritime Museum. There we unveiled a commemorative plaque and presented special medallions, commemorating the end of the Second World War in the Pacific, to World War II veterans, their widows and widowers. There were 874 eligible recipients in the electorate of Sydney, and we were able to invite all of those people to the morning tea at the Maritime Museum because of the extraordinary generosity of the Australian National Maritime Museum. I take this opportunity to thank in particular the Director of the Maritime Museum, Mary-Louise Williams, and the Assistant Director, Michael Crayford, who did an excellent job as Master of Ceremonies on the day, and Inger Sheil, who did the bulk of the organising of this day. We thank all of the staff at the museum who helped and supported this event not just for their work on the day but also for their work during the lead-up to the day. We now have a wonderful commemorative plaque on the wall of the National Maritime Museum, facing Sydney Harbour, that thousands of tourists pass every day and that thousands of schoolchildren can see every week. Veterans of World War II can see it at any time and know that Australia honours their work and honours their sacrifice. I want to particularly acknowledge the very good work of a number of the local RSL clubs in putting on this function. James Park, who is the Honorary Secretary of the Balmain-Rozelle RSL Club, and Aub Silcock from Redfern RSL were absolutely tireless in their efforts to make this event the wonderful success that it was. All credit should go to James and Aub for their hard work. But their work does not stop at this one event: each of them is organising or has organised further events in their local sub-branch areas to remind the community, particularly our young people, of the importance of this anniversary of victory in the Pacific. I would also like to thank Father John Knight, the parish priest of Our Lady of Mount Carmel Church in Waterloo, who offered prayers on the day and our friend from the Salvation Army who also offered prayers on the day. Bill Orton, the President of the Balmain-Rozelle RSL Club, made a wonderful contribution. We thank State Transit for providing buses to transport all our veterans and schoolchildren. Our photographer, as always, was the wonderful Izzy Perko. He has sent a photograph of every veteran or every veteran’s widow or widower receiving a medal to them. I know that those photographs have been greatly appreciated. MAIN COMMITTEE Councillors Tony Pooley, Marcelle Hoff and Shayne Mallard attended from the City of Sydney Council. Our very special guest was Mr Tom Uren, a former minister in the Whitlam government. Tom enlisted in the Royal Australian Artillery in 1939 and later served as a bombardier with the 2nd/1st Heavy Battery in Timor. From 1942 to 1945, he was a Japanese prisoner of war in Timor, Java and Singapore, on the Burma-Siam railway and in Japan. Tom remembers the dropping of the bombs on Nagasaki and Hiroshima; he remembers seeing the mushroom clouds. Of course those years as a soldier and, more particularly, as a prisoner of war were terrible years not only for Tom but also for the men that he was locked up with. But those years built in Tom a spirit of forgiveness, compassion and generosity that I think he would agree were in many ways the making of him as a man. We were very lucky to have Tom with us on the day not only to remind us of his experiences but also to remind us that war is never to be glorified and that these opportunities are not opportunities to glorify war but to honour the sacrifice of the people who went to fight fascicm. The people who received medals on the day were Mr Frank Balbi of Rosebery, Mr Francis Breen of Balmain, Mr Harry Brindle of Camperdown, Mrs Lydia Bushell of Glebe, Mr Dusan Davidovic of Chippendale, Mrs Ethel Driscoll of Beaconsfield, Mr Alan Duncan of Balmain, Mr Donald Gale of Sydney, Mrs Sonia Gidley-King of Woolloomooloo, Mr Denis Gray of Millers Point, Mrs Elaine Hickey of Redfern, Mrs Isabella Jones of Potts Point, Mr Thomas rick Morriss of Glebe, Mr Iukhym Sapozhnikov of Waterloo, Mr Roland Schilling of Glebe, Mr Harry Slarke of Centennial Park, Mrs Maria Texeira of Waterloo, Mrs Sylvia Wardell of Balmain, Mrs Alice Weeks of Waterloo, Mr Ken Buckley of Sydney, Mr Efim Solovei of Surry Hills, Mr Burt Mulford of Redfern and Mr James Gray of Glebe. We also had a medal for Mr Bill Orton and we honoured Mr James Park and also Mr Aub Silcock. This may be the last chance that veterans of Victory in the Pacific have to gather in great numbers to have their particular contribution honoured. SoI wish to say to every one of the people on the list I have just read out and to every one of the over 800 people who are eligible for this honour in the electorate of Sydney: we thank you for your sacrifice and we acknowledge your hard work. We know that the number of young people who attend ANZAC Day services across the country continues to grow. Again, I do not believe it is because these young people honour war. I think it is because they honour sacrifice. Just as we remember those who fought for us, when I looked into the eyes of the veterans to whom I was presenting medals I knew that they were remembering their mates who fell. pause and record its thanks, gratitude and appreciation for the sacrifice of a generation of Australians who, during World War II, saved Australia. There is a simple truth in all of this: that generation and their deeds did in fact save Australia from tyranny. They established the basis for what has been 60 years of relative peace and prosperity, and without their great deeds that would not have been possible. A while ago this parliament discussed a similar motion in respect of victory in Europe, and it was appropriate that we paused then to acknowledge the contribution in that theatre of war. As with the European campaign, Australian forces distinguished themselves in the AsiaPacific region. It is probably the case that the first defeat suffered by the Nazi war machine in MAIN COMMITTEE",199,Victory In The Pacific

354,Mr Bevis (Brisbane) (5.30 Pm),"This is an important occasion for the parliament toEurope occurred at Tobruk, which was largely held by Australians-indeed, the first defeat for Rommel was with forces commanded by an Australian officer. The same can be said in the Pacific theatre of war. The Japanese war machine had effectively conquered all through Asia-through Korea, China, Indochina and Malaya, and had taken what was then regarded as the invincible stronghold of Singapore. It was not until August 1942, when they sought to take Milne Bay in Papua New Guinea, that the Japanese suffered their first defeat on land. That was at the hands of Australian troops, most of whom were citizen soldiers. They were not career soldiers. They were part-time soldiers who had taken up the call to defend their country and their families. They had gone to New Guinea to resist the expected invasion, which came on 25 August. In extremely fierce fighting over some 10 days they repelled the Japanese attack on Milne Bay, and in so doing inflicted the first defeat on the Japanese army. At the same time, and over the period of that battle, Australians were engaged in another very bloody encounter, on the Kokoda Trail. I think few Australians grow up without knowing the story of the Kokoda Trail and the great sacrifices by Australians and by Papua New Guinea citizens on the Kokoda Trail. I think we should acknowledge the contribution of those Papua New Guinea citizens, the people who lovingly became known as the ‘fuzzy wuzzy angels’ and without whom many more Australian lives would have been lost. We often see photos of Australian wounded being helped down treacherous mountainsides in terrible conditions by the fuzzy wuzzy angels. What is not as widely known is that many of them served in their own Papua New Guinea battalions and took up arms and fought alongside the Australians. Also not often recognised is that, for most of the war in the Pacific, General MacArthur, the Supreme Allied Commander in the Pacific, had more Australians under his command than Americans. It was not until 1944 that MacArthur had more Americans under his charge than Australians. The brunt of the land battle in the Pacific was borne by Australian men and women. To their great credit, they performed with enormous valour and courage. The Leader of the Opposition, Kim Beazley, in his contribution at the start of this debate, referred to the writings of an American historian in a book titled Touched With Fire. I want to repeat that reference because it rang a chord with me and a number of others with whom I have spoken. This was an American’s view of Australians involved in Papua New Guinea during those days. The American observed: The ingenuity required on the frontier, which Australians call the ‘convict mentality’, was very real. There was also a genuine ruggedness to the national character. Physical courage was highly prized. A broken nose was easy enough to come by in pre-war Australia ... It is, I think, safe to say that somewhere along the line the ‘Protestant work ethic’ lost some of its intensity in Australia. An Australian infantry man who served at Milne Bay told me they were glad to hear of the Japanese attack because that freed them from an ugly road building detail in the mud. He concluded: Soldiers who would rather fight crack Japanese assault troops than build roads win wars. And indeed they did. I think it is a very insightful observation of those rugged Aussies by an American historian. I think we should also pay tribute to the other Australians who were involved-not necessarily in such a high-profile way. Whilst the Army was heavily engaged in the war in the PaMAIN COMMITTEE cific-at Kokoda and Milne Bay and on the islands of the South Pacific-it was supported by Royal Australian Navy and Air Force personnel. They fulfilled not just the normal combat roles but a wide range of other roles, including strategic support and intelligence gathering. Some of those intelligence-gathering activities were every bit as treacherous and dangerous as the front-line combat activities. Australians who had the role of spotter were stationed with their radios on small uninhabited islands across the Pacific, and their observations of the movements of Japanese navy and aircraft were essential in providing the intelligence that allowed the allied forces to do so well in the major battles of the Coral Sea and Midway. Without the intelligence that they were able to provide at great risk to themselves, events may well have turned out differently. I suppose their role is more often recognised, to the extent that it is, by virtue of one particular incident, where an Australian noticed that an American patrol boat had been sliced up in the night. It just happened to be commanded by John Kennedy, who later became President. It was an Australian spotter who was able to relay the information that rescued JFK and the survivors of his crew. The people in the Navy and the Air Force who provided that support and those in the Air Force who engaged in the bitter air battles in the Pacific deserve great commendation as well. Certainly in the early part of the war they often engaged in battles with inferior equipment but never without great commitment to their country. I also want to acknowledge the people who were back home during that period. Some of those were in uniform and eager to go to war but never did. There was an Australian armoured corps unit, the name of which I forget at the moment. They were equipped with Matilda tanks and it was intended for them to go abroad on two occasions but they were never able to. I have met a number of people who were in that unit, and they certainly would have matched the courage of other Australian troops who were involved in that theatre. There are also the people who protected Darwin and Northern Australia from the attacks that occurred on land from the bombings of the Japanese air force. I also want to acknowledge the role that women played during that period, including the Women’s Land Army, which was absolutely critical in ensuring that the needs of the nation continued to be met while literally millions of its people-its men-who had held down jobs were at war. Mr Price interjectingthe role that women played in all walks of life in industry. This enabled the planes to be built, the weapons to be made and the vehicles to be constructed. None of that would have been possible without the role of women. There is no doubt that the women who were involved in those many facets of activity during World War II, whether it was formally as part of the Women’s Land Army or in other roles in industry, played an essential part. I also want to include a comment about the role of Indigenous Australians in the Australian Defence Force. They receive, I have to say, far too little recognition for their contribution. There were outstanding examples of Aboriginal Australians making such a contribution. And we have to remember that at that time they had no right to vote or even to be counted as human beings in the census. They were not regarded by the government of the day and the nation as a whole as people to be counted in a census. They were not, in most parts of Australia, paid the same wage in civilian employment as the white person working beside them. But MAIN COMMITTEE",209,Victory In The Pacific
355,Mr Bevis,"As I am correctly reminded by my friend the member for Chifley, there wasthey were committed Australians and many Aborigines served in the Australian Defence Forces-in all services, but particularly in the Army and the Air Force. I think it is a great tragedy, frankly, that it took until two decades after the war for them to receive the same basic rights as all other people, following the referendum in the mid-1960s. They should be remembered. Aboriginal Australians who fought during that period did so with great valour, and I hope that one day their story will be receive more publicity than it has had until now. Finally, I want to acknowledge the people in my own electorate who have participated in the commemorative celebrations that have been held and who will participate in the celebrations that are yet to be held. This SaturdayI will have the great honour and pleasure of attending a film evening with about 150 to 200 of my constituents. There will be some World War II newsreels, a large number of old diggers and their families, and the opportunity to present some awards to some of those assembled there. It is going to be a great evening. These occasions are important and, as the member for Sydney pointed out, they are important not because anyone wants to glorify war-the tragedies and the harm that come from that are all too obvious when we turn on our television sets every night. But it is more than appropriate that we thank those people for their sacrifice and acknowledge their contribution. Occasions like this are important for doing that. I want to especially thank the many people at the Gaythorne RSL in my electorate who have given their time-not just on occasions like this but on every day of the year-to support our veterans, as have the members of the Ashgrove RSL and the Bardon RSL. They do a fine job and we all owe them a debt of thanks for their support of a generation that was special. In conclusion, I think this generation deserve greater thanks and credit than any other I can contemplate-and not just because of the deeds performed during World War II. This was a generation that grew up as children during the Great Depression. As young people they did not enjoy any of the normal worldly benefits that we might have enjoyed when we grew up or that our children do. They grew up and, as young adults, went into a war. After having gone through a depression, they moved as young adults into a war over many years to defend our nation. They then came back and put their shoulders to the wheel and helped build one of the most prosperous countries on the planet. That is a great testament. I think any one of those things makes a generation stand out, but that generation endured all three and did so with great fortitude, great pride and a great outcome. I think it is a wonderful testament to them and it is appropriate that we should acknowledge them. friend the honourable member for Brisbane and shadow minister for homeland security. Certainly, I totally endorse all of his contribution. I begin my contribution with the remarks I made in my electorate and with which the Leader of the Opposition concluded his contribution to this debate. They were the words of Ben Chifley, the then Prime Minister, a month after Curtin died. On 15 August he said: Fellow citizens, the war is over ... Let us remember those whose lives were given that we may enjoy this glorious moment and may look forward to a peace which they have won for us. Let us remember those whose thoughts, with proud sorrow, turn towards gallant loved ones who will not come back ... Nothing can fully repay the debt we owe them, nor can history record in adequate terms their deeds from the black days that followed September 1939, and December 1941, until this moment. MAIN COMMITTEE",211,Victory In The Pacific
356,Mr Price (Chifley) (5.44 Pm),"I somewhat reluctantly follow the contribution of myI cannot say that I have experienced war; in fact, I am a baby boomer born in the year that peace was declared. I think we forget what Australia was like in those days. Out of a population of six million, half a million people were under arms. We paid as we went as far as the war was concerned. Today we are a population of 20 million. We are not at war and our armed services comprise something like 50,000 people. As the honourable member for Brisbane pointed out, so many people contributed and so many received inadequate recognition for their efforts. I am pleased that he raised the issue of those in our Indigenous community who served and have been very much ignored. I wish to speak of the contribution of Australia’s women. Australia, under its total mobilisation then in place, could not have kept wartime industry and the civilian components that were operating going without the contribution of women. When I say ‘the contribution of women’, they actually did jobs that they had never done before. They did jobs that were seen as jobs for men. They worked in munitions factories and on tanks and aircraft. Again, the honourable member for Brisbane has outlined that. I know enough to understand that there is nothing nice or attractive about war. I think that the older one gets the more one wants to very much avoid war. It is never the old who glory in war, but it is the old who send the young men and women of a nation to war. We had a wonderful ceremony in Chifley, the details of which I would like to place on the public record, Mr Deputy Speaker Quick. A mutual friend of ours and former Minister for Veterans’ Affairs, the Hon. Con Sciacca, initiated an Australia Remembers service. I have to say that I have always counted myself a good friend of Con Sciacca. I put on the public record that he did not get to open the memorial gardens in the electorate of Chifley, much to my bitter disappointment. The gardens were a combined effort of the Rooty Hill and St Mary’s RSL sub-branches. Those memorial gardens continue today. I am fond of saying that council does not have flowers west of Alpha Park in Blacktown, but we have roses in the memorial gardens. They are a beautiful thing and both RSLs contribute many man-hours and hard work to keep them in pristine condition. Kevin Hall, the president of the Rooty Hill RSL sub-branch, and Leanne Taylor, the president of the St Mary’s RSL sub-branch-who unfortunately could not join us on the daywere the two chief officials. It was just a wonderful ceremony. I got an unexpected but special reward, which was the privilege of unveiling a plaque in the memorial gardens. I was very touched. For me to unveil that plaque in front of people who had served during the war, been widowed during that war or served in subsequent wars under the Australian flag was a very moving thing. I did not get a lot of notice on the speech, but nevertheless I hope I did them proud. But more than the remarks of the officials, or of the chaplain, I might say-I mean no disrespect-what gave real significance to the ceremony was the participation in the ceremony of all the students from the primary schools in Mount Druitt and the surrounding suburbs. It was just wonderful. Please forgive me if I mention the schools, but I am indebted to the teachers and more so to the students. I know it affected me, and those veterans appreciated it heapsthe students made it even more meaningful for them. The schools included Rooty Hill Public School, St Marys South Public School, St Marys North Public School, Bidwill Public School, Shalvey Public School, Hebersham Public School, Glendenning Public School, Colyton Public School, Dawson Public School, Lethbridge Park Public School, Willmott Public School, MAIN COMMITTEE Minchinbury Public School, Plumpton Public School, Mount Druitt Public School, St Marys Public School, Eastern Creek Public School, Blackett Public School, Tregear Public School, Emerton Public School, Hassall Grove Public School and Noumea Public School. Thanks to those students. Once upon a time in this country we had to fight hard to perpetuate ANZAC Day, which primarily commemorates World War I, but it is these students’ understanding and sense of the sacrifice and what it was like, not any contribution here today-notwithstanding, I am sure, many fine contributions-which will perpetuate our memories and our gratitude for all those who served and all those who contributed, many of whom lost their lives. Mr Deputy Speaker Quick, I know that you have a relative who fought in World War I. I hope that in the future we never see a war of this dimension, although the nature and character of war seems to have changed quite dramatically. We often talk at different services about how much those actions contributed to peace, but I often wonder whether we honour the people involved, particularly those who lost their lives, by fighting for peace just that little bit harder. As we have turned the century and as we have turned the millennium, it has not been a peaceful planet, I have to say. It is not a peaceful planet in the way I think we would all have hoped that it would be. If we want to honour veterans and honour so many people other than veterans and their families who contributed to our success in World War II, we, particularly as legislators in this place, owe it to them to work that little bit harder for peace. Ms HOARE (Charlton) (5.53 pm)-I am very pleased to join my colleagues on both sides of the House as we pause to remember the men and women who sacrificed their lives in a time of war, particularly on this occasion of the 60th anniversary of Victory in the Pacific Day. Like many of my colleagues, I have had the honour and the privilege of presenting commemorative medallions. On Saturday, 13 AugustI was able to present medallions to 70 local World War II veterans and widows at the Toronto RSL Memorial Club. On Tuesday next week I will be continuing that presentation, with a medallion presentation to veterans and widows at the Boolaroo Speers Point RSL Memorial Club. We have all mentioned the commemorative activities that have taken place in our electorates to commemorate the 60th anniversary of Victory in the Pacific. The Toronto RSL subbranch began planning their commemorations more than 12 months ago, back in September 2004, because they knew that this would be a significant occasion and they were going to have the biggest and the best regional commemoration to celebrate the 60th anniversary of Victory in the Pacific. On Sunday, 14 August, I was honoured and privileged to participate in the commemoration ceremony. It was the largest in regional New South Wales and local school students performed extremely well. The sub-branch organising committee had a strong commitment, as the member for Chifley was just saying, that young people in our region should lead the commemoration honouring veterans and widows because young people really are going to make the difference, to make sure that we live in a peaceful world in years to come. On Monday, 15 August, the organising committee held a special luncheon at the Toronto RSL Memorial Club to honour World War II veterans and widows and to commemorate the end of World War II. It would be remiss of me not to mention a lot of the people involved. There were the 12 months of organisation, the medallion presentation on the Saturday and the students had a march down the Boulevard, the main street of Toronto, around to the cenotaph. Only people MAIN COMMITTEE honouring the veterans marched; the veterans and widows who were being honoured stood along the roadside and then joined us at the cenotaph for a program run entirely by school students from Lake Macquarie Christian College at Fassifern, Toronto High School, St Paul’s High School at Booragul and Blackalls Park Public School choir. There was not an adult voice to be heard throughout the whole ceremony. The weekend commemoration was organised by the organising committee of the Toronto RSL sub-branch. I honour them here today: they did a fantastic job. The chair of the committee was Henry Miller. The school liaison person was Cec Donaldson OAM, who is a longtime stalwart and supporter of our local community. The patron of the Toronto sub-branch is Air Vice Marshal Jack Cornish (retired) AO, CBE, LVO, AFC. The publicity officer was Peter Stephenson. The secretary of the organising committee was John Handley. The assistant secretary and all-round gofer was Ron Richardson. The treasurer was John Renfrew. Other committee members were Brian Field and Gordon Gardiner. They should be very proud of the way the activities went and of the successful events over the whole weekend. The main commemoration happened on the Sunday. At the service we had the honour of the RAAF Air Command Band from Richmond and also the Australian Army Reserve Band from Newcastle. Mr Deputy Speaker Quick, I do not think you have had the opportunity to visit Toronto on the shores of Lake Macquarie; you should come one day. During the Sunday afternoon, we all adjourned to the park down on the foreshore and the RAAF band went into swing in the rotunda there. Everyone enjoyed a wonderful sunny afternoon down by the lake following the commemorations. There was also a flyover that had been arranged by the organising committee. It was vintage planes that were owned, operated and provided by Cole Paye and Phil Unicomb. It was a flyover comprising Kittyhawk, Wirraway and Trojan planes. Then at 1 pm on the Sunday we had a jet flyover that came from Williamtown RAAF base. For those of us who were not ready for it, it came as a bit of a shock. We do not usually have RAAF jets flying over Lake Macquarie. The commemorations also included a publication. It was suggested by the organising committee that a publication be produced by high school students. It was, and it is called Sacred Records: Stories from World War II. It was compiled and edited by children from Toronto High School. These students did this under the supervision of their teacher, Mrs Beverley Richardson. They are year 7 independent learner students at Toronto High School and this publication is a great credit to them. It is going to serve as a memory and a way to continue honouring World War II veterans and widows. A lot of stories in this publication came from these students interviewing members of their own families. As I said, Cec Donaldson OAM is a local identity and the first interview was with him. When Cec was interviewed he gave a bit of his background. He said that he had enjoyed being a cadet at school so when they heard the first reports of the war he decided that he was going to be a soldier. In the publication he is quoted as saying: First came the war, then the rations. The rations we had were horrible. Everything was pretty bad those days. I would go as far to say that everybody was everybody’s friends in the war and if one of them died they’d just let it be, because really there was nothing they could do about it. He goes on to say: MAIN COMMITTEE The war was indescribable, it was just so hard to look at all the people who took pride in their country just fighting till death right in front of your eyes Young Tynan Jayne interviewed his grandfather who was a young boy during the war. He recalls: One chilly August morning in 1945, I was walking to school with my sisters, Carmen and Shirley, when suddenly the big air raid siren screamed to life. People stopped everywhere, unsure what to do, terrified, fearing an attack. I stood paralysed to the spot, searching the faces around me for clues on what to do. Moments later the local newsagent, Mr Cook, came racing out of his shop yelling. “The war is over, the war is over!” The Japanese had surrendered. There is another interview with Mrs June Bickle. I do not have the time to go into it as far as I would like to; I will just quote the first part. June is very well known and well loved throughout our community. The article says: Every ANZAC Day and every Remembrance Day the people will see June Bickle with two flower posies to lay in tribute; you will also find June at the Field of Remembrance planting two wooden crosses. One of June’s tributes is for her late husband, Alan Bickle, who was a long term president of both the RSL Memorial Club Ltd and also the president of the Toronto RSL Sub-Branch. The other tribute is for Charlie, who was killed in action in 1941. Charlie was June’s brother. The article goes on: ... at just eighteen years of age Ordinary Seaman Patrick was on his first ever voyage on a Naval ship. He was on the HMAS Sydney when he lost his life. As many people have said, this is not to honour war; this is to honour the sacrifice that our veterans made to ensure that we all live in a democracy and in a safe land as we do todayand that that continues on for our children as well. All the commemorations around Toronto that weekend had an empty chair sitting there with an Australian flag, a tin hat and a pair of boots. Peter Stephenson, who was the publicity officer on that organising committee and was also the secretary of the Toronto RSL subbranch, wrote a poem about this and these are Peter’s words. The poem is called An Empty Chair. A single chair sits empty: Our flag is draped about And on its seat sits still: A ‘‘tin-hat’’ and boots at its feet: We may see this empty chair And think of nothing else: Yet as we celebrate our Vict’ry Ghosts watch on and smile: This is not an empty chair For in it sits the spirit: Of those who’ve gone before us Those who’ve shown the way This chair is here to remind us: MAIN COMMITTEE Of those who could not Be with us in the flesh today: They’re here yet all the same So as we gaze upon this chair Let us see the faces Of young and vibrant warriors: Sitting with us, in this place Let’s take peace and joy Their work was not in vain: Let’s celebrate the past Knowing they are freed of pain I know Peter is very proud of that poem, and so he should be. The Prime Minister, while speaking to this motion in this House, paid tribute to Australia’s wartime Prime Minister, John Curtin. He said: ... to our own Prime Minister at the time, John Curtin, who died on 5 July 1945 and was thus denied the opportunity to see the victory to which his leadership had made a very significant contribution. I pay unconditional tribute to the contribution that he made in the time he was Prime Minister during World War II. In his recent biography of John Curtin, author David Day wrote: Curtin committed his life to achieving a better Australia for all its citizens ... He was of that optimistic generation that came to adulthood in the wake of Federation and which had its hopes tempered by the horrors of the First World War. Despite that experience and the years of the Great Depression, or perhaps because of them, Curtin continued to devote himself to improving the lives of ordinary Australians. It was his hope for a better Australia that drove him, at a terrible cost to his health, to galvanise Australians against the dangers of a military invasion that would have destroyed those hopes for all time. In conclusion, I once again honour all those veterans and widows of the Charlton electorate. I wish them all the best of good wishes and health. I pay tribute to all who made such an important and significant contribution to our history. We must never forget the tragedy of war, and future generations must commit to doing whatever is needed to ensure that the international community works towards world peace encompassing respect and justice for all global citizens. being born in June 1941, I want to talk about some memories. I was just over four when the war ended. I remember vividly my Uncle Bill, Bill Lostetter. He was an American Marine and he married my mum’s sister, my Aunt May, who was a teenage American war bride. I remember when Uncle Bill was on leave in Australia going around to my grandmother and Grandpa’s place in Hampton and seeing him there in his gear and being impressed. Uncle Bill served in Guadalcanal, one of the areas of huge loss for the American Marines, and Iwo Jima and all those sorts of areas. My Aunty May was shipped, with many other teenage American war brides, across the Pacific in very dangerous conditions with their young children. Aunt May arrived on the west coast of America and then was sent by train across to Cincinnati in Ohio to live with Uncle Bill’s family. She had never met them before. She did MAIN COMMITTEE",212,Victory In The Pacific
357,Mr Quick (Franklin) (6.08 Pm),"As I am the oldest member of the ALP in the House,not know whether she would ever see him again, but this was her new family in a strange country and she subsequently settled there. When Uncle Bill returned from the war they moved to Downey in California. I have other memories of that time. As I said, we lived in Hampton. We had an air-raid shelter in the backyard. I remember as a young four-year-old-the eldest in the familyclambering in and out of the air-raid shelter; it was a sort of cubbyhouse. I also remember the searchlights in the sky over Melbourne. A bit later, we moved up to Ballarat because my grandparents were ageing. I also remember the rationing and going to the grocer with mum with a ration book. I still have it at home, and it is one of my proud treasures. Those were the days of rationing and small amounts of butter, sugar and tea. That was before plastics were invented. There was no such thing as putting your recycling out. Everyone had chooks. We used to collect the horse manure, because the bread and milk were delivered by horse and cart, and we had a wonderful garden sprinkled liberally with horse manure. I remember my father telling me after the war had ended and I was getting towards the stage of going to school about the contributions made by some of his mates who had served with him in the First World War; they were young enough to participate in the Second World War and had gone back for a double dose. Fortunately, my dad was wounded seriously enough in the First World War not to have to venture a second try. I remember when a neighbour, Clarrie Everett, a 19-year-old, left for the Middle East and served in the African desert. He was withdrawn from there and was expected to-and did-fight in the Pacific. He went from the trauma of the heat, the dry and the dust of the African campaign to the heat, the wet, the damp and the unknown of the jungles of the Pacific. He was so tormented that, not long after he returned, he ended up killing himself. I remember the ANZAC Day marches in the forties and, as a child, proudly going along and watching my father march. Remember that, in the late forties, most of the guys from the First World War were still in their 40s-and there were the young blokes who had come back from the Second World War marching proudly. The ANZAC Day marches lasted forever and ever. SinceI have been a member of the federal parliament I have visited the Kokoda Trail, Lae, Wewak and Madang. I have visited parts of the Marshall Islands and have seen first hand some of the battlefields and war memorials. I was in Lae and Wewak when the rain absolutely pelted down. I thought, ‘How in the name of creation could you ever fight anybody in these conditions?’ It was 33 or 34 degrees, there were inches and inches of rain and it was real jungle. How could you fight and survive in something like that? I remember children who had Winston as part of their name. The Prime Minister’s middle name is Winston and so is my brother’s-John Winston Howard and Robert Winston Quick. I remember the saying about the Yanks being ‘overpaid, oversexed and over here’. I remember hearing stories about the ‘battle of Spencer Street’ when a train load of Americans came in saying, ‘Don’t worry fellas, we’ll look after your women for you!’ A few people got rather excited and discharged weapons, and some died as a result of that confrontation. I remember going out to where the American soldiers were based in the forests in Ballarat when I was a young cub and unexpectedly finding a pistol that had been left behind. I remember wondering whether I should stick it in my rucksack and go home, excited, but I must have been well trained, because I handed it over to my sixer and then it was handed over to the scoutmaster. As I got older, being a student of history, I tried to get in touch with many of the MAIN COMMITTEE diggers of the Second World War who had served in the Pacific, to try to understand some of the experiences and traumas they experienced. One of my best mates’ fathers, Bob Brownlie, who served in the Air Force, who was almost like a surrogate father to me, told me of his experiences in the Pacific. Most of us have organised a variety of events in our electorates to pay due respect and homage to these people-as people have said, not just to the men but to the women. As a student of history, I remember reading of the tragedy that beset the Australian nurses in the Pacific, who were captured by the Japanese and most of whom were executed. Vivian Bullwinkel is the famous nurse who survived to tell the story. Women stayed at home and worked in industry. Growing up in the Mallee, I knew of the role of women in the bush who stayed and worked to ensure that the farms continued, because in those days most of the men who could enrol did enrol. It is a time that we should not forget. Most of these people are now well into their 80s, and many are in their 90s. I think we have learnt the lesson from the First World War where, tragically, we let them get to the stage that the Second World War guys are at at the moment and suddenly realised that they were dying in vast numbers. There are now only three of them left. Someone mentioned Australia Remembers and Con Sciacca. I think what we are doing here with Victory in the Pacific goes some way to recognising the wonderful role that they played in ensuring that we live in the best country in the world, with the democracy that many people dream of. When I have my thanksgiving celebrations and hand out the medallions on 28 October, I will do it with a tear in my eye because, as I said, there are strong links through my family and through many of my friends’ parents who are no longer with us. I would like to pay tribute publicly to all of these people who have contributed much to our history. Ms BURKE (Chisholm) (6.18 pm)-I too want to make some remarks in respect of Victory in the Pacific Day. I want to start by thanking the government for going to the effort of recognising this day and providing sufficient funds for all our electorates to honour this celebration. It is quite interesting that, for years and years, our celebrations of the Australian war effort have concentrated on World War I, so it was fascinating, appropriate and timely to actually do something in respect of World War II. I hope, as members of parliament, all of us will continue this tradition-be it funded or not, whether there are medals or not-and do something on this day in years to come, because I think it reinforces for the generations who have no recollection or linkage to the war whatsoever that people did make a great sacrifice. In those traditional words, lest we forget. This also gives us a time to recall that we do honour those who gave their lives, but we also continue to have Australian service men and women serving for our country overseas. The notion of a returned service man or woman is not gone, and we still have people returning from conflicts, returning injured, but, touch wood, not returning dead. We need to recall that people continue to engage in active service on behalf of our country. I, like everyone else in this place, was privileged to be part of many ceremonies for VP Day. On the day itself we had two very moving services. One was at the Oakleigh RSL, where a phenomenal speech was given by Mal Carson, the past president of the Waverley RSL. Many people attended that fantastic service. I want to thank Neil Slaughter, at the Waverley RSL, for being the driving force behind that. I want to thank Chris and Peter, a phenomenal MAIN COMMITTEE duo, at the Oakleigh RSL, for all their efforts, and I also want to thank Ray Scott at the Clayton RSL for the work he did on that day. So in the morning we had that service. In the afternoon we coordinated through the Box Hill RSL, and a big thank you to Tony Bowden for that. We invited students from the local schools to attend a memorial service, and we asked grades 5 and 6 to be present. We provided them with a base to make their own wreaths, and they could do whatever theme they wanted. We also asked them to provide some poetry for the day. I would like to share with you some phenomenally inspirational words from children who have no direct experience of these conflicts. Kingswood College Junior School students wrote: To the men and women who made the ultimate sacrifice in the Battle for the Pacific in WWII; We are grateful for giving us the freedom we enjoy today. We are now aware of the brutality and cruelty many of you suffered and the bravery and mateship you showed each other, which have become a symbol of the spirit of the Australian soldier. May history never forget you and may you continue to be honoured. St Benedict’s Primary School, my old alma mater: Some lived, Some died In our hearts, they survive. They fought for our freedom And some went to prison. We celebrate on August 15, When a new day had arisen. Mont Albert Primary School: As Sadako Sasaka was dying of leukemia in Hiroshima, she folded paper cranes as a prayer for health. On her deathbed she held one up and said, “I will write Peace on your wings and you will fly all over the world”. We share her dream of a world without war. It is up to the children of the world if Peace will come in the end. Give us the knowledge and wisdom to help prevent wars. We wish there were no war, violence or terrorism anywhere. We wish that everyone would co-operate, show tolerance and respect; and live in harmony. We wish that the cranes could fly free. Presbyterian Ladies’ College Junior School: On and on and he ran through the fields Each step he took would hopefully bring Australia one giant leap towards freedom. Japanese soldiers lay in wait on the muddy ground The sky was turning blood red as he ran towards the dreaded No Man’s Land. Bullets whistled past his ear Japanese gunmen laid low on the hills Waiting for the perfect moment to strike One moment felt like a lifetime Suddenly everything was silent A smooth, cold bullet punctured him MAIN COMMITTEE Slowly he fell to the ground “For Australia” he whispered silently in a hoarse voice When would the terror and bloodshed end? Hiroshima devastated along with the hopes of innocent civilians. A white flag rose and the war came to an end To this day we remember the brave who died for the greed of man. Our Lady’s Primary School: VP Day 60 years ago, PM Chifley announced, World War II was over. People started to dance. Over 1,000,000 Aussies fought to defend But for 40,000, their lives came to an end. Today we gather here to remember Those women and men whose lives changed forever. We celebrate the end of World War2 As world peace and freedom, we pursue. Mount Scopus Junior School: A day of mourning, a day of grief, Today we are going to lay this wreath. For the soldiers that have died, In their Australian pride. They dressed in green, With their fatal machine. Knowing their fate was near, They stood their ground, without any fear. In our minds the bravest men of Australia, The ones who fought for their country and gave up their lives. Clayton Primary School: To end a war that should not have started To bring joy to the broken-hearted. The men and women that went to war Swore to the enemies, that they would never fall. Many years have passed us by When many soldiers cried and died. We remember them on this day as VP day When World War2 went away. It’s been 60 long years Of pain and tears We’ve tried our best to comfort MAIN COMMITTEE The brave. We remember them today As heroes who set us all free, To live today in peace and harmony. Wattle Park Primary School: The war was bloody, The guns never stopped, And there was a good chance that you would be shot. Lots were killed, 40,000 in all, And then there was no fighting, The end of World War. Soldiers died, To keep us free, To save Australia For you and me. Kerrimuir Primary School quoted from Rudyard Kipling’s Ode, which he wrote for the commemoration of the Melbourne Shrine of Remembrance. I am going to read just a couple of stanzas: SO LONG as memory, valour, and faith endure, Let these stones witness, through the years to come, How once there was a people fenced secure Behind great waters girdling a far home. Their own and their land’s youth ran side by side Heedless and headlong as their unyoked seasLavish o’er all, and set in stubborn pride Of judgment, nurtured by accepted peace. Thus, suddenly, war took them-seas and skies Joined with the earth for slaughter. In a breath They, scoffing at all talk of sacrifice, Gave themselves without idle words to death. … … … Then they returned to their desired landThe kindly cities and plains where they were bredHaving revealed their nation in earth’s sight So long as sacrifice and honour stand, And their own sun at the hushed hour shall light The shrine of these their dead! MAIN COMMITTEE I found the whole ceremony incredibly moving. Some World War II veterans were present in the audience and there was not a dry eye in the house. We were also very blessed to have a veteran address the group. The children and I were quite stunned to find that this man had spent six years on the front line. He survived, he came back and 60 years later he was still alive. I, too, asked various people what they remembered about the end of the war. My mother said, ‘I was pretty young and I think we got a day off school.’ My dad said that his most vivid memory was a couple of weeks later when he was sitting around at home as usual. A whole bunch of people were sitting around having a cup of tea-I come from pretty good Irish stock-and someone said to dad, ‘Barney’-that is how they referred to him-‘see that bloke in the corner; he’s your dad,’ and it was the first time he had met him. He had returned from World War II. Dad was probably about eight. He had no recollections of him prior to going to war, and there was this man in the corner who was his father. He lived for only a couple more years. My father said that the most vivid memory he has of his childhood was meeting the man who was his father. My grandfather served in World WarI and World War II. Like many of us, we have connections to this horror. I hope that these celebrations and commemorations demonstrate to those people who fought for us so long ago that we do not forget. We thank them for their service, we commemorate them and, hopefully, as I said, we will not let this pass as a one-off. As electorates, we will share the valour of our World War II heroes and remember them. It was not just the men who fought; many Australian women fought and many Australian women did their bit back home. All of Australia was at war at that time. Sadly, I have two regrets about this occasion. I would like to put on the record my sadness for Norm Furness, from the 2nd 22nd Battalion, who was hoping to get back to Rabaul this year for a commemorative service. Veterans were sent there by the Department of Veterans’ Affairs. Sadly, Norm’s group in Melbourne were not made aware of that commemoration and no-one from his regiment, who was on the front line, was given the chance to attend that ceremony. I am disappointed on their behalf. I am also disappointed on behalf of a couple of veterans in my area-particularly Cyril Ashton, who was a citizen of the United Kingdom at the time. He was conscripted aged 19. He did his war service. He did his bit at the hospital where they sewed up what they referred to as ‘the guinea pigs’-those people who came down during those tragic air battles over England. Sadly, as his service was not recognised as being part of a conflict because he was not actually overseas-although in Cyril’s words ‘They were dropping bombs on me every day, so I figured I was probably in a war zone-he was not entitled to a 60th anniversary medallion and that caused him some grief. I would like to thank all those people involved, particularly Ric from my office who did such great work to make our medal presentation the splendid day it was. To the Mount Scopus children who came and presented, on behalf of the Jewish community, their memories of war, my thanks. Thanks to the Pacific Island dancers who came and represented the Pacific Islands and all those who partook in the ceremony. Lest we forget. Debate adjourned. Main Committee adjourned at 6.31 pm MAIN COMMITTEE Medicare (Question No. 966) Can he say when a Medicare Office will be opened in Gungahlin in the electoral division of Fraser, one of eight new offices to be opened, as indicated in the Health Insurance Commission’s announcement of 31 August 2004 which can be viewed on its website.

369,Mr Downer,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:Mr John Cobb-The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member’s question: (1) (a) Advertisements seeking expressions of interest were placed in The Australian, The Sydney Morning Herald, The Canberra Times and the Age on 21 May 2005. Industry Groups were asked to submit a brief proposal outlining how the department officers would be utilised and addressing the following selection criteria: extent of skills shortage, extent of education required in the industry, extent of organisation support available for the officer, and the work plan proposal. (b) The following industry groups are involved: Australian Chamber of Commerce& Industry Master Builders Association Housing Industry Association Motor Trades Association of Australia Australasian Railways Association Commerce Queensland Growcom National Farmers Federation Victorian Employer’s Chamber of Commerce& Industry Manufacturing & Engineering Skills Advisory Board Victoria Australian Industry Group Australian Business Ltd Association of Consulting Engineers Australia Australian Mines& Metals Association WA Resources Sector Consortium (CME & APPEA) Chamber of Commerce& Industry WA Business SA Tasmanian Chamber of Commerce& Industry Northern Territory Chamber of Commerce& Industry Restaurants & Catering Australia In addition, the department is also working closely with the Minerals Council of Australia but not on an outplaced basis. (c) The officers will be located in Canberra, Sydney, Melbourne, Darwin, Perth, Adelaide, Hobart and Brisbane. Some will have national and others state wide coverage. (2) The Department is responsible for salary, travel, equipment for presentations and related administrative costs. The host employer organisation will provide a work area, some equipment and administrative support needed for the day-to-day work of the officer. The officers remain accountable to the department. (3) DIMIA has taken steps to ensure clarity on the role and activities of the industry officers. A draft Deed of Agreement has been developed for signing with each host Industry group. The Deed identifies clearly the role of the industry officers and does not include membership recruitment activities. In addition, the Industry officers are developing business plans, in conjunction with the host industry group and the department. These plans will clearly outline the roles and responsibilities of the outposted officers. These will include advising on immigration options to the employer members of the organisation, promoting electronic lodgement and liaising on policy/procedural issues that require attention. The effectiveness of the program is being monitored through strategies such as monthly reports received from each industry officer on their activities and progress with the business plan. The program will be formally evaluated after nine months. Baxter Detention Centre (Question No. 1927) Mr Georganas asked the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, in writing, on 9 August 2005: Do security staff at Baxter detention centre dispense prescribed medication to detainees; if so, has the wrong medication ever been dispensed to a detainee by security staff. Mr John Cobb-The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member’s question: Where medication is required by detainees at Baxter Immigration Detention Facility (IDF) at night or on Sundays, Detention Services Officers deliver medications prescribed to detainees by authorised medical staff by way of “Webster Packs”. A “Webster Pack” is an A4 card, printed with the patient’s name, medication and daily/weekly dosage. Attached to the front of the card is a clear plastic blister pack which a pharmacist fills with the appropriate medication, thus enabling the delivery of medication by non-clinical staff. Pharmacists are the only people able to fill a Webster Pack and this is done in accordance with prescriptions authorised by a qualified medical practitioner. Delivery of medication via Webster Packs is undertaken in accordance with procedures that have been approved by independent medical experts. Where officers deliver medication via Webster Packs the Webster Packs are returned to the Health Centre as part of the control process where nurses review the medication delivered and note the detainee’s medical chart accordingly. Webster Packs were introduced at Baxter IDF due to intimidating behaviour by detainees towards nursing staff who previously dispensed after hours medication from trolleys at the accommodation units. The Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs’ (DIMIA) records indicate that on 1 December 2004 a detainee advised that he had been provided with medication of a type that he no longer required on 29 November 2004. The Detention Services Provider (DSP) was asked to investigate the matter. DIMIA was advised that the detainee had left the IDF and that no medication was provided to the detainee on the date in question. Neither DIMIA nor the DSP is aware of any other incidents involving incorrect medication other than that described above, which has not been substantiated. Foreign Nationals (Question No. 1932) Ms Roxon asked the Attorney-General, in writing, on 9 August 2005: (1) What were the grounds for the decision to waive the jurisdiction of the Queensland courts to try Lance Corporal Craig Meeks and Staff Sergeant Beryl Wilson Jr in relation to the alleged assault and attempted murder of Mr Heath Twomey of Townsville. (2) Can he explain the process that was followed in making this decision, including details on the date of the decision, the name and position of the decision-maker and the information collected before the decision was made. (3) At the time that this decision was made, what assurances or undertakings did the Government receive from the Government of the United States of America as to the steps that would be taken to ensure that Lance Corporal Meeks and Staff Sergeant Wilson would face charges for the alleged assault and attempted murder of Mr Twomey. (4) Did the Government request that the US military proceedings in this matter take place in Townsville or elsewhere in Australia; if so, on what grounds was this request denied. (5) What steps did the Government take to ensure that Mr Twomey or other Townsville-based witnesses could give evidence in the US military proceedings. (6) What steps did the Government take to monitor the conduct of this matter through the US military justice system. (7) What steps, if any, did the Government take to assist the US authorities that investigated and tried this matter, including assistance to prosecutors. (8) When did the Government first become aware that no charges had been laid against Lance Corporal Meeks and that Staff Sergeant Wilson had been acquitted. (9) What steps did the Government take to ensure that Mr Twomey and his family were informed of developments in the matter, including the acquittal and the decision not to lay charges. (10) Why has he failed to acknowledge or reply to correspondence (dated 5 March 2005 and 24 May 2005) on this matter from Mr Michael Reynolds, Member for Townsville in the Queensland Parliament. (11) Since 1996, how many times has the Government waived the jurisdiction of an Australian, State or Territory court to try foreign nationals accused of crimes committed in Australia so that the foreign nationals could be tried in another country. (12) In respect of each occasion since 1996 that the Government has waived the jurisdiction of an Australian, State or Territory court, (a) what were the details of the case including the alleged crime, (b) what were the grounds for the waiver, (c) which other country was involved, and (d) what was the outcome of trial in that country. (1) The decision-maker considered a broad range of factors such as the views and wishes of the complainant, the need to deter recurrence of the alleged conduct by visiting forces, the length of the trial processes in each jurisdiction, the comparative penalties in each jurisdiction and the comparative costs of trial in each jurisdiction. (2) The decision was made on 19 May 2004, by Robert Cornall, Secretary of the Attorney-General’s Department. The following information was collected before the decision was made: the views of Mr Heath Twomey, the views of the Queensland Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, the difference in penalties, the comparative costs in either case and who would bear them, and the difference in compensation arrangements. (3) The decision to waive Australia’s jurisdiction in this case was made on the basis that the marines would be appropriately tried under US military laws, which comprise disciplinary as well as criminal sanctions. (4) No. (5) Once transferred, the United States has jurisdiction and it is not appropriate for Australia to interfere in the United States’ proceedings.",231,Questions In Writing
370,Mr Ruddock,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(6) Once jurisdiction was transferred, the United States had the responsibility to update Mr Twomey about the proceedings. Since finding out about the outcome in this case, the Government sought further information from the US about the handling of this matter. It is regrettable that the US did not inform the complainant about the outcome of this matter. However, the Government has since been advised that the US has spoken and written to the complainant about the approach to the trial and its outcome. (7) The matter was thoroughly investigated by the US military, with the cooperation of the Queensland Police. (8) The Department contacted the US Embassy on 21 April 2005, to enquire about the Meeks and Wilson case and was informed of the outcome. (9) Since finding out about the outcome in this case, the Government sought further information from the US about the handling of this matter. It is regrettable that the US did not inform the complainant about the outcome of this matter. However, the Government has since been advised that the US has spoken and written to the complainant about the approach to the trial and its outcome. (10) I replied to both of these letters on 7 July 2005. (11) Since 1996, the Government has waived jurisdiction under section 10 of the Defence (Visiting Forces) Act 1963 over four individuals. (12) Request1 (a) Charged with rape and sexual intercourse without consent, (b) the alleged victim and the relevant state Director of Public Prosecutions supported the waiver, (c) the United States, and (d) 18 years confinement, reduced to lowest military grade and dishonourable discharge. Request2 (a) Charged with being an accessory to rape, (b) the alleged victim and the relevant state Director of Public Prosecutions supported the waiver, (c) the United States, (d) 2 years confinement, reduced to lowest military grade, ‘total forfeiture’ (ie no pay), and dishonourable discharge. Request3 (a) Charged with aggravated assault, (b) the alleged victim and the relevant state Director of Public Prosecutions supported the waiver, (c) the United States, (d) investigated by US and charges not progressed. Request4 (a) Charged with attempted murder, (b) the alleged victim and the relevant state Director of Public Prosecutions supported the waiver, (c) the United States, and (d) acquitted. Classified Material (Question No. 1956) Mr Kelvin Thomson asked the Attorney-General, in writing, on 9 August 2005: (1) In respect of the provisions of the Commonwealth Protective Security Survey Manual regarding checks on Top Secret files, what audit procedures have been undertaken by his department to identify problems in the management, security and location or retention of classified material held by Commonwealth agencies from 1998 to the present (2) Have any of the audits identified discrepancies in the management, security and location or retention of classified material held by Commonwealth agencies. (3) In respect of the correspondence between Deputy Secretary, Mr Miles Jordana, and the Herald Sun reporter, Mr Mark Dunn, dated 29 June 2005 which confirmed that the Attorney-General’s Department holds material “coming into the ambit” of an FOI request lodged by Mr Dunn and that the material identifies a number of ‘discrepancies’ of the type mentioned in his request, how many discrepancies have been identified. (4) What is the nature of the discrepancies and do any of the discrepancies constitute security breaches. (5) Were any of the discrepancies identified in relation to classified documents; if so, how many classified documents were involved and at what security level were these documents classified. (6) What specific steps have been taken by the department since the first security discrepancies were identified to prevent further breaches or discrepancies from occurring. (7) Can he confirm that the view of his department as expressed in the decision not to release information relating to security discrepancies that “vulnerabilities and weaknesses in the storing and retention of such material are likely to exist within the Department” is correct. (1) Responsibility for the management of classified material rests with each agency’s Chief Executive Officer/Secretary. Each Department is responsible for auditing their own security procedures. Australian Government agencies complete an annual survey on their protective security compliance and the results are considered by Government. The Attorney-General’s Department Security Unit is responsible for security audits internally. (2) The Department does not conduct protective security audits of other Australian Government agencies. The internal audits conducted by the Department’s Security Unit noted minor discrepancies in the management, security and location of the Department’s information holdings. (3) The information recorded is largely qualitative in nature and cannot be readily converted to numbers or statistics. (4) The discrepancies noted in the internal audits related to procedural errors in the management of Departmental information holdings. These were minor. Identifying and monitoring these procedural errors assisted the Department to improve its security practices. (5) These discrepancies related to classified and unclassified documents and files at varying classifications. All breaches were minor and so no investigations were undertaken. The exact number of documents was not recorded in the audit reports, as the reports commonly focused on the procedural weaknesses in the affected areas. (6) The Department has conducted and continues to conduct security audits and make recommendations for improving security practice. The results of these audits are monitored and targeted security training is provided where necessary. The Department also has in place a security awareness training program for all staff. (7) The answer is no. The response provided to Mr Dunn was that: “The material sought by you identifies the type of vulnerabilities and weaknesses in the storing and retention of such material that are unavoidably likely to exist within the Department from time to time.” The discrepancies identified within the Department have been of a minor nature and therefore were not investigated. The Department undertakes security awareness training and continues to monitor security procedures to ensure compliance with the standards detailed in the Protective Security Manual. New Apprenticeships Employer Incentive Scheme (Question No. 1978) Ms Macklin asked the Minister for Vocational and Technical Education, in writing, on 9 August 2005: (1) What are the fifty qualifications for which the highest number of incentive payments were made under the New Apprenticeship Employer Incentive Scheme for (a) 2001, (b) 2002, (c) 2003, and (d) 2004.",234,Questions In Writing
371,Mr Ruddock,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(2) For each of the qualifications listed in part (1), what was the total value of the payments for (a) 2001, (b) 2002, (c) 2003, and (d) 2004. The following four tables list the fifty New Apprenticeships qualifications against which the highest number of New Apprenticeships employer incentives payments have been made, as well as total amount of incentives paid against each of those qualifications for the calendar years 2001, 2002, 2003 and 2004. The totalled payments cover the full range of the New Apprenticeships Incentives Programme, including commencement, progression and completion payments as well as special and additional incentives. It is important to note that there is no direct correlation between the number and value of claims as this information reflects only those claims submitted by employers. You should also note that traditional trades qualifications are under-represented in these tables because until recently most traditional trade apprenticeships were conducted using different qualification codes for each State and Territory. Most apprenticeships are now covered by single National Training Package qualifications and this is reflected in the higher position in the 2004 table for occupations such as electricians, carpenters and hairdressers.

Baxter Detention Centre (Question No. 2102) Dr Lawrence asked the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, in writing, on 17 August 2005: (1) What enquiries did the Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs, as the Acting Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, make before issuing the statement on 26 April that “All people working as psychologists at immigration detention facilities are appropriately trained and registered with relevant agencies” in response to credible information that unregistered psychologists were practising at the Baxter Detention Centre in contravention of South Australian law and in clear breach of the Detention Services Contract between DIMIA and GSL. (2) Is the Minister aware that the South Australian Psychological Board pursued the matter and found that the psychologists were not registered and consequently advised them that any further breaches of the law would be referred to the Crown Solicitor’s office for prosecution. (3) Can the Minister account for, or explain, the Acting Minister’s apparent error in this matter. (4) What action has the Minister taken to improve the process by which statements are issued from (a) the Minister’s and (b) the Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs’ office since becoming aware that the statement issued on 26 April 2005 was incorrect. (5) In respect of the breach of clause 7.1.9 of the Detention Services Contract between DIMIA and GSL which requires that “All detainees must be able to access timely and effective primary health care, including psychological and psychiatric services. At all times, care needs must be identified and delivered by qualified, registered and appropriately trained health care professionals” can the Minister provide the date on which GSL informed DIMIA of the Default that occurred, as it is required to do under clause 8.1.1 of the Detention Services Contract. (6) Can the Minister advise whether DIMIA has issued a Default Notice under clause 8.1.2(a) in relation to this matter. Mr John Cobb-The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member’s question: (1) to (4) The intent of the statement of 26 April 2005 referred to the training and registration of psychologists employed on an ongoing basis, all of whom were registered with the appropriate professional board in a state of Australia. After investigation by my Department, this remains the case. However, after further investigation, it is true that two psychologists who provided short-term relief services at Baxter Immigration Detention Facility (IDF) had omitted to obtain mutual recognition of registration in South Australia in advance of this. They obtained the proper registration on 2 May and 4 May 2005 respectively and both apologised in writing to the South Australian Psychological Board for their oversight. The Acting Minister’s statement was not intended to mislead. It was interpreted in a way that was not anticipated at the time. The relevant officer has apologised to me for not being clearer in preparing the statement. After requests for more detailed information, on 7 July 2005 the Detention Services Provider (GSL Australia) advised my Department of a total of fifteen instances in which visiting psychologists providing services at the Christmas Island Immigration Reception and Processing Centre and Baxter IDF had failed to comply with state mutual recognition registration requirements while providing short-term relief or visiting services. In all cases, there is no indication that the psychologist involved did not have the appropriate skills and training to provide psychological services. All psychologists were trained and properly registered to work as psychologists in the state in which they usually worked. (5) to (6) My Department does not consider that clause 7.1.9 of schedule 2 of the Detention Services Contract was breached in these instances as the health care professionals were in fact registered as psychologists in other states and there is no suggestion that they were not appropriately qualified and trained to provide psychological services to detainees. However, my Department does consider that there were breaches of Immigration Detention Standard 7.1.3, which requires staff to be registered in the state or territory where they are working. My Department has made it clear to GSL that these breaches are totally unacceptable. Significant sanctions were imposed on GSL as a result of the breaches. New Apprenticeship Centres (Question No. 2114) Mr Martin Ferguson asked the Minister for Vocational and Technical Education, in writing, on 18 August 2005: (1) For each financial year since the Government opened New Apprenticeship Centres (NACs), (a) what sum has the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (ACCI) been allocated to operate NACs, and (b) in which locations has the ACCI operated NACs. (2) For each financial year since the Government opened New Apprenticeship Centres (NACs) and for each NAC, how many (a) new apprenticeships and (b) traditional trade apprenticeships have been (i) commenced and (ii) completed. (3) For each financial year since the Government opened New Apprenticeship Centres (NACs), in which skill area and with which employers have ACCI operated NACs achieved new apprenticeships and traditional trade apprenticeships to completion.",237,Questions In Writing

Note that completion data on TYIMS is not comprehensive as employers are only obliged to report successful completions to their New Apprenticeships Centre where they wish to claim a completion incentive. The definition of apprentices uses a TYIMS identifier which classifies individual qualifications into an apprenticeship or traineeship according to how the qualification is assessed in a majority of States/ Territories. This definition may differ from that used by other organisations. In responding to this question traditional trade apprenticeships have been identified as ‘Apprentices’ in the tables.

traditional trade apprenticeships completions since 1 May 1998 recorded against New Apprenticeships Centres affiliated with the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry by the National Training Package (skill area) in which the New Apprentice was undertaking training. Note that completion data on TYIMS is not comprehensive as employers are only obliged to report successful completions to their New Apprenticeships Centre where they wish to claim a completion incentive. The definition of apprentices uses a TYIMS identifier which classifies individual qualifications into an apprenticeship or traineeship according to how the qualification is assessed in a majority of States/ Territories. This definition may differ from that used by other organisations. The financial year shown relates to the date of completion of the New Apprenticeship. As a result data will increase over time as more completions are recorded on TYIMS with completion dates in those financial years. All data is drawn TYIMS as at 26 August 2005.

Industry by the Australian and New Zealand Standard Industrial Classification (ANZSIC) industry of the employer. Individual employer names could not be provided in response to this question as this would generate over 50,000 rows of data. Note that completion data on TYIMS is not comprehensive as employers are only obliged to report successful completions to their New Apprenticeships Centre where they wish to claim a completion incentive. The definition of apprentices uses a TYIMS identifier which classifies individual qualifications into an apprenticeship or traineeship according to how the qualification is assessed in a majority of States/ Territories. This definition may differ from that used by other organisations. The financial year shown relates to the date of completion of the New Apprenticeship. As a result data will increase over time as more completions are recorded on TYIMS with completion dates in those financial years. All data is drawn TYIMS as at 26 August 2005.

As a result data will increase over time as more completions are recorded on TYIMS with completion dates in those financial years. All data is drawn TYIMS as at 26 August 2005.

Integrated Humanitarian Settlement Strategy (Question No. 2237) Ms Hoare asked the Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs, in writing, on 5 September 2005: (1) Can the Minister confirm that the Government is seeking ways to encourage migrants and refugees to settle in regional areas. (2) What is the Government doing so that in encouraging the regional settlement of migrants and refugees care is taken to ensure that resettlement is consolidated and that value is placed on the knowledge, networks and industry insight of the ‘local connection’. (3) Is the Minister aware that the tender to provide the Integrated Humanitarian Settlement Strategy (IHSS) in the Newcastle and Hunter Region has been conferred on a consortium led by the Australian Centre for Languages (ACL) which is a Sydney-based, for profit, company with no local history or reputation in the Newcastle and Hunter region. (4) Is the Minister aware that with only a month before the new contracts for IHSS delivery commence, ACL has (a) shown no evidence of its client focus or seamless service delivery in the critical weeks of the roll-out, (b) paid one half-hour visit to the area, and (c) made one phone call to Centrelink in the region.",246,Questions In Writing
374,Dr Nelson,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(5) Is the Minister concerned that ACL has shown a lack of commitment to the regional settlement of migrants and refugees and has ignored local knowledge, insight and expertise; if not, can the Minister explain the basis on which the Government is satisfied with ACL’s commitment to the settlement of migrants and refugees in the Newcastle and Hunter Region. (6) Will the Minister ensure that local expertise will be included in the current and future tenders for IHSS service delivery; if not, why not. Mr John Cobb-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (1) Yes, in line with the recommendations of the 2003 Report of the Review of Settlement Services for Migrants and Humanitarian Entrants and the Government’s broader strategy to increase regional migration, the Australian Government is actively encouraging new arrivals to settle in regional Australia. (2) The Australian Government is aware of the need to ensure that the appropriate settlement services are in place to cater for the particular needs of humanitarian entrants, family stream migrants and family members of skilled migrants with low English proficiency. In addition to available mainstream services, the Government delivers targeted assistance through the Integrated Humanitarian Settlement Strategy (IHSS), the Adult Migrant English Program (AMEP) and the Community Settlement Services Scheme (CSSS). (3) Yes, the contract to provide IHSS services in the Northern Metropolitan Region in NSW, encompassing the Newcastle and Hunter Region, has been awarded to a consortium led by the Australian Centre for Languages (ACL) and including Resolve FM, Mission Australia and STARTTS as partners. (4) There is significant evidence of the ACL consortium’s strong client focus and commitment to service delivery in the Newcastle and Hunter Region. Both Mission Australia and STARTTS have offices in Newcastle and ACL is acquiring an office in Newcastle. ACL is implementing a transition plan which was agreed by my Department and which includes a number of actions to facilitate a smooth transition to service delivery under the new arrangements. (5) Given that IHSS service delivery under new contracts does not begin until 1 October there is no evidence to suggest that the ACL consortium is not committed to the settlement of migrants and refugees in the Newcastle and Hunter Region. On the contrary, implementation activity already undertaken indicates that the consortium has a strong commitment to both regional settlement and to the utilisation of local knowledge. (6) Local knowledge and expertise was a requirement of the current IHSS tender and will be in any future IHSS tender. Sudanese Refugees (Question No. 2245) Mr Price asked the Minister for Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs, in writing, on 6 September 2005: (1) For (a) 2002, (b) 2003, (c) 2004, and (d) 2005, how many Sudanese refugees have been settled (i) in total and (ii) in each federal electoral division. (2) For (a) 2002, (b) 2003, (c) 2004, and (d) 2005, how many other refugees from the African continent have been settled (i) in total and (ii) in each federal electoral division. (3) For (a) 2002, (b) 2003, (c) 2004, and (d) 2005, how many migrants from the African continent have been settled (i) in total and (ii) in each federal electoral division. Mr John Cobb-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: The information requested is not available by federal electorate without a very considerable investment of resources. The following information shows the State or Territory of settlement of refugee and other migrant entrants at 31 August 2005, by country of birth. For the purposes of this question, refugees have been defined as persons processed within visa subclasses 200 217 (Refugee& Humanitarian overseas sub-classes) and visa sub-class 866 (onshore Permanent Protection). The data does not include Temporary Protection Visa holders. (1) Sudanese refugees by State/Territory of settlement.

Job Network Providers (Question No. 2275) Ms Bird asked the Minister for Workforce Participation, in writing, on 6 September 2005: (1) Is he aware that Job Network providers are requesting that job seekers with a disability, such as epilepsy, should not advise a potential employer of their disability in job interviews? (2) What are the guidelines for Job Network providers on advising job seekers of their obligation to disclose disabilities to potential employers. (1) No. The Department of Employment and Workplace Relations has not directed Job Network members to request job seekers with a disability not to advise potential employers. (2) Job Network members are bound by the Employment Services Contract 2003-2006 to comply with all relevant Australian laws, including anti-discrimination laws, in their dealings with job seekers. The Department of Employment and Workplace Relations maintains a dedicated web site, JobAble, to provide a wide range of information and strategies to assist Job Network members in servicing people with disabilities as well as information for employers. JobAble provides links to the Disability Discrimination Act 1992, including that recruitment questions about an applicant’s disability should be linked to the requirements of the vacancy.",288,Questions In Writing
