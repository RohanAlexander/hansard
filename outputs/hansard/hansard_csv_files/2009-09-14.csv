House adjourned at 10 pm The following notice was given: Mr Albanese to present a bill for an act to amend legislation relating to telecommunications, and for other purposes. Monday, 14 September 2009 ----Maranoa Electorate: Mobile Internet Safety issue that is a threat not only to the safety of young people in my electorate of Maranoa but also to young people across Australia-indeed, to anyone who has access to the internet through a mobile phone. I am raising the issue of mobile internet safety in the parliament today because of concerns brought to me by a constituent. While I am not going to go into any further detail, the story she told me was any parent’s nightmare. Over the past decade, with our ever-increasing reliance on the internet for communication, families have become more aware of the potential dangers of an online presence. Many people know never to provide personal details to anyone they do not know or trust. And many children are aware that they should never meet in person with any friends that they have made through chat forums over the internet. The former coalition government and this government have made great efforts to educate families about the dangers of the internet. The federal government provided a free content filter for home computers, before it was abolished by Labor over the Christmas season, so that families could protect their children from viewing inappropriate content on the web. Two years ago, Choice magazine rated 15 net filtering software programs, with three of the top six being government supplied. Yet one area which we should be focusing on is the safety of young people who access the internet through their mobile phones. Today’s mobile phones are capable of doing almost everything that can be done on a home computer. People can check their Facebook, MySpace, Twitter and email. They can watch YouTube, they can use Skype and they can go online to forums to supposedly get help with games or to chat with a friend-and, of course, chat with complete strangers. I am sure there are a lot of parents out there who are not aware of the potential dangers their children face when accessing the internet through their mobile phone. Many parents provide their children with mobile phones so that they can be easily contacted and have a means of contacting their family or authorities if they run into trouble. Yet because children can use mobile phones anywhere at any time, it is difficult for parents to keep an eye on what their children are viewing through the mobile’s internet, but the same threats to children that are lurking on the home internet also exist on mobile internet. Paedophiles can and will try to find their next victim through any means, and mobile internet is just another playground for their criminal practices. But parents can protect their children, even if they are not around when their children are using a mobile phone. Parents can call their mobile provider and ask to have an internet blocking on their children’s phones. They must also teach their children that the same rules that apply to the home computer are the ones they want them to use on their mobile phones. (Time expired) MAIN COMMITTEE",159,Adjournment

235,Mr Bruce Scott (Maranoa) (4.00 Pm),"I rise this afternoon to discuss a very seriousFowler Electorate: Disabilities by Michael Rutherford, a high school student residing in my electorate of Fowler who recently undertook work experience in my electorate office. I quote: In 21st century Australia, we as a people should value and respect the rights of our fellow Australians, regardless of individual circumstance, including mental and physical disability. Those sentiments are echoed around the world. In 2006-2007 the United Nations adopted and opened for the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. Australia was one of the 83 countries which signed the convention on its opening day, but it took a new change of government to ratify the convention in July 2008. I am pleased to say that last month Australia ratified the optional protocol that accompanies the convention. This protocol allows individuals who feel their needs are not met by the government to ultimately take their case to the UN Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities if all domestic avenues of appeal are exhausted. I congratulate the government for ratifying the protocol. This will clarify the domestic avenues of appeal for disabled citizens who have a complaint. We have nothing to fear of our treatment of the disabled. I believe that this government should have a direct role in the research and development of communication technology, such as braille, mobility devices such as wheelchairs, and assistance devices such as hoists, and provide these technologies at an affordable cost. This would align us further with the convention. The convention requires that governments engage in consultation with the disabled, through disability organisations, when developing related policy. I congratulate the government on its current level of consultation with these groups and hope that this continues so that high quality policies can be developed in the future. One of these is the recent Helping Children with Autism program, which is an important step forward and will provide much needed assistance to thousands of families with autistic children. The provision of preschools for autistic children is crucial in delivering the education that these children deserve. It is a base from which we can build policies for children suffering from other disabilities such as Down syndrome, cerebral palsy and others. While the autism policy focuses mainly on children aged 6 and under there is room to expand the policy to provide greater support for autistic children in primary and secondary schooling and into adulthood. I believe that this government is committed to providing a greater standard of living for Australians with a disability. I urge the Rudd government to continue to build on the United Nations convention so that disabled Australians can actively participate in all aspects of our society. I congratulate Michael on his excellent research and speech. I give my regards to his wonderful sister and his beautiful parents. MAIN COMMITTEE",162,Constituency Statements
236,Mrs Irwin (Fowler) (4.03 Pm),"My speech this afternoon was researched and preparedSpark of Life Club Program constituents, who has just received a prestigious international healthcare award for the Spark of Life Club Program, which is making significant inroads into the treatment of people with dementia. The Spark of Life approach won the 2009 IAHSA Excellence in Ageing Services Award and was deemed to be a model of innovation and excellence by the International Association of Homes and Services for the Ageing awards committee. Dementia Care Australia, based in Mooroolbark, is a small, independent, self-funded information and education organisation founded in 1993 by Jane Verity, who developed the Spark of Life Club Program. Hilary Lee implemented the program in Perth and experienced the spectacular changes brought about by the Spark of Life approach. She has since clinically researched the program. Both Jane and Hilary flew to London to receive the award in front of 700 high-level executives and representatives from the major aged-care organisations worldwide. The award ceremony was followed by a reception at the House of Lords, where they were personally thanked by Baroness Greengross, OBE. As Jane Verity said on receiving the award: Receiving this award is a great acknowledgement of the significance and uniqueness of this powerful program. I hope this Award will take the Spark of Life to many more facilities in Australia and the international arena, bringing benefits to thousands more people around the world. All of us here have seen in our families, among our friends and in our communities the traumas that dementia brings to those diagnosed and to their loved ones. I am a supporter of the Spark of Life. I have seen it grow from humble beginnings to, now, an internationally recognised program which is giving hope and life to an area that is so often seen as tragic and the start of a downward spiral to the end of life. The program enriches the lives of everyone involved and will greatly benefit Australians with dementia and their carers. So often we go overseas to find solutions, but here we are fortunate to have one on our very own doorstep. I commend Jane Verity and Dementia Care Australia for all the work that they have done, for their contribution and for the greater good their program will bring to many families in the months and years ahead.

It was very pleasing to see many members of this parliament from all sides of politics in attendance, including the Treasurer, who launched the awareness month and also spoke about his own experiences with prostate cancer. Part of the theme was the colour blue-you may have seen the blue badges and blue ties that were worn last week. This widespread blue hue marked the start of the rollout of a myriad blue barbecues around the nation to promote prostate awareness. The barbecues will come with all the trimmings, of course, but in the name of good health. Blue barbecue aprons were given out and are to be worn and blue tongs will promote awareness of prostate cancer. These barbecues will be hosted by men who want to share the importance of knowing about good health and continuing health. This, of course, is all for a good cause: National Prostate Cancer Awareness Month. There are fewer things that men around Australia need to become better aware of.

I encourage all and sundry to spread the word and join the Prostate Cancer Foundation of Australia to raise the community’s awareness of how big a problem this condition is and why people should get themselves checked. The chance of developing prostate cancer increases as men get older and, if there is a family history of prostate cancer, again the chances are high. Early, curable prostate cancer may not have symptoms. However, simple testing by a GP can indicate prostate cancer. These are really simple messages. As is so often the case, the message is not difficult. Getting a person to hear it is the difficult bithence the blue hue and the blue barbecues of last week, which will continue this month.

I may only be 14 years old, but I do know what is right and what is wrong. You are supposed to be sticking up for all Australians. Let me guess, did your government fund all the victims of the Victoria Bushfires? Of course you did. All those people had lost homes and belongings, Labor Party or not. It’s hard enough with Australia going through a recession, but when hundreds of Australian homes go under water, you don’t seem to care. You tell Australians not to discriminate against each other, yet you are discriminating to the people of Coffs Harbour all because our member of parliament is with the Nationals. Now what kind of example are you showing to the future adults of Australia? We will be voting in a few years and how do you expect us to vote for you if we know that you won’t help all Australian when they are in crisis? Most of the people who lost their homes are elderly who only have a small retirement fund because they spent it all on the house that just got destroyed. These people are mums and dads, grandparents, neighbours and you can somehow sleep at night knowing that they do not have a home to sleep in too. All Australians are equal, Labor Party or not.

They should treat all Australians equally; they should pay the Coffs Harbour flood of victims in exactly the same way that victims of other flood events were treated and exactly the same way as the victims of the Victorian bushfires were treated. There is no logical reason to have any discrimination between the Victorian victims of fires and the Coffs Harbour victims of floods. It has been absolutely outrageous that this Prime Minister and the Minister for Community Services have abandoned these people. Fourteen-year-old Georgia Newell knows what is right, yet our Prime Minister and our Minister for Community Services cannot seem to get the message. Blaxland Electorate: Bankstown Children’s Festival 15,000 people will converge on Paul Keating Park in Bankstown to celebrate the 11th annual Bankstown Children’s Festival. As I have said before in this place, it is a fantastic event. There is everything from face painting to fireworks. This year the festival will have a new addition. It will officially welcome the new additions to our local community at an event that I am organising called Welcoming the Babies. Bankstown is the baby capital of Sydney. In 2007 there were 2,700 babies born in Bankstown-more than almost anywhere else in Australia. Having a child is one of the most important decisions that we will ever make. This event is a small way to say thank you to those parents and guardians who take on this important responsibility. Australia’s fertility rate has fallen dramatically over the last 50 years. In 1961 the fertility rate was 3.5 children per woman. Today it stands at 1.9. As the second Intergenerational report, released in 2007, shows, the drop in our fertility rate is one of the main factors contributing to the ageing of our population. This in turn will slow economic growth and the rise in living standards and puts more pressure on the budget in areas like health, aged care and the pension. It is the decisions that we make here and that parents and guardians make that will help us meet the challenge of an ageing population. That is why I am organising this event. Every child will receive a special certificate welcoming them to our local community, and every mum and dad will get a bag full of helpful parenting information on things like developing babies’ learning and motor skills, breastfeeding, healthy food options, playgroups, immunisation and toilet training. I want to thank Baby Kingdom, Bounty, Centro Bankstown, Inky Feet, Advent, Church and Dwight Co., Gaia Skin Naturals, Nicepak and Nutricia Australia, who have all donated the information and the products that are going in the bags. I also want to thank Bankstown City Council, who have donated a native tree to each family. I also thank Creating Links, Bankstown Community Resource Group and the Benevolent Society’s Brighter Futures program along with Centrelink Bankstown, who are holding information stalls, and Bankstown Family Day Care, GymbaRoo and Bankstown Library’s Lapsit Storytime program, who are going to provide entertainment on the day.

But last year at that same expo-they are celebrating their 10th year-Professor David de Kretser, who you would know better as our state Governor and who is Patron of Andrology Australia, which deals with men’s health, male reproductive health and associated conditions, requested that we have information for men at the Dairy Expo this year. Peter Ryan and I have put together a package, with the support of our great staff, to have that information at the stand. There will be a diabetes stand as well at the Dairy Expo from 23 to 24 September at Poowong. It was a very ordinary day, a beautiful day, when in the evening a farmer went down to check his trough. It was normal to check that particular trough just before dinner. He was concerned about it. Dinner was on pretty soon so he had five or 10 minutes to go and check it. He took the old farm ute down, parked the farm ute, pulled on the handbrake and walked around the back of the ute to check the trough. Blow me down; the handbrake gave way and slammed the farmer up against the trough, trapping him. His wife back at the house, knowing that he was ready for dinner, thought he had been a little too long at the trough and was concerned. She could see the ute up there on the hill and it had not moved. She thought it was time to move to go and check. She found that her husband was crushed under the ute behind the trough. He was quickly flown out of there by air ambulance and he is now recuperating in a rehabilitation hospital. I bring this to your attention not because we have farm accidents-they do happen-but because the ute was not registered. It was the old farm ute; therefore in Victoria the farmer would not come under the TAC. My address today is to tell farmers across Australia-if it affects them in the same way-that, if they are using vehicles on their property that are not registered and they have an accident with them, the vehicles are not covered by the TAC. It is a plea from me and every member of this parliament for care in farm safety. Another great plea is: for heaven’s sake cover your loved ones, your family and those who work for you by making sure that the equipment on your farm is registered and can do the job that it is meant to do. Breast Cancer Screening Ms SAFFIN (Page) (4.20 pm)-The matter of breast screening has been in the news lately with the release by the government of the final report by the Evaluation Advisory Committee of the Australian Health Ministers Advisory Council into BreastScreening Australia. This committee was chaired by the eminent Helen Zorbas. It puts forward a number of recommendations. One is contentious-not in terms of the medical evidence but because it is about access to medical assessment and medical care that can and does save lives. The recommendation says: Women aged 40-44 years and women aged 75 years and overI noticed that the latter age was not so contentious in the mediashould no longer be able to attend the program. I have read the report and, because I was for a long time involved with the North Coast BreastScreen program and was the president of it, I know a fair bit about it and why it has MAIN COMMITTEE",166,Constituency Statements
241,Mr Broadbent (Mcmillan) (4.17 Pm),"I have come not to talk about Poowong Dairycome about. However, we do not want to deny access to anything that can help save lives and that can make sure that women get diagnosed. Younger women do get breast cancer. We know that. Women like the late Belinda Emmett, the late Jane McGrath and now Kylie Minogue have been in the media recently, as have women not previously known: Josie Dietrich, Wendy Bryant and Therese Dunn. Therese Dunn is from Wollongbar in my seat of Page. She is 44 and, according to the Northern Star coverage of Therese’s story, she was diagnosed at 40. She had some comments to make about this. Also, in my home town, our Mayor of Lismore, Jenny Dowell, herself a cancer survivor, said: Once women hit 40 I would be concerned that there is no free screening for them. She said: Resources for breast screening should increase. I have a few figures about breast screening. Currently, 36 women in Australia are diagnosed with breast cancer every day. I have some New South Wales figures-and these are from the Cancer Institute New South Wales in 2005-which show: Most women who develop breast cancer are aged 50 years or over. Of the 4,103 women in NSW diagnosed with breast cancer in 2003, 76.7% (3,148) were women in this age groupgenerally up to 69. The figures continue: In comparison, 17.5% (718)that is still quite highwere women aged 40 to 49 yearsso some of them were in that target areaand 5.8% (237) were women aged 39 years or younger. It would be a real tragedy if some of them were denied access. I would also like to raise the issue that in my area, under the North Coast Area Health Service, there is a breast screen program that operates. There has been a loss of mobile units and three breast cancer survivors have written to me asking to meet me to talk about this. (Time expired) Cowan Electorate: Wanneroo Districts Netball Association Wanneroo Districts Netball Association. This association operates up at the Kingsway Regional Sporting Complex in the electorate of Cowan. For a long time they have been adding great value for the young women of the northern suburbs. In fact, I doubt whether any young lady from the northern suburbs of Perth would not be aware that the heart of netball is at Kingsway Regional Sporting Complex and the Wanneroo Districts Netball Association. My eldest daughter has participated in netball and, as we approach the spring season starting next month, I hope to have my 10-year-old and six-year-old daughters participating in this very fine sport. I understand that netball is the second biggest sport in Australia in terms of participants. That is a great example of what a great sport it is and how it is regarded by the people. On Saturday morning I was honoured to be able to attend the Wanneroo Districts Netball Association awards breakfast. I would like to acknowledge that, at that breakfast, the Spirit of Netball award was won by Irene McCoach, the Junior Spirit of Netball award was won by MAIN COMMITTEE",167,Constituency Statements

I would also like to acknowledge the president and vice-president of the association, Joanne Clark and Peter Brems, and the board members of the association, Lauren Bridges, Patricia Taylor, Estelle Walker and Bev Hyde. As I said before, this is the second biggest sport in Australia in terms of participants. A lot of teams participate in the association and literally hundreds of volunteers make sure that all of the teams can play on the weekends. We are talking about coaches, managers, umpires and club administrators. I would just like to say what a brilliant association they are and what great value they add for young women in the northern suburbs of Perth. It is a great honour for me to have them within the electorate of Cowan. Horse Racing Services and Parliamentary Secretary for Victorian Bushfire Reconstruction) (4.26 pm)-This is the time of year when Australia’s racing industry is usually preparing for another spectacular spring carnival and season of great racing. However, the industry is locked into a dispute over changes to rules governing how jockeys can use the whip. I had the privilege in a previous occupation, with the Australian Workers Union, of representing jockeys. This afternoon I wish to speak in support of jockeys and their organisation, the Australian Jockeys Association, in representing the valid concerns raised by their members and others in the racing industry. I acknowledge the member for Solomon and his interest for allowing me to take his threeminute statement. I commend the Australian Racing Board for meeting with the AJA and senior riders this afternoon to resolve differences. The issue at the heart of the debate, which has seen recent industrial action taken by jockeys, is changes to the Australian Rules of Racing in the use of the whip. Under the new rules, which came in on 1 August, jockeys can still use the whip in a backhand fashion behind the saddle, but rules about using the whip with a forehand grip have changed. Under the new rules, a jockey is allowed to use the whip five times up to the last 200 metres, and then, in the last 200 metres, on 12 occasions in a non-consecutive pattern, there being 24 strides for the horse in the last 200 metres-except on one occasion, where the jockey can use it in a consecutive pattern. These new rules are very confusing to long standing jockeys. The Australian jockeys understand that change is inevitable, and there is debate about animal welfare, integrity in racing and the need to have competition. But these rules have been brought in on 1 August and the Australian jockeys have reported that to change a work practice and the skill of riding a thoroughbred, which is a complex and athletic feat, requires more notice and debate than has been allowed the jockeys. I can report that the Australian Racing Board is ably led by chairman Bob Bentley and CEO Andrew Harding. I believe they understand that they need to listen to the concerns that have been raised by Australian jockeys, particularly when these views are shared by many owners, trainers and breeders. Australia’s 850 working jockeys are superb, committed, fearless and hard working. Professional jockeys love to race, they care for the horses, they risk their safety and they are at the heart of the industry. I do not believe they have taken the decision not to ride lightly. The AJA advises me the situation is caused by a breakdown of communication. What we now need to MAIN COMMITTEE",168,Constituency Statements
243,Mr Shorten (Maribyrnong,"Parliamentary Secretary for Disabilities and Children’ssee in racing in order to secure the spring carnival is what we are seeing the first signs of today, ongoing negotiations. I know the jockeys care very much for their colleagues. They understand that when they ride it could be their last time and that, following a fall, when they wake up in a hospital bed, they may be unable to walk, if indeed they wake up at all. I know the stories of jockeys such as Gavin Lisk. I believe the meeting this afternoon should be successful and I hope that the impasse is resolved. 193 the time for members’ constituency statements has concluded. Second Reading Debate resumed from 20 June, on motion by Mr Bowen: That this bill be now read a second time. Corporations Legislation Amendment (Financial Services Modernisation) Bill 2009. Ostensibly the bill looks to bring margin lending, trustee companies and promissory notes under nationally uniform regulation in the Corporations Act. The regulation of all financial services in a nationally consistent manner has long been considered a desirable outcome by industry, government and consumers. Indeed, the last Howard government tried to achieve the same ends. Perhaps they were stopped by the intransigence of some of the states. Whether that is the case or not, the good result is that this bill brings the last vestiges under federal control and, more importantly, under the statutory authority’s watch-that being ASIC. It is disappointing that it takes cataclysmic events in investment and financial losses to achieve end-states that had previously been pushed for. In the recent collapse of Westpoint disaster, debentures provided to retail clients were subject to the Corporations Act, chapter 7, Disclosures and consumer protection provisions, but promissory notes were not, and Westpoint proved to be a disaster for those investing in the promissory note financial products. Of course the massive regulatory problems surrounding margin lending in the collapse of Storm Financial in 2008 have been highlighted to the inquiry by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services. Being a sitting member of that committee and having attended many of the inquiries, I have noted that the publicly available submissions and the evidence given in public have pointed to a lack of consistency and regulation and to significant confusion over advisers’ and lenders’ responsibilities. Who was responsible in providing a margin call to consumers? We know that in June 2008, according to Reserve Bank information, there were over 206,000 clients using margin lending facilities. We know that by September 2008 there were something like 2,000 margin calls a day being exercised. Yet, ironically, none were being exercised on Storm Financial customers. Even the Ts and Cs of the bank lenders, like Colonial First State as part of Commonwealth, showed clearly that the bank would provide the margin call to the consumer. There is some indication that the bank had an arrangement with Storm Financial that meant Storm would represent the client. Indeed, clients never received margin calls, were never able to exercise those options, index funds were sold down and $3 billion to $4 billion was lost. Any move to MAIN COMMITTEE",169,Constituency Statements
244,The Deputy Speaker (Ms Ae Burke),Order! In accordance with standing order,170,Corporations Legislation Amendment Financial Services Modernisation Bill 2009
245,Mr Robert (Fadden) (4.30 Pm),"I rise to make a few brief statements in support of theprovide a degree of regulation that is sensible and open, that people can look at and understand to avoid huge losses, is certainly a wise move. The federal regulation of consistent oversight by ASIC can only be a good thing. In terms of actual objectives of the bill with margin lending, there will be a licensing of lenders and advisers, and all will require an Australian financial services licence. There will be a clarification under chapter 7 of the Corporations Act of margin call responsibilities-who is responsible for the margin call, who is responsible to ensure communication, and how that will be achieved to the person receiving the margin call. Enhanced investor protections are also being put in place, which include responsible lending provisions that are subsequently being put through by regulation. At present I am not across what the regulation is. It would be preferable if this predilection towards regulation would obey, and the legislative instrument-the act itself-would contain, the provisions. However, my understanding is that responsible lending provisions will come about through regulation. There is also a move to standardise disclosure documents, and that is a healthy thing. The national uniformity with respect to trustee companies will allow companies to operate across multiple state jurisdictions, obviously without the different laws and the complying costs that go with that. It is understanding that financial services cross state boundaries and that they are, indeed, Australian financial services. This is long overdue. Of course, promissory notes will be regulated in the same manner as debentures, and they will be subject to additional disclosure and regulatory requirements. To be able to stand here and look at the last vestiges of financial services being brought across to the Commonwealth is a great thing for the industry. It is a good thing that margin lending, trustee companies and promissory notes will come under uniform national regulation, especially under chapter 7 of the Corporations Act as it regards regulation and disclosure, and that one statutory authority, in the form of ASIC, will be responsible for compliance and regulatory oversight. As communications break down our state boundaries more and more, we need to look towards nationalising key areas like financial services so that there is one regime in which people operate, one body which provides oversight and one body of legislation which provides the necessary guidance. I commend the bill to the House. He is a member of the committee that has been looking into Storm Financial and the effect on many lenders when margin calls were made, and that inquiry has turned everybody’s attention to these issues. Through the proposed amendment of the Corporations Act, this government is implementing the reforms necessary to ensure that responsible financial lending and consumer practices are advanced in this country. I commend the Minister for Financial Services, Superannuation and Corporate Law for delivering an amendment bill at this stage. Not only does this step take us closer to the commitments that were made at COAG but it will help ensure the modernisation of a body of financial lending that has for far too long gone unchecked. The Corporations Legislation Amendment (Financial Services Modernisation) Bill 2009 comes about as a direct recommendation of the Australian Securities and Investment Commission. It is an area of financial services that is not yet adequately regulated by the current corporations legislation. Most importantly, the provisions included in the bill complement MAIN COMMITTEE",170,Corporations Legislation Amendment Financial Services Modernisation Bill 2009
246,Mr Hayes (Werriwa) (4.36 Pm),"I commend the contribution of the member for Fadden.ASIC’s existing authority in two areas: margin lending and trustee companies. Not only will the provisions ensure more responsible lending practices and prudent regulation but they will ultimately serve to protect and strengthen consumer protection in these financial services areas. There are substantial benefits to the realisation of these reforms. Their implementation is necessary to give protection to the many who utilise these services but are vulnerable because of inadequate legislation. The member for Fadden alluded to Storm Financial. That matter is being considered by a parliamentary committee at the moment, but those of us who follow it in the papers would know that over 3,000 people have been affected. People in their retirement were encouraged to take out loans affecting their housing which were subject to a margin call. Three thousand families that thought they were making provision for their retirement and long-term economic security now find themselves very much in the forefront of a financial catastrophe. That catastrophe is not of the making of the economic downturn but a direct result of a margin call being made, as can occur, and those 3,000 families’ exposure was such that they were significantly affected. That is why this is an important and prudent piece of legislation at this time. Over the past decade the use of margin lending has increased dramatically in Australia and, despite the surge in this type of lending, it has really escaped consumer credit regulation and consequently a gap has occurred. There is no point simply focussing on issues such as Storm Financial. We are all being encouraged to look at ways that we could actually make retirement incomes and security, and I think that is a good thing. What has occurred through this process in the practice of margin lending is that areas have been left with a significant degree of exposure because legislation has not been developed that regulates in that respect of a lending practice. In implementing the changes the amendments have targeted lenders by requiring both them and their advisers to be licensed. As a consequence, through ASIC, they will be regulated not only now but into the future. Through that process we can at least ensure consistency and a high level of compliance through the licensing arrangements. Licensing components will provide enhanced, comprehensive and consistent protection for consumers entering into margin loans and will encourage the improvement of standards for margin loans offered by lenders. The proposal also includes provision for guarantees of an enhanced level of responsible lending by preventing lenders from approving unsuitable loans to consumers that may put them at risk of losing their own homes. This new margin loan disclosure document, introduced by these changes, will allow borrowers to be informed in a concise manner of the facts they need to know before entering into such a significant arrangement as a margin loan agreement. This, combined with a dispute resolution process, will actually be able to deliver an independent, expedient and free dispute resolution service. Again, that will act to protect consumers from unnecessary harmful lending practices that have the potential to destroy a family’s future. The government has made extensive efforts to ensure that there is an adequate transition period for the industry and its stakeholders, and a 12-month buffer period has been created to do that. The second aspect of this legislation, as I indicated at the outset, involves legislation relating to trust property and trustee companies. It will alleviate many of the concerns raised by ASIC by extending the existing powers that apply to these financial products. The extension of their authority will allow ASIC to access vital information relating to trust property and MAIN COMMITTEE will increase the control over trustee companies. Allowing ASIC to access greater amounts of information, such as details of the persons involved in a transaction about a trust property, will allow better judgments as to whether they pursue a formal investigation. As a result of increasing their control over trustee companies, ASIC will have the authority over the trust property. In certain circumstances this will prevent the disposal of such property. The other significant aspect is that with the current state based systems, where a trustee company operates in more than one state we find companies being subject to compliance with differing inconsistent authorisations and reporting requirements. By creating a national framework of trustee companies under the authority of ASIC the unnecessary barriers to entry for companies will be eliminated, as well as the compliance costs and burdens associated with that. The benefits of national regulation will also be felt by consumers. The traditional services of trustee companies will be regarded as financial services, and will fall under the consumer protection and disclosure requirements dictated under the Corporations Act 2001. By binding trustee corporations to existing financial product disclosure, licensing, conduct, advice and dispute resolution, these reforms will all move to significantly protect consumers. I commend the legislation to the House. Law and Minister for Human Services) (4.45 pm)-in reply-I thank the honourable members who have spoken on this Corporations Legislation Amendment (Financial Services Modernisation) Bill 2009, particularly the honourable member for Werriwa. This bill will give effect to the COAG agreement to provide for national regulation of margin lending and trustee corporations. The bill will also make long awaited improvements to the regulatory regime covering the issue of debentures. Until now, margin lending has not been subject to any specific regulatory regime at all. This is a serious issue particularly because non-standard margin loans contain some features that borrowers often find difficult to understand. As we saw in the fallout from several recent high-profile financial collapses, when investors put their money into sophisticated financial products they do not fully understand they can stand to lose up to hundreds of thousands of dollars and, sometimes, their family home. Under this bill, lenders and advisers will need to be licensed and regulated by ASIC. Consumers will have access to independent, free and fast dispute resolution services. Importantly, under the new responsible lending requirements, advisers will be required to only provide advice if it is appropriate to the client’s needs and circumstances. A further consumer protection measure clarifies which party is responsible for notifying borrowers when a margin call occurs where both a lender and a financial adviser are involved. In the past, delays in margin call notifications and disagreements between lenders and advisers contributed to losses suffered by consumers. The new margin loan regime provided for by the financial services modernisation bill represents a major and long overdue improvement in consumer protection. The second area covered by the bill is the traditional activities of trustee corporations. These include personal trust and deceased estate administration services. Trustee corporations which carry out these tasks are currently regulated by the states and territories, but the regulaMAIN COMMITTEE",171,Corporations Legislation Amendment Financial Services Modernisation Bill 2009
247,Mr Bowen (Prospect,"Minister for Financial Services, Superannuation and Corporatetory coverage is often inconsistent. Under the Commonwealth system there will be a single licensing regime administered by one single well-resourced regulator, ASIC. Under the financial services modernisation bill, the traditional services of trustee corporations will be deemed to be financial services and will be covered by the consumer protection and disclosure requirements of the Corporations Act 2001 and the ASIC Act 2001. This will ensure that, in providing these services, trustee corporations will be bound by the financial product disclosure licensing conduct advice and dispute resolution provisions of those acts. This will mean greater transparency for trustee corporations and far better protection for consumers. The third area covered by the bill is debentures and promissory notes. The bill will amend the regulatory framework in the Corporations Act to align the regulation and promissory notes with debentures and also provide additional protection for investors by removing uncertainty in the law. This is a much needed change following the collapse of Westpoint, which tried to use the issue of promissory notes with face values of at least $50,000 to avoid the operation of the law. Under the amendments, all promissory notes issued to retail clients will be subject to the same regulatory regime as debentures requiring the issue of a trust deed, the appointment of a trustee and the issue of a prospectus. The amendments will also enhance transparency for debenture holders by creating a publicly available register of debenture trustees. The register will be established and maintained by ASIC. Since the introduction of the bill on 25 June 2009, there have been some proposed changes which are reflected in the parliamentary amendments I will move in the consideration in detail stage. In relation to margin loans, the amendments address the regulatory gap when an issuer of a margin loan uses a subsidiary or another organisation to sell the loan. Currently, the lenders of a margin lending facility can be exempt from obtaining an Australian financial services licence if they rely on another AFSL holder to meet their legal requirements. If so, they could potentially avoid responsible lending and other conduct obligations. To address this issue, I propose to introduce a regulation mechanism to enable issuers of a margin-lending facility to be removed from the exemption, thereby closing a potential avoidance loophole. The regulation-making power will provide the flexibility to address different corporate structures in the margin-lending context and potentially other lending arrangements or products at a later stage. The amendments will also clarify the use of the term ‘provider’ in relation to the margin-lending facility. In relation to trustee corporations, the government is seeking amendments to ensure that ASIC can access certain powers to regulate the industry. The amendments ensure that certain existing ASIC powers are available to it in relation to trust property held by trustee companies. The amendments replicate or amend, as appropriate, certain existing ASIC powers that apply to financial products, so that they can be used in relation to trust property held by a trustee company. In essence, the amendments allow ASIC to obtain information about trust property outside a formal investigation under part 3, divisions 1 and 2 of the ASIC Act and certain information-gathering powers under part 3 of the ASIC Act. Further, the amendments allow ASIC to make certain orders in relation to trust property in certain circumstances. An anomaly MAIN COMMITTEE in the ASIC Act in relation to unconscionable conduct in business transactions is also corrected. In conclusion, by introducing national regulation for margin loans and improving the regulatory framework governing trustee corporations, debentures and promissory notes, this bill will make important changes to the regulatory framework, changes which will bring far greater consistency, clarity and fairness to our consumer credit regulatory regime.

Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee Report Debate resumed from 20 August, on motion by Mr Dreyfus: That the House take note of the report. Disability (Access to Premises-Buildings) Standards addresses many of the inequalities those with a disability encounter when going about their day-to-day activities. I congratulate the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee and its chair, the member for Isaacs, for their work in drawing to the attention of this House the impediments faced by people with a disability in accessing buildings that the rest of us take for granted. Those affected by a lack of access to buildings, and indeed affected by the fitout of some buildings, are not an insignificant group because one in five Australian people are estimated to have a disability-that is 20 per cent of the population. Indeed, I would suggest that number will grow quite rapidly as our country faces the ageing of our population. So it is a very important matter which has been on the agenda for some time. I am not a member of the committee; however, I feel so strongly about this matter that I wanted to take the opportunity to say something about it. I suppose I first became aware of the difficulty people with a disability face when I had ministerial responsibility for disability services in 1996. I have continued to take an interest in these matters, particularly as I moved to the role of chair of the PubMAIN COMMITTEE",175,Corporations Legislation Amendment Financial Services Modernisation Bill 2009

251,Mrs Moylan (Pearce) (4.52 Pm),"Access all areas: report of the inquiry into Draftlic Works Committee, a role that I undertook for nine years-I think it was nine years; it seemed like an awful long time anyway! During that time, I felt very proud of all members of that committee, both in terms of their interest and the interest they took in questioning the adequacy of access for people with a disability in new buildings, and refurbishments, that were being proposed by government agencies, or agencies of the Commonwealth, that came before that committee. Disability does cover many different conditions. It can include people who are wheelchairbound, blind, and indeed, older Australians. People suffering from rheumatism and arthritis sometimes have great difficulties with access to buildings. For those of us who do not face living with these extra challenges, I think, it often escapes our notice that without specific attention to the way buildings are constructed and fitted out, the daily routine for people with a disability can be seriously compromised. The Disability Discrimination Act was passed in this parliament in 1992, just a little before my election to parliament. Its 16 years of operation have highlighted not only some of the positive steps forward in providing for people with a disability within the community by not discriminating against them, but it has also highlighted some of the deficiencies in its operation. Of course it is true that there have been many positive changes, both in accessibility to buildings, and, I think, to community attitudes towards people with a disability. But surprisingly, there are still difficulties and challenges for people with a disability in accessing buildings for work, for necessary services and for leisure. That isolates many people with a disability, both socially and from being able to access the workplace and generally going about their day-to-day business. This report specifically looks critically at the intersection and operation of the Disability Discrimination Act and the Building Code of Australia. While the act enshrines the right of access to premises by people with a disability, it is enforced, in the first instance, through the Australian Human Rights Commission complaints mechanism. But it is up to a person with a disability to take action to have the provision of the act enforced. It is therefore not surprising that few people exercise that right due to the financial and emotional cost of initiating such access. If conciliation is not successful then the aggrieved party must initiate an action in the Federal Magistrates Court or in the Federal Court of Australia. Very few people with a disability, I would suggest, would want to actually pursue that course of action. I am pleased to see that the report makes a recommendation in regard to the fit-out, and to apply disability standards to places other than buildings. Primarily, the committee was asked to inquire into, and report on: the appropriateness and effectiveness of the proposed Premises Standards in achieving their objects; the interaction between the Premises Standards and existing regulatory schemes operating in state and territory jurisdictions, including the appropriateness and effectiveness of the proposed model process to administer building access for people with a disability; whether the premises standards will have an unjustifiable impact on any particular sector or group within the sector; and any related matters. MAIN COMMITTEE Under the current arrangement there is too much scope for confusion and uncertainty which does not serve to encourage building owners to comply and it risks leading to a high level of complaint from people with a disability. The Attorney-General does have the power under the Disability Discrimination Act to codify standards and to give greater clarity. This has led to the government’s announcement that it will introduce premises standards in the hope of achieving greater clarity. The premises standards have the potential to ensure that the Building Code of Australia and the Disability Discrimination Act is harmonised and incorporates an access code into the building code. This should assist those engaged in the industry to comply with these acts and ensure that buildings meet disability access requirements. According to the evidence given to the inquiry by the Victorian Disability Advisory Council: The standards are long overdue. The [Disability Discrimination Act] and the Victorian Equal Opportunity Act have been in place for 17 and 13 years, respectively. The industry has had 17 years to regulate itself and to progressively and cost-effectively implement changes that would meet their obligations under the Acts. Had they done so, many of the cost arguments mounted today would be irrelevant. Industry has in fact been cost-saving for 17 years at the expense of a large percentage of the population. It is now time to restore that balance. And while cost is frequently argued as a reason to do nothing, it is hard to sustain that argument in the case of new construction. The regulation impact statement estimates that the cost of compliance for a new building or new buildings as a proportion of overall building costs is low. The RIS indicates a scale of cost based on case studies, and for the most part the costs are estimated at between one and five per cent for new buildings, with the bulk of case studies falling between a cost of one and three per cent of the total cost of building. Really, no-one could argue that that is unreasonable where a new building is being contemplated and planned for. Of course cost needs to be considered. None of us in this place is naive enough to think that it is something we should not consider. I suppose, especially with regard to existing buildings, there is certainly a much higher cost in retrofitting existing buildings and perhaps even greater difficulties when it comes to heritage listed buildings. The costs for retrofitting such buildings rise sharply, with the RIS estimating between a two to 20 per cent cost relative to the value of the building. However, that should not prevent us from seeking a sensible way forward to ensure that people with disability are not excluded from accessing necessary services and from social exclusion. I was also pleased to see that the committee did take particular note of the heritage issues. At 4.56 of the report, on page 65, it says: The Committee supports the inclusion of a heritage value provision in determinations of unjustifiable hardship. However, the Committee also agrees with the arguments raised by many submitters that providing access to heritage buildings does not have to diminish the heritage value. The Australian heritage industry could look overseas for examples of how a compromise might be reached. These problems have been addressed in some countries where the buildings were built many, many years ago. They are not new challenges or new problems and I am sure they are ones that could be overcome. They are surmountable. The committee report did go on, at 4.57, to MAIN COMMITTEE point out that the term ‘heritage value’ is a bit ambiguous. It is unclear, and it wanted greater clarification of those particular words. I think they are sensible suggestions in this report. In the little time. I have available, I would like to mention that I thought, looking through some of the submissions, that Vision Australia made an excellent submission to this committee hearing. I cannot go through the whole submission, it is quite a detailed one, but they did raise a matter which is probably relatively easily addressed in all buildings, whether they are existing buildings or new buildings-that is, braille and tactile signage for people who are vision impaired or blind. Vision Australia felt that this is a particularly important matter. They said that the provision of tactile and braille signage is the only way finding device included in the draft standards, and they did not regard features such as hazard warning TGSIs and luminance contrasts as way finding devices per se, rather they are safety features. They said: However, there are several cases where there is no specific requirement to provide braille and tactile signage even though other signage is required … They went on to say: Perhaps the omission of the words ‘braille and tactile’ in these cases is an oversight. In any case, Vision Australia’s strong view is that if signage is considered necessary to provide useful information to the public, then people who are blind or have low vision are just as entitled to this information as other members of the public. They also said: Braille and tactile signage could be provided at minimal cost, and would have significant benefits for people who are blind or have low vision. They also talked about the safety issues around moving people out of buildings. I have to say that a matter that concerned me as the Chair of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works when we were approving proposals for Commonwealth buildings was emergency egress from buildings for people who have a disability. I know that the committee at that time shared my views that this is a matter of considerable import. Vision Australia just highlighted the issue for people who are blind. They went on to say: It goes without saying that people who are blind or have low vision should have their needs taken into account in the design of systems for the same evacuation of people from premises in emergency situations. It is a very serious matter and some of those issues go to: Adequate lighting of emergency egress routes Braille and tactile signage of emergency egress stairways and exits The need for wayfinding features such as directional TGSIs to provide an accessible path of travel from emergency exits to designated assembly points. In closing, I think it is apt to quote from one of the submissions, from People with Disabilities in Western Australia: Every person, with or without a disability has the right to enter and use buildings and facilities housed within the built environment. Stating that certain areas do not need to meet the Standards may prevent people with a disability from working, living, or socialising in specific areas. This is discriminatory. Once again I congratulate those involved in putting this report together. I hope that this parliament can look forward to seeing some of the worse of these issues addressed in the very near future. MAIN COMMITTEE Ms JACKSON (Hasluck) (5.08 pm)-I will start by concurring with many of the remarks that my colleague the member for Pearce made. I also congratulate the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs on this report, Access all areas. It is a terrific report and one where I not only support the recommendations but also urge the government to implement the recommendations as expeditiously as possible. Increasingly, the issue of access is gaining greater prominence in the community and, as the member for Pearce has indicated, not only because so many Australians-some one in fivehave a disability but also as a result of our ageing population, where greater disability or a lack of mobility is becoming an increasing issue in the community. Frankly, it is wrong for people with a disability to be denied adequate access to buildings. This can have repercussions not only in a social sense but especially for their employment and it raises issues associated with social inclusion. I am particularly pleased that the report has not just determined that the issues of access are about access to buildings. I congratulate the committee on the broadening of the definition of ‘to place’. Indeed, it is only right and proper that people with a disability have access to all manner of opportunities in their lives. The report seeks to achieve a number of objectives. The first is to recommend harmonisation of the Building Code with the current provisions of the Disability Discrimination Act by containing the access code as schedule 1. I applaud that. People in the past have done a good job with the Building Code, despite the fact that they struggle with different legislative and planning requirements across the nation. There has not been a clear and precise set of standards developed with respect to the requirements of the Disability Discrimination Act. The second objective of not only harmonising the act with the Building Code but incorporating the access code into the Building Code is something which we should congratulate. Apart from anything else, it will provide a huge opportunity for consistency in development and for certainty for building owners and people in the building industry. I am also delighted at the recommendations which will see a shift from what has been very much an individual complaints based framework to a compliance based framework. I am particularly pleased with that change. That would be achieved by incorporating prescribed requirements into a code. That alleviates the need for us to wait for an individual to experience some sort of disadvantage or discrimination before a complaint can be made and, presumably, action is taken. This way we will see a proactive role to ensure that particularly new buildings are constructed in an accessible manner. Increasingly, we will also see the role of the Disability Discrimination Commissioner encouraging, through not only compliance but greater information, building owners and the like retroactively dealing with rectifying obstacles that are identified. I endorse the approach of the committee, which is, frankly, ‘Let’s get something into place as quickly as possible,’ and the acknowledgement that anything in terms of standards is better than what we have now. I say that because clearly there are some, for want of a better description, kinks in the current code. The fact of the matter is that these regulations, if they come into effect as an access code, will have the greatest impact on new buildings and major upgrades. That is something that will have real value for people with disabilities. It is, no doubt, long overdue. The code in many respects should be measured against the intent of the Disability Discrimination Act which applies now. On that basis it should not be onerous to implement the MAIN COMMITTEE code immediately, because, frankly, people should have been complying with these sorts of standards. One would hope that current plans for buildings would not have been approved if they did not meet accessibility standards like those set out in the report and its recommendations. I am very pleased to say that I think this is the beginning of a better system for everyone. It removes business exposure to prosecution by complaint and ensures better compliance for disabilities. The publishing of the report has created the opportunity for what is necessary dialogue with the broader community. I notice, for example, that the committee found it difficult to find accessible public hearing venues, especially in places like central Melbourne and Brisbane, which is almost unbelievable in 2009. That in itself immediately highlights issues that can be addressed. The report also touched on things such as-and I appreciate the debateaccessible rooms in our fourand five-star hotels for people with a disability. It was reported that many hotel staff were reluctant to offer available accessible rooms to patrons who appeared to have a disability for fear of giving offence. That is on page 97 of the report. I hope this public discussion and recognition of the importance of accessible public venues and buildings will begin to see accessible room requirements as a positive opportunity-indeed, a marketing opportunity-for the hotel and tourism industry. On many, many pages the report stresses the need for haste in the implementation of change. It notes that there will be further research required, for example, in the area of dimensions of modern wheelchairs. It encourages that to be done as a matter of some urgency. But to proceed in any event is important. Again, I think this recognises the time that has been taken to get this far. Indeed, the member for Pearce referred to a particular quote that the committee includes in its introductory comments at paragraph 1.19: In calling for a speedy conclusion to this process, the Committee notes that most submitters have also requested that the Premises Standards be introduced without further delay: The standards are long overdue. The [Disability Discrimination Act] and the Victorian Equal Opportunity Act have been in place for 17 and 13 years, respectively. The industry has had 17 years to regulate itself and to progressively and cost-effectively implement changes that would meet their obligations under the Acts. Had they done so, many of the cost arguments mounted today would be irrelevant. Industry has in fact been cost-saving for 17 years at the expense of a large percentage of the population. It is now time to restore that balance. I concur also with the quote from the Victorian Disability Advisory Council and with the committee’s conclusion that the premises standards should be introduced without further delay. I do note that the committee recommended that the Australian government provide funding for new research-they specify a 12-month timetable from the tabling of the report-into wheelchair sizes and the dimensions of building features necessary to accommodate them. I endorse that recommendation. I understand that the data the committee had been relying on for the development of the standards was based on a study conducted in 1983. Frankly, we know that the population requiring accessible facilities is increasing and we know that the technology available to assist them is improving. It seems to me that to be unaware of whether that has meant that wheelchairs are changing shape, getting bigger or getting smaller or by how much seems to be a gap in the research and information available to the committee. I hope that that research will be able to be conducted and perhaps improvements to the code made in that regard. MAIN COMMITTEE In the case of my own electorate office, we found that a constituent with a child with a disability whose electric wheelchair would be unable to come through the front door of my office. With the support and approval of the Special Minister of State that resulted in some renovations to my office to ensure that we had access for all my constituents who may need to come and see me. I referred earlier to my delight at the committee’s recommendations that the Disability Discrimination Commissioner be given power to investigate non-compliance with the premises standards and to be able to bring a complaint where there is non-compliance with the premises standards without requiring any individual complaint. I think this is an incredibly important reform. Our experience in this area shows that an individual complaints based system is less effective than it could be or should be-when I say ‘less effective’ in some cases it is totally ineffective-in bringing about the sort of change that would ensure not only social justice but improved social inclusion for people with disabilities. The process of pursuing a complaint can be lengthy and costly for the individual who has been disadvantaged or discriminated against in the first place. It seems to me not a desirable system when you are dealing with issues associated with discrimination. SoI fully support this role for the Disability Discrimination Commissioner and I hope that this will hold drive change effectively across our community. In conclusion, can I say that I would again urge the government to implement the committee’s recommendations expeditiously. It is clear to me that out there in the disability services sector-and certainly amongst advocates and representatives of people with disability-there is a great anxiety to see these changes implemented as soon as possible. I am also confident that the recommendations, if implemented, will drive positive change in our community. In that regard, I could not possibly conclude today without acknowledging the disability services sector in Western Australia for the work that they continue to do in advocating for the rights of people with disability. I talk here about not only community based organisations but also our own Disability Services Commission in Western Australia. They understand completely that accessibility is critical to the full participation of people with a disability in all that life has to offer. I am pleased that access has been the focus of substantial campaigns and public policy development in Western Australia. Indeed, the West Australian state government has a regime in place-and has had for many years-which requires all state government agencies and departments, as well as all local governments in Western Australia, to consider their buildings and facilities and to ensure that they have plans for disability access. Disability access and inclusion plans have been required to be tabled in Western Australia for some time, and it has helped provide some focus to this issue in Western Australia. The Disability Services Commission, who have driven much of that change, have also campaigned successfully on this issue. I would like to close with a quote from their campaign: Good access for people with a disability means good access for all people. Again, I commend the report. I commend the committee, and in particular the chair, the member for Isaacs. I look forward to seeing the Rudd government, especially led by the parliamentary secretary in this area, act on the recommendations of the report at the earliest opportunity. MAIN COMMITTEE Services and Parliamentary Secretary for Victorian Bushfire Reconstruction) (5.22 pm)-I rise to congratulate the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Standing Committee led by my colleague the member for Isaacs, for its hard work in examining the draft Disability (Access to Premises-Buildings) Standards. I would also like to acknowledge the work of the countless number of people from the disability sector who made submissions. There were also constructive contributions from many in the property sector, including Peter Verwer, the head of the Property Council of Australia. The Rudd government is still finalising its response to the report, I can advise the member for Hasluck, but I believe that the thoroughness of the consultation process and the work that has been done will influence the final decision. The battle for access to public buildings for people with disability is one that has been fought for many years and unfortunately despite some victories is not over. I believe that without access to buildings and public spaces there cannot be true equality for Australians with disability. Until people with disability can enter shops and cafes, enter workplaces, get to appointments that are not on the ground floor and enjoy the same concerts and sporting events as the rest of the population then their inclusion in society cannot be considered complete. Too many Australians are literally on the outside looking in. Throughout the history of all civil rights struggles, access to public premises has been a key test. Whether it be black Americans forced to ride at the back of the bus, or Aboriginal Australians barred from public swimming pools, second-class citizenship has always been clothed in physical exclusion. Despite the passing of the Disability Discrimination Act in 1992 and the progress that has been made since then, people with disability are still excluded too often in society in terms of access to premises. I believe that this exclusion is generally not through active malice but through a combination of indifference and neglect that sometimes takes refuge behind a spurious economic argument. It has been suggested to me by one advocate that buildings that are not accessible should be required to have signs prominently displayed telling the public which classes of people with disability are not welcome in the building, and therefore we could shame people into changing the way they build their buildings. I think this suggestion shows the importance of this issue to people with disability and how keenly exclusion is felt. The idea that we would design labels on buildings saying, ‘You’re not welcome here,’ would be anathema to Australians. But that is exactly what happens with disability standards and access to premises. The Rudd government recently released the Shut out report, the result of consultations on our national disability strategy, which is due next year. This report is an honest look at the frustrations of having a disability in Australia today and the barriers that are routinely and needlessly placed in the path of people with impairments. Twenty-seven in every 100 respondents to the massive survey in the Shut out report said that lack of access to the environment acts as a barrier to their full participation in the life of the community. The report quotes one as saying: “We want to contribute to Australian society but we usually find that we can’t access the workplace, can’t access public venues, can’t have a holiday because there is no suitable accommodation.” Another was quoted as saying: MAIN COMMITTEE",178,Committees
252,Mr Shorten (Maribyrnong,"Parliamentary Secretary for Disabilities and Children’s“Many professional services [such as dentists] are based on secondary levels with stair access only. Many cafes have step entry. Cinemas and swimming facilities are still often inaccessible. This prevents me from participating in these recreational activities with family and friends.” This inability to access facilities compromises a person with a disability’s quality of life and acts as a persistent reminder that they are only partial members of the broader Australian community. Nothing reinforces the sense of internal exile that many feel more than the experience of arriving at a shop or restaurant only to find that they are effectively locked out. If they are not locked out, they might be forced to go around the back, through the kitchen or up the goods lifts-made to feel less than the person they are. People with disability have the legal right not to be discriminated against with regard to access to premises and the built environment. The Disability Discrimination Act affirmed those rights when it was enacted in 1992. This act has done great work, and in the hands of dedicated advocates for people with disability it has been used as a tunnel-boring machine driving through the rock line of entrenched prejudice. However, the act does not provide detailed guidance as to what a building owner, designer or manager needs to do to ensure accessibility. It is clear, and has been clear for some years, that the Building Code of Australia needs to be amended to outline the legal responsibilities in detail. Premises standards would harmonise the requirements of the Building Code and the Disability Discrimination Act. As well as providing more access for people with disability, premises standards would provide more certainty to the building industry by letting them know in advance what is required. It is obvious to anyone who has renovated a house that including accessibility features in the original design is far cheaper and easier than trying to retrofit them to an existing building. We have reached a point, I am pleased to say, where environmental sustainability is automatically considered as part of the design of a new building, reinforced by the star-rating schemes established by the states. But where is the same treatment for people with a disability? Are they less important than our environment? I think not. We are not at the same point with disability access. It is still seen as an add-on cost, something separate from the main design of a building. In my role as the Parliamentary Secretary for Disabilities and Children’s ServicesI am constantly being presented with issues of accessibility-from poorly located disability parking places and ramps leading straight into grilles that a wheelchair could not negotiate to shortages of disabled toilets. I am grateful for some research from the Australian Federation of Disability Organisations for the following paragraphs: Disabled toilets appear to be a particular issue. Even in new buildings, such as Rod Laver Arena and Federation Square in Melbourne, or the Pacific Fair Shopping Centre on the Gold Coast, there are issues with the quality and access of disabled toilets. I hear that the toilets are often not suitable for people who require a hoist, or for those who require assistance and an adult-size change table. In one case reported to me, the lock on the door required both hands to open and shut-making it difficult for some people with disability to enter. Often these toilets are combined with baby-changing facilities. Presumably this is to save space, but it increases the demand on a scarce resource. I know that people with disability are frustrated by the sporadic application of accessibility principles and the number of new buildings that appear to have been built without any thought about or input from a person with a disability. I am also aware that local councils are all too MAIN COMMITTEE often failing in their responsibility to their ratepayers with a disability by allowing exemptions to accessibility standards for new construction. I am also concerned about the way our houses and apartments are being built in Australia. The issue of residential premises is not covered by these draft standards, but I believe it is one that will become of increasing importance as Australians age. I would love to see more builders embrace the concept of universal design, the simple yet powerful idea that houses should be able to change as we change and to adapt to our changing needs as we go. Along with ageing Australians, there are approximately 1.3 million Australians with a severe or profound disability, and this number is likely to increase. It is also obvious that most people prefer to age in their own homes, on their own terms, with as much independence and dignity as possible. Some of the practical features of universal design are simple: solid walls in bathrooms so that rails can be easily attached; showers where a person does not have to step over the side of a bath or another obstacle to get into them; benchtops in kitchens at both sitting and standing heights; extra living spaces on the ground floor of homes to accommodate future needs; a level main entrance to a house and a sloping landscape to allow easier access; and windows that can be opened or closed with one hand by a person in a sitting position. None of these items adds significantly to the cost of a new house, and indeed the builders would find a greater market to purchase these houses. The battle for equality for people with disabilities is not one that is going to be won overnight, as many decades of struggle would indicate. I suggest that it is a series of small victories and incremental changes. However, measures such as these building standards are an important signal to the building industry that the needs of people with disability and their right to access buildings easily and with dignity are important. I think these draft standards show that we in this place no longer accept that the needs of people with disabilities are secondary to the needs of other Australians. We accept that they need to be included and consulted when buildings are designed. For too long people with disabilities have been told they are the ones who have to adapt to their environment rather than having the built environment adapt to them. They have had to waste valuable time and energy dealing with products, rules and systems that have been put in place with no thought for how a person with an impairment might deal with them. NeedI add that we are all only one terrible car accident or, indeed, the effluxion of age away from having the very same issues that we talk about when we refer to people with disabilities? This is not an acceptable situation for people with disabilities, who are, in fact, us. I hope that the introduction of building standards will be a recognition that it is time for the rest of the community to begin more serious thinking about the needs of people with disability in every aspect of their lives. the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs entitled Access all areas. It is a report on the draft Disability (Access to Premises-Buildings) Standards. I could not help reading the opening commentary in that report, which was a statement by Brian Howe MP made on 26 May 1992 in his second reading speech on the Disability Discrimination Bill. Having read that statement, I believe it sums up very eloquently what we as a society should be aspiring to when it comes to redressing and addressing the issues, difficulties and disadvantages being faced by people with a disability throughout our communities. MAIN COMMITTEE",185,Committees
253,Mr Zappia (Makin) (5.32 Pm),"I too welcome the opportunity to speak on the report byI certainly welcome the opportunity to speak on this report because it enables me to touch on some of the matters that cause that disadvantage and create barriers to people with a disability not just in Australia but right around the world. I say from the outset that this is a matter that has been neglected and somewhat ignored for much too long. I certainly welcome the fact that in recent years this parliament has begun to address many of these issues. We nevertheless have a long, long way to go. I say that in the full knowledge that it is indeed a very complex matter that is effectively endless. You can start on this project, as I suspect the committee members did, and once you begin to make your inquiries and hear the stories you begin to delve into areas that you had not intended to from the outset but which are just as relevant to what you are trying to achieve as the final recommendations that you bring back to the parliament are. Clearly, the committee had a focus on addressing the issues relating to buildings, and quite rightly so, because, without access into buildings, that level of disadvantage is just compounded so much more. Access denied into buildings is in fact one of the most serious kinds of barriers that we place in front of people with a disability. I say that in the full knowledge that there is such a wide range of disabilities and trying to address every aspect of improvement that is required for every kind of disability that is out there is indeed a mammoth task. For that reason I accept that we can address these issues by taking them one step at a time, and I believe that is exactly what the committee has endeavoured to do in this report by, in the first instance, addressing the building standards. I congratulate the committee members on the effort they have put into this report. It is clear that they have put an incredible amount of work into listening to the representations that were made and then put some very considered thought into the recommendations that they brought back to the parliament. Just a moment ago I listened to the Parliamentary Secretary for Disabilities and Children’s Services and I, too, will be waiting with interest for the government’s response to the report. It is well known and, again, repeated in the report that one in five members of our society has some form of disability. As I said earlier on, that disability can take on a whole range of different forms. As a result of that, those people with a disability, whatever it might be, have to live with a level of hardship on a daily basis that, fortunately, most of us do not have to do. It is a hardship that is made worse because we as a society have, over the years, placed unnecessary barriers in front of people with disabilities. We have done so, I believe, not deliberately but unintentionally. We have done so because many of us within society, in our decision making processes, simply do not have the understanding and the knowledge of what it might be like for a person with a disability to then have to, perhaps, be part of whatever it is we are making a decision on. I will come back to that a bit later on and talk about some of the things that can be done. It seems to me that, quite often, many of the barriers that are there for people with disabilities could have been avoided, probably without any additional cost whatsoever to society, but rather with some foresight. I said earlier that this is a complex issue and indeed it is. It is a complex issue because of the multiple nature of barriers that are there and the multiple nature of disabilities that exist amongst the community. For that reason I expect that our response to all of these matters will certainly be a slow one. Extensive reform is possible without, I believe, doing much more than just changing the culture and the mindset of the decision makers, MAIN COMMITTEE the designers and the people who make decisions within society generally. In saying that, I believe it is possible to do all those things without imposing an unreasonable obligation on the rest of society. I highlight the word ‘unreasonable’ in my remarks because there is a level at which you have to make a judgment about what is reasonable and what is unreasonable. It is all about: what is reasonable? We live in a society where many of our laws, practices and principles we adhere to are built on a spirit of social justice or social equality. Yet, when it comes to disability issues, reform seems to have occurred at a much slower pace than it has in so many other areas. We can talk about inequality, whether it is to do with women’s issues or racial issues and so on, and we moved and acted on those many years ago, but it seems we have been pretty slow when it comes to the disability sector. Again, I welcome the fact that this parliament is now speaking about this issue and has brought back this report. As I said, access to buildings is one of those primary areas that we need to overcome if we are going to begin on the road to breaking down the barriers for people with disabilities. Essentially, that comes about by society broadly having a much better understanding of what needs to be done, and you can only have that better understanding if you take the time out to listen to people with disabilities, to listen to their problems and to understand that, more often than not, what they are asking for is not at all unreasonable. It comes about, for example, through changing the designs of many of the things we manufacture, including our homes. I heard the parliamentary secretary talking about that just a moment ago. A classic example of the way we design homes today is that had we designed them differently in years gone by, and if the standards for door making, or windows, or ramps or whatever had been done differently from the start, it would have made life so much easier for so many people, yet without adding any additional cost. All it meant was a different design, not a different cost structure. The cost occurs now because when you retrofit, what you are trying to do and what you need to do incur additional costs because they are not standard fittings anymore. Had they been standard in the first place, they would not have been an extra cost at all. I can think of many examples, whether they are to do with ramps, passageways or doorways, that could easily have been designed differently in years gone by. It now is the case that we have to retrofit in many examples, so bringing about some uniformity in the building standards and standards to address some of those problems will at least ensure that new buildings, or where new work is carried out, will comply with those standards. I believe that is a good thing and is something that is well overdue. I will give another example of how, sometimes, it does not take a lot to do things differently but it can make a world of difference to people with disabilities. Years ago I was the mayor of the City of Salisbury. We adopted a program whereby we would see what we could do to overcome many of the barriers faced by people with disabilities. We set up an advisory committee made up predominantly of members of the community with a diverse range of disabilities, who gave us advice as to what should be done. One of the issues that was a constant problem to people with disabilities was accessing buses-getting on and off buses-because the bus stops were not properly designed and built to enable that to occur. Certainly, if you had a wheelchair, or one of those motorised gophers, it was almost impossible to get onto a bus at most bus stops. We went about redesigning and changing the bus stops throughout the city. Had that been done in the first instance, most of the problems-the redesign and rebuild MAIN COMMITTEE work that took place-would never have been necessary, and it would not have cost much more to have done it right in the first place than it was to have done it the way that it was. It was simply through genuine ignorance that they were designed and built the way they were. Ultimately, to retrofit was going to cost our city close to $1 million. That is the kind of cost that could have been avoided. Having said that, the work of the committee highlighted to me that people with a disability are not at all unreasonable; in fact, they are probably more understanding and more tolerant than most other people. It was because of that I came to respect the fact that what they asked for was never unreasonable, and if what seemed to be unreasonable was unreasonable, they would be the first to say, ‘We accept that this might create a barrier for us but it is unreasonable to ask the rest of the community to fix it up for us.’ They did not have unrealistic expectations. What we were able to do, as a group, was methodically to work through the areas of disadvantage that were being caused for people with disabilities throughout the city as a result of doing things unintentionally, which created those barriers. This report has a number of recommendations in it, and I suspect they make a huge inroad towards breaking down those barriers. It is a report that, I believe, will lead to a lot more reports in years to come and a lot more areas being explored where the barriers for people with disabilities can and should be broken down, and I welcome that. A number of the recommendations talk about further work being done in different areas. I conclude my remarks by saying that, having read parts of the report-and I cannot say that I have studied it all in detail-the important thing is that we need to ensure whatever standards are agreed to are then implemented throughout the community because it is pointless having a set of standards that overcome the barriers that I am referring to but are not in fact policed in any way, shape or form. That is one of the things that we need to ensure happens. The other concern I have is that because of the cost of housing today and the small allotments that are being created, I am seeing smaller homes being built on tighter allotments with tighter spaces in every sense of the word. I believe that we may regret doing that because in years to come when older people remain in their own homes they will need some of the aids that the parliamentary secretary referred to earlier. The places that we are building now may not be designed to cater for them. Again, that is why I welcome the fact that, at least in future new buildings, or where new work is carried out, work ought to be carried out in a way that complies with these standards. Once again, I congratulate all of the committee members for the work they have done. I look forward to the government response on this; but, more importantly, I look forward to the community’s response on this because this is a matter for which we all collectively have responsibility. Debate (on motion by Mr Ripoll) adjourned. Sitting suspended from 5.46 pm to 6.40 pm Tangney Electorate: Private Health Insurance Dr JENSEN (Tangney) (6.41 pm)-I rise to support my constituents of Tangney in the face of the latest attacks on private health insurance by the Rudd Labor government. Over 74 MAIN COMMITTEE per cent of my electorate have private health insurance. The remaining percentage rely heavily on the public system. Both groups will suffer if Labor succeeds in decimating private health insurance membership. Insured Tangney residents who earn over $75,000 would have to pay more because of the cut to the private health insurance rebate. If they dropped out altogether, they would still have paid more due to an increased Medicare levy surcharge. Insured Tangney residents who earn under $75,000 would have to pay more because of increased premiums due to younger and healthier people dropping out. Uninsured Tangney voters would be waiting longer in the public hospital queues for essential treatment because of the further influx of people into a public health system already under extreme pressure. In the early 1990s, Labor nearly crippled our health system because of ideological opposition to private health cover. This government is hurtling down the same destructive path, and again Australians rely on the coalition to save them from this unconscionable attack. Fremantle Electorate: Film and Television Institute Ms PARKE (Fremantle) (6.43 pm)-The Film and Television Institute of WA, locally known as the FTI, is a creative production and learning hub based in Fremantle that has helped foster talented filmmakers and community interest in this field of the arts since 1971. Its facilities and services include an animation studio, post-production facilities, a 120-seat theatre, an annual outdoor cinema program and accredited vocational education and training courses. The FTI’s CEO Graeme Sward, a man who is passionate about the FTI and its place as one of Fremantle’s pre-eminent creative centres. The organisation faces two major challenges, which I am committed to help resolve. The first challenge relates to the maintenance of the 19th century building that the FTI currently occupies, the heritage listed former Fremantle Boys School, which is owned by the state Department for Planning and Infrastructure. If urgent upgrade and repairs are not carried out, the FTI may be forced to leave the premises due to health and safety concerns. The second challenge relates to being able to effectively connect to the rest of the filmmaking community. The organisation is just one example of why fast, affordable, high-bandwidth broadband is needed across Australia. I note that this was previously highlighted as a major issue for the film industry in a 2004 report from the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Communications, Information Technology and the Arts entitled From reel to unreal. The Film and Television Institute of WA, located in Fremantle, plays an important role in WA’s film and television industry. I will continue working to ensure it receives the government support it needs and deserves. Formula One Technology Challenge September, the Formula One Technology Challenge. The event involves student teams designing and racing small-scale versions of F1 cars. The 11to 16-year-olds taking part have to grapple with some challenging engineering concepts. I, along with the parents and teachers, was impressed by their efforts. Producing high-quality engineers is fast becoming a WA specialty. There are 10,000 students in my electorate of Swan and many of them are taking engineering degrees.

254,Mr Irons (Swan) (6.44 Pm),"This evening I rise to talk about an event I attended on 4ing events like this. The F1 challenge is supported by the Re-Engineering Australia Foundation, and I congratulate them on their initiative. I am sure it will go a long way to developing a future pool of engineers in WA. At the event I was pleased to see that Streamline Racing from Wesley College from my electorate of Swan won the senior title. Probably the most impressive entry was from Perth Modern School by a group of young women who finished second in the racing competition on the day I attended. However, credit must go to all those schools, the students and teachers who took part in the event. Last year I was pleased to be appointed joint patron of this event with the member for Hasluck, Sharryn Jackson, who happens to be in the chamber. It has been good to witness the progress of the competition and the students over this period of time. I am sure we will both do our best to support the event and encourage more schools to take part next year. It is a worthy competition and fostering an engineering culture in WA is a worthy pursuit. I wish the WA team all the best in the national titles in Sydney. (Time expired) Petition: Parallel Import Restrictions on Books Maryborough residents requesting that the Productivity Commission recommendation to remove the parallel import restrictions on books be rejected. In addition to the 3,885 signatures on the petition, another 1,300 of these coupons have been published in each edition of the Maryborough Advertiser over the past month or so. Maryborough has a population of just over 8,000 people, so this means that more than half the population have recorded their strong opposition to the removal of parallel import restrictions. Why? Because they know that this has the potential to decimate Maryborough’s biggest employer, McPherson’s Print Group, who employ around 300 to 350 employees or residents. The Maryborough Advertiser sent a letter to the Prime Minister, published on the front page of the Friday, 14 August edition, requesting his intervention. The removal of parallel import restrictions will not only decimate the printing and publishing industries but also severely retard Australian authors’ ability to get their work published. Imagine an Australia without books by Patrick White, Tim Winton or Kate Grenville. Imagine an Australia where the only places you can buy books are supermarkets or discount stores. Imagine an Australia where the only books they stock are written by Americans, about Americans and for Americans. This is what is at stake if parallel import restrictions are removed as requested by the Productivity Commission. The petition read as followsTo the Honourable The Speaker and members of the House of Representatives: We the undersigned citizens of central Victoria wish to draw to the attention of the House that the Productivity Commission has recommended the removal of the Parallel Import Restrictions on books. Such a proposal if enacted would result in the loss of hundreds of jobs in this community and make a significant downward impact on the economy of the area. Your petitioners therefore ask the House to reject the recommendation of the Productivity Commission regarding Parallel Import Restrictions on books and to retain the current arrangements. from 3,885 citizens Petition received MAIN COMMITTEE",191,Statements By Members

They celebrated two great milestones in the last week when they stunned the Queensland State League by winning 2-1 against a foundation and former national league team, the Brisbane Strikers, in Saturday night’s football grand final. They were rank outsiders but they pulled out two goals in the final quarter to win 4-1. The goal scorers were Wayne Knipe, Russell Woodruffe and, of course, our imports Darren Davies from Wales and Englishman Danny Byrne. The man of the match was Graeme Fyfe, another devil Scottish import. They beat the Fire and they beat Olympic on the way to the grand final. Their second achievement was in the under-21s, Forte Skordou, with his own stellar football career on his resume, set out in his first year and coached the under-21s to within an inch of a grand final victory.

(Time expired) Ms Genia Janover school principals who influences the course of history in their country. At a special function that I attended on Sunday, tribute was paid to Genia with this wonderful book of tribute to her 20 years as principal of Bialik College in Melbourne, a college that she has brought, in the last 20 years, from some 400 students to 1,100 today. To honour her at that wonderful warm ceremony, where the parents, staff and students expressed what I can only describe as love for her, an announcement was made that an early learning centre would be named in perpetuity in her honour. Genia has also been judged by objective criteria. She was named as one of the 10 top educators in Australia in 2003. She was named as principal of the year in 2007. But this does not really describe the way people feel about her. I think it was best summed up by a teacher who said, ‘Most principals are tolerated, some are respected, few are liked, but you are actually loved.’ According to objective criteria, Bialik College is the top performing school in the VCE in Melbourne. That is in no small part due to her extraordinary ethos as an educator. really getting stuck in the craw of my rural electorate in Western Australia-that is, the MAIN COMMITTEE",192,Statements By Members

These issues have been brought to the attention of the public through the media that defends them. These days, they are taking out multi-thousand-dollar as in daily newspapers, stepping out of their iconic role into agriculture and food production generally. It is an absolute nonsense. Among other things, they are suggesting that we have got to stop jockeys using whips in the sport of kings and that we have got to stop the mulesing of merino sheep in Australia, which is ruining our wool industry. They are going to stop the live export of livestock from Western Australia, where there are no abattoirs and therefore no justification for breeding stock other than to send it overseas. I suggest to you that the RSPCA will maintain their iconic reputation in Australia so long as they stick with their core business, which is looking after the welfare of domestic pets. Let them get back to it. Hospitals Ms COLLINS (Franklin) (6.52 pm)-I want to talk this evening about an important investment for Tasmania’s health system. It was just a few weeks ago that I stood with my federal colleague, the member for Denison, and also my state colleague, the Deputy Premier and Minister for Health, Lara Giddings, to announce funding for Tasmania’s first public PET scanner, which is to be installed in the Royal Hobart Hospital. The Rudd government has provided $3.5 million for this new state-of-the-art public PET scanner. The Tasmanian government is also contributing $3.7 million to upgrade the area where the machine is to be installed. This diagnostic equipment will enable the Royal Hobart Hospital to operate a tertiary oncology unit with daily access to PET-CT scans for the first time. We have delivered on yet another election commitment to provide this service for the state of Tasmania and the PET scanner will make a difference for those people who are awaiting cancer diagnosis. The machine will ensure that Tasmanians are able to access the latest diagnostic tools at their local public hospital. The PET scans will also provide important assistance to clinicians in the early diagnosis of cancers, as well as neurological conditions and cardiovascular disease. The machine will have the new time-of-flight technology. The scanner will also be used for clinical research through the collaborative partnership that was recently established between the Menzies Research Institute and the Royal Hobart Hospital. This is a win for the people of Tasmania and we have delivered on what we promised them in the 2007 election campaign. Mr Matthew Leonard John Leonard, who was just 28 years old when he died in a plane crash near Kokoda in Papua New Guinea on 11 August 2008. On Friday, 4 September I attended the funeral of Matt Leonard at the Greenwood Catholic Parish, in the All Saints church. At that moving service, it was apparent to those of us who did not know him that he was held in the highest regard. A graduate of the Western Australian Academy of Performing Arts, he had moved from his home in Western Australia to Melbourne. In Melbourne he embarked on a career with the Metropolitan Fire Brigade, undertaking training and then graduating to serve at the East Malvern station house.

There is nothing surprising about that. The eulogy and the statements paint a picture of a young man who added great value in everything he did. Nothing was too much trouble for Matt and he was a great friend to all. Clearly Matt Leonard’s family, friends and colleagues will miss him greatly. His loss will forever be felt by all those who knew him. Those of us who did not know him feel a very great regret. Once again, for their loss, I express my condolences to Matthew Leonard’s parents, Bill and Anne, and his brothers, Russ and Mike, and his sister, Bec. National Stroke Awareness Week Debate resumed, on motion by Ms Hall: That the House: (1) notes that: (a) National Stroke Awareness Week is 14 to 20 September 2009; (b) 60,000 people in Australia will suffer a stroke this year; (c) stroke is the second most prevalent cause of death, and leading cause of disability, in Australia; (d) one in seven people will suffer a stroke in their lifetime; (e) twenty per cent of all strokes occur in people under fifty years of age; (f) stroke costs Australia $2.14 billion a year, and is preventable; and (g) education plays an important role in reducing the occurrence of stroke; and (2) acknowledges the: (a) role played by the families and carers of stroke victims; and (b) National Stroke Foundation’s launch of its new Face, Arms, Speech, Time Campaign. Ms HALL (Shortland) (6.55 pm)-This week is National Stroke Awareness Week. Stroke is one of those diseases that I think Australians, and for that matter people through the world, do not understand fully. They do not know the signs and do not know the correct treatment and the correct way to react at the time of having a stroke. Stroke is the second greatest killer after coronary disease and a leading cause of disability. In 2009 Australians will suffer around 60,000 new and recurrent strokes-that is one every 10 minutes. One in five people having a first-ever stroke will die within one month, and one in three will die within a year. The number of strokes will increase each year due to the ageing of the population unless something is done to reduce the incidence of stroke. With the increased incidence of stroke comes an increased cost to our community. It comes in the necessity to have more beds in aged-care facilities. It also comes in the form of a greater reliance on family and carers, a cost in terms of loss of production and the simple human cost associated with people suffering strokes. The FAST test is an easy way to recognise and remember the signs of stroke. Using the FAST test involves asking three simple questions. Face: check the person’s face. Has the person’s mouth drooped? Arms: can they lift both their arms? Speech: is their speech slurred? Do MAIN COMMITTEE they understand you? If the answer creates any concern, then it is time. Time is critical. If you see any of these signs, call 000 straight away. In the next 10 years more than half a million people will suffer a stroke. Stroke kills more women than breast cancer. About 88 per cent of stroke survivors live at home, and most have a severe disability or some kind of disability. Close to 20 per cent of all strokes occur in people under 50 years of age. Stroke costs Australia approximately $2.14 billion per year. So it causes enormous disability and it increases the demand for aged care facilities and it puts an enormous burden on carers. Once a person suffers a stroke some of the things that they need to do is undertake lifestyle change: look at their diet, level of exercise, level of alcohol intake and smoking. These are all behaviours that impact on a person’s ability to recover from a stroke and to ensure that they do not have future strokes. In the time that I have remaining I would like to share with the House details of a research project that has been conducted by the Hunter Medical Research Institute’s Stroke Research Group. The group has developed a system for fast-tracking stoke treatment which could benefit thousands of Australians who suffer from strokes and save millions of dollars. The system is called Pre-hospital Acute Stroke Triage, or PAST, Protocol. It reduces pre-hospital and emergency department delays to allow more stroke patients to receive brain-saving thrombolysis, or clot-bursting treatment, within a three-hour window of having a stroke. A three-hour treatment period is a very important time period. By reversing the crippling effects of the stroke we can enable more people to return to their families, their homes and their jobs. This also reduces the demand on nursing home beds, in-hospital rehabilitation programs and healthcare dollars. This is a unique system. If the PAST protocol were implemented nationally an additional 2,500 people could receive the thrombolysis treatment. This is a unique process that has been developed in the Hunter and it is one that really benefits stroke patients throughout Australia. This is Stroke Awareness Week. Let us be aware of stroke. (Time expired) land for her contribution and the motion before the House. I thank the member for raising this important issue, particularly in the context of National Stroke Awareness Week and the fact that 60,000 people in Australia will suffer a stroke this year. There is not a person in this place who has not been directly affected by someone they know and love suffering a stroke. As we all know, it is not one person who is affected as a result. While the individual survivor concerned may be left with the most obvious physical or mental impairment, the reverberations are felt throughout their home and community. As the member for Shortland indicated in her motion, stroke is the second most prevalent cause of death and the leading cause of disability in Australia. It staggers me that one in seven people will suffer a stroke in their lifetime and that 20 per cent of strokes occur in people under the age of 50. That figure makes a mockery of the view, which many of us tend to have, that stroke is an ailment that only afflicts the aged. One in five stroke sufferers are aged under 50. If they survive they can face many years of rehabilitation and the need for a range of support services. It is in that context that I want to raise the issue of the Stroke Association of Victoria and the remarkable work that the volunteers undertake on behalf of stroke survivors. I had the opportunity earlier this year to meet with Clare Gray from the Stroke Association when she MAIN COMMITTEE",194,Rspca It Is A Wonderful Organisation That Is Doing Great Things They Have Created A Reputa
260,Mr Chester (Gippsland) (7.00 Pm),"I would like to commend the member for Shortvisited East Gippsland along with many of her members. It is a remarkable organisation on many fronts. The association is made up completely of volunteers who provide support as caregivers to loved ones who have suffered a stroke. These people give their time to supporting stroke survivors and reinforcing the message of stroke awareness to the community at large. They provide a wide range of information and ongoing support long after the medical profession has dealt with the most obvious issues. There is a constant need for support and assistance to make sure the stroke survivor can enjoy the highest quality of life possible. It disappoints me that the work of the Stroke Association of Victoria is not properly acknowledged with ongoing funding for professional support staff. With a relatively minor investment, the work of the association could expand through the use of a professional coordinator to develop and administer services to more than 20 support groups across Victoria. Australia is a nation that relies on its selfless volunteers-and long may that be the case-but we need to make sure that we do not take them for granted. Governments at the state and federal level should urgently consider how we fund such volunteer organisations that could leverage countless more hours of support activities and provide an even better service with just a small investment from the public purse. We cannot talk about stroke without acknowledging the opportunities to minimise our personal risk. The member for Shortland touched on them. There are some factors which are beyond our control, but lifestyle factors such as diet, alcohol consumption, smoking and how active we are in our daily lives will all affect our own level of risk. As members of parliament we must avoid the temptation to become a nanny state and dictate to our communities, but we can do a lot more to promote healthy and active lifestyles for people of all ages through the provision of appropriate facilities and more support for junior sporting organisations. I am a big believer in junior team sports and the role they play in connecting children with their communities and establishing healthy habits for life. I fear that many young people miss out on this opportunity for purely economic reasons. It is an area that I intend to keep pursuing with governments at all levels to increase access to sporting opportunities and the lifelong benefits it provides. As a layman I like the description that the Victorian Stroke Association provides to explain a stroke on its website. They call it a ‘brain attack’ in that it happens when the blood supply to the brain in interrupted and the brain does not get the oxygen is needs. The importance of prompt action to assist someone you suspect of having experienced a stroke cannot be overstated. As the member for Shortland correctly pointed out, the symptoms may include weakness or numbness or part paralysis in parts of the body, difficulty swallowing or a loss of vision or dizziness. The association’s website provides a range of support material but the most important advice is to seek medical assistance immediately if you suspect someone is having a stroke. Fast action can save a life or minimise the level of permanent impairment. The association’s website also makes another important point in relation to the recovery process. It says: The brain is a remarkable organ and is capable of adapting to change. In the weeks and months following a stroke many partially-damaged cells may recover and start to work again. … … … The length of time it takes to recover varies widely from person to person. MAIN COMMITTEE … … … As a rule, a majority of recovery often takes place during the first year to 18 months, but many people continue to improve over a much longer period. This is why we always say, ‘NEVER GIVE UP’ There is a message here for us all in terms of the activities that we undertake to assist people in recovering from stroke and to support research and development into preventative actions: we must never give up. DareI say, in the time that is left to me, that I think if more Australian were aware of the contributions made by their elected members during debates such as this, rather than being aware of some of the spectacles that they sometimes see in question time, their respect for those who choose to serve our communities through elected office would rise considerably. I congratulate the member for Shortland for bringing this important matter to the attention of the House. moving tonight her motion about strokes and helping to create added awareness in the federal parliament about this issue. I want to make a small contribution to help create that awareness across my electorate and right across Australia, because I think this is one of those important areas of health awareness that not enough people understand, and we ought to do everything we can to make sure that people know the symptoms, know the causes and know the impact and effects of a stroke. To illustrate the impact that a stroke has on people, I want to invite the members present in the chamber and the people that might be listening to imagine what it would be like if you awoke one morning to find one side of your body was permanently paralysed, or to find that you were perfectly able to understand words but were unable to speak or to write or to find that you were having to relearn how to perform the simplest activities of daily living, such as eating, dressing or bathing, things that come naturally to the rest of us. Your life and the lives of your family and friends would need to be completely rearranged. That is a very difficult time for people who have a stroke. It is a very difficult time for their friends and families as well. These are just some of the life-altering ways that a stroke can have an impact on people’s lives. You have already heard tonight, from the member for Shortland and others, some pretty alarming statistics about stroke sufferers in Australia, so I want to talk mainly about the topic of prevention. To give a background setting, there are a range of signs of stroke which may include one or more of the following things. People may experience numbness, weakness or paralysis of the face, or of an arm or a leg on one or both sides of the body. They may find they are having difficulty in speaking or understanding what somebody is saying to them. They may find themselves dizzy, or experiencing a loss of balance or having an unexplained fall. They may have some loss of vision or suddenly blurred or decreased vision in one or both eyes. They may have a headache, an unusually severe one, or the abrupt onset of a headache. They may have some unexplained change in a headache pattern, with one that might persist, or have difficulty in swallowing. This is not an exhaustive list. These are just some of the things that may happen to people. Having lost a close friend of mine to a stroke only about five years ago, I have a sense of just how quickly it can happen to someone, someone who is not necessarily an older person. In fact, as we have heard, most strokes happen to people who are under 55 years of age. They can even happen to really young people in their 20s or MAIN COMMITTEE",196,Private Members Business
261,Mr Ripoll (Oxley) (7.05 Pm),"I also want to commend the member for Shortland foryounger. Strokes are very debilitating. They can also lead to death. People might not recover at all from their stroke, particularly within 48 hours of having it. It would be a safe assumption to make that many Australians just do not realise the extent of a stroke or what it can do. That is why I think awareness campaigns such as the FAST campaign are essential. They really do help people to better understand what is happening either to themselves or to somebody close to them, being a friend or a family member. Not only is stroke Australia’s second biggest killer; the number of strokes will increase each year as Australia’s population ages unless we can reduce the incidence rate. FAST is a simple way of remembering the signs of stroke and what to do if you experience them or if you see the signs in another person. FAST stands for Facial weakness, Arm weakness, Speech difficulties and Time to act fast. Calling 000 immediately could prevent death or severe disability. This brings me to another aspect of stroke: not only can it be prevented but if you act quickly enough you can minimise the impact of a stroke on someone by getting them to hospital in time. I have been active in the FAST campaign. I have promoted widely the need for people to carry FAST wallet cards to assist them in recognising the symptoms. They are still available from my office and I know they are available from other members’ offices as well. I know everyone in this parliament is committed to trying to help reduce the incidence of stroke. In the short time that I have I also want to make mention of the things that we can all do to try and help prevent a stroke. There are obviously easy things such as not smoking or giving up smoking, losing weight if you are overweight, limiting your alcohol intake-a moderate amount of alcohol can lower your risk of stroke, but more alcohol is harmful to your healthkeeping your blood pressure low with a low-salt diet and undertaking physical activity. If required, medical attention is also necessary. You can also live by the motto, ‘The lower your cholesterol, the lower your risk of stroke.’ The two are intimately linked. You can control cholesterol with a combination of diet, exercise and, of course, medication. Being physically active is also very important, so we should try to do some moderate exercise every day. There is a lot that people can do. We all have to be aware of the symptoms and we have to try and help our friends and family, not only beforehand but also afterwards if something does happen. vious speaker in relation to opportunities to prevent the frequency of stroke occurring in our community-in particular the issues raised in relation to older people and those with certain medical problems such as high blood pressure and diabetes. There is no question that lifestyle factors such as diet, alcohol consumption, smoking and how active we are in our daily lives affect our individual risk. In particular I refer to the issue of smoking. As someone who had a father who was a regular smoker and tragically suffered from lung cancer later in his life due to his smoking habit, formed as a very young man, I am very committed to encouraging young people in our community to avoid taking up smoking in the first place. As a government there is a lot more that we could do via public health initiatives on the issue of smoking. The Quit campaign, which has been very successful across Australia, is an initiative which needs further support in the future. There are a whole range of initiatives being considered in terms of restricting the amount of advertising and the display of cigarettes.

262,Mr Chester (Gippsland) (7.11 Pm),"by leave-I take up the points raised by the prehabit of smoking early in life, the benefits will flow through in minimising the number of strokes in our community. Healthy eating is also an issue that the previous member referred to. Again, it is an opportunity for us as elected members of parliament to lead by example. We should support our food producers across our nation and encourage young people in particular to enjoy five portions of fruit and vegetables each day. It does a lot for your health, in terms not only of minimising the incidence of stroke in our community but of overall quality of life. In my previous contribution to this motion before the HouseI referred to the need to encourage healthy lifestyles, particularly amongst our young people. It is something I would like to expand on further if time permits. We have an opportunity in our nation to encourage young people in particular to be active members of their communities. There is a real prospect for us to do a lot more in reducing the economic barriers for a lot of our young people. I represent a regional constituency, and a lot of our young people have trouble accessing sporting opportunities. There is a real opportunity for us to make sure that we provide those opportunities in our regional communities, taking into consideration the extra transport costs involved for a lot of families. Again, early habits formed in terms of a healthy lifestyle will have immeasurable benefit in reducing the incidence of stroke in our community. I also referred previously to the Stroke Association of Victoria and the excellent work they are doing in supporting people who have suffered from stroke and, of course, their families and caregivers. As members of parliament we need to reflect more on the contribution that is made to our community by carers. Carers save our nation a king’s ransom in forgone costs to the community if we had to provide that care from the public purse. With a little further investment from us at the state and federal levels to support our carers we would be able to achieve a lot more in supporting people with illnesses. In this particular case I am referring to strokes. The support groups that exist in Victoria provide a wide range of support to families and to survivors, helping them through a very traumatic time in their lives. By their very nature, strokes are unexpected. They occur suddenly and it is like a lightning strike on the families involved. It hits them in an instant and, from then on, their lives are different. It is up to us as a government and as members of parliament to make sure that we provide support for the survivors and also to the caregivers. There are opportunities for us to make sure that the caregivers and the work that they are doing in the community are more widely recognised and appreciated. It is with that in mind that I repeat my earlier remarks encouraging state and federal governments to see what support they can give to groups like the Stroke Association of Victoria in terms of professional facilitation work, because I find that a professional facilitator or coordinator can leverage off the amount of work the volunteers undertake on behalf of those who have suffered a stroke. Again, I thank the member for Shortland for the motion before the House and commend her for her work in this regard. Ms REA (Bonner) (7.16 pm)-In rising to support this motion, I too wish to congratulate the member for Shortland for bringing this motion before the House today and for giving me the opportunity to speak on this very serious and very important issue. If there is one thing I have learnt in the 18 months I have been in this House it is that there are many very important and very serious issues that we feel passionate about. We in this House have the opportunity MAIN COMMITTEE to raise many of those issues on behalf of our electorates and on behalf of groups that we may be involved in or work with. National Stroke Week is a great opportunity to speak on this issue because, by raising awareness of the issues of stroke, the causes of stroke and the very important medical research and medical support that goes into dealing with the results of stroke, we can perhaps make a difference. There are many causes that we as individuals and members of parliament passionately believe in but, unfortunately, we cannot make a difference in all of them. But through public debate and awareness-raising we can contribute to the prevention of stroke and perhaps raise the number of medical opportunities available to deal with the symptoms of stroke. As I and speakers before me have said, stroke is preventable. It is an issue that fits, I think, quite closely with the government’s agenda when it comes to health reform and health policy around increasing our support for preventive health and primary care. It is at those two levels that we can make a real difference for stroke victims and, as importantly, potential stroke victims in this country. There are three key ways in which we can prevent stroke from happening. One of them is through clinical ways in terms of medication and, where appropriate, surgery. With the wonders of modern medicine in this country, we can deal with some of the causes of stroke through medical technology and medical expertise and so prevent strokes from occurring. But, as other speakers have said, the critical way of preventing stroke in our community is through changes in lifestyle. We all know that improving our diets, exercising more and cutting down on the bad habits of smoking and excessive intake of alcohol can improve our health in so many ways. Indeed, it is very clear that there are direct correlations between preventing strokes and addressing those lifestyle issues. So if just a few people are paying attention during the short time that we have available for this debate this evening and get the message and start to improve their lifestyle and physical health, it will be a great improvement for our community. Whilst we all know the major focus is on the benefits to individuals we must also acknowledge that stroke costs the taxpayer around $2.14 billion each year, so there is clearly an incentive from a financial perspective for us to encourage people to take up lifestyle changes that will help prevent them from becoming victims of stroke. As I said, this is important not just from the financial perspective, but also due to the fact that stroke is the second biggest killer in this country after coronary heart disease. As has been mentioned before, a statistic I was not aware of until I started to research this topic, is that stroke kills more women than breast cancer. We all know how effective the breast cancer campaign has been right across this country in many different aspects. This campaign has raised awareness and I believe it has meant that a lot more young women have taken the time to ensure that they put together a range of checks, balances and lifestyle changes to prevent them from becoming victims of that disease. In the time remaining can I echo the previous speaker’s comments about carers and volunteers in this area. (Time expired) tisan support to the work of the member for Shortland on this motion. I want to begin with a human tale, in fact two. I will not name the people involved for reasons of privacy, but the story of stroke in our community is about the impact of a tragic condition on real people.

263,Mr Hunt (Flinders) (7.21 Pm),"It is a great honour to be able to give personal and biparOne is the mum of a young girl called Grace. This mum was in her early forties when she was struck by a stroke. She was not a smoker. To the best of my knowledge she may have had one or two glasses of wine a week. She kept herself well, healthy and fit. There was a time when her family thought they would lose her. Fortunately, due to the combination of the love of her husband, the strength of a friend and the skill of those in the stroke unit who helped take care of her, she has been able to make a tremendous recovery. That is an exemplar of what we are looking at here. I want to deal briefly with the problem, the prevention and the cure. There is another story as well and that is of a young woman known to our family who was in her late twenties at the time, an athlete, a non-drinker and a non-smoker. What occurred in her situation was that during the week in which she finished her PhD thesis, she was also the victim of a stroke attack. For a long while we thought that this young woman would also be lost. There is nothing explicable; that is chance, human tragedy. Again, because of the strength of the individual, the support of her husband and the care, skill and professionalism of those in stroke units, there has been a very solid recovery. In each case there has been loss of quality of life. I do not want to pretend that there have been miracle recoveries, but there have been solid improvements which mean that there is a future. But there is a loss of amenity and there is suffering as a consequence. Let me explain the problem. The problem is that in this country 60,000 people will suffer a stroke each year. The causes have been well documented during this debate. There is some genetic predisposition for stroke, and for that there is screening and work can be done. But many strokes result from lifestyle issues, and it is these things which we can addressthrough National Stroke Week, through the work of the National Stroke Foundation, through the work of the different health bodies in relation to healthy lifestyle, control of our intake of alcohol, reduction and hopefully eradication of the use of tobacco products, and exercise on an appropriate scale. These things can help us make a real difference on the side of prevention. That is a profound and important task and that is why the National Stroke Foundation’s launch of its ‘Face, Arms, Speech, Time’ campaign is extremely important-it helps people to identify the risk factors and helps them to respond so that they take responsibility for their own lives and for those around them. That leads to the question of, where we cannot prevent, what we can do to help to cure. The research of the National Stroke Foundation is very clear that care in a stroke unit compared with general medical care can lead to a 20 per cent reduction in death, in the early days, and in disability, in the longer periods. This is an extremely important contribution. We need to spread these stroke units from within major hospitals and bring them to regional hospitals to give people the opportunity for early and immediate intervention at the moment of greatest need. That is our task. I thank the member for Shortland because, in bringing this motion to the House, she gives us a chance to cooperate in a bipartisan way on an issue of genuine bipartisan and national need. expired.

264,The Deputy Speaker ( Mr Aj Schultz),"Order! The time allotted for this debate hasDairy Industry Debate resumed, on motion by Dr Stone: That the House: (1) recognises the crisis now facing the dairy industry supplying export markets, as they are forced to take prices close to or below the costs of production; and (2) calls on the Government to: (a) provide the immediate assistance needed to ensure these dairy farmers are not forced to sell their herds or their water, destroying the prospects for recovery of this industry when export markets recover; and (b) remember how swiftly it responded to the crisis in Australia’s automotive and retail sectors, as it considers support of the multi-billion dollar dairy export sector which employs some 30,000 workers. Dr STONE (Murray) (7.26 pm)-The dairy industry is, without doubt, in crisis. An extraordinary overlapping of terrible events has meant that for the first time in 30 years we are seeing prices so low that dairy farmers are right now saying it is just too hard to continue. We have had drought in the southern Murray-Darling Basin and northern Victoria for seven years. We have had the global contraction of credit as a result of the global recession and so the contraction of demand for dairy product. That came on top of a scare in relation to contamination of milk powder in China. Put all that together and we saw the doors to our export industry slam shut some six to eight months ago. On top of those hard-enough-to-deal-with factors, we have federal and state government policies creating the destruction of the irrigation infrastructure of northern Victoria and southern New South Wales. The economies of scale of production which are needed to sustain dairy manufacturing depend on drought proofing. In some parts of Australia, there has been high rainfall. In most parts of Australia where milk is produced for dairy manufacturing, that production has been sustained over the last 100 years through low-energy, gravity fed irrigation. Unfortunately, through this government’s policies, we are seeing irrigators forced to sell out at prices offered by a federal government with very deep pockets when their lenders say to them: ‘You are in debt. The drought continues. You can leave right now or you can sell some of your water and hang on a little while longer and maybe it will rain.’ The problem with that scenario is that, once you have sold your water, if you are in the Goulburn Valley, the Murray Valley or the Loddon Valley-the homeland of dairy manufacturing in Australia-it is all over; you cannot afford to repurchase water and, with the loss of the security of supply and the contraction of the numbers of dairy farmers in the region, your own dairy manufacturing factories are looking very closely at whether it is a good idea to remain in the region. You can imagine the distress of dairy farmers when they saw the Rudd Labor government bail out the multinational car industry with nearly $6 billion and the ailing retail sector primed with another $4 billion before Christmas. We have also seen this Labor government look very kindly towards textiles, clothing and footwear. All of these industry sectors have for years battled to be classed as internationally competitive, but these particular industry sectors were handed billions of dollars to stay afloat. On the other hand we have the dairy industry-the manufacturing or export oriented dairy industry. It has been an industry that has held its head up despite no subsidy for generations. It generates, in fact, billions of dollars-$4.6 billion value at the farm gate and $11.5 billion MAIN COMMITTEE annually of wholesale value to the economy. The export industry alone contributes $2.9 billion to the economy. Between 30,000 and 40,000 jobs are dependent on the dairy industry. The economic regional multiplier of the dairy industry is estimated to be 2.5. This is a major industry for Australia and it is one which has been world’s best in practice for generations. It is not like our automotive industry-a multinational-led industry that staggers from crisis to crisis; the dairy industry has been superb and supreme. Now is its time of make or break. We have been appealing to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Minister Burke, now for six months. He says he is very understanding and sympathetic. He has visited my electorate, he has visited other parts of the Murray-Darling Basin to look at the dairy sector, and he has had his advisers come to the region. What he has told them basically is: ‘You’re in a great amount of strife here. You should be sympathised with but, sorry, we are not about to give you a hand.’ What the dairy industry needs is the difference between the below-cost-of-production prices offered and a reasonable return so they can hang on for at least 18 months, when we hope the prices will come back with international credit better restored and international demand back where it used to be. We are looking at only about $74 million. That is all it would take to give a future to Australia’s export dairy manufacturing sector and to protect the jobs for all of those who are involved, not just in the dairy production itself, but in the transport sector associated with this industry, the food manufacturing sector, the research and development sector, and the commercial sector with the retailing that goes with all of this production. Dairy milk powders were the biggest export by commodity volume and value out of Geelong for years, yet this Rudd Labor government has turned its back on the dairy industry. It is extraordinary to contemplate. What is the difference between keeping something like automotive, retail or the textile, clothing and footwear sectors afloat and the dairy industry? I am afraid some people simply say it is the way they vote. That should not be the way that this government deals with taxpayers’ funds and with retaining jobs in this economy. Let me say, too, that we have the most appalling water policy now. We have the minister, Penny Wong, thinking that if she puts enough dollars on the table, buys enough water from desperate farmers-who are not willing to sell, who are being pressured by their lenders-she is doing a favour to the environment. We have even the environmentalists, or those who say they have green credentials, now alarmed and disturbed that this water buyback measure has done nothing for restoring wetlands. What it has done is strand the assets of the irrigation sector and drive some of our best performers as dairy producers out of business. Let me give you an example of how perverse and extraordinary this whole business of the water buyback is for the dairy sector. HereI have from the Australian government Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts an offer to buy the water entitlements, for them to be sold to the Commonwealth, under the Restoring the Balance in the Murray-Darling Basin program. The offer to these farmers, who were forced to put their water on the market, was for $2,400 per megalitre. The date of the offer is 26 February this year. Note: 26 February. We have in this case and so many like it not a word since that offer was made-or, rather, their offer was accepted. The department recommends that this party get some accounting advice in relation to signing the contract. It is supposed to be a done deal. The government has said ‘here is $2,400 per megalitre; get out of business’. They do not even have the gumption or the values to say this MAIN COMMITTEE particular dairy farmer is completely finished because he has not been able to sell his water to save even part of his herd. This is the sort of thing our dairy farmers are facing. I have to tell you that it is an industry that has been world’s best practice. It is one that can continue to be world’s best practice and provide dairy food security for Australia ad infinitum, protecting the environment as it goes, building on its fantastic genetic values in its herds. Its human capital is the envy of the world and yet this government has turned its back on this industry. Only $74 million we are asking for-not $4 billion, not $6 billion-$74 million. The time is almost too late but not quite. If this government gets off its backside now we could have a dairy industry for the future. tion and I believe this issue has been long overdue for recognition, as there is a problem with the dairy industry in Australia. However, I think she is only looking for bandaid measures in the short-term, rather than looking to provide a future for the dairy industry in the long-term. Hopefully, some good suggestions will come out of the Senate inquiry but I note it has been spearheaded by our Tasmanian senators. I feel we have to look at the takeovers early in 2000 to see what has been going on and going wrong. I believe there have been some deregulatory changes that have not worked in favour of primary producers but have merely consolidated the market of two major overseas-owned companies. The recent history is quite interesting. From1 July 2000 long standing marketing arrangements, under which state governments regulated farm level prices for an output of fresh milk, ceased to exist. This development is generally referred to as dairy deregulation but it should be noted that post farm gate aspects of the dairy marketing had been progressively deregulated over several years immediately prior to that. The main drivers of market milk-market gate deregulation were the long foreshadowed determination of the Domestic Market Support Scheme, DMS, for manufactured milk on 30 June 2000, the push by Victorian producers and processors for deregulation and the National Competition Policy, NCP. The above factors were all interconnected to some extent and it is difficult to identify the specific role played by each. The DMS scheme contained a sunset clause in its legislation that would end on 30 June 2000 and it was clear that the main manufacturing milk producer states-especially Victoria and Tasmania-would be the major losers from the cessation of the DMS. Farm gate deregulation was strongly advocated by Victoria, which dominates the national dairy industry. The Victorian major dairy companies and producer organisations strongly sought deregulation to coincide with the determination of the DMS. This is not surprising, given their expected associated income losses. But Victoria’s support for deregulation was not confined to the big players. In December 1999 nearly 8,000 out of 9,000 eligible Victorian farmers took part in a plebiscite on deregulation and 89 per cent of those voting supported deregulation and accepted the Commonwealth government’s assistance package. The state NCP dairy reviews, while seeming to coincide with the termination of the DMS, actually had their own momentum and timetable. The first part of the dairy industry examination examined under the NCP was the post farm gate sector and this has been progressively deregulated with all retail pricing and supply controls removed from 1 January 1999. It was the subsequent NCP review of regulation at the farm level which created controversy. The Victorian NCP review of farm level regulation strongly backed deregulation, while other MAIN COMMITTEE",202,Private Members Business
265,Mr Adams (Lyons) (7.36 Pm),"I thank the member for Murray for introducing this mostates’ reviews were lukewarm at best. Nationally, however, governments and the industry recognise that national deregulation was inevitable if Victoria chose deregulation. The Tasmanian picture is interesting. Some 445 dairy farmers are expected to produce 700 million litres of milk in 2008-09. This represents some seven per cent of the national milk output. The dairy industry directly employs 1,475 people on farms and a further 1,250 in the processing sector. Dairy companies manufacturing product in the region includes Fonterra, National Foods and Cadbury. The estimated value of farm gate production in the region in 2007-08 was $275 million. Dairy export from the region was valued at around $260 million. The farms surveyed in Tasmania were milking around 351 cows and producing 1.9 million litres on average in 2008-09. The average area of dairy land was 160 hectares. Seventy-seven per cent of Tasmanian respondents have been affected by price step-downs. Step-downs had a major effect on 68 per cent of farms in the region. As a result of step-downs, 33 per cent of those affected decided to decrease the level of supplementary feed used. Seventy-four per cent of farmers in the region undertook some capital investments in 2008-09. The average grain usage dropped from 1.2 tonnes per cow per year to 1.1 tonnes; 87 per cent of land set up for irrigation was actually irrigated in 2008-09 and 78 per cent of respondents typically purchased grains and supplements as required while 25 per cent used forward contracts. For 73 per cent of farms in the region, the most common production scheme was seasonal calving. Some 21 per cent of farms used split or batch calving, while six per cent produced milk all year round. Tasmanians have had a tough time because they have had a very severe drought in recent years, and there has been an enormous effort to start drought-proofing land in order for farmers to plan their future investment. In recent times we had floods which caused problems with spring calving and generally caused problems because of the long-term drought. With the market now concentrated in two companies in south-east Australia, there is little room for proper competition to work. The changes that occurred after deregulation were largely driven by the impact on farmgate returns. There have been some important developments in farm-gate milk pricing. These include changes in the price determination process for year-round milk production, the impact of deregulation on average price received for milk and the emergence of distinct regional variations in milk pricing. Deregulation has affected export returns, which now have a greater effect on the average price received for milk as they have taken into account changes in the values of seasonal milk used for manufactured products. Dairy companies compete for milk supplies on the basis of annual prices offered for seasonal and non-seasonal milk. The RIRDC report Industry adjustment to policy reform suggests that the key is the monthly profile of milk production. Manufacturers are after seasonal milk for cheese, butter et cetera whereas milk processors need the short shelf-life products like fresh milk. It is the milk processors that need a constant supply. Apparently, the RIRDC commercial requirements for the reliable supply of non-seasonal milk have caused processors to introduce supply contracts. They provided a guaranteed source of supply for a significant proportion of their annual milk requirements, according to the National Competition Council in 2004. Contract pricing conditions have replaced the regulated price controls as an indicator of the farm gate value of year round milk supplies. These prices are set at different levels depending on the monthly cycle. The average price for non-seasonal milk is supposed to be higher than MAIN COMMITTEE for seasonal milk as it has traditionally worked, but somehow in Tasmania the contracts have failed to hold their price over a 12-month period. I believe we should have put into place some resource guarantee so that when contracts were negotiated there were some bottom-line principles to work up a sustainable price. I do not see why the manufacturing companies can send the primary producers broke to compete in the world sense. The deregulation in Victoria caused this dilemma and there was no research done to see how some of the levy that was put in place could have been put aside to hedge against lower world milk demand. This is not something that can be discussed here in a mere 10 minutes. I will be talking to both manufacturers and producers in the next few weeks to see whether I can get a clearer picture. The federal Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry has told me that there are measures that farmers can pursue to assist in the short term. Although we have already provided some assistance through the exceptional circumstances program, there may be other assistance for which Tasmanian farmers can apply. I am looking forward to see what farmers need to help them to negotiate sustainable contracts for their domestic fresh milk. for putting this important motion before the chamber and I associate myself with the comments she made, particularly in relation to the need for government assistance for the dairy industry at such a critical time in its history. The member for Murray and the member for Lyons understand the importance of the dairy industry to their communities and the great difficulties that farming families are facing, particularly with reduced prices and the ongoing drought. It does beggar belief that, in that environment, Melbourne Labor ministers at state level would be stealing water from the Goulburn River. But then again they are about to steal another 10 billion litres from the Thomson River in the electorate of Gippsland, and that is an issue for another day. The dairy industry is as critical to the seat of Gippsland as the car industry is to a city like Geelong and yet we have seen a remarkable double standard in the government’s treatment of the two industries at this time of economic crisis. It is a crisis which I stress is beyond the control of individual dairy farmers. I note with a great deal of interest that the Senate is about to undertake an inquiry into a range of issues which are relevant to the motion which is before the chamber. That inquiry will investigate the economic impact on the dairy industry of the reductions in prices that are paid to producers by the milk processors. There are a whole range of important issues that the Senate inquiry will consider, particularly in the context of the ongoing drought conditions in parts of Australia and the fact that the cost of production for many of our dairy farmers is higher than the prices that are currently on offer at the milk factories. The dairy industry in Gippsland is concentrated in the Macalister irrigation district, which is the largest irrigation area south of the Great Dividing Range in Victoria. As I have told the chamber previously, our dairy farmers are among the most productive and efficient in the world. They are world-class producers of a world-class product. The dairy industry is quite big business for the people of Gippsland, with the Wellington shire having more than 400 dairy farms, the majority of which are located in the MID. The region has its own major collection and processing facility at Maffra, with the Murray Goulburn co-op, which produces a range of products mainly for the export markets.

266,Mr Chester (Gippsland) (7.46 Pm),"I would like to commend the member for MurrayMy community has been particularly hard hit by the drop in prices and I have sought assistance from both the state and federal agriculture ministers for the development of an industry assistance package. I have argued in my correspondence to the ministers that the dairy industry has a strong long-term future in the region but there is a need to assist my community as it deals with the current difficulties. I am particularly concerned about our younger farmers who may be carrying significant levels of debt. I believe we need to give them confidence in their futures on the land. I have taken up the point in the member for Murray’s motion that the government could provide assistance to ensure our dairy farmers are not forced to sell their herds or their water, destroying the prospects for recovery when export markets inevitably recover. As I said, I am optimistic about the longer term future but we need to take action now to help our farmers get over the hump before them so that they are in a position to continue to produce quality Australian dairy products in the future. There needs to be a survival plan developed to assist our farmers through what I believe will be a difficult 12-month period. Both state and federal governments need to demonstrate their support for a viable dairy industry right across Australia and be prepared to offer assistance during this period. As a nation we have bailed out the car industry, as I referred to earlier. We have also handed out billions of dollars in $900 cheques to prop up the retail sector. I think it is reasonable to develop an assistance package for the dairy industry in these exceptional circumstances. It would be a modest package in comparison to those cash splashes that we have seen by the government. I have received a reply from my representations to the federal Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, and I am afraid there is no good news for my local farmers in his response. There is no intention of taking decisive action. While the minister’s response was certainly sympathetic, reflected an understanding of my concerns for the dairy industry, there is no sign that he is actually prepared to take action. He indicated, on a visit to Shepparton, he is aware of the challenges facing the dairy industry in terms of the ongoing drought, the sharp fall in global dairy commodity prices and the decisions by the European Union and the United States to introduce export subsidies. But that is about where it ends from the minister’s perspective. His response is certainly sympathetic and it reflected that understanding of the concerns. However, I urge him to be more than sympathetic, I urge him to be a champion of the industry that he is commissioned to represent in this place. Many farmers have suggested options to me, including a range of measures such as temporary income support to underwrite low prices or triggering exceptional circumstances interest rate subsidies and increased assistance to develop international markets. The minister says that he is dealing with that final point and there has been some improvement in the situation with India, along with funding for Dairy Australia to host dairy events in Dubai and Saudi Arabia. I doubt though that we are doing enough and the end result will be more dairy farmers forced off the land. Referring again to the situation in Gippsland, I would like to comment briefly on the government’s stimulus spending. Apart from the current prices, which hopefully will pass, the biggest issue for dairy farms in my electorate is the issue of water security. It staggers me that this government has been prepared to hand out $900 cheques but has not even looked at a critical issue, such as investing in improved infrastructure delivering increased water security in Gippsland. The dairy industry in Gippsland is faced with ageing infrastructure and an inefMAIN COMMITTEE ficient system. The MID 2030 Strategy was released two years ago and can improve the supply system. This would be a win for the industry and a win for the environment. I urge the minister to be a champion for that cause as well. dairy industry it is extremely important to our nation and to the future of our nation. It is important that we have a viable dairy industry well into the future. Just before I get to the question of the dairy industry specifically, I note that the motion that is before the House talks about doing something equivalent to the support the Rudd government provided to the automotive industry in Australia. I make this point: in respect to the automotive industry in Australia, the support provided by the government was more than simply about providing support to one particular sector. It was about supporting the sector that underpins the manufacturing base right throughout this country. It was broad support to the manufacturing industry which began with the automotive sector. Secondly, it was about providing an investment in reducing carbon emissions into the future; again, one of the most critical challenges we face not only in Australia but right across the globe. Thirdly, it was about investing in more fuel-efficient motor vehicles, because, in the future when petrol prices are likely to escalate as a result of the world oil shortage, it is important that we bring back value for money for the motorists. So it was more than simply about underpinning a particular industry. Having said that, I do value the dairy industry in this country. It is my view, that, next to water, milk is probably the most critical liquid we have on earth. It sustains life right across the earth. The dairy industry in this country has been in decline for several decades. In about 1980 we had something like 20,000 dairy farmers across Australia, that figure is now down to about 8,000. In my own state of South Australia, in 1980 we had just under 2,000 dairy farmers, today it is around 300 or so. I have seen the decline. Like so many other agricultural and horticultural sectors in this country the decline has been there for a range of reasons. It is not something that I would like to see continued; I make that absolutely clear. Nevertheless, the dairy industry would not be unique in the agricultural sector in the difficulties it is facing. These difficulties were acknowledge by the previous government when they introduced the 11c per litre levy on milk in order to try to provide some income back to the farmers, but, in reality, led to a rationalisation of the industry but seems to have done very little else in sustaining the industry well into the future. It is an industry which got the benefit of the $1.9 billion from the 11c levy that was raised, but, nevertheless, is still facing very real hardships today which I very well acknowledge. These are hardships that, I believe, arise from two areas. One is because of the water shortages that members opposite have spoken about-and which I acknowledge. As a result of those water shortages, the ability to irrigate the pastures required to sustain their herds has become much more expensive. Water shortages are a critical issue being faced by orange growers, vignerons and people across the agricultural sectors. They are facing the same cost pressures on their ability to remain viable. Nevertheless, this issue is very real and we need to do what we can to improve water availability for our agricultural and horticultural producers right across this country. I will not labour the point, but the $13 billion that the Rudd government has invested in securing our water supplies for the future will go a long way to doing that. Ultimately, more may need to be done. MAIN COMMITTEE",207,Private Members Business
267,Mr Zappia (Makin) (7.51 Pm),"Let me say from the outset that it is my view that theThe critical issues, however, are the multinational takeover of the milk industries in this country and the subsidies provided to overseas dairy producers by their governments, which we are regrettably unable to match at the moment. The Minister for Trade, Simon Crean, is working through the Doha Round to create a much more level playing field for our dairy farmers. If that can be achieved it will hopefully go a long way to giving them some additional support. No-one would deny we are going through the worse global recession since the Great Depression. That too has contributed to the downward trend in milk prices. What can be done is being done by the government, and I support the measures that are already in place. this discussion to the attention of the House. It has been quite a useful exchange. Between her electorate and mine we jointly represent the great bulk of the dairy industry of the irrigated region of the Murray Valley. I speak today about an industry very exposed and vulnerable, an industry that is a wonderful regional employer across north-western Victoria. Dairy is the largest export industry in Victoria. It employs 10,000 people, and last year more than 2.8 billion Victorian dairy products were exported to markets in Asia, Europe and the Americas. That is why it is galling for my constituents to watch this federal government, in league with the state government of Victoria, allow their precious water to be stolen and sent to Melbourne. ‘Stolen’ is a strong word, but it is the truth. It is not moral and there is no limit to the avarice of the Victorian government. Only last week they announced that they want 12,000 megalitres of the water savings from the Wimmera Mallee Pipeline, despite the fact that there are legally constructed agreements between the government of Victoria and the federal government that all the water savings from the $350 million investment by the Commonwealth would go to the environment and stressed rivers, which certainly includes the Goulburn and the Murray. Dairy farmers are facing the multiple whammy of drought, a surge in production costs caused by the drought, uncertainty about how they are going to be treated in the Rudd government’s proposed Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, foreign market manipulation and market domination in the retail sector. I note the comments of the member for Lyons and I accept his long standing association with the dairy industry in Tasmania. But what he overlooked in his comments on the impacts of deregulation and Victorian dairy farmers’ participation in and desire for that outcome is that an unprecedented crisis arrived after the massive reductions in water allocations right along the Murray Valley and the Goulburn River system. These are unprecedented times. What was once the securest water supply system anywhere in the world has now been reduced to its parlous state. On top of that, greedy, avaricious governments want the politically expedient solution to the water supply problems of Melbourne, a big metropolitan city that is not even trying to reuse its sewage water or harvest its drainage water. The dairy industry in Australia does have a future. It is optimistic about that, but it is asking for help in its current calamity. It is going to take years to rebuild the dairy industry, particularly in Victoria. We will lose dairy husbandry expertise. We will lose a large slab of the genetic base of dairy herds, which other countries are now taking advantage of. It is an industry fast losing its capacity to survive and it desperately needs help. You just cannot turn a cow’s udder on and off like a tap. You need the breeding stock and long-term planning. Cows have MAIN COMMITTEE",209,Private Members Business
268,Mr Forrest (Mallee) (7.56 Pm),"I congratulate the member for Murray for bringingto be milked every morning and evening and they have to be fed. If those things cannot happen they have to be sold. I note the member for Makin’s comments. He would defend the investments that have occurred in the motor vehicle industry; it is a very strong industry in his electorate. We are not criticising those investment decisions. We are saying that the dairy industry deserves similar consideration. The massive cash injections that have occurred in some sectors of the economy amount to $160,000 to save every job. When the member for Makin talks about the number of dairy farmers, he forgets the huge numbers of jobs-up to 30,000 right across Australia-in the processing sector. Those are the jobs that are at risk, and we are asking for the government to give strong consideration to supporting them. It can support them by making sure it invests in the dairy industry to save the farmers’ herds. The response to the auto industry investment has been huge. There has been massive investment in the financial sector through bank guarantees, which have reduced competition in the market. The government has made the decision to invest there. We are asking that it recognise the massive significance of the dairy industry across Australia to the GDP and stand by our dairy farmers in the electorates of Mallee and Murray. I support this resolution and am grateful that there has been an opportunity to bring the concerns of my constituents to the attention of the House. share an identical birth date, for raising issues affecting an important Australian industry, particularly in my region, which is one of the most productive dairy districts not just in Tasmania but in the country. In Tasmania dairy represents 24 per cent of the value of farm production and underpins significant downstream processing. Tasmania’s dairy industry supports some 460 farms, producing over 640 million litres annually, and is a vital regional employer, directly employing 2,200 people on-farm and a further 675 in the processing sector. Tasmania is the third biggest dairying state, behind New South Wales and Victoria. In the last five years production has grown by about 20 per cent. Indeed, it is a growing industry not just in terms of output but in terms of capital investment, as some 25 per cent of farms undertook some form of capital investment in 2007-08. About eight per cent of Tasmania’s milk production is consumed as drinking milk. The balance is manufactured by dairy companies such as Fontera, National Foods and Cadbury into products such as cheese, milk powder, butter and confectionery. The gross value of Tasmanian dairy products after manufacturing is nearly $600 million. In the year 2007-08 this was worth $332 million at the farm gate but, as a stark indicator of the problems facing our farmers, this will drop to less than $300 million this year. This drop has been forced by a number of factors, including seasonal conditions and a falling international milk price. In my part of the world a huge rainfall has made it difficult for some farmers just to get the herd to dairy. In January Fontera announced a cut of about 32 per cent to its suppliers, which I am told is worth between $50,000 and $80,000 to the bottom line of a typical supplier. Fontera is by far the largest player in the Tasmanian industry and has been hit by the global financial crisis and its impact on world markets, where much of its produce is traded. I note that some optimism remains in the sector and a few indicators are starting to show light at the end of the international price tunnel. MAIN COMMITTEE",210,Private Members Business
269,Mr Sidebottom (Braddon) (8.01 Pm),"I thank the member for Murray, with whom IIn more recent times suppliers of whole milk in my state have been hit particularly hard by a cut to prices from dairy company National Foods. The reason for this cut in prices has been the subject of much debate and comment, particularly in my state. It led me to write to National Foods to seek their perspective on what it is a complex situation. In direct correspondence with National Foods on this matter the company tells me its price is aimed at sustaining the company and farmers through what is a difficult time for all with reduced prices across the board. While I am no authority on pricing, what I would seek from both National Foods and farmers is an arrangement where, in effect, they share equally both the gain and the pain. When prices are strong and a market buoyant, then both parties should be rewarded. But, when times are tough, then a company should be staring down a barrel just as much as its suppliers. National Foods says it was forced to pay a competitive price to its whole milk suppliers two years ago when the processing milk price was high. Further, it argues, while the farm gate price rose by more than 50 per cent, the supermarket price for branded milk rose by about 10 per cent and private label pricing rose even less and has since dropped. During this time of price scrutiny, the major supermarket chains must also look closely at their responsibilities. They have a major say over the volume of milk that flows to consumers and the price that they pay. They must consider the big picture and the future of the industry as a whole, and not be completely price driven. We are at a crossroads for some dairy farmers, and the risk to the industry cannot be understated. On the price front, I hope that the current inquiries by the Senate will look more closely at what influences the price milk suppliers of any type receive. I am concerned however that the lack of competition in Tasmania may lend itself to greater market variability when compared with other states. When massive price distortions occur and long-term contracts are subsequently locked in, there is a real risk that producers will be forced out of the industry-and I do not need to remind members what this will mean to the future viability of the local industry in Tasmania. Given the difficulties facing many of my local farmers, farmers in financial hardship can access free and impartial financial advice through the Rural Financial Counselling Service, co-funded by the Australian and Tasmanian governments, and these services are located throughout Tasmania. We need to strive to find the answers to sustain both our farmers and the companies that they supply so that the industry can survive to a time when prices are again strong and all can reap the benefits. expired. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. Problem Gambling Debate resumed, on motion by Mr Champion: That the House: (1) notes with concern that the incidence of problem gambling has increased since the introduction of electronic gaming machines in communities around Australia, particularly due to the design and structural features of the electronic gaming machines; MAIN COMMITTEE",211,Private Members Business

The time allotted for this debate has(2) recognises that the current legislation and regulation of electronic gaming machines do not provide adequate protection to consumers; (3) notes with deep concern that the availability of treatment services for problem gamblers is inadequate; (4) acknowledges that problem gambling associated with the use of electronic gaming machines causes financial and emotional damage to individual gamblers and their families; and (5) calls upon State governments and the gambling industry to work together to limit the harm caused to problem gamblers from electronic gaming machines. night. In researching my speech, I had a look through the AHA’s magazine. I noticed that one of the newest electronic gaming machines advertised in there has a handbag hook listed as one of its selling points. This handbag hook is an indicator of how important game design is to the industry and how important it is to the debate on problem gambling. The hook did not appear by accident; it is the product of consumer research and industry innovation. It shows that this industry is very focused on its customer, very focused on what makes the customer stay or go from a gaming machine. I have no idea about the effect of this handbag hook on problem gambling. It may have no effect at all. make the customer stay at the machine a bit longer, helping to create or exacerbate a problem. The Tasmanian Gaming Commission report of 2008 found, on page 6: The machine producers are known to invest heavily in R&D to make their machines more profitable for venue operators. Features are developed and refined to attract gamblers to the machines and keep them engaged with the machines. Vulnerable gamblers are captured by these specifically designed features. This report bells the cat, because the design of these machines is at the heart of the problems they create for the community. And, make no mistake, they create a great deal of harm to problem gamblers: loss of income, debt, family breakdown, low productivity at work, theft, bankruptcy, suicide-all results of these machines. The Statewide Gambling Therapy Service in my electorate has collected statistics on the people they treat. Numbers seeking treatment have increased from 23 to 134 per year over the past three years. Thirty-six people who were treated last year were spending over $1,500 a week on their addiction prior to their treatment, and the majority of clients were spending more than $500 a week. The median figure for the losses of these gamblers was $30,000 before they sought treatment. Behind all of those figures are personal stories of addiction, loss, shame and deep regret, and all of those people have taken the personal responsibility of getting treatment. Meanwhile, I think parliaments across Australia-governments and oppositions alike-fail to take into account evidence that has been found in many reports that the design of gaming machines is directly related to problem gambling. I do not think we should sit on our hands. We should act on areas of design like reinforcement schedules, spin rates, the appearance of the near miss, multiple-line betting, reducing maximum bet levels, the presence of note acceptors, clear displays of losses as well as wins, visual and sound effects, the design of venues and even small things like the handbag hook. All these design features need to be up for exMAIN COMMITTEE",212,Private Members Business
271,Mr Champion (Wakefield) (8.07 Pm),It is a great pleasure to move this motion to,213,Private Members Business
272,Mr Sidebottom,It’s a service.,213,Private Members Business
273,Mr Champion,"It may be a service, as the member for Braddon says, but it might alsoamination to find a comprehensive set of protections for the community. Even the industry’s own research, the 2001 report by Blaszczynski, Sharpe and Walker, stated on page 11: The present study found evidence to support the view that the reduction of maximum bet size from $10 to $1 on electronic gaming machines would be a potentially effective harm minimisation strategy for a small proportion of players. I am informed that on some machines you can play $9 per spin by betting on multiple lines and that the average spin rate on these machines is three seconds, so you can lose $180 per minute, or $10,000 an hour. So this recommendation made by the industry’s own commissioned research is very important, but unfortunately it has been ignored, as so many reports around the country have been ignored. There have been reports from South Australia, and in Tasmania there has been a lot of research throughout the industry over the years. Every day we ignore these reports and the effects of machine design, people are placed at financial and emotional risk. One cannot predict the future. Politicians rarely make guarantees. The one thing I can guarantee to this House is that somewhere in my electorate tonight someone will leave a gaming venue feeling ashamed, desperate and remorseful, all because of addiction to these machines. They have a responsibility to get help, but we have a responsibility to get the industry’s hooks out of their handbags. a scourge that is bad for families and takes advantage of human frailty. I therefore welcome the motion brought forward by the member for Wakefield, which addresses the issue of problem gambling, the proliferation of electronic gaming machines in communities and the way these machines are designed. The motion also raises the inadequate legislation and regulation of these electronic gaming machines and the inadequate treatment services available, as well as calling upon state governments and the gambling industry to work together to limit the harm caused to problem gamblers by these electronic gaming machines. Gambling is the best example of the genie being let out of the bottle. It is like the Ebola virus, with serious financial mortality for those who are afflicted with gambling addiction. The great thing for my state of Western Australia is that successive state governments have rejected the proliferation of gaming machines beyond Burswood casino. Consequently the state of Western Australia has never relied on the revenue generated by gambling machines in licensed clubs across the state, and long may that be the case. I am certain that under the Barnett Liberal government there will not be any change to that policy. With regard to electronic gaming machines-which I think of as, as we used to call them, poker machines-there are, sadly, a lot of people in this country who make an all too regular pilgrimage to put money into the machines in many places around the country, including the casino in Perth. They primarily do so in the many licensed clubs in the other states around the country. In response to this criticism, licensed clubs talk about how much money they have put back into the community, and there is no doubt that junior sport has benefited from the money that has flowed. But I ask: at what cost? Junior sport in the eastern states should not be built on the financial wreckage of the families brought down by gambling and human weakness. A telling statistic comes from the 1999 productivity study into gambling, which suggests that 43 per cent of the revenue from gambling comes from problem gamblers. I recall that MAIN COMMITTEE",213,Private Members Business
274,Mr Simpkins (Cowan) (8.11 Pm),"Electronic gambling is a scourge, as all gambling ismany years ago, on a visit to the Wrest Point casino in Hobart, I put $20 on the chocolate wheel and promptly lost it. I felt bad, and I will recall that incident for the rest of my life. I therefore have never gambled again, and clearly I am not an addicted gambler, but many are. It also seems to be the case that so many of these people cannot afford to lose their money. I put this down to two things: an addiction to gambling coupled with the so often misplaced belief in luck. More people in this country should come to the stark realisation that there is no such thing as luck. Achievement is based on hard work and the taking of opportunities. No benefit is going to fall in one’s lap as a result of luck; benefits come about only because of the specific action taken by the individual. In considering this motion I am torn between my fundamental belief in the principle of personal responsibility and the need for government action to take away the risk posed by these electronic gambling machines. That brings me to what must be done. It does not look like any of the state governments are going to take action on this issue, but there are some things that could be done. Firstly, they could withdraw the licences for all gaming machines outside casinos. If not, they could take ATMs out of casinos, licensed premises and clubs. They could also remove EFTPOS and credit card machines out of anywhere apart from the restaurant facilities in these places. With that, they could make sure that none of the electronic gaming machines accept banknotes. These measures are about harm elimination, not harm reduction. But these are the harder measures, whereas some form of tax imposed on the industry or treatment programs and other reactions to the outcomes of problem gambling just deal with the symptoms, not the underlying issue. So far I have talked about the actions available to state governments, but I return to the responsibility of individuals. Never having been addicted to anything, I just do not understand it. Perhaps it is easy for someone like me to just say: walk away and turn your back on that path of self-destruction-that is, gambling. Yes, it takes strength of character, but action should not come down to government alone. Acceptance of responsibility is important for individual problem gamblers. Gambling causes financial cost and loss of employment, and sometimes it turns a person towards crime. It can even cost a person their family. These are the costs that await problem gamblers. Gambling is a national problem that affects families. Money is being made and government revenue is being generated, but it is the families of problem gamblers who are without doubt the big losers. They are suffering because their family members are gambling. The gambler should firstly look in a mirror and confront their own responsibilities, but governments should not make it so easy for these people to be parted from their money either. very important issue and I thank other members for their contributions. We certainly have a culture of gambling in this country. If you look back at The Man from Snowy River line, ‘There was Harrison, who made his pile when Pardon won the cup,’ there is certainly a culture of gambling in our country. We have always enjoyed a punt on the horses or a game of two-up on ANZAC Day at various venues around the community. As gaming machines come into casinos, less of the floor is taken up by the old style of games and more of the floor is occupied by poker machines. I certainly welcome this motion from the member for Wakefield because it is a mature debate that the country needs to have. We do not want it to be the elephant in the room, where MAIN COMMITTEE",214,Private Members Business
275,Mr Hale (Solomon) (8.16 Pm),"I commend the member for Wakefield for raising thiswe ignore the fact that there are people within our society who do have a problem with gambling. These electronic machines have taken gambling to a new level. The member for Wakefield alluded to the amount of money that can be lost in a very short period of time. There are clubs throughout Australia that are working diligently on trying to address the issues that face problem gamblers within their organisations. However, more still has to be done. The Australian Hotels Association has a lot of responsibility falling back onto it for a raft of different reasons. It is an organisation that was established in 1839. Many of the challenges that it faces have to do with the essence of Australian culture, whether that is to do with gambling, smoking regulations or the global financial crisis, as well as the impact that alcohol and illicit drugs make. As the private sector pulls back on sponsorship during the global financial crisis, it will be the clubs that will step up and sponsor organisations. However, they still have a responsibility to continue to work closely with government to protect people who find themselves in a position where they are affected by gambling. Some 6,800 hotels in Australia employ 188,000 people, with a total spend of $12 billion to $13 billion a year. It is not an issue that we can sweep under the carpet; it is an issue that needs to be discussed. I welcome the fact that the Productivity Commission will be making findings. There have been something like 260 public submissions already and I encourage people to continue to put submissions forward so that we can have a whole-of-nation approach. It is up to the federal government to work with the state and territory governments in order to address the problems that are facing problem gamblers. I commend the Palmerston Sports Club, the Northern Territory government, the Casuarina All Sports Club, Tracy Village Social and Sports Club and Charles Darwin University to name but a few organisations within my electorate that have decided to put submissions forward in relation to this. One of the disturbing things that I found while researching for this contribution tonight was in a submission made by the National, State and Territory Councils of Social Service. We all had a vision, I suppose, of the lady with the blue-rinse hair sitting in front of a poker machine. Certainly, when I was a golf course superintendent on the Murray River there were a lot of those types of people, but increasingly this is a problem that is affecting young people. You only need to go into a casino nowadays to see that the age of the people who are playing the machines has come down dramatically. There are a lot of young people, people at risk, people with disabilities and certainly people from the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities that are affected by this. The number of young people that you see is quite unbelievable. I think it is really important that our society addresses quickly the poker machine problem that is starting to occur amongst our young people. We certainly need to have a debate about the issue. The community services in Darwin do a lot of work in this area and they find that there are spin-off effects from gambling. There are the effects on the person with the gambling problem and also the neglect of family, the overlooking of social and cultural obligations, family breakdown and the spin-off effects of people losing their jobs. We certainly need to have a debate on this issue in this country. I look forward to the Productivity Commission’s final report. I commend the member for bringing it to the attention of the House. ing this motion before the House and giving members the opportunity to reflect on gambling within our communities. The topic is of particular interest to my electorate of Swan, which MAIN COMMITTEE",215,Private Members Business
276,Mr Irons (Swan) (8.22 Pm),"I would like to thank the member for Wakefield for bringcontains the Burswood casino, one of the largest casinos and gambling centres in WA. I also have in my electorate two horseracing tracks, Belmont Park and Ascot, and the Cannington Greyhounds. I guess you could call it the gambling electorate of Western Australia. I will try to bring a Western Australian perspective to today’s debate-obviously, following up on the member for Cowan’s contribution. Statistics show that Western Australia has the lowest gambling rate in Australia. In 2006-07 the average Australian adult spend $1,131 on gambling. However, in Western Australia the average per adult expenditure on gambling was $630, by far the lowest in all states and territories. In terms of gambling turnover, Western Australians contributed just 2.9 per cent of all gambling turnover across Australia. With just 10 per cent of the population, that is a remarkable figure. The 10 per cent figure also reminds me of the remarkable figure of the enormous amounts of exports from our great state-close to 40 per cent of all Australian exports. And at times Western Australia is considered a cowboy state, although we do have a really low gambling rate! Gaming policy has traditionally been a responsibility of the states, and part of the reason for our low gambling rates has been WA’s long-term gambling licensing legislation. WA has placed restrictions on gaming ever since 1892, when the Western Australian Police Act made gambling illegal. Many Western Australians will remember the illegal gambling places in Northbridge that went under the policy radar until about the mid-eighties. Very few obeyed the laws and, over time, legislation was introduced to carefully manage gambling and ensure that the proceeds benefited the community. For example, the 1932 Lotteries Control Act led to permits for lotteries and in 1972 the Lotteries Commission granted bingo permits for religious or charitable organisations. Perhaps crucially, though, a report of the Royal Commission into gambling in 1974 strongly recommended against the introduction of poker machines. Successive governments have maintained this policy. This was a contentious decision and in the ensuing years many argued passionately for and against the ban. Luckily, those against have prevailed. However, introduction of the Casino (Burswood Island Agreement) Act in 1995 represented a compromise. WA legalised slot machines in only one place-Burswood. As a result of the semi-ban Western Australia today has just 523 pokies, compared with 45,000 in Queensland. Members will be well aware of the evidence linking pokies and problem gamblers, and I think it is fair to draw a correlation between the two. I support a continuation of the pokies ban in WA, even though the WA government is foregoing tax revenues in excess of $300 million by maintaining the ban. We have to strike a balance between defending individual rights to gamble and protecting individuals and communities from the problems that gambling causes. I think in WA we have got that balance right, but we can do better. Having said this, there remain serious examples of problem gambling in WA, and I am aware of people in my electorate who have suffered. I have two family members who have fallen victim to gambling addictions in Victoria. The member for Wakefield has gone into the problems associated with gambling in detail, and I do not need to repeat them here. He addressed these issues with a compassion which I applaud. The Productivity Commission estimate that problem gamblers lose around $3.5 billion annually, or an average of $12,000 each, and that there are around 1,600 gambling related divorces annually and between 35 and 60 suicides. In WA I know the state government runs free counselling services to help address this problem. As members of parliament, we must continue to support these programs. At the same MAIN COMMITTEE time, it is important to continue to ensure WA’s tradition of investing gambling proceeds back into communities. Burswood Casino does contribute to worthwhile community projects. I recognise its contribution to St Vincent de Paul’s winter appeal and its $500,000 contribution towards the Victorian bushfire victims, helping these families and communities rebuild their lives. A levy on the pokies has led to $15 million of much needed investment in the Swan River. In conclusion, the Western Australian experience shows that electronic gambling machines can be used in a way that recognises community needs and benefits local communities. If we contain the use of the machines, the temptation is reduced for problem gamblers and the machines are less accessible than those that exist in sporting clubs or other venues on the east coast. At the end of the day, I understand personal responsibility but the primary issue here is to minimise the gambling environment, support those who have fallen under its spell and help them recover from the damage gambling addictions cause to families in our communities. At a federal level, we also have a responsibility to oversee this industry. I acknowledge the good work done by previous parliaments, particularly in passing the Interactive Gambling Bill 2001. (Time expired) Ms RISHWORTH (Kingston) (8.27 pm)-I am very pleased to rise to support the motion by the member for Wakefield. I commend him for bringing it to House and commend the contributions by all the other speakers here today. I would like to add my concern about the impact that electronic gaming machines have on some members of our community. It is estimated that there are over 290,000 problem gamblers here in Australia and over two million Australians are affected in some way by problem gambling. The member for Wakefield mentioned that there was probably someone in his electorate tonight leaving a place having been affected by problem gambling. I would say that there is probably someone in all of our electorates tonight who is leaving a place having been affected by problem gambling. Previous to working as a member of parliament, I used to work as a psychologist. I saw first hand some of the terrible effects when someone becomes addicted to gambling. What struck me more than any economic detriment was the psychological detriment that occurred to these people, whether it was intense shame, intense embarrassment or depression. For the families as well there were severe trust issues that occurred. It really did tear some families apart. So this has a particular importance to me, and I am pleased that the motion recognises the inadequacy of some of the consumer protections in place at the moment. The member for Wakefield rightly pointed to the area of consumer protection when it comes to the design of electronic gaming machines. There are many elements of these machines that make them incredibly reinforcing to the player, including the music, the pictures, the physical features-the handbag hook has been mentioned-the payout schedules, the amount of payout and the amount that you can bet. All these are designed to encourage patrons to stay longer than they intended to. In addition, it has been acknowledged that the surrounding environment also gets people to keep on playing these machines. Research suggests that gamblers, especially those who play more than once a week, find it difficult to stop playing once the session has commenced. This was made evident to me by the sharp decline in gambling revenue that occurs-it has been acknowledged in South Australia and by the Productivity Commission in 2001-when smoking bans occur. That got me thinking: what actually is happening here? MAIN COMMITTEE rupted in accordance with standing order 41. The member will have leave to continue speaking when private members’ business is resumed. Debate resumed from 7 September. That grievances be noted. Gambling Work for the Dole so many grievances that I am not sure that 10 minutes will be enough. have. Speaker! I want to pick up where the member for Kingston’s contribution left off. I commend her and her colleagues and, in fact, members on both sides of the House for looking at the insidious impact of gambling. I am always flabbergasted that poker machines, in which I find I have no interest as they offer no entertainment whatsoever, seem to be the single focus of this. What about interactive gambling? What about this area under direct federal jurisdiction where we are seeing little baby steps of new technology being introduced, bringing the curse of being able to lose your shirt without even having to put one on. Yes, you can lose your shirt without putting one on by gambling at home, with all the sights and sounds of race day coming and booming at you through your high-definition plasma television, while you are banging away at your betting investment, able to EFT or ring in for more credit. So where is the conversation about that? There is nothing. We had Prime Minister Rudd and the Labor government talking about a war on gambling. What they were talking about is a little skirmish over to one side, being the most supervised and observed part of gambling that you have ever seen, while there is this enormous internecine gambling problem brewing with interactive gambling and this government will not lift a finger. There is something very strange and very perverse about that. I grieve for the people in families who are raised on a diet of interactive gambling at home without the brakes that you see on betting in gaming venues, without the limit on transactions that you see with poker machines, without the supervised use that you see in gaming venues, without someone observing whether you are tired and without someone making sure that you are not intoxicated. All of these supervisions and safeguards are there with poker machines, and today we have been talking about more-and I commend people for that. But what about interactive gambling? It is out of sight and out of mind, bringing havoc to households right across Australia through what I think is an overreach against the current legislation by some gaming providers. We will get to the point where we are like the United States, where one of the biggest problems on university campuses is interactive gambling, a form of entertainment where people are geed on by friends and colleagues making them go that bit further than they actually can.

At the moment, if they continue to participate in the delivery of Work for the Dole programs they will go broke. The allocation of funding is $750 per participant. That is supposed to cover 26 weeks of activity. There is now a new requirement that there needs to be one supervisor for every four participants. For that one supervisor, funded at $22.50 plus on-costs, $6.90 an hour is what is received. That is a significant loss by any measure in any proportion from anyone’s perspective. What is unique though is that enterprises like Mornington Peninsula Youth Enterprises are trying to engage with the community, as they have always done, to reach out to other not-for-profit groups to try to deal with this incredible funding shortfall. Other Work for the Dole providers seem to be moving away from the original model of skill development, workplace know-how and engagement in the workforce, so that people present an enhanced curriculum vitae to prospective employers and a community benefit is delivered. We have seen it at football clubs. We have seen it in revegetation programs. We have seen it in community newsletters. We have seen it in skill development, in support for the ageing and in mosaic projects right across our city. It is a great program that has delivered benefits but there are no resources for this under the current construct of this contract. People who take this new funding offer-and respect the one supervisor for every four employees-will go broke very fast. They are trying to set up trade based training schemes but we have seen reports in the paper about how difficult it is to get access to higher level training funding support and this has been commented on in the media recently. So what you are seeing is a death by stealth of Work for the Dole. You are seeing community organisations committed to delivering outcomes for participants, and the community starved of the resources to be able to do that. The only ones who can then operate on this basis are the larger organisations offering, effectively, a work placement. Now there is nothing wrong with work placement but call it what it is. Let us make it clear that it is not designed to deliver a mutual benefit for the participant and the community-it is about placing a job seeker in a work place. This can have positive outcomes but let us not call it something it is not-it is not Work for the Dole. That is not the way this program was designed. This also highlights how the Rudd Labor government is not that interested in Work for the Dole. They are trying to keep it because they know it is popular in the community-and then reorientate it MAIN COMMITTEE so that it does not actually behave or perform in the way that it did. They then starve it by a lack of funding, so it is ‘death by atrophy’ not by a blanket removal of that program. Another area of grievance is an opportunity potentially being missed and that relates to the stimulus program that the federal Labor government has put in place and the process through which applications are made for regional and local community infrastructure projects. I was encouraged by the first funding round seeing Frankston City Council picking up on a program I called for, which was to make use of the savings generated by the Howard government over its years to save water for the years to come. Some of that funding went towards a water recycling scheme. WhatI am encouraging our community to do-and, if the federal Labor government is interested, there are further opportunities of this kind around the Mornington area-is come together, with the support of the Mornington Peninsula Shire working in partnership with South East Water and Racing Victoria, to move forward the Mornington-Tyabb Road recycling scheme. This program was one that I had secured funding for under the previous government but, because of the take-or-pay contract that was being enforced by South East Water at the time, it was not worth their while using recycled water. If it rained and there was no need for recycled water they still had to pay for it. If there was a prevailing wind from the south-east that may have pushed some of the spray that was being used to irrigate the track onto neighbouring properties, they could not use it-and they would be billed for it anyway. That recurrent funding burden outweighed the entire benefit of funding the capital works upfront through what was then a water grant program by the Howard government. It seems we have made some progress there by involving the Dallas Brooks Reserve and the council’s Civic Reserve as part of that outlook but now that that infrastructure is reaching into Mornington why don’t we take it further? Why don’t we extend that waste water recycling system and head north so we can pick-up Mornington Park Primary School, Padua College, Mornington Secondary College, Mornington Country Golf Club and the winegrowing and agriculture businesses in that area? WhilstI declare a pecuniary interest of being an honorary member of Mornington Country Golf Club, I am pleased to say that it is a golf club that has been harvesting its own water for generations. As that water harvesting opportunity is being limited, they are looking at needing to bring water onto the property. Using potable water would be a shame-a crying shamewhen so close is the recycled water out of the south-eastern treatment plant that would be perfectly suitable for that activity. The golf club is prepared to pay its way, to partner with broader community users such as the school communities that I touched on: Mornington Secondary College, with its ambition of hosting athletics at a more senior level, the activities of the local primary school, and also the winegrowing, equine and agriculture activities-properties like Morning Star and others in that immediate vicinity. These could all participate in a collaborative scheme that would see benefits delivered not only to the local economy but-more broadly-for the sustainability of economic activity, agriculture, leisure and the broader economy in the Mornington area. SoI encourage people to have a look at that opportunity. In the minute that is available to me, a further grievance relates to that stimulus funding. I am optimistic that my meeting with Minister Gillard on Thursday can deal with the crying shame that Langwarrin Primary School has been told they have to demolish a building simply MAIN COMMITTEE to build another one in its place and not pursue the master plan the school had developed and end up with portable loos as a permanent feature of their site. So be it-a description of a primary school for the 21st century. Hopefully, we can overcome those problems and actually save some money on the way through. A similar example is flowing out of Mornington Park Primary School. They are being told they have to demolish certain buildings to build new classrooms and a library, but along the way they are going to lose their general purpose room, an art room, a current library, a sports store area, their music room, a demountable canteen and the work they have done in creating a life skills program and funding some of the equipment that makes those rooms function through enterprise and fundraising by the parents. Surely we can work collaboratively to get a better outcome for those local communities, to save some money for the taxpayer and actually deliver benefits that school communities are looking for, not being fitted up with projects not of the schools’ choosing. (Time expired) Alcohol Abuse Ms KING (Ballarat) (8.40 pm)-I want to grieve tonight about what is unfortunately becoming a community-wide problem. When we think of community-wide problems many of us think of things such as poverty, cancer, homelessness and issues of social inclusion. In fact, the list is very long. Yet in many electorates across the country we face another communitywide problem that is calling on all of us for some real change. That problem is alcohol use and associated violence. There is an overwhelming swell of support arising across the federal electorate of Ballarat to tackle these two major issues. It is pretty distressing when you open the local newspaper on a Monday morning and read about yet another incident of drunken and violent behaviour that has occurred over the weekend at a local nightspot but unfortunately this is becoming a regular occurrence. It is not only of concern for me as a federal member of parliament but also of concern to every member of our community. Binge drinking appears to have become normalised within some areas of our community and this appears to be contributing to alcohol fuelled violence. If you ask any lawyer, police officer or emergency department doctor, they will tell you that on the whole, in the majority of assaults, alcohol is invariably involved. Over recent months we have seen a spate of reports surrounding violence at late night precincts in my electorate. The crimes have ranged from damage to local businesses in the CBD, damage to cars and personal property and injuries requiring medical treatment, to the unfortunate death of a local young person from an alleged punch to the face. These events are not uncommon. Stories are frequent in my electorate of nights out that have turned into nightmares. These incidents are not only confined to nights but are now also happening at family events. I would like to read from the front page story of today’s edition of one of the local papers in my electorate, the Courier. Entitled ‘Brawl at football’, it reads: Police officers were injured during an alcohol-fuelled incident at the Central Highlands Football League grand final on Saturday. Last Saturday morning hundreds of families around the region were waking up excited about getting along to the Central Highlands Football League grand final. Parents and children gathered to see Daylesford play Hepburn in what was to be a thrilling match with the teams finishMAIN COMMITTEE ing first and second on the ladder. But during the third quarter things went horribly wrong. Police were called upon to defuse an alcohol fuelled dispute that saw five spectators arrested. These troublemakers will face a variety of charges including drunkenness, resisting arrest, assaulting police and discharging missiles. Fuelled by too much alcohol and a complete disregard for anyone else, these louts-and that is all you can say that they were-allegedly threw cans at police. Reportedly, a number of police officers were injured while attempting to evict these drunken few. Pepper spray had to be used a number of times to help subdue the melee. It was necessary to call in more police from around the region. Senior officers held such fear for the safety of the general public in the face of increasingly aggressive behaviour that a further 10 officers from the Police Force Response Unit in Melbourne, over a hundred kilometres away, were called in. All of this took place under a doubling of private security at the event, put in place by organisers to help prevent antisocial and aggressive behaviour. At 4.30 pm police ordered alcohol sales to be completely stopped at the event. I attended the event with my 15-month-old son and I am very thankful to say that I had to leave a bit earlier and I am very pleased that my son was not present at the time at that community event. Those involved showed absolute contempt for their community and contempt for families at the ground looking to enjoy a friendly day out. They also showed contempt for the Victorian police. The cost of additional protection called in, as I said, from the ranks of officers in Melbourne came at a price and would have been easily avoidable if it had not been for a small and drunken minority. I hope the grand final for the second league in my electorate, the Ballarat Football League, will be different this weekend because the eyes of many in our community will be watching. If we look at this incident more closely, it is difficult for the wider community not to feel partly responsible for this surge in substance abuse. I want to touch on the issue of alcohol advertising and just how endemic our alcohol use is and is becoming in everyday life. When attending sporting events young people are subject to alcohol advertisements and alcohol use is very much normalised within those environments. Many sporting clubs get significant revenue from sponsorship that is associated with alcohol and revenue from alcohol sales is an integral fundraiser. The best and fairest medal in the local league is sponsored by alcohol retailer and franchiser, the Premix King. For the best and fairest medal, the Henderson Medal, to be sponsored as the Premix King medal, I think, is profoundly disappointing. The website for Premix King proudly proclaims ‘The party starts at our door’. If you look around any football ground you may see advertising for Heineken and other alcohol brands. On that note, at last week’s City of Ballarat Council meeting it was great to see local councillor Des Hudson ask for a report within three months on the council’s position on alcohol advertising on council owned assets. This is a real challenge for those who hold leadership positions in our community. If we are to take the issue of alcohol related harm seriously then we must address the messages that are communicated within our communities. It is something that is incredibly difficult to do because it is just so endemic and, unfortunately, sporting clubs have become highly reliant on funding associated in some way with alcohol. I do think that sport and alcohol is a good place for us to start. There are a number of campaigns that are already running across the country. These include the federal government’s ‘Don’t turn a night out into a nightmare’ campaign, the Victorian MAIN COMMITTEE government’s ‘Your move/championships move’ and also ‘Will you handle your alcohol or will alcohol handle you?’ There is a local B-safe social marketing campaign, a campaign that has been successful in our local region but obviously not as successful as we would like. A campaign that has really pushed forward in recent times is Geelong’s ‘Just think’ campaign which involves a partnership between the Geelong Advertiser and the Geelong football club. The program has received positive support from Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd and Premier, John Brumby. Yet only on the weekend we heard of an East Geelong footballer who had died after reportedly being struck in a fight during the club’s grand final celebrations. What should have been an exciting day out after winning a grand final turned into a tragedy for that family. Over recent months in Ballarat locals have come together to discuss a range of ways our community may tackle binge drinking and its effects. A group of 20 or 30 residents ranging from local parents to police officers, city councillors, and even students has met regularly. We have been looking at the gaps that are occurring in policy not just from a local government perspective but from a whole-of-government focus. Locally these community leaders will be submitting an application under round 2 of the government’s National Binge Drinking Strategy. They will be putting forward an application that would see young people in Ballarat leading a local campaign to curb binge drinking and its impact on the regional community. That is a key point. This group recognises that the most effective messages to target the younger members of our community-and these are the people who are most at risk of binge drinking and its associated violence-are best formulated and channelled by the members of that generation. The aim is to get them involved, to harness their creativity, energy and unique view of the world, to utilise their language and social networks to create messages that entertain, persuade and ultimately convince. It will be an exciting program. In 2009 it is really difficult to fathom that we live in a community where the culture of some denotes that the only way to have a good night out or a good day out at the football is to binge drink. It is harder to comprehend that some members of the community find it okay to violently abuse fellow community members. But the most difficult of all would be to wake up to learn that a brother, sister, son, daughter, cousin or friend did not come home safely one night because they were caught up in a fight, particularly an alcohol fuelled fight. I do not think people are aware of just what a chronic and long-term problem it is if someone gets an acquired brain injury. To see a young person full of life, with all their personality spilling out and then to see that person later with an acquired brain injury is just the most horrendous thing for any family to have to experience. I think that we absolutely have to own responsibility for the problem of alcohol and violence in our own community. We are determined to try and do something about it. Advertising and the link to sporting associations is obviously just one example that I have highlighted here tonight of a very complex problem but I did want to put that particularly on the record. There are obviously issues in relation to licensed premises and opening hours. There are issues around the spread of liquor outlets within our community. There are also issues around how people actually resolve and manage disputes, what they do when they are in situations where they have had some alcohol and how they have to learn to handle their anger in different ways. We have a long way to go. We have certainly got a long way to go in our community. We do have a wonderful community, but it is something that we as a community have to own up MAIN COMMITTEE to and it is certainly something that we have to deal with. It is a community problem that does require all of us, whether it is sporting groups, parents, students, teachers, community leaders and the liquor outlets themselves, to join together and tackle the issue. We need to say that this is not the sort of community that we want to live in. It is not the sort of community that we want our kids to grow up in. It is not the sort of community where we want our children to go out and not enjoy a great night out. We want them to be safe, we want them to be happy and we want them to enjoy their nights out. We do not want to come home with an injury and we certainly do not want the alcohol and violence to continue. (Time expired) Broadband has been raised today in debate on the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (National Broadband Network Measures No. 1) Bill 2009, but I would like to make some points which are particularly relevant to my electorate. The $43 billion broadband announcement of the Rudd Labor government is a farce. It is a cruel joke being played on this nation. The announcement, like many others, raised unrealistic expectations within the community that a modern, fast, broadband network available to all was just around the corner. It is typical of Labor governments to overpromise and underdeliver. They will underdeliver on access. Under the proposed plans some areas will apparently get 100 megabits per second fibre to their premises while those living in regional and rural areas will receive services almost 10 times slower delivered by wireless and satellite. I have spoken in this parliament and in the media of my concern that over 5,000 people in broadband black-spot areas in my electorate, such as in Agnes Banks, Freemans Reach, Kurmond, Kurrajong Heights, Londonderry, Marsden Park, Pitt Town, Vineyard, Yarramundi and Colo Heights will either miss out or will have to take an inferior service. Labor will underdeliver on infrastructure. News reports in the last month that above-ground aerial cables strung between old power poles-old technologies-will be used in the broadband rollout. That is astonishing but not surprising giving the penny-pinching this Labor government will have to do because of its reckless spending and blow-out of government debt. Labor will underdeliver on fairness. Under the plan, people living in regional and rural areas will have an inferior service to people living in cities who already have access to highstandard services and infrastructure. Is this an example of how Labor governments allocate infrastructure spending; of selectively providing more infrastructure funding into Labor marginal seats rather than spreading the funding across all electorates? This is an issue making headlines in the media and has been referred to a Senate inquiry, and rightly so. Why should people in non-Labor or non-marginal electorates miss out on vital communication infrastructure because Labor is making political judgments, not decisions that are in the best interest of the nation. To allay the concerns that this is a deliberate strategy to starve people in regional and rural areas of vital infrastructure the Labor government needs to explain why it will not release coverage maps which will show the areas that will get the infrastructure. So much for the rhetoric! Those people feel badly let down and abandoned by the city-centric Labor government. I am sure that when they are struggling with their broadband because of their inferior service they will remember who denied them the service. Labor have underdelivered on timing. When the coalition was in government its broadband policy was that 100 per cent of Australians would have access to broadband by 2009. Under MAIN COMMITTEE",219,Grievance Debate
282,Mrs Markus (Greenway) (8.50 Pm),"I would like to note that the issue of broadbandLabor’s plan, 98 per cent-a questionable number; it is more likely to be 75 per cent-of Australians will have access to broadband by 2013. Well, the Labor government had better get a hurry on. We are now in the latter part of 2009 and the expectation was raised that Tasmania would be the first state to have a rollout date. Despite expectations that a rollout date would be announced, all that happened was that the minister confirmed the release of a tender for the supply of fibre-optic cable. The Tasmanian announcement is being labelled as a stunt. Before any rollout can begin on the National Broadband Network, the implementation study commissioned by the Labor government which will deliver the rollout plan is expected to take eight months. Eight months will take us up to the middle of next year. Labor again have underdelivered on cost. The implementation study is estimated to cost taxpayers around $54 million. If you add to that the $20 million already wasted on the Labor government’s failed National Broadband Network mark 1 tender process, the Labor government would have spent around $74 million, and we do not have one broadband connection to show for it. Labor have again underdelivered on probity. A greater issue in this broadband farce is the Labor government’s refusal to provide a rigorous cost-benefit analysis of the project. The coalition has repeatedly called on the Labor government to provide this information and the government have refused. Is that the action of a responsible and accountable government? I think not. I congratulate my coalition colleague the Hon. Nick Minchin, who made a freedom of information request for documents relating to the failed National Broadband Network mark 1 tender process and for information on the formulation of Labor’s reckless mark 2 plan. The coalition believe such a move is in the public interest, but we are told the cost to have the freedom of information request processed will be $24,000, and there are no guarantees that anything will even be released. Our job as opposition is to hold the government accountable, and on the broadband issue the Labor government have much to answer for. Labor have failed to deliver on their promises. Labor have been in government almost two years and all we have in the broadband plan is an announcement for the supply of fibre-optic cable-and promises, promises and more promises. As I said at the beginning, the Labor government’s broadband plan is a farce. On broadband, the Labor government has a track record of broken broadband deadlines. Now people waiting for broadband have to wait another eight months for the implementation study recommendations. How long after that will the rollout start? We have no idea. What we do know is that the delaying of the introduction of the Labor government’s broadband plan could see this parliament going through another election without the government having delivered a single new broadband connection. The $43 billion broadband proposal will take at least eight years to implement and will be funded predominantly from government debt. Adding to the problem is the massive $315 billion gross debt created by Labor’s economic mismanagement. The coalition is concerned that taxpayers will be forced to fund all of Labor’s risky $43 billion spend on their broadband plan. It is important to note that the coalition had a broadband guarantee program that provided subsidised support for Australians living in broadband black spot areas. We had a plan because we had the money in the bank to spend on infrastructure for all. We had the money in the bank because of sound, responsible, conservative economic management. We not only paid off $96 billion of Labor debt but also created a $60 billion Future Fund, other funds for MAIN COMMITTEE roads, health, education, water infrastructure and the Building Australia Fund. The coalition can deliver. On economic management, the Labor Party will be remembered for creating a mountain of debt that is not sustainable. This will lead to rising interest rates, rising unemployment rates and budget cuts in the future, which will impact on programs, services and benefits to the Australian people-the taxpayers who have every right to expect their elected government will be responsible with that money. The Australian economy will have challenges ahead. Given the time it will take to finally roll out the plan and the enormous budget cuts that will have to be made, I seriously doubt that the Labor Party’s national broadband plan will happen. I again mention the suburbs in my electorate where 5,000 people will not have their needs met by this plan: Agnes Banks, Freemans Reach, Kurmond, Kurrajong Heights, Londonderry, Marsden Park, Pitt Town, Vineyard, Yarramundi and Colo Heights. They deserve a broadband plan that will respond to their needs and provide them with access to 21st century broadband communications. United Nations the House of Representatives chamber for a private member’s bill. I thank the Main Committee and various members for allowing a rejigging of the speakers list to accommodate my needs. I rise tonight to talk about the United Nations and its relevance to the local community of the mid-North Coast of New South Wales. I attended a dinner last week, which several members of this place also attended, with former UN ambassador Robert Hill. At the same dinner were representatives from the United Nations Association of Australia, the United Nations Youth Association, the United Nations Information Centre and various promoters and supporters of the UN. I said in my first speech to this place, 12 months ago, that the United Nations and similar international organisations do get rough trade in this place and within Australian culture, with the typical ‘them versus us’ positioning about what the UN is and somewhat of a fear of what the UN means for Australian sovereignty and Australian life. The point was made by Robert Hill, and has been made by many others, that, if we as members of parliament and we as Australians generally believe in the principles of peace, justice, reconciliation, mediation and negotiation rather than in war and violence, it is a logical extension that a body like the United Nations is important. If you do believe in those principles, there is not only an opportunity to place a value on those principles but almost an obligation that we have as holders of those principles to support, promote and advocate for the various United Nations processes. The reason for making that point is that on 11 October we are going to try something a bit different on the mid-North Coast of New South Wales and establish a United Nations Association of Australia branch. It is being held at the well-known palaeontologists’ retreat Falls Forest, Dr Mary White OAM’s farm. I am trying to encourage many members of the local community to participate in this exercise and hopefully in UN processes into the future. Why? It is not only because of what I have just said; I will now put on the record three particular examples of issues this week that an organisation like UNAA should be involved with. If anyone in the mid-North Coast region wants to participate in advocating on these issues, participating in the branch of the UNAA is a good way to do it. The first example is the Micah Challenge issues that have been promoted this week. In my first week here last year I ran into my former church minister, Mr Perini, who I had not seen MAIN COMMITTEE",225,Grievance Debate
283,Mr Oakeshott (Lyne) (8.59 Pm),"I will not speak for long because I am expected insince my school days. He was down here lobbying on the Micah Challenge. I did not know what it was, and now that I do I am a great advocate for its work. I think that generally advocating for the Millennium Development Goals is important. One in 10 Australians today might know what MDG stands for, and I think that a challenge for and a responsibility of members of this place is to, like those promoting the Micah Challenge, advocate for exactly what those Millennium Development Goals are, their importance in the Asia-Pacific region and how we as a country and as a parliament can do a lot better in advocating, promoting, defending and understanding what those Millennium Development Goals are and how we can contribute to achieving better outcomes. The second example is the case of James Elder, an old uni mate, who is the UNICEF spokesman currently being thrown out of Sri Lanka in an extraordinary case in which he is being accused of being a promoter of propaganda and being akin to a terrorist. I do not know where people stand when giving character references, but I can certainly give one for James. He is one of life’s great larrikins in the journalistic tradition, but in no way would he be a promoter of propaganda, in no way should he be likened to a terrorist. He is being challenged by the Sri Lankan government for merely doing his job, and doing it well, as a spokesperson for children in the refugee camps-children very much in need in the conflict situation in Sri Lanka. Again, this is an opportunity for local Australians to get involved in not only defending the interests of someone I know, but also defending current Australian passport holders doing Australian aid work overseas-good Australian aid work through legitimate agencies-and future Australian passport holders who I would hope we encourage to be involved in legitimate international aid work. The third issue is the Guy Campos case. Guy Campos came to Australia on a World Youth Day temporary visa. He was identified in the local community as being involved in war atrocities in East Timor and in the independence movement. The AFP, to their credit, started an investigation in that process. The DPP were given a brief of evidence, as I understand it. A great deal of concern arose about the end of his temporary visa being on the horizon-that is, tomorrow. A lot of people were pushing, myself included-Bob Brown in the upper house, to his credit, has done a lot of work on this-to try to get the Australian government to act to either deliver on the brief of evidence through the DPP or to keep Guy Campos in Australia so those investigations could be completed. It is my sad duty to tell House today that Guy Campos has skipped the country. We have an extraordinary situation where Immigration has potentially had the mickey taken out of it by Guy Campos, the AFP and the DPP have potentially had the mickey taken out of them by Guy Campos, and it is potentially a very embarrassing case for the Australian government generally if this is not elevated to the status that it deserves. Someone such as Guy Campos has clearly been identified as being involved in war atrocities. This is potentially Australia’s best war crimes prosecution, and we have missed it. The guy has gone, the guy has skipped the country, and it should be to the great disappointment of the Australian government. Going back to the UN processes, it is now a matter for the international processes to make sure that the brief of evidence makes it to the country where Guy Campos has gone to and that international pressure is applied if he has returned to a country that is not going to prosecute. MAIN COMMITTEE This is very relevant to local Australians on the mid-North Coast of New South Wales. UN processes do matter, they are relevant and there is an obligation for every single one of us to be aware, to understand and to be involved. I would strongly encourage residents on the midNorth Coast to take up the chance of joining the branch, and once again I thank the House for the opportunity to speak. Mongolia Timor Leste Micah Challenge International Students Ms GRIERSON (Newcastle) (9.08 pm)-I wish to take advantage of this debate to share with the House some observations and knowledge arising from the recent opportunity I had to visit Mongolia and Timor Leste. These experiences, when reflected upon, have significance when related to what we do here in this parliament, the legislation we enact and the policies we deliver. In June 2009 an invitation was extended from His Excellency Mr Enkhbold, the Vice-Chairman of Mongolia’s State Great Khural, the Mongolian parliament, and Chair of the Mongolia-Australia Friendship Group-or the ‘Mozzies’ as they affectionately call itoffering on behalf of the Mongolian parliament to host a delegation from our parliament. The delegation included Kirsten Livermore, the member for Capricornia, who led our delegation. She is particularly deserving of great praise for her diplomacy, her skill and her level of engagement with Mongolia. The delegation also included the Hon. Peter Lindsay, the member for Herbert, and Dr Mal Washer, the member for Moore, as well as Mrs Washer. The visit was particularly extended to people interested in mining communities such as the Hunter region. We were assisted by public servants Ms Bayasa and Mr Batbold, who were excellent advocates for their country. The delegation’s program was divided into formal meetings with members of the executive and the parliament, visits to two national parks showcasing the natural environment of Mongolia and meetings with Australians who are representatives of Australian companies operating in Mongolia. We also had the great opportunity to visit Oyu Tolgoi, an Ivanhoe-Rio copper mine in the Gobi Desert, as well as spending an afternoon with children from Didi Kalika’s Lotus Children’s Centre. Didi is originally from Albury, and her work in setting up that orphanage and the work of the carers whom she employs is outstanding. Whilst visiting the mines in the Gobi Desert, it was a great pleasure for me both to find that the geologist was from Newcastle and to hear them talk about their discovery of 40 dinosaur eggs in the final drilling that disclosed all the copper and gold that is present there. To meet a young Novocastrian who was studying for a PhD, looking at the impact of mining on the Mongolian people with particular reference to gender relationships was a true delight. I was not surprised but was certainly pleased to see that Novocastrians play a role there. We were there because Mongolia extends to us the desire for a ‘third neighbour’. Landlocked between Kyrgyzstan, China and Russia, it is certainly in need of a third neighbour and it looks to us. It has a strong desire for Australia to establish an embassy in Mongolia. We discussed particularly the significance to Mongolians of the AusAID scholarship program and other areas of cooperation, particularly mining, between our countries. MAIN COMMITTEE In many ways Mongolia is reminiscent of Australia pre the economic boom. Mongolians struggle with the challenge of negotiating beneficial international investment agreementsones that will benefit their communities and their country and that will still be attractive for international investment. We are pleased to report that an investment agreement with Rio was signed shortly after our visit, and I can only praise Mongolia’s Prime Minister, His Excellency MrS Bayar; the Minister for Mineral Resources and Energy, MrD Zorigt; and Foreign Affairs MinisterS Batbold for their very frank discussions with us. Certainly I understand that they look to Australia for our technical expertise as well. Although very grateful for the scholarship program, which many Mongolians have benefited from, they would like to see it widened so that they can look to develop the technical skills necessary to deal with mining regulations and safety issues. They also ask us to remove any barriers to studying in Australia and to bringing family. There are some real barriers, and we need to look at ways to promote real engagement and the people-to-people exchange that can be offered if families come with what are often older participants in these programs. Overall the trip was an outstanding success. I congratulate the member for Capricornia on her report, which I know has been given to our relevant ministers. I also recently had the opportunity to visit East Timor, or Timor-Leste, on the occasion of its 10th anniversary of democracy. I was there in my role of Chair of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit to deliver a paper to the East Timorese parliament regarding the Financial Management and Accountability Act. I acknowledge the support of the JCPAA secretariat, in particular the work of Russell Chafer, in assisting me with developing that paper. The conference that I attended was dealing with Timor-Leste’s first legislation regarding accountability and financial management. I can only say that I was so impressed, particularly with the members of parliament that I met. They had many questions, and it was clear that they set the highest goals and ideals for their people. I would like to particularly thank Suzanne McCourt and Brian Diamond, DFAT staff from the Australian embassy there, and Mr Peter Heyward, the Australian ambassador, who extended great hospitality to me during my visit. Fe Gaffud, the senior budget expert and trainer from the UNDP Parliament Project, was responsible for the conference. I thank her for her excellent organisation. I can only say that, when visiting countries like this, you gain a deeper understanding of how important it is that Australia is thoroughly supportive of these countries. In East Timor the life expectancy is 60. In Mongolia it is between 60 and 65. Conditions are harsh and poverty is real. Certainly the work done today by young people to gain our support for the Millennium Development Goals is a salient reminder of our obligations. While I was in Mongolia, 24 people died in 10 days as a result of a flood through their capital Ulaanbaatar. That was just from higher rainfall in that area. Gers were washed away and people drowned. While I was in Timor Leste, in Dili, an earthquake occurred. As I come from Newcastle, it made me rather edgy. But Timorese tell me they are now more frequent. Climate change is very real in countries such as these. In Mongolia desertification is extensive and growing. They do not have climate scepticism. That is an indulgence for developed nations like ours. They know from their everyday lives the impact that climate change has. I can only say to those who may think it is not our role to show regional and international leadership on climate change: please reflect on the plight of our neighbours in our region because they are certainly already experiencing the impacts of climate change. Coincidentally, I also MAIN COMMITTEE recently visited East Timor on a separate occasion to look at Operation Astute, the Australian Defence Force’s continuing contribution to the maintenance of peace and stability in East Timor. The training they were giving was welcomed and certainly, as always, their professionalism was outstanding. I would also like to take the opportunity to thank the participants in the Micah Challenge who came to see me today in my office. Newcastle remains strongly representative of the community that desires to see global poverty eradicated. I support their work. Also tonight I had the pleasure to spend time with two international students from our university, Alexa Halford and Vicky Chew. I have learnt so much already today in my discussions with international students, having dinner with them tonight and visiting them in their workshops. I know that the federal government will respond appropriately to the issue of international student welfare and learning because the input and the output have been exceptional. I look forward to their communique being presented to the Deputy Prime Minister tomorrow and congratulate them on the work they are doing. I wish Mr Bruce Baird, a former member of this parliament, success in his review of the role and activities of international colleges and private institutions for international students, because the issues raised today were quite alarming. There is certainly a great deal of work to do. Global Food Security regard to the issue of global food security. According to the 1996 World Food Summit, ‘food security’ means that food is available at all times, that all persons have means of access to it, that it is nutritionally adequate in terms of quantity, quality and variety, and that it is acceptable within any given culture. Almost one billion people around the world are malnourished. This is being exacerbated by unprecedented population growth, high food prices and high oil prices. While food prices remain high in many poor countries, the global economic downturn continues to play a prominent role in this issue. Current food prices have effectively compounded the effects of the recession in many countries around the world. There is no doubt that food prices are the real problem. Millions of people worldwide risk being forced into poverty every time the cost of produce goes up. For example, as an indicator of just how serious this is, in Indonesia alone a 10 per cent rise in rice prices means that two million more people will be officially in poverty. The statistics continue to paint an ominous picture. It is estimated that 100 million people have fallen into poverty in the last two years and that poor families spend up to 80 per cent of their budget on food alone. The Australian government places a high priority on assisting developing countries with food security, as part of reducing poverty and achieving sustainable development. This was evident in a joint statement from the recent G8 summit in L’Aquila, Italy. The communique said: There is an urgent need for decisive action to free humankind from hunger and poverty. Food security, nutrition and sustainable agriculture must remain a priority issue on the political agenda, to be addressed through a cross-cutting and inclusive approach, involving all relevant stakeholders, at global, regional and national level. That is one part of a quite extensive communique, but it is important in noting just how big the problem is. Given the statistics and positions, there is definitely scope for the global food MAIN COMMITTEE",227,Grievance Debate
284,Mr Ripoll (Oxley) (9.18 Pm),"I rise tonight to speak about my ongoing concern withsecurity challenge to be addressed by boosting research and development, helping to remove barriers to global trade and driving productivity along the global food production chainsomething that Australia can have a remarkable impact on. Analysis by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization has shown that prices have retreated for most food commodities since the record highs in 2008-just last year-but prices remain high, above long-term trends, and the high cost of food continues to present a food security challenge for many developing countries. The Australian government is supporting improved productivity and innovation in the agriculture sector in the face of climate change and increasing constraints on land and water. We need to do what we can in this country and certainly show the way in other countries. This is being done here through the provision of matching research and development contributions exceeding $200 million each year to the rural research and development corporations; through Australia’s Farming Future package, which provides $130 million over four years to help our primary producers adapt and adjust to the impacts of climate change; and through the $35 million Regional Food Producers Innovation and Productivity Program, which aims to improve the productivity and competitiveness of food industries through innovation and technology improvements. Australia can play a major role. It can do that on many fronts. As a major food-producing country and exporter it is important that we do this. Recognising that food security is a global concern, the government is investing $464 million over four years on the AusAID Food Security through Rural Development initiative that includes increasing investments in international agriculture research and development, improving rural livelihoods by addressing market failures in rural areas, and increasing the capacity of the poor to access food. This initiative builds on existing measures such as last year’s $50 million contribution to a World Bank trust fund aimed at stimulating agricultural supply in developing countries and $30 million to the World Food Program emergency food aid appeal. The government also recently allocated $50 million to assist our Pacific Island neighbours meet the immediate challenges of climate change, which for them is very real and very immediate. Of this, $25 million will be to help implement high-priority, practical adaptation programs in Pacific Island countries, including working with the agriculture sector to address food security issues. In making these points I believe that food security and the food crisis, the global financial crisis and climate change are all interrelated. They are all interlinked. The Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry has been extremely active in this area and I commend his commitment to the issue. I note that he attended the 35th special session of the Food and Agriculture Organization in November last year, the high-level conference on Food Security for All in January 2009 and the G8 meeting of agriculture ministers in April 2009. Certainly, this government has taken global food security very seriously, and having a minister that is personally interested and active in this area is very commendable. The L’Aquila food security initiative, as it became known, reinforces Australia’s commitment to comprehensive global action to address the underlying causes of global food insecurity. All G8 leaders agreed on the need for the food security agenda to focus on agriculture and rural development by promoting sustainable production, productivity and rural economic growth. In the end we help others by helping them help themselves. It was recognised that MAIN COMMITTEE substantial increases were needed in aid to agriculture and food security, and commitment was given to a goal of mobilising US$20 billion over three years. The government is also engaged internationally, advocating strongly for increased investment in agricultural productivity while at the same time ensuring liberalised markets for food as a means of contributing to global food security. Freeing up markets through trade liberalisation is part of that process to achieve long-term food security and independence for developing countries. It is promising to see the Rudd government actively helping to liberalise world markets through the Doha negotiations, which will contribute to food security in developing nations and also generate new opportunities for Australian agriculture. Again, that is more good news for Australian farmers. Concluding Doha is the best insurance against protectionism and will give the global economy a major confidence boost. This in turn will contribute to the stability of world food supplies. In the lead-up to the Copenhagen climate change meeting, Australia will continue to pursue a science based carbon accounting system that treats agricultural food production equitably. In doing so, we must ensure that actions to combat climate change enhance our shared goal to meet the food needs of a growing global population. The outcomes from Copenhagen will have significant implications for food security. When it comes to responding to climate change, those who work the land have more at stake than those in any other part of the economy. They have a unique interest in ensuring that carbon accounting matches the science that goes along with it. There are good reasons why countries have been reluctant to include agriculture in their accounting, but we must continue to pursue a science based accounting system that treats agricultural food production equitably across the globe, and this will need more attention in the lead-up to Copenhagen. We must and can ensure that actions to combat climate change enhance our shared goal to meet the food needs of a growing global population. Finally, I note that the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation’s World Food Day on 16 October is fast approaching. The aim of that day is to heighten public awareness of the world food problem and strengthen solidarity in the struggle against hunger, malnutrition and poverty. I inform the parliament of my intention to move a private member’s motion on this important event which I hope gets the chance to be debated in the next sitting period in a few weeks time. Food security is about a range of issues and outcomes around the world. Certainly the global financial crisis has added to those problems, but if we look only at our region and the issue of national security then food security plays a role in that as well. Whether it is food security, fuel security-that is, oil security-or other issues which are the highest order needs for poor people around the world, there is no doubt that Australia must play a role. Australia must invest in those nations and in those people. We can play a very big role in this country through science, through technology, through research and development and through the investments we make in food production, innovation and productivity gains. The things that we learn in this country we can pass on to other countries and help them to become self-reliant. There is an old saying which is the core theme of what global food security is about: ‘If you give a man a fish, he will eat for a day, but if you teach him how to fish, he will eat for a lifetime’. That is the principle we need to adopt on this very critical issue. It is about providing financial support and it is about making sure that we can deal with the immediate issues. But MAIN COMMITTEE it is about more than that. It is about providing leadership and guidance. It is about providing the expertise that we have-the technology, the innovation and the productivity-and making sure that poor countries, countries that are hungry, have a means of going forward. (Time expired) bate is adjourned. The resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. Main Committee adjourned at 9.28 pm MAIN COMMITTEE",231,Grievance Debate
285,The Deputy Speaker (Ms Ae Burke),"There being no further grievances, the deRefugee Status Reviews (Question No. 787) Dr Stone asked the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, in writing, on 18 June 2009: In respect of Senate Estimates on Thursday 28 May 2009 where, in an answer to questions from Senator Fierravanti-Wells, a departmental officer indicated that the Minister had established an expert panel to review decisions on refugee applications made on Christmas Island -Is it correct that there are interim arrangements in place and a small panel of people whom the Minister calls upon if there is a need to undertake an independent merits review; if so, (a) how were the members of this panel selected; (b) what is the role of the panel; (c) under what instructions does the panel operate; (d) how is this panel funded; (e) what are the names of the panel members; (f) what are the conditions of employment for the panel members; (g) for what length of time is the appointment of panel members; (h) what were the selection criteria for the appointment of panel members; (i) has the Minister made an announcement about the appointment of panel members and their role; (j) how many decisions has this panel made; (k) will all decisions of the panel be made public; if so, when; (l) how is this panel accountable to the Parliament; (m) who is the panel accountable to; and (n) are the decisions of this panel appellable; if so, to whom. ing answer to the honourable member’s question: Interim arrangements are in place for conducting non-statutory independent merits review of unfavourable refugee status assessments, in the form of a contract between the Commonwealth and a labour hire firm to provide independent reviewers for the immediate caseload. (a) Under the current interim arrangements, the reviews are conducted by independent people well qualified in refugee status determination processes. (b) The role of the Independent reviewer is to consider afresh all claims for protection as they relate to the Refugees Convention. As the independent review process is non-statutory, the role of the Independent reviewer is advisory and not determinative. I draw on the Independent reviewer’s assessment when considering whether to exercise my public interest powers under section 46A of the Migration Act 1958. (c) Independent reviewers conduct reviews in accordance with the services and requirements set out in the contract. (d) The Government has provided $0.3 million funding in FY2008-09 for establishment of the panel and $0.13 million each year for associated reviewer costs (this funding is contingent upon fluctuations in the number of unauthorised boat arrivals seeking review of Refugee Status Assessments). (e) At present, three people are contracted as Independent reviewers under the interim arrangements: Mr Steve Karas AO, Mr Christopher Keher, and Ms Sue Zelinka. (f) Under the interim arrangements, the remuneration and related conditions of independent reviewers is consistent with the rates set by the Remuneration Tribunal for ‘public offices’ performing similar work (ie. part time members of the RRT). (g) The current contract in place to provide independent merits review under these interim arrangements was recently extended up to 31 December 2009.",234,Grievance Debate
286,Mr Mcclelland,"The Minister for Immigration and Citizenship has provided the follow(h) Under the interim arrangements, the selection of the independent reviewers was based on the criteria that they were people who had sound experience in administrative decision-making and a background in refugee law. (i) The Government decision to introduce independent merits review of unfavourable refugee status assessments has been announced. (j) Under the interim arrangements, three review assessments have been completed. (k) Taking into account the relatively small number of review assessments and privacy and confidentiality considerations, it is not yet practicable to publish the review assessments. (l) and (m) Independent reviewers are accountable through the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship to Parliament. Only the Minister has power under section 46A to allow an offshore entry person to apply for a Protection visa. (n) Assessments may be subject to judicial review in the original jurisdiction of the High Court or in the Federal Court on procedural fairness grounds (but not beyond that). Employment Services (Question No. 789) Dr Southcott asked the Minister representing the Minister for Employment Participation, in writing, on 22 June 2009: In respect of Employment Services Contract (ESC) 2006-09 and ESC 2009-12: how many ESC (a) 2006-09 sites will be closing on 30 June 2009 (i) in total, and (ii) by Employment Services Area (ESA); (b) 2009-12 sites will be opening on 1 July 2009 as new sites (i) in total, and (ii) by ESA; and; (c) 200609 sites will be continuing as Job Services Australia sites (i) in total, and (ii) by ESA.

Mr Liu Xiaobo (Question No. 853) Mr Danby asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, in writing, on 11 August 2009: (1) Is the Government aware that in June 2009 Mr Liu Xiaobo, one of China’s most prominent political activists, was formally arrested for inciting subversion, six months after he was taken into custody. (2) Is the Government aware that Mr Xiaobo was detained on the eve of the publication of ‘Charter 08’, a document he co-authored which was signed by hundreds of Chinese artists, academics and political activists, which called for political reforms in China, such as a new constitution, judicial independence and the freedom to assemble. (3) What is the Government’s position in relation to the detention and arrest of Mr Xiaobo. (4) Has the Government raised the issue of Mr Xiaobo’s detention and arrest with the Chinese Government; if not, does it plan to do so. Mr Stephen Smith-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) Yes. (3) The Government is concerned about the arrest and detention of Mr Liu Xiaobo and has called for his release. (4) The Government first raised Mr Liu’s detention with the Chinese authorities during the AustraliaChina Human Rights Dialogue, held in Canberra on 9-10 February 2009. We subsequently followed up with representations through the Australian Embassy in Beijing to the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The Government will continue to make representations to China on the detention of Charter 08 signatories and others who were exercising internationally recognised liberties, including freedom of speech. Aung San Suu Kyi (Question No. 860) Ms Julie Bishop asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, in writing, on 11 August 2009: (1) What specific protests has the Government lodged with the Burmese regime over the detention of Aung San Suu Kyi. (2) Has any Government official contacted other countries on this matter; if so, (a) which countries, (b) at what level, (c) on what dates, and (d) what specific actions were discussed on each occasion. (3) Has the Government made any representations to the Burmese regime about the treatment of Aung San Suu Kyi whilst detained. (4) Has the Government been in contact with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations regarding Aung San Suu Kyi; if so, (a) on what date/s, and (b) at what level. Mr Stephen Smith-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (1) A central message in representations to the Burmese regime has consistently been the Government’s call for the immediate and unconditional release of all political prisoners, including Aung San Suu Kyi. The detention of Aung San Suu Kyi is repeatedly protested by the Government directly to the Burmese regime. (2) Yes. The situation in Burma is a foreign policy priority for the Government. It has been, and continues to be, the subject of numerous diplomatic discussions and representations between Australian officials and those of other governments including by Australian Ambassadors, embassy staff, and visiting officials, as well as with members of the diplomatic corps in Canberra. Consistent with the practice of successive Governments, I do not intend to elaborate further as it would be inappropriate to provide details of confidential discussions with other governments. (3) Yes. The Government, through the Australian Embassy in Rangoon, has made a number of representations on Aung San Suu Kyi’s treatment in detention, including pressing the authorities to ensure she has access to medical care and legal advice. (4) Yes. I have raised Aung San Suu Kyi’s situation with the ASEAN Secretary-General. I have also discussed Burma with my ASEAN counterparts. Australia’s Ambassador to ASEAN meets regularly with representatives from the ASEAN Secretariat and member countries. She discusses a range of issues including relevant human rights matters and the situation in Burma. Indonesia: Debt to Health Swap Program (Question No. 862) Ms Julie Bishop asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, in writing, on 11 August 2009: (1) How does the Australian Government intend to implement the Debt to Health Swap program, including its plans for negotiations with the Indonesian Government. (2) Has the Australian Government made contact on this matter with the Indonesian Government; if so, (a) on what date/s was contact made; (b) at what level was the contact, and (c) what was the Indonesian Government’s response. Mr Stephen Smith-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (1) On 12 May 2009 the Australian Government announced the Debt-to-Health Swap with the Indonesian Government whereby Australia will forgive $75 million of debt and the Indonesian Government will contribute $37.5 million to the Global Fund to support HIV and tuberculosis projects in Indonesia. The Debt-to-Health swap will be implemented in conjunction with AusAID and the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation (EFIC). A tripartite agreement between Australia, Indonesia and the Global Fund to fight AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria will be signed once agreement has been reached on the swap mechanism. EFIC will then seek to negotiate a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Indonesian Ministry of Finance detailing debt relief arrangements and the conditions that must be met. Resourcing of $75 million allocated as administered equity in the 2009-10 budget will be drawn on and transferred to EFIC once the MoU with Indonesia is finalised. (2) The Australian Government, through its Embassy in Jakarta, has had several contacts with the Indonesian Government on this matter since late 2008. Contacts were made at Deputy Minister level in December 2008, January 2009 and July 2009 and at Director level in June 2009. The Indonesian Government has expressed strong support for the debt swap. Mr Le Cong Dinh (Question No. 879) Mr Danby asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, in writing, on 11 August 2009: (1) Is the Australian Government aware that in June 2009 the Vietnamese Government arrested human rights lawyer, Mr Le Cong Dinh. (2) Is the Australian Government aware that Vietnamese Police have charged Mr Dinh under Article 88 of the Vietnam Criminal Code-‘conducting propaganda against the government’-which carries a prison sentence of up to 20 years. (3) Is the Australian Government aware that Vietnamese Government authorities have accused Mr Dinh of using his work as a defence lawyer for high-profile democracy and religious freedom activists to ‘propagandize against the regime and distort Vietnam’s constitution and laws’. (4) What is the Australian Government’s position in relation to the detention and arrest of Mr Dinh. (5) Has the Australian Government raised the issue of Mr Dinh’s arrest with the Vietnamese Government; if not, does it plan to do so. Mr Stephen Smith-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) Yes. (3) Yes. (4) The Government is concerned about the implications of Mr Dinh’s arrest for freedom of expression and the right to legal representation in Vietnam. The Government is also concerned about Vietnam’s ongoing use of the broadly framed Article 88 of the Vietnamese Criminal Code under which Mr Dinh and several other individuals of human rights concern have been charged. (5) The Australian Government made representations to the Government of Vietnam on 25 June 2009 regarding the arrest of Mr Le Cong Dinh, consistent with the position expressed in response to question 4. The Government requested that Mr Dinh be afforded legal representation and visitation rights and requested that a representative from the Australian Embassy in Hanoi attend should the case be brought to trial. Professor Ilham Tohti (Question No. 884) Mr Danby asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, in writing, on 11 August 2009: (1) Is the Australian Government aware that in July 2009 the Chinese Government detained prominent ethnic Uighur economist Professor Ilham Tohti. (2) Is the Australian Government aware that Professor Tohti had been critical of the lack of jobs for Uighurs and policies that encouraged the influx of Han settlers into traditionally ethnic Uighur areas of China. (3) Does the Australian Government know if Professor Tohti has been charged; if he has, what are the charges. (4) What is the Australian Government’s position in relation to the detention of Professor Tohti.
