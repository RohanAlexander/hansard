2,Mr Makin,"to admit that the control by the Customs Department has weakened. I think it was generally agreed by honourable members last week that the department continues to zealously protect the interests of the Commonwealth in this matter. However, j shall make inquiry as to the exact position. before the Royal Commission on the Constitution of the Commonwealth, Dr. Cumpston, the Commonwealth Director General of Health, said that the inspection of imported food is not a function of the Health Department, and so far as that duty was performed, it was carried out by the Customs Department. I desire to know what are the qualifications of the inspectors who are permitted to make examinations of food on behalf of the Customs Department ? Sir NEVIL LE HOWSE I shall ascertain what are the qualifications of these officers, who carry out what we must ous private banks, are matters for the .all admit is a most important duty. WAR SERVICE HMS -owing to the failure of the central administration of the War Service Homes Commission to authorize the employment of additional staff, the employees of the New -South Wales branch are being overworked? In addition to much overtime, are the employees compelled to take work home to enable them to overtake arrears, for which they receive no remuneration? Has the Commonwealth Medical Officer for New South Wales made a report to the Chief Medical Officer of the Commonwealth on these speeding-up methods, directing attention to several breakdowns which are attributed to this cause? Will the Minister for Works and Railways ask the Public Serviee Board to conduct an inquiry into the working conditions of this department? staff of the War Service Homes Department in New South Wales is overworked; I rather think that the reverse is the case. However, I shall have inquiry made, and let the honourable member have a reply to his questions. the Treasurer would state at the rising of the House the order of business for tomorrow ancl next week, to assist honourable members in making their arrangements. this evening to give the right honourable gentleman information regarding the order of business for to-morrow, and possibly for next week also. question I asked yesterday, will the Treasurer ascertain whether it is a fact that the Bank of New South Wales has a special arrangement with the Commonwealth .Bank whereby it can receive accommodation up to from £300,000 to £400,000 at 3 per cent. ments made between the Commonwealth Bauk and its clients, including the varibank administration itself, and I do not see that it is possible for me to inquire into such matters. tion of the Minister for Home and Territories to a paragraph in yesterday's Daily Guardian, Sydney, headed "" Canberra Seaport.

The indications are that the mails were pillaged before reaching Australia. C.O.R, SPIRIT . Minister, upon notice1. Whether it is a fact that although the Commonwealth Oil Refineries Limited pay no duty upon the partly-refined oil from which its refined petrol is produced, the same price, 2s. a gallon, is at present being charged for C.O.R. petrol as for petrol of equal quality upon which a duty of 3d. a gallon is paid ? 2. Is the Commonwealth Oil Refinery au important factor in protecting Australian petrol-users from exploitation by private entertralia at less than the cost in the country of prise engaged in the importation of petrol? the honourable member's questions are as follow:1. It is a fact that the Comnioiiwealth Oil Refineries Ltd., pays no duty upon the crude oil it imports, as crude oil is not dutiable. It . is not a fact that the imported oil from which the C.O.R. petrol is.produced is partly refined. The honourable member's suggestion is probably based upon the fact that some time ago the company imported two or three cargoes of crude oil containing an admixture of once-run distillate; but this was for all commercial and manufacturing purposes a crude oil, and was so classified by the Customs. The retail price of C.O.R. petrol ha§ not been increased since the duty ou petrol was increased by 3d. per gallon, but has been maintained at the price of 2s. per gallon. The petrol imported by other companies, for the greater part of the last financial year, was sold at 2s. 2d. and 2s. 3d. per gallon, but has since been reduced to 2s. per gallon. 2. Yes. The information is GRAETON TO SOUTHBRISBAN E member for Lilley( Mr Mackay) asked me the following question, without It has been stated in the public press of at least three of the States that tlie Commonwealth Government by withholding certain funds has been responsible for delay in construction of the Kyogle-South Brisbane railway.

If so, will he have inquiry made to ascertain whether, after allowance is made for freight, the coal is being disposed of in Ausorigin ? I am now able to supply the honourable member with the following information :1. Yes. Two cargoes were imported into South Australia in August last. 2. Information as to the price of coal in London is not available. 3. The coal was imported for the importing concerns' own use, none being otherwise disposed of in Australia.

A Commonwealth Savings Bank, to he called the Commonwealth Savings Bank of Australia, is hereby established This proposed new section describes tbe savings bank as the "" Commonwealth -Savings Bank of Australia,"" which is not in conformity with the title of the b ill. That clearly indicates that the title of the bill should have been amended. Asi t stands, it is misleading, and is foreign altogether to the provisions of the bill. It w ill confuse the general public when the bank is established, and I again bring the matter under the notice of the Treasurer, and urge that the title should be altered, even at this late stage. surer) [2.56] -The honourable member raised this question previously, but there is really nothing in his contention The title of the bill is the "" Commonwealth Bank Savings BankB ill .

General) [ 3 . 0 ] It is not in my experience, which is, I admit, limited to Victoria, the practice of savings banks to allow depositors to withdraw money by cheques as can. be done by depositors in ordinary banks As a general rule the savings bank depositor must produce his pass-book and a withdrawal slip before payment is made to him and the amount of the withdrawal is entered in his pass-book. One advantage of the system is that no stamp duty is payable, and the system is generally understood as being in the interests of t h r if t , inasmuch as savings bank depositors, not having the same ready access to their money as they would nave in a general bank, do not so readily withdraw their savings. I do not think that this provision in itself authorizes the savings bank commissioners to issue cheque books and honour cheques as is done by the ordinary banks, because that it is not incidental to the general business of savings banks as understood in Australia. But the commissioners of the Commonwealth Savings Bank w ill have the right to draw cheques. It is quite a common practice for a person who is withdrawing money to ask for a cheque instead of cash. I should like a further explanation f r o in the Treasurer of the provisions that the savings bank should have power among other things, "" to receive money on deposit either for a fixed term or on current account,"" and "" to make advances by way of loan or otherwise.""

RILEY sioners have the power to erect buildings wherever they like? have all the powers of savings bank commissioners to do whatever they like with the savings bank? surer) [3.7] -The commissioners w ill have all the powers referred to by the honourable member for South Sydney. There is no justification for the statement of the honourable member for Werriwa( Mr Lazzarini) that this b ill will diminish the powers of the Commonwealth Bank. Section7 of the principal act, which is not affected by this bill, gives to the Commonwealth Bank the f u l l powers on which it now operates. The powers given by this bill to the savings bank commissioners are essential to the conduct of a savings bank business. It is the ordinary practice of savings bank depositors to place their money i u current 'account, and, although this money is usually at call, there are always regulations providing that a depositor cannot withdraw more than a certain so. sum without giving notice. Some savings banks accept money on fixed A r e the ordinary deposit for six or twelve months just as ordinary trading banks do, and on those fixed deposits they usually pay a higher rate of interest. The clause provides for both classes of deposits, ordinary In the ordinary current account and fixed deposits. The bill contains nothing which is contrary to the ordinary savings bank practice. Paragraph d of theproposed new section 35D provides that the savings bank shall have power "" to make advances by way of loan or otherwise.""

58,Mr Charlton (Hunter) [3.13],"Aof the Commonwealth Bank shall be transferred from the present board of directors to a commission. During the second reading debate this matter was discussed at length, and it was shown that the effect of this provision must be to lower the prestige of the Commonwealth Bank, and to reduce its profits. Seeing that the assets of the general bank amount to £32,000,000, as against the savings bank branch assets of £46,000,000, it is obvious that a large proportion of the Commonwealth Bank's profits are derived from the savings bank department. when we reflect that the money from the savings bank depositors is obtained at 3 per cent., as against 5 per cent, paid i u respect of deposits in the general bank. The Commonwealth Bank is now recognized as one of the world's leading financial institutions; but if this proposal is agreed to, that position w ill no longer continue. In order to maintain the bank's prestige the Treasurer proposes to move for the insertion of a new clause to provide that the balance-sheets of the Commonwealth Bank and of the savings bank shall be combined. That w ill not meet the situation. Section 20 of the principal act providesThe board, at least twice in each year, shall prepare a balance-sheet in accordance with the prescribed form, and submit it to the Auditor General for report as to its correctness or otherwise, and transmit it with the report of the Auditor-General to the Treasurer, and shall also transmit a true copy of the balance-sheet and report to the President of the Senate and to the Speaker of the House of' Representatives, to be laid before the Senate and the House of Representatives respectively. The proposed amendment of which the. Treasurer has given notice provides that the Treasurer, not the board, shallat least twice in each year, precommission for one purpose only, and pare a statement of the combined accounts of the bank and the savings bank in accordance with the prescribed form. (2) The Treasurer shall submit the statement to the Auditor-General for the Commonwealth for certification as to its correctness. (3) The statement shall, within fourteen days of its being so certified, be laid before both Houses of the Parliament if the Parliament is then sitting, and, if not, then within fourteen days after the next meeting of the Parliament. Tbe combined balance-sheet w ill give the combined profits of the two banks; but it w ill not be issued by the bank.. It w ill be a publication issued under the author i ty of the Treasurer. A f t e r the commencement of this act a smaller profit w ill be shown each year in the bank's balance-sheet. We should make it our aim to maintain the present strength of the Commonwealth Bank. It should be allowed to remain in active competition with private banks. Should we have a recurrence of the conditions which prevailed from 1914 to 1918 we shall need a financial institution strong enough to meet the That fact is more evident situation. If we weaken the Commonwealth Bank, as is proposed in this measure, it w ill f a i l us in any great emergency. The committee should consider carefully, the position in which the bank w ill be placed by this legislation. It is not justified in concluding that .the Government's proposals have the approval of the directors of the Commonwealth Bank. We know nothing at all i u regard to the details of any proposal submitted by the Treasurer to the bank directors when they carried the resolution recently placed before this House. There is a big principle involved in this clause; and I do not think this House should allow the clause to go through without thorough discussion. I do not think that there is any necessity for a clause of this kind at all. No evidence has been produced to this House to show that it is neeessary to divorce the savings bank from the general banking department. If they are not going to perform any but the ordinary functions of savings bank administrat i o n ; if they are only going to advance money for the purpose of allowing homes to be built by some other authority, the commissioners w ill have practically nothing whatever to do. We are establishing the that, in my opinion, is to diminish the influence of the Commonwealth Bank itself. If the Treasurer had shown that there was any justification for separating the two branches of the bank, there might be some reason for accepting this proposal. But everything that has been advanced has only gone to prove more f u l l y that the Commonwealth Bank, as at present constituted, is capable of carrying out the proposed housing scheme in its entirety. Surely those now controlling the bank could advance monev to the State autliorities. authorities pass legislation in accordance with the conditions which we have attached to our housiug scheme they cannot obtain advances. But if they comply with those conditions they can make application to the Commonwealth Sasings Bank for an advance, and, if the application is granted, certain sums of money will be advanced to them, and the account will be adjusted by means of a book entry. Yet, though that is all that has to be done, it is proposed to separate the savings bank department from the general banking branch. the savings bank is an extremely important branch of the bank, because it is the branch which handles the savings of the people. has brought in a milk-and-water proposal, to take the edge off the criticism which has been levelled against this bill. The committee will be well advised, before it allows this clause to pass, to insist upon obtaining full information from him as to his reasons for .dividing the control of the bank. I know that an injustice is being done to the Commonwealth Bank. Whether it is being done deliberately or not, I do not know; but an injustice is being clone, the effect-of which will be to reduce the status of the bank. It will not continue to be the same institution as it is at the present time. But instead of reducing the status of the bank, we should take steps to increase its business throughout Australia. No one will feel the injury that is being clone to the Commonwealth Bank mo™ than the primary producer. It is to the Commonwealth Bank that he must look when the need arises. If there should be another drought in Australia, it is this bank which will have to stand at the back of the primary producer. If the bank is divided, as proposed in this bill, it will not be as strong financially as it is at the present time. As at present constituted, the bank could, in times of stress, obtain money or credit from other parts of the world to tide the country over bad times. taking such action as is here proposed-the cutting off of an important branch-we weaken the credit of the bank both at home and overseas. We should endeavour to model this bank Mr Chariton. Unless the State on lines that would increase its strength and solidity, so that it might be able to protect Australia in any financial, crisis that might arise. We do not want to get back to the occurrences of the old days, when thousands of people who had saved up, perhaps, £200*-or £300, lost every penny of it because the' banks to which they had entrusted their money had closed their doors.. That cannot happen while we have the Commonwealth Bank operating as at present. But by this bill we propose to weaken the bank, and lessen its powers to No. doubt help the people. It will no longer be, as it was called during the second-reading debate, the financial Gibraltar of Australia. This bank is the creation of The Treasurer the Australian people, through this Parliament, and Parliament, havingthus assisted in the creation of the bank, should seek to strengthen it, rather than to reduce its effectiveness. We should endeavour to create the impression throughout the world that, just as the Bark of England speaks for England in matters financial, so this bank speaks for Australia. It should be our endeavour to make the bank loom large among the financial institutions of the world. Instead of doiug that, we are now seeking to reduce its status in the eyes of people at Home and abroad.' If the Parliament of this country has not sufficient faith in this bank to allow it to carry on as it is, what effect will this proposal produce on the minds of people in other parts of the world? People will say that Parliament has not much faith in the bank, and seems to be doing its best to cripple it. I hope that, even at this hour, the committee will come to the conclusion that this bill is inadvisable, and will see that the bank is allowed to carry on as it is now. rise to call attention to the manner in which this clause is presented to the com.mittee, and, incidentally, to the drafting of the bill. I draw attention to the fact But if we weaken it by that clause 7 embraces about five pages of printed matter, and that it is liberally divided and subdivided first, into sections numbered 35A, 35B, 35C, and so on, which are. again split into sub-sections, and then into rjaragraphs, marked a, i , c, and",20,Commonwealth Bank

I -cannot understand why the drafting has not been done in a more understandable form, in consecutive clauses, sub-divisions being made alphabetically only where they were clearly necessary. Whatever we may say is not likely to have any effect against the superior weight of numbers with which we are faced. only, not in ability. that have been advanced from this side have not been altogether unfruitful. They have at least evoked from the Treasurer a series of apologies and explanations which suggest that, although he will not admit himself to be in the wrong, he realizes that what Ave have said in regard to the disintegration and the disunion of the bank has a great deal of force. He has just submitted to the committee an amendment Avhich Avill make it possible for the figures of the two institutions to be aggregated for the purposes of the balance-sheet. He has gone to some pains to explain that there is more than one bond connecting the savings bank, that is hereafter to be set up, and the general bank. His action is suggestive of that of a man Avho, having run amok Avith an axe and inflicted grievous bodily harm upon some person, rushes round in search of bandages and lint so that he may show his Avillingness to repair, as far as pos-. sible, the injury Avhich he has caused. That simile should appeal to the Treasurer, who has a more profound knowledge of physics than of finance. I have nothing to add to the judgment that has been passed by my Leader( Mr the CommonAvealth Bank of Australia, iu Charlton) and other honourable members Avho sit on this side. I merely emphasize the protest that I uttered at an earlier stage against the proposed severance. General) [3.35] I remind the committee that there is on the statute-book an act which Avas passed in 1905, and described as "" An act to incorporate amendments in amended acts."" If the amended act has been properly drawn, it is possible to have the statute reprinted Avith all amendments up to date. This method of drafting has been adopted by the CommonAvealth, but not by the States. The effect is that one can obtain in a single print any CommonAvealth statute containing all amendments that haAe been made up to date. r The alternative Avould be that, instead of being able to consult a single statute, one Avould need to refer to perhaps half a dozen. If honourable members were obliged to refer separately to the ten' amending acts that have been made tp the CommonAvealth Conciliation and ArbiThe arguments tration Act, it AA'ould be very difficult for them to ascertain Avhat the law Avas. Clause7 has been drafted in this form to enable a reprint to be made of the act when amended. It is a convenient method, alike for honourable members, the public, and the legal profession. Treasurer ought to inform honourable members at this stage of the reason for the inclusion of the proposed neAV section 35E. On the motion for the second reading, and in the various speeches that he has made during the committee stage, he has told us that only the administration of the savings bank Avas to be removed from the administration of the general bank. When an honourable member suggested that something more than the administration was involved, he accused him of having misrepresented the position. If only the administration is to be divided, because it Avould be impossible for the directors of the bank, without dropping dead Avith fatigue, to borrow £20,000,000, and lend it to the States to enable them to finance the housing scheme, Avhat is the necessity for this provision ? It says that "" The assets of respect of its saA'ings bank business, shall be transferred to the savings bank."" That is to say, the assets of the savings bank are to be wrenched away from the general bank and placed under the control of an entirely neAv administratiou, and that-in the language used by the honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan) on the motion for the second reading of the bill-signifie s the establishment of a neAv bank.

63,Mr Scullin (Yarra) [3.37],"Theappointment to tlie new board of one of the memhers of the present hoard of directors will not maintain a connection between the assets of the two institutions. If there is to be a division of administration only, why are the assets to be divided ? It is undoubted that the Commonwealth Bank is becoming more and more a bankers' bank. Up to last week the desire to lodge trust moneys with the bank had been frustrated on five separate occasions. Although, thanks to the Treasurer, the last amending act contained a provision permitting trustee business to be done, the management of the hank has shown no desire to give effect to it. I attribute that to the innovation of placing the control of the Commonwealth Bank under a board of directors. With the advance that; has been made by the Commonwealth Bank-which , however, is not as great as it should be-additiona l branches should be opened ancl opportunities thus provided for the promotion of some of the younger members of the staff. As the savings bank, which is the people's bank, brings the Commonwealth Bank more into contact with depositors than any other financial institution, I cannot understand why these two branches of Commonwealth banking business should be separated. The Victorian railways and the Melbourne municipal tramway service operate under separate control, with the result that the tramways enter into severe competition with the railways. Separate control of Commonwealth banking will also result in unnecessary competition, to the detriment of the people. During recent years many important banks have amalgamated with other financial institutions. The old Colonial Bank, with which I was associated many years ago, has, for instance, amalgamated with the National Bank, which may be an advantage sliould we be threatened with another* debacle such as that which occurred in 1S89. By fixiug rhe interest rate on overdrafts at 6 per cent, during the war period, the Commonwealth Bank assisted materially in stabilizing finance in Australia; but the Commonwealth Bank is in most instances now charging 6-J per cent. With the possibility of unsatisfactory seasons which, some have foreshadowed, the banks should not charge more than 6 per cent., particularly as that rate was considered adequate during a period of national .emergency. I trust that the Government will introduce an amendment of our Commonwealth Bank legislation so that the trustee , branch of the business may be extended. The present trustee companies are practically as safe as a banking institution; but they cannot be as secure as an institution which has the whole of our resources as security. If a new board is appointed to control the savings bank branch of the business, new premises will have to be obtained ancl additional officers appointed. If effect had been given to the desires of Mr King O'Malley, the father of the Commonwealth Bank, we would not now have in Melbourne a State Savings Bank building in Elizabeth Street, another in Spencer-street, and also a huge building which was recently acquired in Swanston-street, competing with the Commonwealth Savings Bank. The acquisition of additional accommodation, and the appointment of a new staff, will increase the administrative costs, and possibly affect the rate of interest paid to depositors, and surely reduce the profits. WhilstI believe that the Treasurer has the best of intentions, I still think a mistake is being made in separating tliese two branches of the bank's business. -An examination of the balance-sheet of the Commonwealth Bank shows that, apart from the funds of the note issue -branch, which is not associated with the ordinary business of banking, the amount ou deposit in the two sections amounts to £90,582,000. Deposits, including accrued interest, in the Savings Bank, amount to £46,479,000, and therefore those of the general banking business amount to £44,103,000. In order to mollify honourable members opposite, the Treasurer states that he is prepared to introduce a new clause for the purpose of showing the total operations of the two banks in one balance-sheet. A tyro in finance could see that that is a mere pretence. the receipts from Customs. board of the general bank will have no right to one penny of the funds of the commissioners established under the bill.",23,Commonwealth Bank

Sub-section 2 deals with the application of agreements which have been made with two of the States. Although this matter was discussed at the second-reading stage. I do not intend to let this opportunity pass without issuing a final warning. The Treasurer (Dr. Earle Page) has never yet been able to inform the committee whether the States that are in agreement with the Commonwealth in respect of the savings bank have accepted these proposals. The first thing that we should know is whether Queensland and Tasmania, which States have handed over their savings bank business to the Commonwealth, have agreed to the bill. If they have not done so, by passing this bill we shall be practically breaking faith with them. The Treasurer should State now whether the two States concerned are favorable to thc bill; and, if they are, an objection to it would be removed. What may be the position if . the bill is passed? Two or three States may accept the conditions under which money may be borrowed from the Commonwealth Savings Bank, but if Queensland and Tasmania refuse to alter their existing legislation they will be unable to borrow from the bank, and will, therefore, be at a disadvantave. wealth is practically holding a pistol at their heads. They have to accept the conditions laid down under the bill or else receive no money at all from the Commonwealth for the furtherance of their housing schemes. Although they have supplied probably half the funds of the Commonwealth Savings Bank, their money will be used for building homes in other States. This is a serious matter, and one upon which the committee should be enlightened. The Treasurer has said that; he mentioned the proposal to officials of those two States, and that they raised no objection to it ; but he has not informed the committee whether the Governments of those States have agreed to able member for Dalley( Mr Theodore) nine hundred and thirteen, the that this legislation imposes conditions that are totally different from those existing in Queensland to-day, and that the Queensland Government, TO conform with the bill, will need to alter the basis of its housing schemes. That State has more money in the Commonwealth Savings Bank than any other State, and if it refuses to accept this legislation its money will be used for housing schemes in other States. That is not the spirit of federation. member suggest that the passage of this bill will adversely affect Queensland and Tasmania? tain conditions must be complied with, and if Queensland refuses to accept those conditions because they are unsuitable it will be debarred from receiving one penny from the Commonwealth Savings Bank. tors receive their interest payments they will not be adversely affected. not altogether of the depositors receiving interest, but of developing as far as possible each State with the capital of the combined States. In private life when a _ departure is made from an agreement, the person adversely affected may have recourse to law, but in this case Queensland and Tasmania will have no redress. The Commonwealth Parliament in passing this legislation is dictating to the States the conditions under which The Commonthey can borrow money for their housing, schemes. I object to that. It is necessary, in order to foster the true spirit of federation amongst the people of Australia, that there should always be a common understanding between the Commonwealth and the States. The States have every right to conduct their, own savings bank business, and they should not be deprived of those rights. Queensland and Tasmania agreed to transfer their savings banks to the Commonwealth Government, believing that step to be in the best interests of the Commonwealth.",26,Pairs

Treasurer imagine that, had the Government of Queensland anticipated the introduction of this measure, which differs so entirely from the agreement into which it entered with the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank, it would have handed over its savings bank to the Commonwealth Government? The Treasurer should have laid his cards upon the table, and revealed to the States concerned his proposed legislation, so that, if tion to supplement the activities of the they were not agreeable to it, they could have continued with their savings bank businesses and conserved their money for the development of their own territory. This Government cannot continue the policy which is exemplified by this bill, and in which, of recent years, it has been only too prone to indulge. The governments of Queensland and Tasmania entered into a solemn and binding agreement with the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank, under the conviction that it was in the interest of all concerned, and . now the money that they have passed over to the Commonwealth Government is to be allocated for the purpose of a home-building scheme quite different from those already existing in the States.

Under the actual letter of the agreement it is merely an advisory board; but the spirit of the agreement, and one of the reasons why it was entered into, was that the advice tendered by the board should be acted on. The board was really more than an advisory board; but the Chief Savings Bank Commissioner, who under this bill takes the place of the place of the Governor of the Commonwealth Banki n the administration of savings bank funds, may feel that he is at liberty to disregard its advice. For a couple of years after negotiating the agreement with the Commonwealth BankI acted as a member of that board, in conjunction w i th Sir Denison Miller. course, if the Queensland Government has raised no objection to the present proposal, I have no reason to do so. merely call attention to the fact that the provision may act detrimentally to the State of Queensland.

One-half shall he placed to the credit of a fund to he called the Savings Bank Reserve Fund; and (6) One-half shall be paid into the National Debt Sinking Fund as soon as practicable after the preparation of each balance-sheet.

103,Mr Charlton,"I am glad to haveboards to advise it, our action will be regarded by them as authority on which they should act. It would be interesting to know the cost of the boards and commissions which have been appointed during the last four years. I hope that the proposed new section will not be agreed to. [5.0] I agree with the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton) that boards of advice in the several States are unnecessary. The Treasurer just now claimed that the proposed section 35J was necessary because of a similar provision in the principal act. Yet a provision similar to that in the proposed new section now before the committee was struck out of a previous measure. The Treasurer is blowing hot and cold. Tbe 1924 bill at first provided for a board of advice in each State, but Tiot in London. It passed this Housei n . that form, but in another place it was ^altered to provide for a board of advice in London, and none, in the States. So far as the Commonwealth Bank itself is concerned, the 1924 act does uot provide for boards of advice in the States, and I cannot see that, in connection with a measure dealing only with the savings bank branch of the bank, there is any need for them. So far as I am aware, the private banks have no boards of advice in States other than those in which their head offices are situated; their directors visit the various States from time to time. I intend to vote against the proposed new sub-section. £5.3] I hope that the Treasurer will reconsider his intention to appoint boards of advice in the several States. There is no necessity for them. Honourable members who frequently refer to the heavy expenditure caused by methods, should be consistent and vote against the proposed new section. The inclusion of this proposed new section in the bill justifies the contention has been made in Tasmania. of honourable members on this side that the multiplication of boards is unwarranted. There will be nothing for the boards of advice to do. The commission will have the benefit of the advice of its own officers. If we have, in addition to the three commissioners, a board of advice in every State of the Commonwealth, that is going to mean the multiplication of officers, and increased expense. I am certain that there will be a rising among the taxpayers if we keep on appointing boards and commissions. The country is under sufficient expense already. Everybody knows that whenever the Government establishes a fresh set of commissioners these men soon gather a staff about them. There are branches of the bank in practically every State. There is, I understand, a new building for the Commonwealth Bank being erected in Brisbane. building it is going to be, too. of the bank in practically every town, surely there will be enough officers to do the business of the savings bank, even under the new housing scheme. labouring the point? surer) [5.7] -The reason for incorporating the proposed new section 35K in the bill, is that proposed new section 35:F says thatSavings banks may, witli tbe approval of the Treasurer, enter into an arrangement with the proper authority controlling any savings bank constituted under the laws of a State, for the transfer to the savings bank, upon such terms and conditions as are agreed upon between the savings bank and the proper authority, of the whole, or any part, of the assets, liabilities and business of that savings bank. -If the business of any State savings bank is transferred to the Commonwealth Savings Bank, it would be a wise thing to do what has been done in the case of Tasmania and Queensland. In both of those "" go-slow"" States a board of advice has been constituted. In Queensland, the board consists of the State Treasurer and the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank, or, in future the chief commissioner of the savings bank.

I do not agree with the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton) in the contention that the savings bank business is being satisfactorily conducted in post offices. The mere fact that depositors have to transact their business in post offices reduces the volume of business. I which perhaps one postal official is doing Commonwealth savings bank business whilst in an adjacent State savings bank building five or six officers are emmonwealth for any officer of the department ployed.

They have drawn attention to the fact that under the rural credits scheme of the Commonwealth Banki t is not possible to get other than short-dated accommodation-that is, accommodation for not more than twslve months-and that the beneficence of the scheme would be tremendously improved if funds were also made available to enable storehouses or warehouses to be built to hold goods placed in pools. They pointed out that if this were done it would enable cooperative societies to hold produce and market it in more orderly fashion than would otherwise be possible. is made under the rural credits scheme agaiust the goods stored in the warehouses ? of the rural credits scheme submitted to Parliament over two years ago was on the basis of making the funds available to the maximum possible degree to enable the harvest for each year to be marketed in a regular and orderly fashion. To that end a great deal of elasticity was given to the funds at the command of the bank for rural credits, but they were to be made available only to the extent that they would return within a year for use for the next year's crop. Advances under tbe rural credits scheme are essentially short-dated loans--the y do not extend for legislation is to enable co-operative more than twelve months-and they could be of no value for the erection of a warecredits scheme to house their products. house. A warehouse is a permanent asset, and needs different treatment. It might, perhaps, take twenty years to pay off an advance for such a building. It was felt that the appropriate place for a provision to enable advances to be made on warehouses for the storage of primary products was in a section of the act dealscheme would suffer from the lack of ing with the investment of savings bank funds. Consequently, in submitting a bill which will enable savings bank funds to be advanced for the building of houses on terms of repayment extending over 20 or 30 years, we are also making provision for advancing savings bank funds for the erection of warehouses to hold primary products. In each case the business is similar. I think facilities."" I do not think we can deal that cleaning and drying plants are covered by the term "" storage facilities."" posed section. A well-equipped maize silo could not be installed without provision for cleaning the maize and putting it into proper shape before it is actually stored. I should think that a cleaning and drying plaut would be part and parcel of the actual machinery necessary to carry on the work of warehouses, and provision is already made for this in the bill by the use of the term "" storage facilities."" money be advanced would be advanced at the discretion of the commissioners, and, I take it, mostly to State co-operative bodies who desired to pool their products. A body such as the Atherton maize pool, or a wheat pool, would be able to get an advance from the Savings Bank Commissioners on long terms of repayment, such as are extended to a home-builder. 4 commissioners would also be able to advance to private companies ? company, quite independent of a cooperative concern, could obtain an advance for the purpose of building a warehouse for the storage of primary products but the definite purpose of this societies to take advantage of the rural This bill will make the position easier for the rural credits department of the Commonwealth Bank.

A privateam sorry that the Treasurer cannot see his way to broaden the proposed section by permitting the Savings Bank Commissioners to make advances on facilities other than those which are named. advances to provide warehouses and storage facilities, I cannot see why advances cannot be made for those other essential agricultural necessities which make for the orderly marketing of produce. The Treasurer evidently regards the words "" storage facilities"" as em-_ bracing silos; but if they embrace silos I think the paragraph should also be made to embrace the cleaning and drying plants which are so essential in silos. are covered by the words "" storage facilia very large extent they will be renties."" much to tlie good; but no harm can be done by naming these things, and placing beyond the possibility of doubt the power of the commissioners to make advances on these plants. Some facilities, however, do not come within the term "" storage facilities,"" and I think they ought also to be named in the bill. Surely the underlying idea is to aid co-operation in agriculture. If we are to do what we can do as a national Parliament towards the improvement of primary production iu Australia, we should assist by means of finance, the co-operative movement in agriculture. I admit that ttc excess of deposits over withdrawals available to the commissioners of the savings bank will be too small to enable much to be done in that direction. If any considerable funds are available from that source they will be required for the housing scheme. Thc Treasurer, however, has undertaken to issue a series of loans, aggregating in all £20,000,000, to assist the savings bank commissioners to carry out the purposes of this bill and the housing bill, and a definite portion of that amount could be allocated to assist agriculture. Eveni f the Treasurer had to get a special authorization from Parliament to exceed the £20,000,000, he'would be well justified in doing so. An advance of £20,000,000 on reasonable terms to farmers' co-operative organizations would be a sound investment for the Commonwealth, and no one would criticize it. I do not hold, of course, that the Commonwealth sliould involve itself in heavy financial loss. Advances would have to If it be sound to make be made on good security. Nor do I suggest that the Treasurer should advance up to 20s. in the £ on the security offering. There should be a margin to safeguard the bank or the authority making the advance. The Treasurer has asserted, and we all agree, that he can raise loans on much more favorable terms than the farmers or any one else in Australia. By placing these facilities through the commissioners of the savings bank at the disposal of agricultural organizations we shall enable the organizations themselves to get cheap money, and to dered independent of private institutions in financing their enterprizes. At present, as every one knows, they are under very painful restrictions. The banks can charge almost extortionate rates of interest and impose conditions to which the . farmers find it very difficult to conform. I moveTliat after the word "" products,"" paragraph [d), the words ""or for factories, cleaning and drying plants, mechanical loading, apparatus for grading and processing, or transportation facilities"" be added. I admit the wide nature of the words "" transportation facilities."" I do not want advances to be made to farmers to enable them to build railway lines or branch lines or anything of that sort. But motor transport is becoming almost indispensable in connection with all industries, and nowhere is it more indispensable than in agriculture. If the farmers are to organize and avail themselves of modern transport facilities they can only do so when they have money to finance their schemes. there be for transportation facilities? advance to be made without security or an advance to be'made to the extent of 20s. in the £ on the security offering.

Personally, gulation of these matters by statute, rather than by statutory rule. Under paragraph c, "" in advancing money in accordance with the Commonwealth Housing Act 1927, for the purchase or erection of dwelling-houses,"" it is clear that the maximum amount that can be advanced is £1,800, or 90 per cent, of the value, as that is laid down under the Housing Bill. In clause d, however, there is nothing whatever to suggest, that even 150 per cent, of the cost might not be advanced. There is no limitation stipulated, nor is the amount or the percentage which may be advanced indicated either in this bill or in the Housing Bill. ThoughI have a great desire to see the extension to priapparatus; nevertheless, the cost worked mary producers of such facilities as are hci-e provided for, it does not seem to me believe, however, that if money could that the position is adequately safeguarded as the paragraph now stands.

If it were proposed to advance money in accordance with the rural credits scheme, the suggestion would commend itself to me. But, as it stands now, the provision appears to be entirely uncontrolled. There would be no limitation, except by regulations, of the amount to be advanced to any one person. The paragraph now states that the money is to be advanced for the erection of. warehouses, and warehouses always suggest trading. If it had been storehouses, instead of warehouses, it would be less objectionable to me, at any rate. As regards the amendment proposed by the honourable member for .

What it says is that up to 90 per cent, may be advanced.
