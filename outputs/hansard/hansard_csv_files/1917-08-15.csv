Its terms are a replica of the provision in the Victorian Act, and the practice which has been followed under that Act w ill be observed in its enforcement. I assume that it will not apply to meetings within halls. Thc Government in issuing the Proclamation had not such meetings in mind: Should ita legal effect be greater than was intended, the Proclamation may be modified. It s object is to prevent the assembling of large bodies of persons for the purpose of overawing Parliament, and thus taking away the prerogative of my friends opposite to say what they please about the Government. Minister have the Proclamation printed, so that it may be widely distributed ? fairl y wide circulation, but I shall be glad to take such further steps as may be necessary to make it known where it is most likely to be of service.

The honourable member has already been informed that the Australian rifle. is interchangeable with the British rifle, but that it requires some slight alteration in the sighting to fire Mark VII . ammunition, effectively. It was in 1911 that the Minister first became aware of this. Since that time the matter has been the subject of communication with the British Government. 2. It is expected that rifles sighted for Mark VII . ammunition will be produced at Lithgow in the course of the next six months. 3.

123,Sir William Irvine (Flinders),"the taking away, by means of a waT-time profits tax, of 75 per cent, of the excess profits gained during the last two years of the waT period is, perhaps, the worse way in which money could be raised. Members are at one in thinking that the heaviest taxation should be levied on war profits; but if we tax. at the rate of 75 per cent, excess profits which are not war profits, we shall be taxing heavily a small section of the community, and following a course prejudicial, and possibly ruinous if carried very far, to the country's interests. Like all the other countries engaged in this terrible war, we shall have shortly to face the most serious commercial and industrial position with which we have yet been confronted. There is now taking place an enormous destruction of the working capital of the community, aud the task of reconstruction will require all the energy, organizing ability, and capital which can be devoted to it. Even then, it will prove almost overwhelming in magnitude and danger. If we are to succeed, we must maintain and restore our necessarily lowered credit and capital, so that the community may be in a condition to apply its energies to the production of wealth. proposal to tax war profits, let us deal with the Bill as a proposal to tax profits that are not war profits, but have arisen from greater skill or good fortune in the conduct of business. If you tax such profits at the rate of 75 per cent., you do the utmost to weaken the springs of energy and enterprise. Por that reason, as I said on Friday last, the only justification for so enormous and confiscatory an imposition as this is that it is a tax on war profits, and on war profits only. If it is not such a tax, it should be brought as near to that definition as possible. There are many provisions in the Bill to which I shall refer in Committee; but I appeal to the Minister in charge of it to adopt the couTse which alone will enable it to be made workable, and to be applied with justice, and that is to make it appear, on the face of it, that its object is to tax the profits which have arisen by reason of the war, and to tax nothing else. Such taxation should apply to all persons who have derived such profits, without, any exemption whatever. -My attitude in regard to the Bill will vent the making of profits during war be easily and briefly stated. On the 8th December last I expressed the view that a measure such as this is not calculated to accomplish the results desired by the people. I object to this Bill for the reasons for which I objected to the last Bill. It is not what it represents itself to be, nor what the people had a right to expect, nor what they think it is. The people and the Government are of opinion that it is perfectly right to tax war profits made in war time. the war? has not been framed for that purpose; and if it had been, it would be rather a reflection on us than anything for which we might claim credit. There is a peculiar anomaly in the fact that during war time a section of .the people should be able to so increase prices as to make exceptional profits. Surely where patriotism was anything better than what Dr. Johnson called it , "" the last refuge of a scoundrel,"" it would be impossible for any man or any company tb reap rich rewards in profits during a period of national * struggle and danger. It is to our shame / and disgrace, and indicates our inability Putting aside the to meet the systems that are operating in the world to-day, that there should be war profits; but during this, as during every previous war of which we have any knowledge, the same thing has happened. We have had in Great Britain, Russia, France, and Germany, exposures of enormous profit making, and in to-day's newspapers there is an instance of the way in which America, who is now our Ally, took advantage of our National necessities earlier in the war. In one factory alone the British people are now making a profit of £8,000,000 over the prices charged by American manufacturers for the same goods. If the Bill sought to minimize the possibility of profit making during the war, there might be some attractiveness about it , but neither in the measure nor in the speech of the Treasurer do I find any reason for thinking that it will put a stop to the making of profits during war time. allowed, all businesses would be closed. the interjection later in exactly the terms that I used on the 8th December last.

128,. Mr Finlayson,"I hope to reply to time. I am more desirous of stopping the profiteer than of taking part of his excess profits. The Treasurer, in his second reading speech, correctly pointed out that the profits made because of the war in Australia are in a different cacegorv from those made by manufacturers in the Mother Country or in Canada, where huge Government orders for fhe manufacture of munitions have been placed. Australian merchants, having had no such orders, have made profits, not out of the British Government, but out of our own people. Our war expenditure has been about £100,000,000, and I imagine that it has .been distributed through the various channels along which it has flowed at a less profit than 5 per cent. The Treasurer proposes to secure £1,000,000 of this £5,000,000 of profit over a period of two year3. It is a rather significant sidelight on the proposal that the Treasurer, in seeking for £9,000,000 bo make up the deficit provides for. wartime profits taxation amounting to £1,000,000 for two years, £500,000 by taxing widowers and single . men between the ages of twenty-one and forty*fiye years. No matter what may be the underlying motive of the latter tax, the public will regard it as economic conscription, as intended to force young men between the ages of twenty-one and forty-five years to enlist. tween those ages, not merely on eligibles. made a definite statement regarding the proposal. will be many exemptions and extensions, but in the public mind the idea is rooted, and I think quite correctly, that this pro-; posed tax on single men and widowers without children is another effort, not so much to raise revenue as to force men to enlist. should adopt any such measures. Rightly or wrongly the country has declared against conscription, and the Government have been fairly honest, and the Director-General of Recruiting particularly honestI give them credit for itin pointing out what the Government's policy is. If that is true in regard to one aspect of conscription, it ought to be equally true in regard to the financial aspect, ifowever, I do not wish to labour that point, because when the proposed tax comes before us we shall have an opportunity of objecting. My point is that £5,000,000 has been made in profits out of expenditure on the war. The Treasurer says that he sees his way to take only £1,000,000. can get, but I am not sure of the amount. This sum is in addition to the income tax whicli they all pay. honourable members that the Prime Minister, when making his Ministerial statement on the 30th August, 1916, saidcannot There must be, as far as humanly possible, equality of sacrifice. Wealth has its duties; it owes all it has to the State, and must be prepared, if necessary, to sacrifice that all to the State. Many wealthy men have responded nobly to the call of duty; others have not. But they cannot be allowed thus to evade their responsibilities. All other considerations must be swept aside. One great principle must now govern our every action. Whatever is necessary for the salvation of the country must be done; and, since we are calling upon men to sacrifice their lives, we ought not to, and shall and for not, hesitate to compel men to sacrifice their wealth. about that. approved of the idea then. Does the Treasurer still approve of it ? taking place to-day. honourable gentleman ask the people to accept this War-time ProfitsB ill as an indication of the intention of the Government to compel wealth to accept its share of its responsibilities in connection with No doubt there the war? Those who make money must pay some of it to the Treasury. must admit that if this is 'one means it I do not think the Treasurer is a very feeble, harassing, and unsatisfactory method. I agree entirely with the right honourable member for Flinders in questioning whether, if the Treasurer's estimate of receipts from this> tax is based upon reliable figures, the B ill is worth having. not worth having ? need not put it that way. It is not a question of whether a million pounds can or cannot be got, but whether this is the best way of getting it .",13,Forrest

There is only one ""way of accomplishing our purpose, and that is by so severe a limitation of prices as w ill prevent people making profits during the war. profits. can only limi t profits by limiting prices. I see no other way of achieving our object. I was interested in reading the other day that Mr Henderson, who was, until very recently, a member of the British War' Cabinet, had said that if we had tried to get compulsion of wealth, the war would have been over before the B ill was through the House of Commons. . If this B ill was even an instalment of a conscription of wealth, as we understand the term-and I confess it is almost impossible to give a definition of what is meant by '' conscription of wealth ''-ther e would be some satisfaction in the minds of the people. But this B ill does not propose to tax wealth. It does not propose to hinder profiteering, or to put any l i m it to profitshould not the Treasurer avail himself of making. It does not propose in any way to prevent people amassing as much wealth as they can.

I do not believe in the principle, and am not in favour of the B ill . As I have already said, it is a limitation of fraud, since it is not what it pretends to be. The Newfoundland Upper House has rejected a B ill for the taxation of business profits arising out of war revenue.! That Chamber, I suppose, is a f a i r replica of most of the Upper Housesi n the world. I know that the British House of Lords was not very favourably disposed to the War-time ProfitsB ill , but it had to make the best of it . Mr Bonar Law, in a parliamentary paper, says that the number of income taxpayers in the United Kingdom increased from 1,200,000 in 1913-14 to 3,200,000 in 1916-17.

Admittedly there is a difference, but, after all, the income comes from the same people. It is made practically in the same way, because individual application must apply all the time. I do not think there is room for making these differentiations, which at all times cause trouble and annoyance to the Government Departments as well as a good deal of heart-burning on tlie part of the people affected. They are more of an annoyance than a help to the Government Departments. I notice with considerable interest that Mr Booker, M.L.A., of Queensland man, or is he a colleague of the honourable member for Wide Bay( Mr Corser) ? league of the honourable member for Wide Bay.

That is the sentiment in the heart of almost every cattle and sheep breeder. with that. sentiment, with which I heartily agree. ment would not allow what would have been a patriotic action on the part of the meat and wool producers if they had agreed to accept for the period of the war the prices in operation at the beginning of the war. meat at that time was high. per cwt., whereas it is now about 45s. per cwt. member's authority for those prices? them from the Sydney Bulletin. In commenting on Mr Booker's statement, the Sydney Bulletin wroteThe price was then 25s. per cwt.; in QueensThere is certainly land now it is about 45s., and still there is nn outcry against the Ryan Government for so fixing prices that the northern meat grower is making nothing by comparison with the southern pastoralist. Familiarity with war has bred contempt in the profiteer for most of the finepatriotic sentiments it started off with. But that is no reason why the instinctive justice of the early seutiments shonld'nt still be recognised by the Government, which has to finance the war. The world is deluged with war, and there is trouble, sorrow, and difficulty in all the .affected countries. However anxious we may be to see the end of the war, there is only one opinion in the minds of honourable members, and that is that we should secure a speedy and honourable peace. While the war lasts, there is one class in the communiby who may have a different! opinion; and though bhat class is small, it exercises wonderful power and influence. I refer to that section which, in our own and every other country, is making money out of the war. Selfishness is stronger than their patriotism; and the consequence is that while the masses of the people are feeling the burdens of the war -facin g the taxation, sorrow, suffering, and sacrifice-thes e few others are making profits. Cannot we find some method whereby this profiteering may be put a stop to? The opportunity is easier in Australia than in any other country, because, as I pointed out before, we are not directly interested in the manufacture of any of the necessities of the war. We are more concerned about keeping up the food supply, and are not in the same position as some of the other countries, where there are huge contracts, with enormous opportunities for money making. We are more in the nature of a people who are being bled to pay for those contracts in other countries, rather than getting any backward flow from that expenditure of money; other countries .are growing rich at OUT expense. The unfortunate thingis that, even in Australia, though we have not those direct opportunities, there are a number of people who are getting richer and richer in consequence of the war. This is not directly because of the war, but they are able to take advantage of the fact of the war to increase",17,Pobkest The Y Would Not

He also said that the same rule would apply in regard to the property of a company of which he was a member. asked, ' ' W h y does not your Government bring in a B ill to prevent any landlord from increasing rents ? Why me, as a man, for others? "" I say the same. The Prime Minister, in answer to a question of mine, said that any landlord who put up his Tents should be held up to public opprobrium of the severest kind, but that treatment would not hurt such men. I know of a case of a woman whose f a m i l y was smashed during the land boom, and who took up the hardest employment possible for a woman, that of keeping a house for board and lodging. Her rent has been increased by 36 per cent., after she has been twenty years in the same house under various landlords, and the other day she received notice that ' her tenancy was to be ended at the end of the month. The action taken was afterwards regretted. I approached the agents, one of the chief house and land agents in Melbourne, and the principals told me that they were sorry the notice had been sent out, because they had it noted in their books that tlie lady in question was a most, reputable tenant, and had been on their books for years. The PrimeM in ister spcke of a landlord owning property worth £500, and increasing its value to £1,000, and said that such a landlord would be justified in raising his rent. No one would object in such a case, but the class of-whom I am speaking go a little further, if the opportunity presents it self. In regard to prices, I have seen a list where a certain drug has been sold at a price which is 1,700 times more than what the article was sold for before the was. That drug, so far as my informant could state, has not been imported since the war began. an increase of 1,700 times runs to something like 170,000. ment took half of that profit, it would, to use the expression of the honourable member for ETerbert( Mr Bamford), licensing Dr. Maloney. preying on his fellow-men. To take every pound and every shilling of profits over and above the average earned prior to the declaration of war would be right, and a just punishment on those who had made such profits; but it would be unworthy of the Government and of the ParB ut he liament"" to become co-partners with those who have made these huge profits, it being a well-known maxim that the receiver is worse than the thief. If we did such a should you have to appeal to thing, history would point at us. We are blessed by having a wide ocean between us and the scenes of the present terrible fighting, and we should not allow those in our midst who, for the love of filthy lucre, would rob even their' nearest relation, to take advantage of their situation. It is stated that in the late nineties, when a war with Germany was never dreamt of, Lord Tollemache, during a conversation, asked Gladstone whether he thought that in tlie event of such a war the shipping companies, if they were paid well enough, would bring enemies to England? Gladstone's answer was, "" I believe that the shipping companies would, for lucre, land enemies in the port of heaven, if that were possible,"" We know some such companies here. I propose now to read a list of companies which have made profits during the present war.

If only make the fair profit that he made during the three years preceding the war he would then have no incentive to sell at an enhanced price, and take advantage of the needs of his fellow men. Farmers could nob buy galvanized iron with which to shelter their wheat, and as a result millions of bushels of grain have been ruined. The statement as to iron not being imported, or imported only tio a limited extent, can easily be verified by reference to the Customs House. Let a fair profit be allowed on imported iron, but why do not the Government start! works for the manufacture of galvanized iron ? They may be able to get from the steel and iron works of the BrokenH ill Proprietary black iron (that could be galvanized. The suggestion made by the honourable member for Flinders that this B ill should be altered from a war-time f rofits tax to a war profits tax Was made, am afraid, not with the object of benefiting the Treasury. Such an alteration would increase the ""difficulties of collecting the tax, and I compliment the Treasurer on having refused the suggestion. War-time profits clearly mean profits made during war time, but profits made from the war would be very difficult to discover. It would be contrary to logic to change the name of the measure. I still advocate the fixation of prices for vampires who are battening on the Engthe principal commodities. Last year I suggested to the Government) that they should display outside every post-office in the Commonwealth a list of the prices that should be charged for wheat, bread over the counter, sugar, and meat. Every caller at the office would see at a glance the price which he or she should pay for those commodities. also show the name of the officer to whom a citizen should write if charged more than the fixed price. The answer I received from the Minister of the day was that the Commonwealth Gazette was hung 1 at the post-office, but any person who tried to discover the locality prices of commodities from the Gazette would be very puzzled. I also suggested that all shopkeepers and purveyors of goods should be obliged to display in a position where it could readily be seen by any cus[41] .tomer a list of the prices fixed by the Government. The adoption of these proposals would prevent a lot of trouble and annoyance. MrH . L . Wilkinson, M.C.E., Melbourne University, A . M . Inst.

That book shows that, in 1907, when flour was sold at £ 9 5s. per ton, bread was from 5£d. to 6d. per 4-lb. loaf. In 1909, when £ 1 1 10s. was charged fop flour, bread was still from 5£d. to 6d. per loaf. Flour is now £ 1 0 15s. per ton, that is 15s. less than it was in 1909, and bread to-day is sold at 7d.. To show how the public are exploited, I may mention that, in 1911, when flour was only £ 8 per ton, the price of bread was kept up to 5Jd. and 6d. I recognise that the making of large profits is a Stimulus to private enterprise, and that no Treasurer would wish to destroy that stimulus. A t the same time it seems to me that this proposed tax does not go even so f a r as the war profits tax in Great Britain. As reasoning men we have only to ask ourselves:-Would nob the manufacturers and sellers of goods in poor unfortunate Belgium be satisfied to keep their business without making a loss, let alone making abnormal profits, The' same question could be asked of the people of Servia, Roumania, Montenegro, and of the invaded portion of France, the people of which are fighting for their lives at the present time. In the Homeland, too, apart from the ghouls and lish people, how many of those people who have been ruined, would have been content to retain their businesses without making profits? Yet the Treasurer proposes to tax war-time profits only to the extent of £1,000,000 in two years. It seems to me that somebody is seeking to The notice should control' the Government, and unless the Treasurer wisely agrees to an alteration of this tax the Government will in future have the reputation of having invited men in our midst to batten on the community and thin the faces of the poor. Ask any mother who controls the household how she is managing in the face of these in creased prices. Ask any father who has to struggle to keep a home for himself and his dependants.

We are entitled to them and sell the iron at a fair value, at ask what was the position of the public which the owners would have been content to sell them before the outbreak of war. I was struck with some words which abattoirs as it did ? And this is the type Demosthenes uttered at a time of war of men who are battening upon the people when cries for peace were echoing and raising prices. throughout the community, and some were calling for peace at any price., He said: I know well that anything given up in passing from war to peace is lost to the careless side; any one be astonished to read in to-morrow since, when people generally have once made morning's newspapers that the K in g of up their minds for peace, they will not renew Spain bad been shot, aud that Spain had the war for the sake of what has been sacrideclared for a Republic?

A proprietary company, under the Victorian law, may consist of only two or as many as fifty persons. Such companies, I understand, are not compelled to publish balance-sheets, but the Commissioner of Taxation can require them to supply him with them..

Tliat means, I take it , that the directors of a company, no matter how successful it may be, shall not receive fees exceeding a total of £1,000. Legal minds, however, can discover technicalities and loopholes whereby the State is often deprived of its rights. Let us suppose that A , B , C, and D form a proprietary company.

My only regret is that the people themselves cannot determine this question. If the men and women of Australia could vote upon it , there should be no exemptions. They would say, "" Let every profit made during this accursed war over and above the average profits of the two preceding years' be taken by the Treasury."" And the Government would earn honour by adopting that decision. Some time ago, when the Barrier mines threatened to close down, I brought before Mr Andrew Fisher, who was then Prime Minister, a proposal which I thought would save BrokenH ill . The Barrier, as we all know, depends upon the output of its mines. If there were no mines there, there would be no BrokenH ill to-day. Shortly after the outbreak of war I addressed a letter on the subject to the editor of the Age, and it was published on its war page. In that letter I advocated, as I do to-day, that the Commonwealth Government should take over all metals at the price at which they were being sold in England before the declaration of war. I pointed out that in consideration of the Government taking their output at the pre-war prices, In that If Owing to the many wounded should take over the mines and carry I gladly acquiesced, and Mr. Shopkeepers and others at Is. 4 4-5d. per oz.

It is perfectly clear that the meaI f Queensland can, by sure cannot deal with every known cause of excess profits. In many instances high profits made during the war have been made possible simply owing to the fact that, as in the case of shipping, there has been an unusual demand.' The members of the Opposition should recognise that high prices mled during the term of the Labour Government, and that they had just as good an opportunity as have the present Government of dealing w it h the matter. I consider that every man who has made excess profits during the war ought to be taxed pretty freely; and I TOgard the provisions of the B ill as generous.

J The honourable member for Melbourne (Dr. Maloney) read out a long string of figures which he regarded as showing excess profits; but these figures really conveyed no intelligent idea to the House as to where the profits came from. excess profits have been made to such an extent, then, apparently, the Treasurer's estimate is going to be considerably exceeded ; and I do not think there' is one of us who would regret to see huge sums rolling into the Treasury as a result of the tax.

264,Mr Rodgers (Wannon) [8.1],"S oWar-time Profits Tax of lending money but w ill escape paying a tax on the increased interest under the B ill . whether some of the great houses whose money lending is merely incidental to fche carrying on of their business will not escape this taxation. It is surely a fundamental error in principle that such a great increase should bake place in the value of money-a n increase incidental, of course, to the warand that the profits so made should nofc come within the scope of the B ill . Let us analyze a few cases. me take, by way of example, the position of tbe great insurance companies. Their business is not thafc of money lending. Their primary business is insurance, but we know that they are the great domi-' ciles of money in the Commonwealth. It is questionable, however, if they will come within the scope of the B ill . Then again, take the position of trustee companies. actions are but incidental to the carrying on of their business; yet they are fiduciary institutions which take the place of business men who do lend money. They will, however, not come within fche provisions of this measure. stance also the position of members, of the legal profession, who have the control of trust funds, but I do not expect thafc in that respect they should be dealt with as trustees. Let us come to another fortuitous type of man-the man who has finished the carrying on of his life's business. He liquidates his life's work, and decides to put his money into fche most stable form of security that he can obtain in Australia. invest in land. He purchases real estate; and lets it as landlord, but whether ifc be broad acres, residential properties, or business shops in the heart of the city, unless his business be solely that of a landlord buying and letting properties or dealing in land, I doubt very much whether he will come under this B ill . If the Governmenb conceive it to be the duty of those who, in war time, earn profits in excess of their pre-war returns, to contribute their quota of the money required for the carrying on of the war, then I say that, after making provision for the rectification of a few anomalies, there is no good reason why the whole of the non-combatants of Australia should not come into the fold of taxation. [15 AUGUST, 1917.] Assessment Bill. 1091 I cannot understand what justification there is for the exemption of individuals It is very questionable also or groups of individuals. We have laid it down-and I am one who believes in fche principle-fchaf c when a nation is at war all its resources should be organized for the conduct of thab war. That principle has been put to the test recently, so far as the man-power of Australia is concerned. I regard that as only a section of the obligation that' the country owes. The man-power is one section, but all the other resources of the country Let should be marshalled and pub at the disposal of the country. I am not satisfied with this B ill , and as I have already said, I do not believe it was conceived in tihe mind of the Treasurer. I regard ib as the adopted son of the party. In my judgment, it is a misfit* intended to apply only to a section of those who are earning war-time profits. Their money-lending transmember strike out all exemptions ? honourable member's question in this way: In 1914-the year when the war broke out-thi s country suffered one of the most I might in devastating droughts in its history. As the result of that drought, I believe we lost, ab the very least, £100,000,000 by reason of exhaustion of stock and nonproduction of produce of all descriptions. The very face of the earth was bare and unyielding. I would, go ithe length of saying thafc all who suffered from the drought should have a fixed period for recovery, so far as this B ill is concerned. In the case of such people, however, this B ill practically proposes to tax capital in In other words, he decides to stead of earnings, or what would really be income in the period of recovery. I do nob propose afc this stage to discuss the machinery of the B ill ; a more suitable opportunity will offer when the measure is in Committee. Like the honourable member for Flinders( Sir William Irvine), I think the Government are proposing t'o place an impossible task in the hands of the gentleman who is to administer this law. The House is nofc attempting to define it's object. Under the B i ll it is not a war profit, nor is it a wartime profit that we are proposing to tax in respect of fche whole of the people of Australia. TheB ill is so drawn that any sensible person looking at it , and knowing anything of the commercial, financial, and rural interests of the Commonwealth must recognise that grave",34,William Irvine W H A T Is Your Times Has Been Sold F O R £300 000 And The

266,Mr Rodgers,"I shall answer theinjustices are going to be done under it . The Commissioner is to be given very wide powers. The National Government has been very fortunate, since the inception of it i direct taxation policy, in having as its Taxation Commissioner a man so eminent and so broad-minded as was the late Commissioner. In his successor-the gentleman who is to-day filling his placethe Government have a very capable, able, and earnest officer, who 1 believe will give the taxpayers a fair deal. But the time may, and will come, no doubt, when the Treasurer, beginning to find that he is getting short of money, w ill think that too liberal a construction is perhaps p u t upon the Act by the Commissioner administering it . The Commissioner w ill then be elbowed to secure more revenue from this source, and, in my judgment, his interpretation of the law may becomeless favorable. This Parliament ought to be capable of declaring what it Sets out to do. L e t it make known its intentions in clearer and more definite language than is employed in this measure. Asi t stands, the B ill is imperfect. It is not right that a Minister should pass over his responsibility to the Commissioner to such an extent as is here proposed. If the B ill goes through in its present form, the whole burden of responsibility will be placed on the Commissioner. The responsibility is one which Parliament should take/ We should be more specific and definite in stating what we seek to accomplish. Sir WILLIAMIRVINE sponsibility upon him, without any guiding principle. great powers are chiefly in respect of new businesses. wider powers in relation to other matters. Under one provision he has power practically to use his own discretion. "" capital "" in the B ill . that definition is altogether wrong, and that if it be allowed to stand it w ill cause grave injustice to many. Clause 16 provides thatThe amount of the capital of a business shall be taken to be the amount of its capital paid up by the owner in money or in kind, together with all accumulated profits invested in the business, with the addition or subtraction of balances brought forward from previous years to the credit or debit respectively of profit and loss account. If the B ill remains as it is, what' will be the position of those in business? They will get only the benefit of the 10 per cent, exemption in regard to their own capital in the business. The very world revolves on public credit; nation lives on nation, and"" individuals on one another; and it is the custom for the fortunate man to lend to his less fortunate brothers. The taxing master knows that many of the great business undertakings of this citv could not survive for half a year if the borrowed capital were with-' drawn. A f u l l allowance of 10 per cent, should be allowed on all capital in a business. I must say that, in my judgment, the Treasurer, as far as the B ill w ill allow him, has shown a disposition to meet practically every interest which he believes has a genuine grievance. I , .along with other honourable members, have brought some cases under his notice, and he has given us most considerate treatment; and what I complain of is that the B ill , as constructed, will not permit him to do justice. In respect of capital, 10 per cent, is allowed by the Treasurer, and honourable members, particularly those opposite, say that that is excessive. To-day the value of ""money, apart altogether from in vestments in business, is from 6 | per cent, to 7 per cent, on overdraft. There is a margin of 3 per cent, for the risk of carrying on the business, for losses, and It leaves the refor management; and that is a very small sum in a great commercial community. Commissioner's stuck to the 6 per cent, and 7 per cent, that anomaly would not exist injustice would occur, and I congratulate the Treasurer on recognising that industries cannot go ahead without some in ducements. very good inducement. Half the industries are not earning 8 per cent. honourable member's position so much the worse, because the business man gets no margin at all, practically, for carrying on the business. A man with no risks, no organization to provide for, and no industrial troubles, gets the benefit of 6 per cent, and 7 per cent., while, in the",35,William Irvine W H A T Is Your Times Has Been Sold F O R £300 000 And The

In England, Mr Lloyd Georre, with a view to the delivery of the war goods at the earliest possible moment, gave an excessive reward for the provision of munitions and equipment, and got back a fair portion by taxation. We must recognise that a tremendous financial exhaustion .has gone on in every country, and we are still in the middle of a great / war, the end of which no one can see. As the B ill is We here, however, have not yet felt this devastating exhaustion of capital, because we are living on an artificial inflation of internal credit. ^ But we must reach the stage when we must either continue to carry on under these artificial conditions, or come back to financial soundness and stability I take it that the Treasurer wishes t q see new wealth created in order to make Under the proposal of the honup for this exhaustion and to meet our enormous interest debt. Further, we have to remember that 350,000 to 400,000 men will have to be restored to citizen life, and this will cost a large amount of money. This Parliament has two great -, obligations: first, to keep the men backed up on the battlefields, and, secondly, to compensate them reasonably for what they have done on their return. To meet the circumstances the wheels of every industry, rural and secondary, must spin at top pace.

Personally, I think that the portion of the f a r m which, for the time being, is under agriculture will be exempt, while the balance carrying stock will be liable. In appearance there is an agricultural exemption, but in reality there is not, because in respect to the very horses he breeds and uses for agriculture the B ill will apply. mers of the country are as patriotic as any other section. fighting our battle, and they have their hardships, but, providing they are given a period of, say, two years o r . more to recover from drought, they are prepared to pay their proper share of taxation.

I never object to a man making a good profit providing that he employs it m his business, which, in t u r n , gives employment to the people of the country. That is one-of the reasons why I never object, under the policy of Protection, to a manufacturer getting a good profit. You would never have the bigger wheel of industry if you stinted the manufacturer. If we keep people down to a very low margin of profit we shall never obtain the big producing, commercial, and industrial effort necessary to carry us over the war period without substantial loss. If the B ill restricts profits to the pre-war 1 standard, the effect will be the very opposite to what we want. We must make up for the tremendous war losses, and make provision to absorb the fighting men when they come back. To do that, industry must be stimulated.

Let me give him a specific instance. Many people of necessity, and by the encouragement of all Governments, set to work to obtain increased production from the land. Every Parliament called out to these rural men to increase their production. Many, impelled by the necessity of drought losses secured credit to buy stock. One man lost £7,000 during the drought. He borrowed capital to restock. Those who were concerned in it used all their activities to get' him the right class of stock, and to get it cheap. He recovered in the first year over £4,000 net. His previous pre-war standard for the very highest of the six years allowed was £1,200. six years he will get two that were pretty good. six years that the right honourable gentleman allows him to roam over and pick from was one which gave him £1,200.

As the honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr Watt) has said, a man who is taxed tries his best to find some other shoulders on which to place the burden, and, as a rule, is successful in his quest, As a rule, the man on the land cannot pass-on his taxation. The Age article to which I have referred readsThe time is steadily approaching when the Government of the Commonwealth will have to choose between continuing its present policy, which is intrinsically a policy of strike promotion and the creation of general tumult and disorder, and adopting a policy scientifically calculated to banish discontent, that is to say, a general policy of price fixing. Unless the Government do something soon in regard to price fixing, the state of discontent predicted in that article, and the picture presented by the writer in the English Review, w ill manifest themselves in our midst, and w ill extend to every seotion of the community, because people in all classes of life are groaning under a load of taxation which they cannot longer bear, simply because the taxes imposed by the Federal and State Parliaments, and by other authorities, are being continually passed on to the general mass of the people. pessimistic view? view.

AlthoughI do not agree with many of the provisions in ithis Bill, I must confess that, notwithstanding that we in Australia have not had big war contracts for munitions, we have had bigwar contracts for wool and woollen goods, for clothing, and other commodities; and the suppliers of those goods, as well as others in the trading community, have made during war-time very big profits. made thousands of pounds, the American manufacturers have made profits of millions. is no reason why, with a proper system of war profits taxation, we should not tax those thousands. I think the figures in the last New Zealand Budget „will show a proposed increase of nearly £5,000,000 in taxation; and although ithe war profits tax has been repealed, the Government are proposing other taxation which will be perhaps even heavier than that which has been withdrawn. the New Zealand Government will have special provisions in those new taxes to deal with the people who have made big profits in war time. was abandoned in New Zealand because of unequal treatment and the cost of collection. creation of a costly Department for the administration of this tax. The existing Taxation Department has been successful in handling other new taxes, and I dare say this tax can be administered by it with the addition of a few extra officers. The imposition of this tax should not require the appointment of additional highly-salaried officers. Several attempts have been made to discount the importance of. the figures produced by Sir Alexander Peacock in the Victorian Legislative Assembly showing the extent to which certain incomes have increased in thisState. am not a political admirer of that honourable gentleman, I think he would be the last man in the Victorian Parliament to try to mislead it, and as Treasurer of the Statei t is only reasonable to assume that he is well acquainted with its financial operations. cumstances may not find a counterpart in all the other States, but the position in one State is very often a fair index of what is going on in the others. At pages 91-2-3 of' No. 2 of the Victorian Parliamentary Debates of the present session, certain figures cited by Sir Alexander Peacock in the course of a want-of-confidence debate are given. The Leader of the Opposition has already quoted some of the figures given by Sir Alexander Peacock, and they have been amplified by the honourable member for Melbourne (Dr. Maloney). and of no value. honourable member. The honourable member for Kooyong( Sir Robert Best) admitted a few moments ago that Australia in no way compares with either the TJnited States of America or Great Britain in regard to the manufacture of munitions and the profits arising therefrom. That being so, from a business point of view the ordinary trade and industry of the Commonwealth since the outbreak of the war must have been purNo doubt, suing more or less the even tenor of its way. During that time prices have materially increased. Woollen goods, for instance, have doubled inprice. Some one must have obtained the benefit of these increases. Then again, we bave required clothing for our men at the front, and although at present part of the Exhibition Building is practically filled with the products of our woollen mills member say that the price of wool has doubled since the war? particularly to the prices of woollen goods, such as flannels, which are double what they were in 1911. In 1912, according to Sir Alexander Peacock, there were in Victoria 1,056 taxable persons or companies with revenues or salaries of £2,200 and over, and in 1915-16 the number had increased to 1,362. In 1912 the total income of these persons or companies, whose revenues or salaries WhilstI amounted to £2,200 and over, was £7,712,000; in 1913 it was £9,439,000; in 1914, £9,436,000; in 1915, £9,599,000; and in 1915-16, £9,481,000.

We have heard figures from the Leader of the Opposition and the honourable member for Melbourne (Dr. Maloney), supplemented, to a certain extent, by the honourable member for Maribyrnong ( Mr Fenton), indicating that, in Victoria alone, incomes have risen enormously. If those figures have been prepared on a fair basis, and are correct, will those'profits not come within the operation of this B ill ? The year 1914, as all who are connected with the country JOHN FORREST -Thos e who say in any way must! know, was one of the very worse years Victoria ever went through. not bear out your statement, for it shows that 1902-3 was a worse year.

377,Mr Manifold,"In the Westernthis, the industry to-day would have been in a very poor way. Some honourable members opposite have made speeches, nob dealing with war profits taxation, but with the fixation of the prices of commodities, and the reduction cf the cost of living. It is perfectly well known that the great rise in the price of meat has been caused to a very large extent by the drought. owing to the great losses that occurred during the calving period; and if it is desired to fix prices, we should fix the price of the unborn calf, and varying figures for the one-year-old, the two-year-old, and so forth . It is idle to suppose that any attempt to fix the price of beef will have any effect in reducing it . Victoria does not. breed anything like sufficient cattle to keep the Melbourne market alone going, and stock has to be brought from other States at enormous cost. I am, not now interested in cattle in any of the States, so that I can speak with some freedom. I have seen cattle coming down in a very low condition, at a cost to the graziers of £ 1 9 a head, and although they were a decent kind of bullock, the graziers will never get their money back. . They have to go to New England and the Queensland border to buy stock, because it is impossible otherwise to get whab is required for the Victorian market. I shall leave the question of the profits made by warehousemen to other members to deal with, but I believe those profits have been enormous, and that they wiU be dealt with under this B ill . Those interested in woollen mills and kindred industries have also made large profits; and I cannot see why honourable members opposite are not prepared to tax them by means of this measure, the opposition to which, so far as I can see, comes largely from the friends of the manufacturers. I do' not think that very much revenue will be derived from the rural industries, especially in the more settled portions of Australia, but a fair amount will be realized, if tbe Bill remains in its present form, from leasehold properties in other States, more particularly in Queensland. I am interested in a leasehold property in that State, though I am not engaged in breeding cattle. I had my lesson in the cattle industry some years ago on a property on the Gulf; and I remember that it did not matter whether we sold or did not sell, we never had more than 5,000 head. When things got very bad indeed, and we found there were only a few bullocks of five years old fit for market, we boiled the lot down, horns and all, and only realized 17s. 6d. per head. A t the present time, as I say, I am not in the cattle ifcrade, but am interested in wool. I am not growling at As to beef, the rise is the proposed taxation as it affects wool, because the wool-grower gets his money and the profits. cent -that is, woollen goods have. know, an increase of 50 per cent, in the price of some kinds of wool compared with the pre-war rates; but in the case of other grades ithe increase has been nothing like that. In any case, even if wool generally had increased in price to that extent, it would be perfectly fair to take some of the increase back in taxation. Much wool in rthe Commonwealth is bringing a lower price to-day than it was prior to the war. If wool does not fall into one particular grade, and has to drop to a lower one, it brings 3d. per lb. less. I am not complaining of that; but it is a hardship that has to be borne. What will really be taxed will not be the increased profit on the wool, but the increased output on the property. If a man was shearing 5,000 sheep prior to the war, and, by cultivation or other means, is now able to carry 6,000, the whole of the return from the 1,000 sheep is to be taxed, and that,. I submit, is not fair. If , however, the increased price per lb. of the wool was taxed, it would be a fair proposition. I should like to deal more particularly with the question of cattle stations, of which I know something, in Queensland. In the case of one property on the Northern Territory boundary in Queensland, a start was made, when the drought began, with 17,000 head, and when the drought had finished there were 1,700. It was then felt to be no good carrying on the work under the then circumstances, and it was decided to go in for improvements. Fencing wire was carted to the property afc a cost of £ 4 0 per ton, and a considerable amount of water was provided. In 1913-14 the proprietors were branding 2,000 calves, and. in 1915-17 6,000 calves, an increase of 4,000. Under the B ill as it is now, this",46,William Irvine W H A T Is Your Times Has Been Sold F O R £300 000 And The

The assessment is not made on the market value, or on the stock that is sold, but on the calves which are branded and many never see the market. people were h it with another drought, they would have no profit at all. This property consists of country which does not carry very much stock. There are 8,000 head of cows, 6,000 one-year old and 3,000 four-year old bullocks fit to sell, with 1,000 others, or 30,000 in a l l . They sell fro m 3,000 to 4,000 cattle off fche property per year. A few cows, also, are ""sold, but the loss that takes place among the cows from time to time nearly wipes that item out altogether. Under the proposed tax these people would have fco pay war-time profit taxation on a profit of £32,000, for calves and one-year-' olds which may never see the market. That is a book profit only. Those are the kind of people we want to encourage to go out into this country. A f t e r paying their war profits tax, it would pay them very much better to take the whole of their 30,000 head of cattle off the place altogether, bring them down to the markets, and sell them, and leave the country vacant, because they would get fro m £120,000 to £130,000 for them. That is the sort of proposition you have to look to as regards the development of Australia. The value of leasehold property away out in this country is simply the value of the stock, and these people would be perfectly justified in selling the whole of their stock and throwing the property back on the hands of the Government if the R ill passes in its present shape. herds be brought up to a certain standard before the people can look for a reduction in.tlie price of meat? orable member toured Victoria he would find it almost impossible to buy any store or four-year-old cattle bred in Victoria, because of the drought period in which all the calves were lost. The only place we can get them from is Queensland, and there we are, to a certain extent, shufc out. a lot of female sheep and cattle in 1914 ? fchey had to k ill off the old ewes i h thousands to save the younger and more valuable ewes fchat were coming on. for food?

The Queensland meat is commandeered at a certain price. It is very hard for the exporter to get hold of beef in this country, but he can get a certain amount of lambs. Beefi n Queensland prior to .the outbreak of the war was worth about 20s. per cwt., altliough it was pretty hard to get 20s. The last big sales which have taken, place in Queensland have been at about 37s. 6 d . , . with a bonus of 2s. 6d. per cwt., making about £ 2 per cwt. The war profit is the difference between £ 1 per cwt. and £ 2 per cwt. and the offal are worth considerably more. The hide to-day is worth over £ 2 10s. fche cattle is nofc getting it . sumer has to pay it . prices at places which are not quite on the railway line in Queensland.

If he makes a profit of only £100 on one business, and a considerable wartime profit on the other, he has to pay the tax on the second, and is allowed no deduction for the other; but if he makes a loss on the one business, and a taxable profit on the other, he is allowed a deduction. I contend that unless he earns the percentage on both businesses he ought to be allowed to deduct one from the The present Treasurer ( Sir John other, or amalgamate the two businesses, provided that both are carried on on the same lines.

He may be a splendid accountant, but he knows nothing about war. 1 do not think there is a man or woman in Australia who believes his vile insinuations against General Murray. him to prove this statement. General Murray is known as one'of the most dashing soldiers under the English flag. Has he not been given a certain duty because he is a man of resource, quick to act in moments of danger? Has not a town in Palestine surrendered to him, though I beUeve that he has since retired? When a gimcrack brigadier-general casts a slur tin a soldier, he should prove his words. I think that Wellington would have had any man shot who dared to say that he would prefer to sacrifice five men for one ' other man of .the same race.
