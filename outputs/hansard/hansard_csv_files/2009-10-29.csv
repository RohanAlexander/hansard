246,The Speaker,"I thank the ministerThursday, 29 October 2009 ----Mr Cliff Dohle late Cliff Dohle, a former constituent of mine and Vietnam veteran. I first spoke in this House in 2006, when I called for a re-examination of the Long Tan medals issue. Cliff was one of the great heroes of the Battle of Long Tan. He was a helicopter pilot who risked his life, defied orders and replenished the Australian troops in the middle of that battle. Without his action, the story of Long Tan would be a very different one today. Cliff died in February this year. This week the government announced that it was accepting a recommendation of its new tribunal to award Cliff the Distinguished Service Medal, the contemporary equivalent award of the Distinguished Flying Cross, the original award for which he was recommended in 1966. Cliff Dohle is one of the great stories in history for Australia in the Vietnam conflict. It has been a difficult period in history for all of those who fought in the Battle of Long Tan. TodayI wish to confine my remarks to Cliff’s role. I got to know Cliff very well. He was very keen to see this issue resolved. I know he would be very happy with the outcome for himself, but of course he would be very concerned about the outcome for all people who were in the Battle of Long Tan. That was a pivotal battle and it is the battle after which Vietnam Veterans Day is named. Cliff was one of the quiet heroes that you so often see. He lived a quiet life in Lilydale. His wife, whom I spoke to yesterday, was very happy with the result. It gives the Dohle family some closure on the issue and it closes a chapter that has been open for a long time. He served this nation with distinction. He was very proud to serve this nation. The Australian nation needs to celebrate the contribution of Cliff Dohle and that entire generation who fought in Vietnam on our behalf and who endured such difficulty on their return. Holt Electorate: Narre Community Learning Centre Ms Emily Kilpatrick retary for Trade) (9.34 am)-I would like to endorse the eloquent remarks made by the member for Casey on that matter. It is a great pleasure to be able to speak today about the Narre Community Learning Centre, a great learning centre in my electorate, and its annual high achiever awards. I had the honour a few weeks ago of attending these awards. The Narre Community Learning Centre is an organisation that provides new pathways of learning and provides alternative opportunities in life for people who go through those pathways. Headed by its chief executive officer, Wayne Hewitt, Narre Community Learning Centre helps people to undertake vocational training in areas like computer courses for over 50s, certificates in business, aged-care work, first aid, and health and well-being courses.

It is a registered training organisation that provides a very valuable and needed service to the whole electorate. The centre also has programs for adult learners, such as certificates in adult education, that have later-year high school equivalence. In this context, the Australian government was able to provide just under $1.5 million recently for the Narre Community Learning Centre to construct new educational facilities and additional training space to meet the high demands that the centre experiences. I want to focus on a very extraordinary young person that I met at the high achiever awards, a young constituent of mine called Emily Kilpatrick. She was awarded the 2009 Courtney Park Memorial Youth of the Year award, which is named in honour of Courtney Park, a 70-year-old who died in 2006 after suffering from an asthma attack. Emily’s mum was also at the awards. Emily was enrolled in the year 10 equivalent certificate II course in adult education at Narre. This young person, at 16, is about to become a mother, and she has endured significant other difficulties and hurdles in her life. But, due to the quality and incredible strength of this young woman, she has never used the challenges that she faces as an excuse to neglect her education. She shows great maturity, great strength and great courage and determination in her approach to life and to her studies, and as a result has completed her certificate II in adult education. Emily is a wonderful example of what can be achieved by a young person. She is a wonderful young person with a tremendous work ethic, a work ethic that has been very pervasive, rubbing off on her classmates, among whom she has formed a reputation as someone who is always willing to lend a helping hand. Even through pregnancy and illness, Emily has strived to ensure that she is educated and she is setting up opportunities in her life.

On that day, the governments of Armenia and Turkey reached agreement about future diplomatic relations. The two governments signed a protocol in Zurich and, while the details have aroused controversy on all sides, I am quietly hopeful that we may see the beginning of a more normal bilateral relationship between Turkey and Armenia.

250,Mr Hawke (Mitchell) (9.38 Am),"I rise this morning to speak up on behalf of the StI know that everyone in this place will be familiar with the tragedy and misery faced by millions of Armenians and others during and after the First World War as the Ottoman Empire collapsed and modern Turkey was created. Indeed, so serious were the mass killings and deportation of Armenians that 20 countries around the world have officially recognised these events as genocide. I have heard first hand accounts from members of the Armenian diaspora in my electorate. Invariably the stories are from older Armenians now settled in Australia, desperately sad tales of loss of homeland and family. The pain is in their faces, in their language and in their songs, and each year, on 24 April, Armenians gather for what to them is one of the most important days to remember past wrongs. But now, with the October protocol, there is the hope-just the hope-of something different. It is an agreement to start internal political consultations in two areas: the establishment of diplomatic relations and the development of bilateral relations. Significantly, Armenia and Turkey also agreed to form a historical commission which will investigate the tragic events of World War I. I welcome this first step in what has been a long history of tragedy and hostility. I say that, but at the same time. I recognise there has not been any universal welcome for this protocol. I recognise and deeply respect the concerns of many Armenians and Turks-both here in Australia and overseas-about the signing of this agreement. The events of 1915 cannot be erased. But I note in particular the comments of the Turkish foreign minister who said in the Turkish parliament only a short time ago: We aim at reconciliation between Turkish and Armenian communities in the diaspora and at opening healthy communication channels through the elimination of exploitation based on historical sufferings. I note as well the comments of Armenian President Sargsyan, who said just prior to the signing of the protocol: It’s important that our nations are able to establish normal relations. This protocol has the support of the Australian government, as well as the United States, the EU, France, Russia and Slovenia. The protocol sends a message to the world that understanding between peoples burdened by tragic pasts is possible, and I hope that this dialogue of resolution between the Turkish and Armenian government continues with civility. (Time expired) Forrest Electorate: World Stroke Day Ms MARINO (Forrest) (10.21 am)-Today is World Stroke Day, which is an ideal opportunity to increase the awareness of stroke and highlight how we can recognise and remember the signs of stroke. Stoke is an interruption to the blood flow to the brain, which then prevents that section of the brain from receiving a continuing supply of oxygen, which in turn damages that section of the brain itself, preventing it from controlling the particular area’s body function. Stroke is Australia’s second-biggest killer and a leading cause of disability which costs the health system approximately $2.14 billion each year. The theme for World Stroke Day 2009 is ‘Stroke, what can I do?’ This is an important question as 60,000 strokes are expected to occur in Australia in 2009-one in every 10 minutes. The theme has been developed to encourage everybody in the community-individuals, groups and governments-to take action against strokes. Lives can be saved by learning the signs, knowing what can cause a stroke and what can be done to reduce the possibility of a MAIN COMMITTEE stroke. So today in Parliament House you can assess your risk by getting your blood pressure checked, and I would encourage all members to do so. I would also take this opportunity to mention the efforts of the Bunbury and Districts Stroke Support Group within my electorate of Forrest. The group provides important and very much appreciated service and support, helping stroke survivors regain self-confidence and fills the need for carers, family and friends to learn about adapting to the new situation that arises after strokes. The group achieves this by sharing experiences, learning how others cope with various problems, actively helping each other and making each other laugh-so important. I endorse the work of the Bunbury and Districts Stroke Support Group in support of World Stroke Day, which urges everyone, including members of this House, to take personal action to reduce the devastating impact of strokes. I also take this last minute to recognise a very dear friend and wonderful community person in my electorate Jenny Fry, who suffered a stroke in recent times. Jenny, a very articulate, confident person, very active, has had to deal with a number of challenges in recent months. She has done this with extreme dignity. She has taken this, as she does with everything, full on. She is giving it her best shot and she is really working overtime to try to manage the effects. She can no longer articulate; she is incredibly frustrated by the fact that she cannot articulate the thoughts in her mind and make them come out in the way that she intends. She is a very brave woman. I encourage her and her husband, Peter, and all of those not only in my electorate, but around Australia who have and will suffer stroke, the very best of support in your efforts to regain your quality of life after you have suffered a stroke. Melbourne Ports Electorate: Ms Derryn Tal a Sydney artist who won the Trevisan International Art Award in Ferrara, Italy, on Saturday last. Derryn’s success is no small achievement. Her exhibit was one of 80 presented by a very competitive field of artists from all over the world. It is interesting that many Australian artists often have to win prizes overseas before their talent is recognised here in Australia. Yet Derryn’s triumph in northern Italy does not surprise me. Derryn has rapidly been making a name for herself in the art world. As an abstract contemporary artist she specialises in mixed media painting. Her media ranges from acrylics to oil glazes to bitumen. As well as painting, Derryn’s creativity spans photography, collage, sculpture and rug design. She has also illustrated children’s books and calendars. Furthermore, Derryn has explored the use of petals and leaves in her art to create a range of delicate flower prints. Many people around this country know of her creative designs with rugs. Her husband’s very well known business, Designer Rugs, has very famous rugs throughout this building and many of the famous hotels in this country. Their designs in no small part are due to Derryn’s creativity. As well as Derryn’s other creative interests, she specialises in Jewish art and has a diverse range of truly unique Jewish prints. People who visit my office will see the very gracious painting that I received from the Tal family as a wedding gift. It is one of the examples of the art that I was just talking about. Derryn won the Australian International Youth Year stamp competition as well as the photographic competition with her horoscope photogram prints. Derryn is exhibited in both Sydney and Melbourne, and I am sure her award in Italy is the first of many international awards. I attended her Melbourne exhibition, which was a great success, and I celebrated her success in Italy with my dear friend Mr Yosi Tal, her husband, MAIN COMMITTEE",143,Constituency Statements
251,Mr Danby (Melbourne Ports) (10.24 Am),"I rise today to speak in praise of Derryn Tal,with whom I have been friends since university; and with her children, Alon, Rami and Shani, who are outstanding achievers in themselves, Alon being school captain of Masada College. We all look forward to Derryn having further exhibitions all around the world. The success in Ferrara is great credit to her, to Australia and to her art, and I hope it brings her the further recognition in this country that she duly deserves. Macarthur Electorate: Ms Virginia Walters Virginia Walters-a wonderful person in my community, a lovely young lady who finds herself, as a single mother through no fault of her own, trying to cope with raising four children on her own. The ages of three of her children are 17, 13 and nine. She has a young son called Michael. Michael is disabled. He is seven years old. Michael has cerebral palsy. He is also vision impaired, is totally reliant on tube feeding, has cataracts in both eyes and, finally, has neuropathy. I wish to speak to this House about her because she is in desperate need of a motor vehicle which can allow her to transport her family around and which has wheelchair access. I raise this issue in this House because there are so many people who try so hard to make a go of things in their life, but it seems like they have bad luck on their side and they have so much difficulty trying to get the support of various government departments. Virginia is such a person, one who has fallen through the cracks of the New South Wales state government’s health system. Unfortunately, she is seemingly unable to qualify for any financial support in this regard. Consequently, she is battling on. She has gone back to university and she is trying to study law because she wants to be able to make a difference to other people who find themselves in the same position. She walks to the university each day. She organises for carers to help her out with her family at her own expense. She does her best to try to make ends meet, to try to survive and to try to do the best for her family, but unfortunately, she cannot do it alone. I am working as hard as I possibly can to try to raise some funds for her so that we can get her a motor vehicle that has wheelchair access, but I cannot do it alone. I need the support of my constituents and of the wider circles and I need a sympathetic ear from government to look at where we fail in our policies, both in New South Wales and even federally, for these people who are trying so hard just to survive from day to day-people who do their best to try to make others’ lives a little bit better. As I mentioned earlier on, through no fault of hers Michael was born to Virginia and she is doing her best to try to make his life the best that she possibly can. But unfortunately, it is not easy. SoI call on the federal government and the state governments alike to work together with the health system in New South Wales to try to improve it for people like Virginia Walters. Petrie Electorate: Redcliffe State High School Mrs D’ATH (Petrie) (10.30 am)-It is my pleasure today to congratulate the 15 students of the QUTeach@Redcliffe program who graduated on Tuesday night at Redcliffe State High School. Eleven of the students who graduated that night were from Redcliffe State High School, with two from Clontarf Beach State High School and two from Deception Bay State High School. The QUTeach program is a fantastic program. The program is directly aimed at students wanting to become teachers. This program allows their university studies to commence in year 11. QUTeach@Redcliffe is part of the students’ senior education and training MAIN COMMITTEE",145,Constituency Statements
252,Mr Farmer (Macarthur) (10.27 Am),"I rise today to speak about a constituent of mine,plan and contributes two advanced credits per semester towards their Queensland Certificate of Education. The students study at Redcliffe State High School after school, two days each week, rather than having to travel elsewhere as earlier early-entry pathways required. Redcliffe High teachers are the tutors for the QUTeach program and are supported by Queensland University of Technology Faculty of Education staff to deliver the course. The program is run in a class format as opposed to being individually targeted. This ensures that the students have support from their peers as well as their teachers. Students attend the Queensland University of Technology campus for one day each semester to get a feel for university life. This provides a transition for students as they enter university knowing they have successfully completed three course units and understand how university operates. QUT have waived all tuition fees. Students pay only for print materials. Students have a QUT student card and they have access to all the facilities of QUT and receive all their lectures and tutorial notes online. The 15 students who graduated this week have completed three semester units of their teaching degree. All of these students have received guaranteed entry into any QUT Start course-an exceptional achievement. These students started university in year 11, a significant achievement. By studying at Redcliffe State High School, these students have not had to face the barrier of transportation to university. Although the school’s teachers and QUT lecturers have supported these students, they have completed the real university course just like any other university student. I am sure that their parents are extremely proud of their achievements, as are the principals: Redcliffe State High School’s Shona McKinlay, Clontarf Beach State High School’s John Bray and Deception Bay State High School’s Jim Box. The program is so successful that they have received a $50,000 grant from the NAB Schools First Impact awards to enhance the program. I congratulate all of the schools for being involved, and of course a special acknowledgement goes to Shona McKinlay and the teachers of Redcliffe State High School for establishing this program and getting students and parents engaged. The opportunity to start an education degree in year 11 is a fantastic one and it deserves to be acknowledged in this House. Leichhardt Electorate: Community Facilities stone in an election commitment I made on behalf of the Rudd government to the community of Cooktown and surrounding communities including Hopevale, Wujal Wujal and Lakeland Downs. These communities have been working for over 10 years to secure funding for a community events centre and to have it located on Airservices Australia navigation beacon land. The former Cook Shire Council, led by Bob Sullivan, was active in working to this end, as have been the new mayor and council led by Peter Scott. In the lead-up to the last election, I was proud to have been the first to make a federal election commitment of $1.5 million towards this project. This issue of the Airservices Australia land, though, had never been able to be resolved by the former Liberal member. One of the first things I did on getting elected was to contact the council and secure previous correspondence between the council, the former member and Airservices Australia, who owned the land where the community wanted the centre built. I set to work to understand what had happened in the past and began working with the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government, Mr Albanese, with Airservices Australia MAIN COMMITTEE",146,Constituency Statements
253,Mr Turnour (Leichhardt) (10.33 Am),"I rise today to speak about a significant mileand with the Cook Shire Council to secure the land for the community. Following on from this there were very constructive negotiations between the council and Airservices Australia and the site was secured. This was a significant achievement as previous councils, federal members and Airservices Australia could never secure a deal, although there had been plenty of discussions and correspondence. I would like to thank Mayor Peter Scott for the constructive way in which he worked with me and Airservices Australia to secure the land for the community. I would also like to thank Minister Albanese, his aviation adviser Antony Sachs and Airservices Australia for the support that they have given to me and the community. I was very pleased to announce this week that the beacon has now been moved so that work can begin on the centre. There was still a shortfall of money for the centre, so, working again with the council, we were able to secure another $1.5 million from the Rudd government’s Jobs Fund toward the project. In the search for more funding, both the mayor and I discussed with Jo Townsend, principal of the Cooktown State School, the possibility of the school becoming a partner in the project through a commitment of $2 million from the Rudd government’s Building the Education Revolution funding. The site is adjacent to the school, and the school desperately needs a good multipurpose hall. I can now confirm that the Rudd government has approved this. The federal government is now committing $5 million towards this project: a $1.5 million election commitment, $1.5 million from the Jobs Fund and $2 million of funding from the Building the Education Revolution. The state has committed $3 million-and I congratulate the state member for Cook, Jason O’Brien, for the work that he has done on the project-and the council $1.5 million, bringing the total project to $9.5 billion. I want to congratulate the community for the work they have done over the past 10 years to bring this project to fruition. It is a credit to past and present councils and the broader community. I would particularly like to pay tribute to Peter Scott, the Mayor of the Cook Shire Council, and his point person, Sian Nivison, who has been working for many, many years for the council to bring this facility to fruition. And of course I thank Jo Townsend, the principal of Cooktown State School, for becoming a partner in this project. I am looking forward to the start of construction next year on a fantastic community facility. Cooktown and the region can finally have a world-class community facility that will be a multipurpose hall, training centre and cyclone shelter. It goes to show what can be achieved when all levels of government and the community pull together to work towards a shared vision. Werriwa Electorate: Autism thanks to the Rudd Labor government for selecting Liverpool as one of the six locations to establish an early autism development centre. When we started looking at the issue of autism in our communities, I had the opportunity to work with a lot of my local organisations. I discovered that, in New South Wales, 50 per cent of families that live with autism reside in the south-west of Sydney. I hasten to add that this has nothing to do with our water supply or the air that we breathe. I think it is probably more to do with the property values, because people who live with autism do it pretty tough financially, and, as a consequence, issues of property values and living in more affordable areas of Sydney become quite significant. The other very tragic thing that I learnt about living with autism is that very few families survive it. Most of the families I see that live with autism are single-parent families, and the MAIN COMMITTEE",147,Constituency Statements
254,Mr Hayes (Werriwa) (10.36 Am),"I take the opportunity to place on record my deepsingle parent is most often the mother. Indeed, a woman I had the opportunity to employ in my office, Vicky Meadows, has a profoundly disabled daughter. It is one of those things that I think is important for all of us members. When we are elected into this place we do not exactly take matters from people off the street, only if it concerns federal Constitution based issues. Something that Vicky brings to my office is a sense of caring for all people with disability. It is not simply bringing sympathy into the equation; she genuinely empathises because she lives it day in and day out. SoI am one of those very fortunate members who have the opportunity to have a person like Vicky Meadows working for me. The community in Western Sydney has very strong autism advocacy these days, and I pay particular tribute to Grace Fava and what she has been able to achieve in the south-west of Sydney. Grace and her husband have two boys who suffer from autism. I see what they go through and I appreciate the time that they put in not only on their own behalf but on behalf of all other members of the community who are similarly suffering the effects of autism, which are significant. My grandson suffers from autism. He is a very bright and able young kid, but from time to time he has an episode which throws a classroom out of its routine. We need to come to terms with these things. We need to assist not only those who live with autism but those members of our community who care about it. On behalf of the community members of the south-west of Sydney, I am very pleased to be a member of a government that is able to take the initiative and show leadership in autism in the south-west of Sydney. National School Chaplaincy Program the past week I have received countless emails from parents, teachers and school chaplains regarding the future of the National School Chaplaincy Program. I know it is a widespread feeling across the community that schools are among our society’s key institutions. We recognised this as the former government, and that is the reason why we decided to support the National School Chaplaincy Program, because we believed that it was crucial to instil in young Australians, in our children, a sense of value and well-being and to nurture their spirituality. Over the past 2½ years, federal funding has been in place to support schools in this regard with the National School Chaplaincy Program. In my electorate alone, 12 schools have received funding totalling some $720,000 to support the vital work that school chaplains do in nurturing young Australians on their path to adulthood. Ten of the 12 schools that received funding from the coalition are government schools, which emphasises the popularity of this program in the public sector as well as in private schools. Among them are schools that are non-denominational in nature, which just underscores the broad support for the School Chaplaincy Program. The three-year funding for the National School Chaplaincy Program is scheduled to end at the end of this financial year. I am concerned that, as a result of this, school communities, including chaplains, teachers, parents and students, have been left in the dark with no guarantee that the chaplaincy services program will continue beyond 1 July 2010. This is concerning because of the fundamentally important work that school chaplains do. Figures show that 97 per cent of school principals who have engaged a chaplain strongly support the program and recognise the benefit for their school communities. On behalf of my community, I implore the Rudd Labor government to stand up and deliver some leadership and to provide funding for the National School Chaplaincy Program. This MAIN COMMITTEE",148,Constituency Statements
255,Mr Ciobo (Moncrieff) (10.39 Am),"I rise to raise an issue of some concern to me. Overprogram does deserve government support. It is an important program that makes a real difference in young people’s lives. The fact that so many public schools, including nondenominational schools, have embraced the National School Chaplaincy Program simply underscores the important role that it plays in providing a clear direction forward on what is acceptable in terms of community values but also in nurturing the spirituality of Australia’s young people. That is fundamental for Australia’s young people going forward. der 193 the time for constituency statements has concluded. TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (2009 MEASURES No. 5) BILL 2009 Second Reading Debate resumed from 28 October, on motion by Mr Shorten: That this bill be now read a second time. contained in the Tax Laws Amendment (2009 Measures No. 5) Bill 2009. Mr Deputy Speaker Andrews, I know you are particularly interested in this legislation. The bill implements a number of improvements to Australian tax law. I will move quickly through the first few amendments, which are largely to close loopholes and address unintended consequences in our tax system. I will then discuss the amendments which will have a real and direct impact on all Australians and on some special sectors that I am particularly sympathetic to-and that I think the member for Werriwa will be particularly interested in, in light of his earlier comments about autism. Firstly, this bill retrospectively amends GST law to ensure that a representative of a failed company is liable for GST transactions. In December last year, the Federal Court determined, in Deputy Commissioner of Taxationv PM Developments Pty Ltd, that a liquidator is not liable for the GST on transactions that occur during the liquidator’s appointment. The court said that the GST liability rests with the company in liquidation. The court decision is at odds with the policy and administration of tax law since July 2000 and it puts at risk around $655 million of GST revenue. The bill amends the GST law from 1 July 2000 to ensure that the law achieves what was intended and what is logical. The change to the law will not affect taxpayers but will protect the government’s GST revenue. Obviously incapacitated companies would generally be unable to pay GST. The intention of the law has always been that liquidators are liable for the GST collected during the period of their appointment. Secondly, this bill reverses the changes to the PAYG instalments system. It overturns recent changes to the taxation of financial arrangements which had the unintended consequence of potentially reducing PAYG instalments paid. These amendments address this unintended outcome. The government will develop a more appropriate method for dealing with PAYG and TOFA in consultation with industry. The bill also amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 to extend eligibility for exemption from interest withholding tax to debt issued by the Commonwealth. This brings me to the aspects of the bill that will improve tax outcomes for some Australians, many of whom, I imagine, are doing it particularly tough. As the member for Werriwa said, people are often going to face extra costs if they have a child with autism. This first measure will deliver a better outcome for regional and remote Australian families who have a MAIN COMMITTEE",149,Constituency Statements
256,The Deputy Speaker (Hon. Kj Andrews),Order! In accordance with standing or,150,Constituency Statements
257,Mr Perrett (Moreton) (10.42 Am),"I rise to speak in support of the range of measureschild with autism spectrum disorder. I declare a particular interest in that my great-nephews Leroy and Jamie Doran, from Roxby Downs in South Australia, are autistic-hello to their parents Christine and Sean Doran; Christine is my niece. I am sure that Leroy and Jamie will be particularly keen to look at Hansard and see their names mentioned. They are the closest I have come to family members with autism, although in my 11 years as a school teacher I definitely taught kids with autism. Perhaps, early on, kids were not diagnosed because the DSM-IV, as I think it then was, did not list autism spectrum disorder and it was not as well known, certainly in the teaching area. The bill before the House will exempt payments made under the Helping Children with Autism package from income-tax. The payments help families access early intervention and education services for children who have been diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder. It is important to exclude these payments from income tax to ensure that these families receive the full benefit for their children. It also ensures that they will not receive an unexpected tax bill when they lodge their return. In a similar way, this bill also supports those who receive payments under the Continence Aids Payment Scheme. This bill will ensure that payments made under this scheme are exempt from income tax. This scheme helps individuals with the costs of continence products and ensures recipients have the flexibility they need to choose the products that suit them best. In a former life as a health adviser I had quite a lot to do with the medical aid subsidy scheme, which is the state-based equivalent of this. It is amazing how a little bit of support can change someone’s life, provide dignity and allow them to be a member of the mainstream community with just a little bit of help and support. With an ageing society this will become even more of a problem. I note that the first baby boomers will be retiring next year; they will be hitting 65 years. I think I am either at the end of the baby boomers or at the start of the next generation-generation X. We need to do what we can to ensure that as many people as possible have dignity when it comes to incontinence. Finally, this bill ensures that the Victorian Bushfire Appeal Fund Independent Advisory Panel has greater scope to support rebuilding efforts. Currently the panel is doing great work but is limited to spending appeal funds in a way that is restricted to what the law considers charitable-based on the legal precedents on the definition of charity from cases under tax law. The Victorian Bushfire Appeal Fund Independent Advisory Panel and all charitable organisations need to adhere to these strict criteria when administering appeal funds, to uphold the integrity of the system. However, the Victorian bushfires were unprecedented in their damage and devastation and the panel needs greater flexibility to adequately support affected communities. This bill will allow the Red Cross to transfer donations to the appeal fund without losing its charitable status. As a Red Cross convener, a regular Red Cross blood donor and having close connections with the Australian Red Cross-its CEO, Robert Tickner, is a respected former member of this House and its General Manager, International Operations, Donna McSkimming, happens to be my cousin, this is just a coincidence-I am very supportive of this initiative to make sure that the Red Cross is able to do as much as possible in the areas affected by the Victorian bushfires. This bill will allow the funds in the appeal fund to be used for a broader range of purposes and will also ensure that charitable donations are used appropriately. MAIN COMMITTEE These allowable purposes include any purpose that is currently allowed under the Australian disaster relief category, any public benefit purpose that meets certain criteria and other allowable purposes, including: providing long-term assistance to orphan minors; reimbursing individuals or organisations who have paid for disaster relief or public benefit activities; providing support to individuals who have lived in transitional housing because of the bushfires; and assisting individuals who are primary producers. The appeal fund will be able to make grants of up to $10,000 to farmers to repair their farms. The appeal fund will also be able to provide assistance to families whose owner-occupied principal residence has been destroyed or damaged. I can still recall my disbelief at the magnitude of the destruction I saw, safely from Queensland, as I watched footage of the Victorian bushfires beamed into my lounge room in February this year. I am sure that you as a Victorian, Mr Acting Deputy Speaker Andrews, would have experienced the horror so much more. The Red Cross bushfire appeal fund raised more than $380 million to support individuals and communities in towns and suburbs affected by the 2009 Victorian bushfires. It showed that all Australians are able to dig into our pockets when times are tough. The Victorian bushfire appeal fund independent advisory panel has done a remarkable job in helping to rebuild communities and will do much more. Obviously there is much more to be done. This bill will ensure that they can do what needs to be done while ensuring the integrity of the charitable donations that have been received through the Red Cross. On a related note, I want to thank the Assistant Treasurer for his efforts to ensure that donations made to support relief efforts following the typhoon in Taiwan are tax deductible. I know you have a particular interest in that country. I know the Taiwanese community in my electorate have given generously to this relief effort, and tax-deductible donations ensure that this generosity goes that bit further. I support the range of the amendments in this bill and commend it to the House. Measures No. 5) Bill 2009. While there are a number of provisions being put forward in this legislation, such as clarifying the GST law and extending the exemption on interest withholding tax to debt issued by the Commonwealth, today I want to give particular focus, as other speakers have, to the amendments made in relation to the Helping Children with Autism package. Why? Because it is a program I advocated and supported in government and one that makes a considerable difference in addressing the special developmental needs of autistic children, supporting their families and reinforcing the proven fact that early intervention produces the best possible outcome for diagnosis in children. It cannot be stressed enough that early intervention is crucial to children with this autism condition. As we have heard, this legislation makes tax-free the outer regional and remote payment under the Helping Children with Autism package. This one-off $2,000 payment assists families living in regional areas to manage the additional costs of accessing early intervention services, including travel and accommodation. Schedule3 makes payments made under the package exempt from income tax, applying retrospectively to payments made in the last financial year. This is an important amendment and one that makes the difficult lives of our families coping with a child with autism slightly easier. I must at this point point out why this is important. In the past autism has not received the attention it should have because it was a MAIN COMMITTEE",150,Constituency Statements
258,Mr Randall (Canning) (10.51 Am),"I rise to speak on the Tax Laws Amendment (2009not recognised as a syndrome but more as a condition and it did not get the funding or attention it deserved. This is actually promoting it to the status it should have. The Helping Children with Autism package was an important coalition initiative and it is not surprising the Rudd government had the sense to carry it on. Autism is not a partisan issue, as we have heard here this morning. It is about giving children the best opportunities, addressing their special needs and supporting the different developmental needs. No party at all has a trademark on this epidemic. It is a national issue that needs national support. Autism spectrum disorders include autism, obviously, Asperger’s syndrome and pervasive developmental disorder. It is characterised by impaired social skills, poor communication and restricted and repetitive behaviours and interests. The distress of parents realising these early signs is heart breaking. Autism has grown to astonishing levels in the last 15 years. Around one in 160 children in Australia are now diagnosed with some level of autism spectrum disorder. An American bureau of statistics study showed that autism has increased by 870 per cent in the last 10 years. Parents of children with autism face immense challenges. Aside from the care of their child, the resulting stress is enormous, and studies show that up to 80 per cent of marriages where there is an autistic child fail. I myself have seen many times the pressure it puts on marriages and relationships. Unfortunately, there is no cure, so we must continue to invest in support and research to make sure families and children cope the best they can. At the cornerstone of the package is, as I said, early intervention. Funding to assist children up to the age of six and their families gain access to better support, education and early intervention services is crucial. Autism-specific playgroups encourage learning and development, and childhood autism advisers help families find the best services to meet the needs of their particular child. Assistance is also provided in the form of Medicare funded services to diagnose autism; workshops and information sessions for parents with school-age children with autism; and professional development for teachers, schools and staff. It is so important that teachers, schools and staff are now getting workshops to help them cope. They play a vital role. Securing additional services to assist autistic children has long been on my agenda. It was as a special needs teacher at a school in Perth, the Gladys Newton School in Balga, that I saw first hand the impact autism has on children and their families and the difficulty many children have in coping in everyday surroundings. In fact, as a young school teacher at the Gladys Newton School my first impressions of autism-I can picture him now, one autistic boywere that it was quite strange; I had never seen anything like it before. My heart went out to that boy’s mother in those days because I knew the difficulty she was having. She had just been abandoned by her husband as a result of the stress placed on their marriage. Over a number of years I have supported a group in my electorate of Canning called the Unique Group of Mothers, a support group of families with autistic children. I will take this opportunity to talk about my friend Dermott Barnard, who adopted me through the Adopt a Politician scheme. Dermott is now 11 and was diagnosed with autism at three. In fact, if this program had been in place he might have been diagnosed much earlier. Since then, his mother, Lynne, has battled to make sure that her son’s needs are met. Most of the time she must feel as though it is a constant uphill battle but you never hear her complain. In fact, Lynne is a very brave and courageous lady. MAIN COMMITTEE I do not want to go into all the details, but Lynne has suffered so much sickness and ill health herself that we thought we had lost her several times. I suspect what keeps her going is the fact that she needs to care for Dermott and his sister. She has had constant surgery, including muscle transplants. As a single mother-who by the way is fighting to get family payments from her ex-partner-she really does it hard. I know what a tough and strong lady she is and I congratulate her for fighting through all this. Dermott’s autism is relatively severe and, like many autistic children, he has several other conditions. He has dysphagia, intellectual disability, asthma, serious behavioural problems, as well as epilepsy. I have not caught up with Dermott as often as I should but I have watched him grow up over the years. Dermott is great with electronics, putting things together and taking them apart. That is part of his repetitive behaviour. We actually sat down and set up a car track and a computer together. Lynne does an outstanding job of coping as a single mother, as I have said. Obviously, Dermott’s condition puts great strain on her. Just to make matters more difficult, along with her poor health of late, she also has a younger daughter who suffers from several conditions herself. So she has two children with huge issues. Lynne has fought battle after battle but always puts a smile on her face. There have been ongoing clashes over Dermott’s entitlement, for example, to aid time at school, and I am pleased to say that I have been able to help. Ensuring that Dermott has adequate and intensive support at school is imperative to his progress. Dermott requires assistance in the classroom and supervision due to fears for his safety. He requires monitoring at mealtimes, because if he did not have that he would choke because he has trouble swallowing, and at bathroom breaks Lynne was among the thousands of parents who welcomed the program, particularly relating to early intervention. At the time, she said: It’s a great package because it is designed to integrate autistic children into general schools and programs. We don’t want to return to the days of ‘special’ centres. In fact, it is not that long ago that they used to call the centres for these children ‘slowlearning centres’, and they were isolated from the rest of the school population. Now they are integrated into the school program, as they should be because it helps their development progress and it also helps the other children in the classroom to show compassion and understanding for children less fortunate than themselves. The sooner a diagnosis is made the sooner early intervention can get underway, so this program is outstanding. In Perth, a new early-learning and care centre for children with autism spectrum disorder is underway. In a partnership with the Autism Association of Western Australia, Curtin University and Jellybeans Child Care Centres, the centre will be staffed by trained professionals and will help children to develop structured social skills. In turn, this will give them confidence and make the transition to school significantly easier. These centres will also provide parents with greater peace of mind and support and will leave them feeling less isolated and frustrated. One of the things that have not been addressed yet, and I know that parents are desperate for it, is respite care. The ability to organise respite care at short notice is crucial to these parents. If you book a child in for, say, a fortnight’s time that is one thing, but when the parent or the carer is absolutely at their wit’s end they need immediate respite. We have heard of tragedies in this country where some parents have not coped and they have done away with their MAIN COMMITTEE child. It is a fact of life and it is very sad. That is why they need emergency respite. That is not being done yet but, hopefully, this is something we can build on after this program is initiated. There is a lot more I could say about this issue but I will move on. I briefly note a couple of other important provisions in this legislation. Giving greater flexibility to the distribution of Victorian bushfire appeal funds can only help the rebuilding process. Schedule6 of the bill allows the Victorian Bushfires Appeal Fund to use donations in ways that would not generally be deemed as being for a charitable purpose. The amendment means that the Australian Red Cross Society will not risk losing its charitable status as a result of undertaking this wider variety of work. This is a practical amendment and it makes sense. When it comes to rebuilding towns, you are basically starting from scratch. People have donated money for this purpose and agencies should not be restricted by bureaucratic red tape. No-one can question the motives behind this amendment to give long-term assistance to orphans, provide assistance to individuals whose homes were destroyed by bushfires, provide up to $15,000 to individuals living in transitional housing and provide up to $10,000 in financial assistance to primary producers. I am sure that many Canning schoolchildren and families who generously donated to the appeal would support their money going to any of those purposes. This past weekend I was in Dwellingup to celebrate the centenary of the pegging of the town. I mention this because the devastating Dwellingup fires of 1961 virtually destroyed the town and brought its thriving timber and milling industry to a complete standstill. Everything was burnt to the ground except-can you believe it?-the local pub. As I understand it, this happened in Marysville or one of those towns recently. As I said on the weekend, somebody has a rare sense of priority. For Dwellingup residents the memories of the fires remain, and they sympathise with the victims of the Victorian fires. Out of the ashes of Dwellingup they banded together and started again. The fires burnt out 1.8 million hectares and 160 buildings and cost $35 million in lost homes, businesses and livestock. Today Dwellingup is a picturesque town which thrives on being a very enviable destination for tourists, so it has moved from being a timber town. It still has a couple of smaller boutique timber mills, but it is moving towards being a tourism town, including for ecotourism. Finally, I am pleased that the legislation also provides an income tax exemption for payments made under the Continence Aids Payment Scheme. The coalition invested heavily in the program, doubling it in 2007, because it provides financial support at a basic level for thousands of Australians with incontinence due to neurological conditions, such as paraplegia, multiple sclerosis or spina bifida, and also the parents of disabled children. Incontinence has physical, social and economic ramifications for people of all ages, for carers and for the community as a whole. I want to mention a certain multiple sclerosis sufferer, athlete et cetera. I particularly want to mention the MS Society champion Betty Cuthbert, who lives in my electorate. I know that she has been a big advocate for this scheme because it has been extremely expensive and her carer has come to me on a number of occasions regarding the incontinence pad situation for Betty. With all that, I commend the bill to this House. Amendment (2009 Measures No. 5) Bill 2009. I am pleased to speak in support of it because it makes some very important changes to our tax law which go to the heart of helping people who are suffering from disability and disadvantage for reasons that are not their own fault: MAIN COMMITTEE",152,Constituency Statements
259,Mr Neumann (Blair) (11.06 Am),"I am happy to speak in support of the Tax Lawsparents, particularly, who have children with autism or men who are suffering from prostate cancer and have the shame and embarrassment of incontinence. It is sorting out a system whereby the taxpayers are not disadvantaged by the seemingly inexplicable decision by Justice Logan in the case of Deputy Commissioner of Taxationv PM Developments Pty Ltd, commonly known as the PMD decision. Another irregularity that needs to be changed results from the amendments made in the Tax Laws Amendment (Taxation of Financial Arrangements) Act 2009. The final thing is a very sensible change that gives greater scope to the Victorian Bushfire Appeal Fund Independent Advisory Panel to support communities affected by the devastation in Victoria from the bushfires earlier this year, which claimed the lives of so many Australians and which devastated the communities and family life of rural Victoria. These amendments by way of schedule, whilst seemingly unglamorous in many ways, really make a difference in the lives of so many Australians. Many times people listen to parliament or watch TV and see politicians speak or be interviewed but do not realise that we often work together to achieve good outcomes which make an appreciable difference in family and community life. Whilst this legislation, on the surface, seems to have a strange and very uninteresting title, the Tax Laws Amendment (2009 Measures No. 5) Bill, it really goes to making a big difference in the lives of so many people. The first thing that I want to talk about is schedule 1. Schedule1 arises out of a decision that was made in relation to GST and how it should be treated in terms of a debt arrangement in circumstances where a company goes belly up and creditors are chasing funds. Having been a lawyer for a long time, I was involved in winding up lots of companies over the years. Certainly, the commercial lawyers in the firm were often amazed that I actually knew something about commercial law, having practised extensively in it when I was much younger. I am aware of the travails and difficulties for creditors and liquidators, if not the receivers and managers as well, who look after companies in these circumstances where the creditors are trying to knock down the doors, particularly the artificial barriers of incorporation. The decision made by Justice Logan in the circumstances is contrary to the stated policy of the government. It is a strange decision; I had a look at it and it really is a situation where he has declared that GST is a post-liquidation debt, and in the circumstances it really results in not enjoying the kind of priority we would hope it would get. As a result of that decision, if debts are owed to the Commonwealth government that money would not come back to the Commonwealth government and the taxpayers’ hands-into consolidated revenue, if you know what I mean. It would really be at the mercy of creditors. The decision there means that hundreds of millions of dollars of taxpayers’ funds could not be taken out of the winding up and given back to consolidated revenue. It is not a revenue debt that gets the priority that it should. It is a strange decision, and I am puzzled how he came to that decision in the circumstance, but I am pleased that we are changing it. In a media announcement in February this year, the Assistant Treasurer made that point. Many times when companies go belly up the result is debts owed to many people. I strongly believe there should be a priority in relation to taxpayers’ funds so that the integrity of our tax system is maintained and money comes back for redistribution amongst the Australian community. I think there is a need for priority in these cases, so I am pleased to support that. I think it is important and I think that the PMD decision, where it found the liquidators not liable for the GST arising from the transaction occurring during the period of the liquidaMAIN COMMITTEE tor’s appointment is simply a wrong decision, and I am pleased we are overturning it. This is changing the GST law, effectively retrospectively backdating it to 1 July 2000 to make sure it has achieved what we think is our objective. There are other changes I want to talk briefly about-and I will not really go into the bushfire one-particularly the autism changes. Schedule3 exempts from income tax the assistance we give to families, particularly to those who are struggling with having a child suffering from autism. This was brought home, starkly, to me not long ago at a mobile office I did at Karalee Shopping Centre. A woman came up to me with her 12-year-old daughter, who suffered from autism. She shared with me, with tears in her eyes, the difficulties that she faced with integrating her child into the education system and the difficulties she faced looking after that child. I invited her to a disability forum in Ipswich, where the Parliamentary Secretary for Disabilities and Children’s Services and Parliamentary Secretary for Victorian Bushfire Reconstruction was present. She came, and very eloquently and passionately, talked about the challenges that she faced and how hard it was for parents. I commend her for doing so, and I could see by the look on people’s faces that she really touched people in that forum at the University of Queensland Ipswich campus last Friday. Schedule3 makes changes which are important. The government is contributing a lot of money and assistance to children and families suffering from autism. The Australian government is committing $190 million for four years up to June 2012 to help families under its Helping Children with Autism package. Following diagnosis they can get access to an autism adviser in their state or territory. Schedule3 exempts from income tax the $2,000 payment which can be given to them if they live in outer regional or remote areas. My electorate of Blair has a very large rural component, so those people who unfortunately have a child who suffers from autism will with this amendment legislation have extra money in their pockets because we are exempting the payment from tax. We are saying to those people, ‘We want to help you.’ We are saying to them, ‘We understand the difficulties that you face every day.’ We want to show a degree of compassion and humanity towards them and help them Schedule4 deals with the assistance we are giving in exempting from income tax those payments made under the Continence Aids Payment Scheme. The difficulties of this were brought home to me by my own father’s personal circumstances. He suffers from prostate cancer and cannot walk, he is in a nursing home in south-west Brisbane and his own personal circumstances are very difficult. I applaud the Prostate Cancer Foundation of Australia who have made much of the need for men’s health to be given a strong focus. Incontinence is often a consequence of the kind of treatment that men absolutely need in the circumstances. I was bewildered and amazed by Catalyst on the ABC recently in relation to this issue which seemed to, by implication, advise men that they really did not have to do much about it in some circumstances. Men who experience incontinence following their treatment suffer distress, worry, anxiety, embarrassment and shame. Giving men who get, by virtue of this payment scheme, extra dollars in their pocket to help them is really a fair and just thing to do and it is a compassionate and humanitarian thing to do. There is a minister of religion in my community who has talked to me on numerous occasions about the travails and troubles that he personally has experienced in relation to incontinence and I commend him and so many other men in the Ipswich and West Moreton communities for their determination. MAIN COMMITTEE There is a Prostate Cancer Foundation support group in my community, Len Lamprecht is the chair, and he does a great job in trying to get men to get their PSA checked, trying to get men to see doctors in the first place and trying to help men who have gone through this process to share their experiences and get counsel and assistance. The changes that we are making in exempting from income tax those payments made under the Continence Aids Payment Scheme is important because men who suffer from these problems need continence products. They need a greater degree of discretion, not simply being told that this is the product that they have to use but income to have the freedom to choose the products that they want to use so that they can live a life of abundance, fulfilment, joy and happiness. There are other changes in the amendments in this legislation. There is a change in schedule 2 which simply amends the PAYG instalment provisions to address a problem that arose from amendments in the Tax Laws Amendment (Taxation of Financial Arrangements) Act. It is not a particularly big change but it is going to remedy the situation that has arisen by virtue of that amendment bill. There is another change, as I say, in relation to the bushfire situation and I will get on to that in a minute, but schedule 5 does make a change in relation to Commonwealth issued debt to make sure they are exempt from interest withholding tax. The Assistant Treasurer has on many occasions talked about the fact that we want Australia to be a financial hub. We want investment from overseas. The exemption here will provide Commonwealth debt, state debt and private sector debt with the same kind of exemption from interest withholding tax. It will mean that Commonwealth debentures, effectively Commonwealth issued securities, will be more attractive. It will mean that in all likelihood we will have more people purchasing those investments; it will mean that we treat our Commonwealth government securities as other Western countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom do, and that is important if we want to make sure that we are a financial hub in Asia and compete with the likes of Hong Kong and Singapore. The changes in relation to the Bushfire Appeal Fund are sensible. The member for Canning said it overcame bureaucracy, and I agree. There is rigidity and eccentricity in relation to this and it overcomes the problems. It means that money may be expended for allowable purposes, broadening the scope for which the money can be used. It is clear that community projects can be undertaken and local people can effectively have more of a say in what happens with respect to the local reconstruction. I support this legislation. It will make a difference in the life of my community, to individuals in my community and in Victoria as well. Services and Parliamentary Secretary for Victorian Bushfire Reconstruction) (11.21 am)-I want to thank those members who have contributed to the debate on the Tax Laws Amendment (2009 Measures No. 5) Bill 2009. Schedule 1, the GST and representatives of incapacitated entities measure, will protect GST revenue in the light of the Federal Court decision which found that the representatives of an incapacitated entity are not liable for the GST consequences that arise during their appointment. This measure will amend the GST law with effect from 1 July 2000 to restore the policy intent stated in the explanatory memorandum to the law introducing the GST. In particular, it will ensure that the representatives of incapacitated entities are liable for GST on postappointment transactions that are within the scope of their authority. This measure will also address the uncertainty faced by insolvency practitioners in the application of the law following the Federal Court decision. MAIN COMMITTEE",155,Constituency Statements
260,Mr Shorten (Maribyrnong,"Parliamentary Secretary for Disabilities and Children’sSchedule2 amends the Pay-As-You-Go instalment provisions to address unintended consequences arising out of the amendments to those provisions contained in the Tax Laws Amendment (Taxation of Financial Arrangements) Act 2009, the TOFA Act. Consultation on a more appropriate method for dealing with the interactions between the Pay-As-You-Go instalment system and the TOFA Act will be undertaken. Schedule3 exempts from income tax the outer regional and remote payment made under the Helping Children with Autism package. This is a payment of $2,000 to assist parents of children with a diagnosis of autism who live in outer regional and remote Australian areas to be able to access services which might not be present in their immediate vicinity by assistance with costs. This exemption will ensure and provide the recipients of this payment with certainty as to the tax status of these payments. The payments, as I said, are for families with children and are to assist with their costs, not create circumstances where they have to pay tax. The Helping Children with Autism package is the first attempt by any federal government to fund early intervention services for children diagnosed with autism or Asperger’s syndrome along the spectrum. We know that early intervention and quality therapies provided by psychologists, occupational therapists and speech therapists can improve a child’s well-being and their ability to benefit from learning and education throughout the course of their schooling life. As members would realise, raising a child with an ASD is a challenging and often isolating experience for parents. I am pleased to say the package has helped 4,104 families with the cost of therapies and 460 of those are living in regional and remote areas. The payment acknowledges the difficulties that families can face when there are not the qualified health professionals available in remote and outer regional Australia. Schedule4 exempts from income tax the payments made under the Continence Aids Payment Scheme. These payments assist eligible recipients with permanent and severe incontinence to meet some of the costs of their continence products and allow recipients greater choice in the range of products. This replaces the existing Continence Aids Assistance Scheme, which currently provides subsidised continence products to eligible recipients. Providing an income tax exemption for the receipt of this payment will ensure that no recipients are disadvantaged under the new scheme. Schedule5 will help improve the neutrality of the tax system and bring Australia’s tax treatment of Commonwealth government securities into line with the treatment of government securities in other nations by the removal of interestwithholding tax on Commonwealth government securities. This important measure will increase the attractiveness of Commonwealth government securities in global financial markets. Finally, as we all know, after the Victorian bushfires devastated communities on 7 February-and there were other fires in that month-a joint appeal fund was established by the Australian Red Cross Society, supported by the Victorian government and the federal government, to help fire affected communities. I am pleased to say the Victorian Bushfire Appeal Fund has received donations in excess of $386 million. Recognising the extraordinary and tragic circumstances and the quite remarkable and unprecedented generosity of Australians and indeed people from overseas, the amendments in schedule 6 permit the Victorian Bushfire Appeal Fund independent advisory panel to use the donations in the fund for a broader range of purposes than the tax law traditionally considers charitable, without jeopardising the charitable status of the Red Cross. MAIN COMMITTEE As I have said, the February bushfires generated a wave of generosity almost unprecedented in Australian history. I believe, through working with the bushfire appeal fund directly in my responsibilities as Parliamentary Secretary for Victorian Bushfire Reconstruction, that those who gave to the fund-and this is in excess of 600,000 people-had an expectation their donations could be used to help all of those genuinely in need as a result of the fires. These changes will allow the fund to fund a wider range of community projects and broaden the number of people eligible for assistance. Some of the changes which have been underway since the minister announced these amendments have seen farmers being able to receive payments for fencing and seen destroyed community projects and community infrastructure able to be replaced with funds from the Red Cross. These changes have been requested by the fund, first chaired by former Governor Landy and now chaired by Mr Patrick McNamara, former Deputy Premier of Victoria. The fund has done a great job. In fact, it has done an exceptional job in wisely distributing the donations it has received. I place on record my congratulations to all the directors of the fund. The allowable purposes for which donations made may be expended are, however, restricted to provide assurance to donors that their charitable gifts will be used appropriately. I commend this bill to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Message from the Governor General recommending appropriation announced. Ordered that the bill be reported to the House without amendment. Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee Report Debate resumed. the report of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Review of the Defence Annual Report 2007-2008. Any review of defence activities in the period 2007-08 or indeed to the present time would have to acknowledge at the outset the very heightened tempo of activity with which the Australian Defence Force is engaged at the moment. Deployments abroad and commitments at home are at a very high tempo, requiring the dedication of all the men and women of the defence forces. In the brief time available, I want to refer to some of the recommendations and issues surrounding the report. The committee has made a recommendation about the importance of Defence looking to buy military off-the-shelf equipment wherever that is able to be done, in effect as a default position. Over the years, the defence committee has looked at a number of acquisitions that have been problematic for Australian defence forces. It does not reflect on who happens to be in government or indeed who happens to be running defence at the time, but there is a pattern which emerges, which is that those defence acquisitions which have been the most problematic, those that have had the greatest time delay and those that have been more prone to cost overruns have been those where Defence and the government of the day have determined to acquire what is, effectively, a one-off solution or to be first of type. It is not surprising that that should be the case. Common sense would tell us that that would be so. MAIN COMMITTEE",158,Constituency Statements
261,Mr Bevis (Brisbane) (11.29 Am),"I am very pleased to have the opportunity to speak toThere will be a number of occasions when Australia’s unique geographical circumstances and our unique strategic environment will in fact require us to have a one-off type solution, and I can think of a number of examples where that is the case. One of the areas that has had difficulties over the years is the combat system on the submarines, yet in truth there is no submarine in the world that would have met Australia’s needs. The typical submarine is designed for operation in the North Atlantic, more in a European context than the circumstances confronting Australia. That is an example of where a military off-the-shelf solution is unlikely to meet our needs. That said, we need to mitigate the risk wherever we can. There are other first-of-type acquisitions that come to mind which have also been problematic, such as the Airborne Warning and Control System. That has been a particularly plagued program. It is now some three years overdue, and a review of the circumstances surrounding it would raise a number of important questions about whether the best decisions were taken at the outset. There have also been acquisitions of military off-the-shelf equipment, the most recent best example of which is the heavy airlift capability that the Australian Defence Force has recently acquired. It has clearly been the correct decision to get a capable, proven platform off the shelf for what is effectively an air cargo freighter-a fancy air cargo freighter, but nonetheless an air cargo freighter. In making this recommendation, it is important to note that it is not intended to be a statement with respect to any particular acquisition that may currently be under consideration. I say that advisedly, given some of the debate surrounding one of the acquisitions that is presently being touted-or, at least, one of the bidders places great store on that as their selling point. That is fair enough, but, in making this recommendation, the committee is not engaging in any assessment of current acquisitions. Rather, it is making a broad point of policy. There is one other recommendation that I want to turn to that has been a concern of mine, and that is the situation with the submarine escape training facility at HMAS Stirling. This has been a very sad and sorry episode in recent government management of naval assets. The escape training facility at HMAS Stirling is world-class, specifically designed as part of the HMAS Stirling submarine fleet base. The training for escape from submarines is an essential part of any Navy operating a submarine fleet. Originally, that training was done by naval and defence personnel. A decision was taken some years ago that that should be outsourced. I am yet to be persuaded or to see the evidence that that was the correct decision. In any event, when it was time for that contract to be renegotiated, apparently nobody able to provide a contract was seen as satisfactory for the purposes. As a result, for some time now we have had a world-class facility for submariner escape training effectively sitting idle and we have needed to send Australian submariners overseas to be trained, in facilities in Canada, in survival and escape from submerged submarines. This is, in my view, completely and utterly absurd and unacceptable. We need to ensure that the facility at Stirling is brought back online as quickly as possible. I understand that the government has been actively engaged in recent times in bringing HMAS Stirling back online; I will be interested to see under what circumstances that occurs and indeed what assessment is done of the relative merits of those services being provided in-house rather than by contractors. Related to that is the submarine rescue vehicle Remora, which has also been unavailable for some time. It and its delivery vehicle have to be operational as a matter of urgency. We cannot in all good conscience operate a submarine fleet without having an indigenous rescue MAIN COMMITTEE capability on hand. There are other alternatives that may be available in case of emergency, but I think we owe it to the men and women in the Navy, particularly those who crew our submarines, to ensure that we have a domestic capability to do all within our power to rescue them should the need arise. The final point I want to make is covered by recommendations 6 and 7. The committee, I think for the first time, engaged Defence on the question of oil supply and alternative fuel sources. Whether it is a short-term dislocation of oil supply or whether it is addressing the peak oil issue that we can argue about occurring 30, 50 or 60 years down the track, there is an important matter confronting the Australian Defence Force, which is the need to guarantee the supply of energy, whether it be oil or some alternative type of fuel, for the ADF’s purposes. The committee made two recommendations-one that deals with the short-term oil shock issue and another that deals with the long-term alternative fuels issue. The United States and other countries are engaged in research on alternative fuels for military application. Australia has had some limited engagement in that process. It is integral to the future security of this nation that we engage more fully in that research, and I would recommend to the government increased activity in that field. In conclusion, I want to thank the members of the Defence Subcommittee for their work in the course of the last year and particularly over the months involved in the review of the Defence annual report 2007-08. I have made this observation in the past, but I think it is worth repeating: the Defence Subcommittee is fortunate to have among its members a number of senior members of parliament and members who have a genuine interest in national security matters. It is important that it operates on the bipartisan basis that it has throughout my experience in this place. I think we owe it to the men and women in the defence forces to ensure that that is the case. I also want to place on the record my thanks to the committee secretary, Dr Margot Kerley, the secretariat, and especially Wing Commander Dave Ashworth. Dave has been the defence adviser throughout this year. His appointment will soon cease and he has got to go back to one of those real jobs, in a uniform, at Air Force. But, as I commented to the committee itself, the Defence Subcommittee could not operate nearly as well as it does without the support of the defence advisers. We have been very lucky to have as defence advisers-through all the years I have been engaged in this-people of a really high calibre. Their advice, their input and their suggestions are instrumental in allowing us to do our work. I do hope that in the course of their engagement with the parliament and the committee they manage to pick up a few ideas about this place that might help shape their thoughts into the future and perhaps change some of the preconceptions they had when they walked in on day 1. But on behalf of the committee I want to sincerely thank Dave again for his outstanding contribution. I also want to place on record my thanks to the other support staff who have been engaged with the committee over this period of time, Muz Ali, Dr Brian Lloyd and Paul Zinkel. I also want to thank the other people who actually ensure that our committee can function and that the documents and everything are where they should be when they need to be. Mrs Donna Quintus-Bosz as office manager is, dare I say, someone I have known since childhood in Brisbane. Donna does a superb job, not just in this committee but in the intelligence and security committee, which I also chair. Her work in that area is greatly appreciated. To Sonya Gaspar and also to Gillian Drew, thanks for their support. None of the committees in the parMAIN COMMITTEE liament would actually operate were it not for that administrative support, and I think it is appropriate that we should from time to time acknowledge it. I am happy to put that on the record and thank them for their service. on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade inquiry into the Defence annual report 2007-08. Let me first of all acknowledge Arch Bevis, member for Brisbane, as chair of the committee, who is certainly a wasted talent sitting on Labor’s backbench. If the Prime Minister had any sense at all, he would seek to promote a talent such as Arch Bevis, who has led the committee so incredibly well. I certainly pay him the respect he deserves. I also thank the defence adviser, Wing Commander David Ashworth, for all his work. I can only hope that in coming here he has learnt a lot about how the committee works, indeed how the parliament works, and can take that experience back to his professional career as an Air Force officer. I also thank the secretariat for the hard work they have done not only on this report but also throughout the year as the defence committee gets across the vast portfolio which is Defence within the Australian security environment. The Defence annual report ostensibly looked at four key areas and its recommendations are factored around those. They have to do with procurement, with Defence pay systems, with issues involving our submarine facilities and with fuel. I wish to make a few comments with respect to those four areas. First, with procurement, the committee recommends that, in the absence of a clear strategic case for high risk, first of type lead customer, we go with a MOTS program, MOTS being military off the shelf. In a corporate sense we would go with COTS, commercial off the shelf: that we would buy, we would borrow and then build as a last resort. The committee recommends this strongly for Defence as well. Buy off the shelf first. Borrow it second. And if you must, for clearly identified reasons, then go for a build option. We know with Defence’s top 20 projects 16 of them are first of customer, first of type-an incredibly high-risk strategy. We also know from questioning Dr Gumley over the best approach that we should be an aggressive follower, in his words slightly behind the power curve; second or third customer first of type, to give an example. It is something we would impress upon the military, notwithstanding their ability on a strategic case-by-case basis to go for a build in the first instance. Secondly, the Defence annual report inquiry recommends strongly that a high priority is placed on fixing the current pay disputes. KPMG has quite rightly identified a range of issues that need to be resolved quickly. The minister needs to take this as a high priority. There is probably no greater crime in the military, having served there for many years, than not paying the soldiers, sailors and airmen. It is important that we pay them on time. They have commitments, they have families and they need to have confidence in the administrative systems that support them, especially when they are fighting on the front line, which is the front line of freedom for all Western democracies. Our third series of recommendations has to do with our submarine fleet. I believe personally we need an inquiry into the current state of our submarine fleet, its operational readiness, its capacity to deploy, its crewing issues and where the whole submarine fleet is going. Notwithstanding that as my personal belief about where we should go, we as a committee are recommending that the submarine escape training facility at HMAS Stirling be resolved, be re-established and function as a dedicated requirement to allow the training of our submariners MAIN COMMITTEE",160,Committees
262,Mr Robert (Fadden) (11.41 Am),"I rise to lend some comment to the Joint Committeein how to flee a sinking submarine. I can think of nothing more harrowing than being in a tin can as it descends to the bottom of the ocean when we do not have the facility to train our men and women on how to get out of that can. And, of course, we have a range of deployability issues with the Australian Submarine Rescue Vehicle Remora that need to be resolved without delay. The final set of recommendations that the defence committee looked at had to do with fuel. With respect to the climate change debate, wherever one sits on the spectrum, what is important is managing the risks. One of the risks as we move forward is reliance on fossil fuels. I have a vision that one day this nation can rise up and be fully reliant on its own source of renewable energy and domestic fuel, that we can move away from reliance on Middle Eastern oil and that we can treat fuel as a strategic resource and have energy security as a priority within our nation. Our defence needs to have an assertive strategy on how it deals with its own energy security, especially with respect to fuels. There are a range of risks that need to be mitigated in our high dependence on oil and other fuels that go with it. The committee are firmly of the view that we need to mitigate that risk and set an agenda for the next 10 years on how we do that. The Parliamentary Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade is an outstanding committee. It has taken a bipartisan approach to all issues that I have been involved with over the term of this parliament. Its view on these four recommendations is strong, and it looks forward to Defence’s response. Debate (on motion by Ms Owens) adjourned. BILL 2009 Second Reading Debate resumed from 20 August, on motion by Mr Brendan O’Connor: That this bill be now read a second time. Ms LEY (Farrer) (11.47 am)-I rise to speak on the Crimes Amendment (Working With Children-Criminal History) Bill 2009. The coalition supports the objectives of this bill. However, amendments may be moved in the Senate pending the recommendations of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee on the bill, which are due today. The safeguarding of children from sexual, physical and other abuse should be a key priority for all Australian governments. The COAG agreement which forms the basis of this bill aims to enable the interjurisdictional exchange of information for people working with children. Protecting children from harm is the paramount objective of the bill. At the same time, it is important for society to afford opportunities for offenders to rehabilitate themselves and find gainful employment. There appears to be broad community acceptance of the necessity of some form of working-with-children check in ensuring the safety of children. However, notably, there is also an emerging debate about issues relating to the expansion of criminal records checks in general. In Australia, there has been a significant increase in requests for criminal record checks in recent years. Between 2004-05 and 2007-08, requests to CrimTrac, the national criminal record agency, increased by 73 per cent, from 1½ million to 2.6 million. Requests to the Australian Federal Police increased by 57 per cent, from 350,000 to 550,000 in the same period. It is interesting to note that other countries have also experienced the same MAIN COMMITTEE significant increases-for example, in England and Wales between 2002-03 and 2008-09 the number of such checks nearly tripled, from 1.4 million to 3.85 million. The proposed amendments in the bill before the House today would create an exception for convictions of persons who work or seek to work with children so that those convictions can be disclosed to and taken into account by Commonwealth, state and territory screening agencies in determining whether a person is suitable to work with children. The bill contains amendments to part VIIC of the Crimes Act 1914. Part VIIC covers the disclosure and nondisclosure of pardons and quashed and spent convictions. Part VIIC provides that a person whose conviction is spent, pardoned or quashed does not have to disclose the fact of the conviction, prohibits others from disclosing the conviction without the person’s consent and prohibits them from taking the conviction into account. The amendments would create an exception for convictions of persons who work or seek to work with children so that those convictions can be disclosed to and taken into account by Commonwealth, state and territory screening agencies in determining whether the person is suitable to work with children. In particular the amendments: repeal existing exclusions in division 6 that relate to the disclosure of spent convictions information in relation to the care, instruction or supervision of a minor; replace the existing exclusions with new exclusions that allow the disclosure of information about a person’s spent, quashed and pardoned convictions to or by a prescribed person or body, permitted or acquired by or under a prescribed law, to obtain and deal with information about persons who work or seek to work with children; and are for the purposes of obtaining or dealing with such information in accordance with the prescribed law. The amendments also define ‘child’ and ‘work’ for the purposes of the new exclusions and specify criteria that screening units must meet before they can be prescribed, to enable them to obtain and deal with Commonwealth criminal history information. These criteria reflect the requirements of COAG agreements and include compliance with applicable privacy, human rights and records management legislation, natural justice principles and implementation of risk assessment frameworks. The amendments require the Minister for Home Affairs to cause a review of the operation of the new provisions to be conducted after an initial trial period. The bill implements the COAG agreement of 29 November 2008 to facilitate the interjurisdictional exchange of criminal history information for people working with children, including information about spent, pardoned and quashed convictions. That is the background to the bill before us. An extract from the communique on the significant COAG meeting of 29 November 2008 reads: Leaders agreed in principle at the April 2007 COAG meeting to a framework to improve access to interjurisdictional criminal history information by child-related employment screening schemes. COAG at this meeting affirmed the importance of an inter-jurisdictional exchange being put in place as soon as possible, and endorsed a set of implementation actions, the establishment of a project implementation committee under the auspices of COAG and an implementation plan. The implementation plan includes that jurisdictions will prepare, introduce and seek passage of legislative amendments within nine months, to enable the information exchange to commence in 12 months. COAG noted that all jurisdictions, with the exception of Victoria and the Australian Capital Territory, would exchange information on non-conviction charges for screening of people working with children. MAIN COMMITTEE As part of the agreement, each jurisdiction is required to remove any legislative impediments to the exchange of criminal history information for people working with children. The bill removes legislative barriers at the Commonwealth level to ensure that the Commonwealth can provide information in accordance with the COAG agreement. As noted in the bill’s explanatory memorandum, under the Commonwealth spent convictions scheme, a person’s conviction is automatically spent on the expiration of a waiting period. The waiting period is five years if the offender was a juvenile when convicted of the offence or 10 years if the offender was an adult when convicted of the offence, regardless of when the offence was committed. The scheme only applies to convictions which did not result in the offender being sentenced to imprisonment at all or where a term of imprisonment was not more than 30 months and the waiting period has expired. As I mentioned earlier, a comprehensive regime for assessing people who work or seek to work with children must be balanced with a person’s right to rehabilitation, privacy and employment. Accordingly, the use and disclosure of extended criminal history information will be subject to stringent safeguards and conditions. One safeguard included in the bill is that the criminal history information received may be used only for the limited purpose of assessing the risk that a person may pose in working with children. The information may not be used for the purpose of a general integrity or employment suitability check. A potential employee’s criminal history information will not be given to their employer; the employer receives only a ‘yes’ or a ‘no’ from the screening unit. A person can appeal the decision of a screening unit and is able to review the reason that they received a ‘no’ decision. A 12-month trial of the new sharing arrangements starts in November 2009 between agents that already have screening units. The Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs inquiry is worth noting at this point. I wish to review some submissions to that inquiry. Bravehearts, as a non profit organisation specialising in child sexual assault, wrote in their submission: Information sharing is our best weapon for protecting our children. Sharing powers would allow the federal, state and territory bodies to better assess the suitability of those seeking to work in areas that involve significant contact with children. Bravehearts thoroughly supports the Crimes Amendment (Working With Children-Criminal History) Bill allowing for information to be shared on pardons quashed and spent offences. Bravehearts, however, believes the bill does not go far enough and would: …also like to see consideration given to extending background checks to include, for example, disciplinary hearings, diversionary programs, employment history and overseas checks. The Australian Childhood Foundation’s submission to the Senate committee stated: We believe that information relating to charges withdrawn or not proven should not be excluded. The decision to exclude such information does not take into account the problems of child sexual abuse and the overwhelmingly poor rate of prosecution and convictions for child sexual offences. In conclusion, the ongoing monitoring, training and supervision of employees who have access to children are critical to minimising the incidence of child sexual assault. In order to achieve the best possible child protection measures it is essential that there is a comprehensive approach that combines both effective screening and safe government and organisational practices and policies. As I noted at the commencement of these remarks, the coalition reserves the right to move amendments in the Senate pending the Senate Legal and ConstituMAIN COMMITTEE tional Affairs Committee’s recommendations which are due today. We do, in broad, support this bill. our hope coagulated. They are the future distilled. They are all our tomorrows right here, right now. I say this as somebody who has two young children but for 39 long years of my life I had no children. For a long while my lifelong partner and I began to contemplate a life without children, that is not to say we were contemplating a life without hope-and I do not wish for a minute to offend the many Australian couples and singles who live without offspring. In our circumstances it merely would have been a reprioritising of aspirations and dreams of our future together. It would have been Paris rather than the playground; London rather than Lego; more writing rather than the Wiggles. I am not arguing about those options or whether they were better or worse-although I do think of Paris a little bit-but they are just choices that we make when we have children. Just different options, I guess. I have many close friends who will be travelling down life’s road without any little voices in the back seat asking, ‘Are we there yet? Are we there yet? Are we there yet?’ Sometimes fate, or God, or time, or geography, or our genes just happen to roll the dice that way. Sometimes people recklessly roll the dice that way, and sometimes people carefully and deliberately roll the dice that way. Having teetered between all of these roles I know that casual words-be they concerned or careless, such as, ‘Do you have any kids?’-can sometimes cut like a knife. I have friends who have dropped my wife and me as a couple, basically because we had children, maybe because of their own poignant circumstances, maybe because they voted Liberal-who knows?-and I will certainly never ask. As any parent knows, your kids are like a friendship recruiting agency. ‘Your kid likes Thomas the Tank Engine? Hey, mine too. Let’s be friends.’ ‘Your kid likes yelling loudly and chucking tantrums at public events whenever his father is just about to speak? Hey, mine too. Let’s be friends.’ I make these introductory comments about children because I want to clearly place on the record what I believe to be children’s crucial place in the centre of a strong society. Unfortunately, not all Australians have the same view of children. In fact, if all of my fellow Australians had exactly the same view and acted the same way towards children as I do, then my wife would be unemployed. I say that, and by way of explanation I refer to a press release from the Queensland Minister for Child Safety and Minister for Women, the Hon. Margaret Keech, on Thursday, 11 September 2008. The press release is headed: 20 Year Hero Honoured at Child Protection Week Awards-and this refers to my wife. After nearly 20 years on the front-line protecting Queensland’s abused and neglected children, Moorooka’s Leanne Scoines is being officially recognised as a community hero. Child Safety Minister Margaret Keech today announced Ms Scoines has won the Child Protection Week Public Sector Award for her decades on the front-line and now at the after hours service centre. I will not read the whole release, but it goes on to say: Ms Scoines and her colleagues at the after hours centre assess risks to children, monitor families, arrange support for children and carers and ensure vulnerable children are protected-around the clock. Armed with three university degrees, and working on her fourth, in lawshe has an exam next week, so good luckMAIN COMMITTEE",163,Committees
263,Mr Perrett (Moreton) (11.56 Am),"Our children are coagulated hope. Our children areMs Scoines sees her future in working with people who need her help. And her husband is easily the best husband in Australia and does more than his fair share around the house. Actually, that was not in the release; I added that last bit. The reason I refer to that press release is that Lea has been a child protection worker for 20 years, and I have been with her for 18 of those 20 years. Therefore I have a little bit of understanding. She obviously has a lengthy understanding and the knowledge, skills, expertise and compassion, and through osmosis and observation I merely have only a little bit of understanding. I also have an understanding from my time as a union organiser in private schools, when I was working on the blue card discussions. For those people not from Queensland, the blue card is basically the Queensland equivalent of this legislation. I went through that same process, looking at the police records of teachers, when I was working for the Queensland Independent Education Union at the start of the decade. On 29 November 2008 the Council of Australian Governments, COAG, endorsed recommendations for the interjurisdictional exchange of criminal history information for people working with children, including information about pardoned, quashed and spent convictions. So we have a bill before the House called the Crimes Amendment (Working With ChildrenCriminal History) Bill 2009. This would not include people who have been questioned and not charged or even necessarily those who were charged but whose charges were later dropped. However, I do point out that, once a red flag is raised, the information pertaining to whether somebody had been pardoned, had their conviction quashed or had spent convictions would be assessed and only acted on if it is relevant and deemed to be of risk. At the November 2008 COAG meeting, the states and territories agreed to prepare, introduce and seek the passage of legislative amendments within nine months of the COAG agreement. Jurisdictions also agreed to remove any legislative or administrative barriers to formally supplying criminal history information, including information on spent, quashed and pardoned convictions, to other jurisdictions for the purpose of child related employment screening. There are important privacy considerations and public good benefits that must be balanced, but it is obviously very important that we get the balance just right. The EM to the bill states One safeguard included in the Bill is that the criminal history information received may only be used for the limited purpose of assessing the risk that a person may pose in working with children. The information may not be used for the purpose of a general probity or employment suitability check. … … … … a person or body will only be prescribed for the purpose of enabling them to receive conviction information if the person or body: is authorised by the government of the State or Territory in which it operates has a legislative basis for screening that prohibits further release or use of the information (except for legislated child protection functions in exceptional circumstances) complies with applicable privacy, human rights and records management legislation reflects principles of natural justice, and has risk assessment frameworks and appropriately skilled staff to assess risks to children’s safety. The bill before the House also requires the Minister for Home Affairs to review these new provisions after an initial trial period. MAIN COMMITTEE These government initiatives might well dissuade a couple of creeps from seeking to work with children, and that is obviously a good thing, we would all agree. However, I could not in good faith talk about child abuse, child protection and hope without touching on a couple of home truths about the real dangers that face most children. It is a horrible truth that our children are most likely to be harmed by the people they know, not by the paedophiles on the front page of the newspapers. Unfortunately it will usually be by their parents or somebody in the parental role and in their home environment. That is the truth. Leaving aside the mob hysteria and the Dennis Fergusons of the world, that is the grim reality. The rates of sexual abuse are actually lower than the rates of other forms of harm. What is more likely to occur is emotional abuse. Sadly it is often due to domestic violence. The next most likely form of abuse is neglect. More often than not, this neglect stems from parental drug abuse issues. People who have addiction problems tend to focus their resources on their habits rather than on their children. Anyone of my age who has seen the movie Trainspotting would have seen some such horrors. The second last most likely form of abuse is physical abuse. Last of all is sexual abuse. The rates are relatively low-from memory, only about eight per cent. It is with much sadness that I repeat the fact that the sexual abuse is most likely to come from somebody acting in the nurturing role, usually the parent. Our newspapers and A Current Affair and Today Tonight would have us believe that abuse only occurs at the hands of strangers and opportunistic paedophiles such as Dennis Ferguson. I am not criticising ‘stranger danger’ programs and safety houses and the like. They are valuable, important supports-and the bill before the House to bring in federal child safety legislation is also a good thing. However, for most children the opportunities for a stranger to have access to them are actually quite limited. Most parents keep a reasonably close watch on their children. The harm is more likely to come from a trusted person who has regular access. I know that grooming does occur. That might have been Dennis Ferguson’s modus operandi-I do not know if that is what he did, and that will be the last time. I mention that guy’s name. I just wanted to say this because I do not want anybody who is listening to or reading this to build a false sense of security about our legislation or, in Queensland’s case, the blue card. I have got my blue card here. As teachers in Queensland, we did not initially have to have it, but I subsequently got one as a politician on the board of a local community group. We need to remember that legislative nets like the legislation before the House can only catch those who have been convicted. People who have experienced abuse, especially sexual abuse, do not disclose this experience easily. They are not likely to disclose it at the time. There is still a lot of shame associated with this trauma, especially for young boys. Often it is disclosed later, when the victim is in their 30s or 40s. The legislation before the House would not catch those perpetrators, because obviously they have not been charged or convicted. Paedophiles will target kids who are vulnerable. Unfortunately such people normally get into a position of trust and present as fantastic saints. It is only later that we find out that they are actually horrible sinners. We need to teach kids and parents to recognise the telltale signs of abuse. We need to train our children to protect themselves-from strangers, sure, but also from their parents or the people in the parenting role. We also need to fund protective behaviour courses for children. These are real steps that will help us protect our hope. MAIN COMMITTEE A blue card like this is not a shield. It is just another weapon in the armoury. But the best weapon of all is to keep our children close and love them to bits. To paraphrase the singer Paul Kelly, from a song that I listened to carefully when I was younger, before I had children: I know sometimes I’ve been careless; sometimes I’ve lost my tenderness. I’ve been careless and I sometimes take bad care of them. I can do better. I dare say that every parent can do better. Every Australian can do a little bit better, and this legislation before the House helps too. I commend the bill to the House. Moreton. Often when we think of the threat to our children from paedophiles or those who would abuse them, we think of cliches like, ‘Watch out around public toilets in parks,’ and ‘Watch out for the car driving past,’ or the white van that we often hear so much about over in Perth when someone tries to grab children off the streets. But the reality is that our vigilance as parents must start at home, particularly with regard to members of the family and family friends, because it is often there that the greatest threat lies. SoI certainly echo the words of the member for Moreton on that point. I welcome the opportunity to make a contribution today on the Crimes Amendment (Working With Children-Criminal History) Bill 2009. I do see it as a reminder that we must always look for opportunities to strengthen the safeguards we have for the protection of children. The working with children checks and cards have been since their introduction a very important part of the safeguard regime. The proposed amendments in this bill would create an exception for convictions of persons who work or seek work with children so that those convictions can be and rightfully should be disclosed to and taken into account by the Commonwealth, state and territory screening agencies in determining whether a person is suitable to work with children. There is nothing more important than the safety of our children and I share the view of many in our society that sexual abuse assaults against children are the worse of crimes. It just does not get any worse than where power and absolute control by an adult over children is used to undertake sexual assault. My view is that rehabilitation for such criminals is highly unlikely and that they should actually be retained in prisons. It is certainly the case that victims of these crimes will struggle to recover, mentally and socially; they are likely to have ongoing psychological issues and an inability to relate to others socially. They are less likely to succeed in education and in work. Also they are more likely to become involved in crime themselves. This is a reminder to us that we cannot afford to allow any children to be subjected to sexual crime because beyond the tragic lifelong damage that they will experience, the impact on society is also significant when you add up the cases across the nation. The point being that not a single case of child sexual abuse or assault is ever acceptable. I would expect that all members of parliament are committed to fighting for the absolute elimination of these crimes and we must look to take every step that we can to achieve that goal. It is for that reason that I support this bill as it will amend the Crimes Act 1914 to allow exceptions to the provisions that prevent the disclosure of pardoned, quashed or spent convictions. In this bill pardoned and quashed convictions would be disclosed to persons or bodies in prescribed jurisdictions and could be used to determine whether an applicant would be able to be authorised to work with children. In the case of spent convictions exceptions which already exist would be expanded upon. The extract from the COAG communiqué from the MAIN COMMITTEE",167,Crimes Amendment Working With Children Criminal History
264,Mr Simpkins (Cowan) (12.09 Pm),"I would like to echo the words of the member formeeting of 29 November last year regarding interjurisdictional exchange of criminal history information for people working with children read: Leaders agreed in principle at the April 2007 COAG meeting to a framework to improve access to interjurisdictional criminal history information by child-related employment screening schemes. COAG at this meeting affirmed the importance of an inter-jurisdictional exchange being put in place as soon as possible, and endorsed a set of implementation actions, the establishment of a project implementation committee under the auspices of COAG and an implementation plan. The implementation plan includes that jurisdictions will prepare, introduce and seek passage of legislative amendments within nine months, to enable the information exchange to commence in 12 months. COAG noted that all jurisdictions, with the exception of Victoria and the Australian Capital Territory, would exchange information on non-conviction charges for screening of people working with children. While it is hoped by COAG that all states would agree Victoria unfortunately has chosen to be excluded from the operation of the exchange of criminal history information. It must be said that I find the Victorian approach disappointing but hardly surprising. I say that because Victoria has a charter of human rights. That document allows judges to overrule the decisions of elected representatives in many cases. This raises an interesting point given the Commonwealth government’s commitment to more jobs for lawyers and slower decision-making also known as a federal charter for human rights. As Senator Brandis has pointed out, the issues that Victoria needs elite lawyers and judges to decide are in fact those that should be decided by elected representatives. If the Rudd government wants a charter of human rights then, unlike Victoria, it should have a referendum to ask the people. I make the point for Western Australians that, with regard to illegal immigrants, any move back by the coalition to strong border controls could be overruled by judges. Also, the popular WA mandatory sentencing laws for assaults on public officials would be a target for lawyers and judges under the charter of human rights. In fact, everyone who feels that the criminal courts in Australia rarely dispense justice should get used to the rights of criminals being paramount. These are matters worth thinking about as the push for this left-wing icon marches forward. I return now to the matter of spent, pardoned and quashed convictions. In Western Australia, convictions are only spent by application to the court. South Australia has no spent convictions regime at all. Pardoned convictions can only be approved by a minister and convictions can be pardoned for technical reasons or for a lack of evidence. A quashed conviction can only be approved by a court. If a conviction is overturned on appeal, it is quashed. According to the Attorney-General’s Department, the reasoning behind this legislation is that, even if a conviction is pardoned or quashed, there is still reason to believe that the person concerned has an unreliable nature and may offend in the future-quite right. Safeguards within the bill include a comprehensive regime for assessing people who work or who seek to work with children to be balanced with a person’s right to rehabilitation, privacy and employment. Accordingly, the use and disclosure of extended criminal history information will be subject to stringent safeguards and conditions-as it should be. One safeguard included in the bill is that the criminal history information received may only be used for the limited purpose of assessing the risks that a person may pose in working with children-which is quite necessary. The information may not be used for the purpose of a general integrity or employment suitability check. A potential employee’s criminal history informaMAIN COMMITTEE tion will not be given to their employer. The employer receives only a ‘yes’ or a ‘no’ from the screening unit. A person can appeal the decision of a screening unit and will be able to view the reason they received a ‘no’ decision. In November 2009, a 12-month trial of the new sharing arrangements will begin between agencies that already have screening units. The facts are that the rights of Australian citizens have been and are still protected under existing laws and amendments passed by this House and the other place. What concerns me about a federal charter of human rights is that it might take away the most important obligation in this nation-that of the personal responsibility of elected representatives to pass laws that place controls on actions. After somewhat of a digression, I would like to return to the core issue of the ‘working with children’ checks. I have longed believed that after a person’s criminal history check has been concluded, the ‘working with children’ card indicates that the person has not been convicted of certain crimes. That is good. However, the question must be asked: how do we better protect our children from those who have an intention to take advantage of them? I therefore bring a proposal to the parliament which represents my own personal viewpoint. I propose that every person seeking a ‘working with children’ card should be required to authorise their internet service provider to provide to the department or the screening authority a certificate stating whether or not that person had ever visited a pornographic website. I believe that such information would seriously undermine confidence in such a person’s reliability in working with children and, if not, at least it should be considered. It is my view that the amendments outlined in this bill will provide additional benefits in the fight to better protect our children. However, there will always be more that can be doneand I have just provided such a proposal. It is always a matter of conjecture as to whether there are more paedophiles now than in the past. I do not believe so. But I do believe that if these warped predators are given an opportunity by weak systems then they will attempt to abuse children. The internet is one such weak system where predators can indulge with some ease their darker side. The Australian Federal Police and other agencies have been doing great work in that area. However, more can be done via such a suggestion as mine. A lack of communication between authorities across this country is also a weakness that could be exploited. I therefore welcome the changes brought forward in this legislation. Finally, as adults and particularly with our extra responsibilities in this place, we have a clear obligation to make sure that we do everything in our power to protect children. I say that not just for those in this place but for every adult in this country. We all have a clear obligation to protect children and to report suspicions or concerns to the appropriate authority. We should never think twice about fulfilling that obligation, and I think more people in this country could do a whole lot better in that regard. (Working With Children-Criminal History) Bill 2009. I do not think there is a member in this House who would disagree with the notion that the safety of our children is of paramount concern to the national community. The object of these amendments is to help protect children from sexual, physical and emotional harm, by permitting criminal history information to be disclosed and taken into account in assessing the suitability of persons to work with children. According to the Australian Institute of Criminology, unofficial estimates are that approximately one in four girls and between one in seven and one in 12 boys are victims of some MAIN COMMITTEE",170,Crimes Amendment Working With Children Criminal History
265,Mr Craig Thomson (Dobell) (12.19 Pm),"I rise to speak on the Crimes Amendmentform of sexual abuse alone. The effects of abuse and neglect on children are tragic. The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare reports that there are established links between abuse or neglect as a child and poor social, behavioural and health outcomes, as well as a higher likelihood of criminal offending and mental health issues. I do not think we need an institute or a study to tell us this; it is almost self-evident. Most Australians would already understand and acknowledge these links. This bill will amend the Crimes Act 1914 to enable the disclosure and use of criminal history information about a person’s pardoned, quashed and spent convictions, but only for the purpose of child related employment screening. The bill implements the COAG agreement to facilitate the interjurisdictional exchange of criminal history information for people working with children. At its meeting on 29 November 2008 the Council of Australian Governments endorsed recommendations for the interjurisdictional exchange of criminal history information for people working with children, including pardoned, quashed and spent convictions. Jurisdictions agreed to prepare, introduce and seek passage of legislative amendments within nine months of the COAG agreement. Jurisdictions also agreed to remove any legislative or administrative barriers to formally supplying criminal history information, including information on spent convictions and quashed and pardoned convictions, to other jurisdictions for the purpose of child related employment screening. At the Commonwealth level, the legislative barriers to the exchange of criminal history information under the COAG implementation plan are contained in part VIIC of the Crimes Act 1914. This bill provides for new exclusions which allow the disclosure of information about a person’s spent, quashed and pardoned convictions to or by a prescribed person or body permitted or required by or under a prescribed law to obtain or deal with information about a person who works, or seeks to work, with children and for the purpose of obtaining or dealing with such information in accordance with prescribed law. At the moment there is national inconsistency with regard to the screening of those who seek to work with children. The differences in laws and approach over different jurisdictions are sparse. In the ACT, there is no formal act or screening program. However, individual employees may require police checks at their discretion. In August 2009 the ACT government released a community discussion paper and a proposed system of background checking of people working with vulnerable people, including children. In New South Wales, the Commission for Children and Young People Act 1988 underpins the New South Wales working with children check. This is an employer-driven point in time system entailing background checks of employees and the permanent exclusion of prohibited persons from child related occupations. In the Northern Territory, the Care and Protection of Children Act 2007 requires individuals to apply for a working with children check, known as a clearance notice. A clearance notice is valid for two years. This applies to employers and volunteers in child related employment settings. In Queensland, the Commission for Children and Young People and Child Guardian Act 2000 requires individuals to apply for a working with children check, known as a blue card. This is valid for two years, and blue cards entitle individuals to engage in child related occupations and volunteering. In South Australia, the Children’s Protection Act 1993 underpins an employer-driven point in time system requiring employers and responsible authorities to obtain criminal history checks for those engaged in child related occupations or volunteering. In MAIN COMMITTEE Tasmania, there is no formal act or screening program. However, individual employers may require police checks at their discretion. In 2005 the Commissioner for Children Tasmania released a consultation paper discussing proposals for the government to introduce screening procedures for Tasmanian organisations which want to employ people to work with children. In Victoria, the Working With Children Act 2005 requires individuals to apply for a working with children check. This is valid for five years. The check entitles individuals to engage in child related occupations and volunteering. Finally, in Western Australia, the Working With Children (Criminal Record Checking) Act 2004 requires individuals to apply for a working with children check. This is valid for three years. Again, the check entitles individuals to engage in child related occupations and volunteering. One safeguard included in this bill is that the criminal history information received may only be used for the limited purposes of assessing the risk that a person may pose in working with children. The information may not be used for the purpose of a general probity or employment suitability check. Another important safeguard under the COAG agreement is that certain participation requirements must be met before a person or body can receive the information. In accordance with the COAG agreement, a person or body will only be prescribed for the purpose of enabling them to receive conviction information if the person or body: is authorised by the government of the state or territory in which it operates; has a legislative basis for screening that prohibits further release or use of the information, except for legislated child protection functions in exceptional circumstances; complies with applicable privacy, human rights and records management legislation; reflects principles of natural justice; and has risk assessment frameworks and appropriately skilled staff to assess risks to children’s safety. To reinforce the importance of these safeguards, before a person or body in a state or territory can be prescribed in regulations to allow them to obtain and deal with the Commonwealth criminal history information, the Minister for Home Affairs must first be satisfied they meet all of these safeguards in their own jurisdiction. The bill also requires the Minister for Home Affairs to cause a review of the operation of the new provisions to be conducted after an initial trial period. The review is to commence not later than 30 June 2011 and must be completed within three months. In the second reading speech on this bill, the Minister for Home Affairs, the Hon Brendan O’Connor, noted two main reasons for COAG’s agreement on a framework that allowed for consideration of a person’s full criminal history, including non-conviction information-that is, evidence that incarcerated sexual offenders are more likely to have previous convictions for nonsexual offences than for sexual offences and indications from law-enforcement agencies that charges relating to offences against children are often withdrawn, as a decision is made to protect the child victim from the stress and trauma of giving evidence, cross examination and simply waiting for committal and trial. There is broad acceptance of the necessity for some form of working with children checking and for ensuring the safety of children. It is appropriate that we are debating this during this sitting, when the plight of the forgotten Australians is very much a topic of the national conversation. The Prime Minister will give a national apology next week to recognise the ongoing hurt suffered by Australians held in care as children. As Minister Jenny Macklin said in parliament: MAIN COMMITTEE For the most part, these were cold, loveless, authoritarian places, with no time at all for the exuberance and innocence of childhood; no time for the love or laughter and warmth of family life; no time to play, to eat healthy food or to get a decent education. Around half a million Australians are believed to be in the group known as the forgotten Australians. Many of these children were subject to emotional, physical and sexual abuse at the hands of those who had the responsibility to care for them. It makes you wonder whether, if governments of the past had been more stringent in their hiring practices and less cold and more humane in nature, this apology from the Prime Minister would have been be necessary. Today, many of the forgotten Australians continue to struggle as a result of their experiences, grappling with mental illness, homelessness and substance abuse. I have spoken in this parliament about my personal experience as an adopted child in the sixties and seventies. Similarly, I have heard in this place the experiences as an adoptee of the member for Forde and the experiences as a foster child of the member for Swan. I can speak only for myself as to how fortunate I was to have two very loving adoptive parents, who continue to support me, but hundreds of thousands of children in similar circumstances were not as lucky. I was part of a loving family environment. An inquiry by the Senate Community Affairs References Committee began in 2004 and allowed many of those affected by the institutional care system of times past to pour out their stories of immense pain and hurt. This committee received over 440 public submissions and 174 confidential submissions. The first recommendation from that report was: That the Commonwealth Government issue a formal statement acknowledging, on behalf of the nation, the hurt and distress suffered by many children in institutional care, particularly the children who were victims of abuse and assault; and apologising for the harm caused to these children. Thankfully, the Rudd government is acknowledging the suffering of the forgotten Australians. An apology will at least acknowledge the hurt of these once-innocent children and make the forgotten Australians forgotten no more. In closing, I wish again to endorse the spirit of this bill. There is a role for government to play to help protect children from sexual, physical and emotional harm. Criminal history information should and must be disclosed and taken into account in assessing the suitability of persons working with children. I commend this bill to the House. Ms GRIERSON (Newcastle) (12.30 pm)-I move: That the Main Committee do now adjourn. Airservices Australia want to respond to statements made by officers of Airservices Australia, Senator Conroy and Senator Glenn Sterle, Chair of the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport, during the committee’s estimates hearing of 20 October 2009. The careless, sarcastic nature of their responses to questions asked by Senator Judith Adams and Senator Chris Back belie the serious nature of changes to air flight paths in Western Australia that are under investigation. During the hearing it was implied that I or my staff had not attended meetings, responded to emails or taken any interest in the Western Australian Route Review MAIN COMMITTEE",172,Crimes Amendment Working With Children Criminal History
266,Mrs Moylan (Pearce) (12.30 Pm),"In the five minutes allocated to me in this debate, IProgram, called WARRP, until after changes to air flight paths were implemented in November 2008. Since 2000, there have been about 19 Perth Airport Noise Management Consultative Committee, or PANMcC, meetings. My staff or I attended 15 of those meetings and an examination of the minutes of the meetings missed reveal that nothing would have foreshadowed the significant changes subsequently made to air flight paths affecting the Perth Hills area. Emails referred to by Airservices provided maps but virtually no explanatory notes. The information was of a technical nature and no response was sought. As Mr Russell, CEO of ASA, admitted in estimates: These airspace concepts can be very technical and difficult to understand and I think the lesson from our viewpoint is that we need to ensure that the information is understood, rather than just assuming that no feedback on it is in fact equal to understanding. I seek leave to table a sample of emails and maps received. Leave granted. October 2006, when Airservices gave their first presentation on WARRP: Stage1 of the Route Review project is to identify the route structure within 100 miles. This should be completed by June 2007. Stage1 involves just a few path changes, over the south of Perth near Banjup and north of Perth. Residents in Pearce are unlikely to be affected by the changes. Stage2 is looking at structure issues to more remote destinations. The Committee would like to see the environmental assessment report (which includes noise) before Stage1 is implemented. Airservices doesn’t know if this is possible, and the Committee has complained about this in the past. Some3 years later and after repeated requests the environmental report has not been received and was in fact requested again at the last PANMcC meeting of 30 September 2009. Access to the Civil Aviation Safety Authority report, which ASA say is the basis for the changes that have been made, has been denied to me and to the rest of the committee and I have had to apply and pay to get access to that report under freedom of information. Mr John Macpherson, the Principal Environmental Noise Officer from the Western Australian Department of Environment and Conservation, stated in an email to PANMcC members of 30 July: The consistent impression given by ASA that the changes would only occur at distances well away from the airport was ultimately misleading, and led the Committee to a view that the changes were not likely to significantly impact any particular group. The quality of information provided by ASA on the WARRP website was clearly inadequate to enable non-aviation experts to identify or evaluate the likely impact. A statement from Mr Dale of Airservices at the meeting on 22 April 2009 that ‘the committee has been informed of changes to flight paths at the meeting of 11 September 2008’ seems to conflict with the minutes of that meeting. Mr Dale was recorded as an apology at that meeting and there was no representative from Airservices present. In general, committee members have been critical of the lack of public consultation. I have asked for public consultations on at least four occasions. ASA is a corporate entity, has primary control over airspace and takes 95 per cent of its funding from the industry, and there is MAIN COMMITTEE",175,Adjournment
267,Mrs Moylan,"The following observations were made by my staff at the meeting of 4an urgent need to review the way it conducts business and the operation of the act that governs it to ensure that ASA has clearly defined community consultation obligations. Corporate Crime Ms GRIERSON (Newcastle) (12.35 pm)-Corporate crime is always unacceptable, but the global financial crisis has certainly shone a brighter spotlight on the losses sustained by average Australian customers and investors when greed replaces integrity. At the local level, the pursuit of development and construction company Hightrade regarding its operations in the Newcastle and Hunter region by both Joanne McCarthy of the Newcastle Herald and Andrew Ferguson of the CFMEU has my full support. The actions of Hightrade have led to considerable loss-by contractors and suppliers, by investors and by workers involved with Hightrade and its associated companies. With a case brought by the Australian Taxation Office currently in the Federal Court, it seems that the loss may also extend to the wider public purse. For the record, I first raised Hightrade with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission through the parliamentary process in 2006. However, under the Howard government, ASIC was seriously underresourced and had limited legislative power to pursue companies like Hightrade or other companies operating under the phoenix model. During the 2007 election campaign, I received a phone call from Mr Ed Mazzoni, representing Hightrade, requesting a meeting with me. I told him that I had concerns about Hightrade’s local operations but that a meeting would not be possible until after the election. Mr Mazzoni responded that he was aware that an election campaign was underway and that Hightrade could be ‘very useful’ to me. I told Mr Mazzoni that the only way Hightrade could be ‘useful’ to me was to do the right thing by the people of Newcastle, repeated that I would not meet with him until after the election and terminated the conversation. That is the only contact I have ever had with Hightrade. At the federal level there is a bigger picture to consider as well. As chair of the federal parliament’s Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit, and as deputy chair in the last parliament, I and the committee have consistently pursued with the Commissioner of Taxation, at our biannual public hearings, the behaviour of phoenix companies, including the activities of Hightrade and other development and construction companies operating in Newcastle suspected to be under the phoenix model. The failure of companies to contribute the superannuation guarantee contribution of employees has been a particular focus of the committee, with greater resourcing and activity undertaken around this area by the ATO as a consequence. Under the Rudd government, Hightrade has also come under particular scrutiny. The relevant federal minister, Chris Bowen, the Minister for Financial Services, Superannuation and Corporate Law, who recently visited Newcastle, is aware of the Hightrade matter and is currently considering legislative reform around the issue of phoenix companies. Hightrade building sites have been raided by immigration authorities at least six times. The Australian Taxation Office’s Serious Non-Compliance Division is currently pursuing Hightrade in the Federal Court for GST fraud, describing these matters as ‘the most important investigations being undertaken by the SNC operations’. With amounts approaching $100 million suspected to be in question and 38 of the 125 companies in the Hightrade group suspected of being involved, the ATO’s pursuit of Hightrade for GST fraud and taxation non-compliance is critical. MAIN COMMITTEE At last Friday’s public hearing between the JCPAA and the Commissioner of Taxation, Michael D’Ascenzo, the taxation commissioner agreed with me that 10 prosecutions of company executives for phoenix type behaviour since 2000 was not satisfactory and that this area of corporate behaviour was deserving of further attention from the ATO. The ATO’s case against Hightrade, if proven, may provide an important precedent for further pursuit of phoenix companies. I am a member too of the federal parliament’s Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services. Our committee’s inquiries into the collapse of agribusinesses, as well as our ongoing inquiry into Storm Financial and Opes Prime, have very much held financial companies, advisers, lenders and the big banks to account. Last night the Commonwealth Bank of Australia and Macquarie Bank presented to the JCCFS in a public hearing to explain their role as lenders to clients investing in these failed investment companies. The role of financial planners and advisers has also come under scrutiny during this inquiry. One important and positive consequence of the global financial crisis for average Australian investors has been the increased funding by the Rudd government to regulators such as ASIC and the more strategic data sharing and matching by government regulators, departments and agencies to pursue illegal corporate behaviour. The Rudd government is serious about combating corporate crime and protecting Australians and the public purse from predatory or illegal behaviour. Gippsland Electorate: Employment to Gippslanders and, I assume, all members in this place, that being the issue of youth unemployment. Recently a report was released titled How young people are faring, and its findings in relation to employment outcomes for young people, particularly in regional areas, should be ringing alarm bells throughout the federal government and its state counterparts. In summary, the report found that the proportion of teenagers out of work increased from 12.2 per cent in May last year to 18.5 per cent in May this year. It also found that the number of people getting into apprenticeships or traineeships has declined. I would like to quote from an article in the Melbourne Age by Farrah Tomazin, a very talented education reporter for that newspaper. The article said: Experts say the findings should be a wake-up call for state and federal governments, whose investment in education has failed to help those who need it most: disadvantaged students, indigenous children, and those in rural and regional communities. The article goes on to say: “The geographic areas where you have low-level participation also tend to be poor, and in many cases, have high indigenous populations,” said Melbourne University education expert Professor Jack Keating. “Yet we haven’t made a lot of gains in those areas over the last decades. That’s the crucial question can we find strategies to help get young people in those areas into education and training?” There is a lack of recent figures in relation to Gippsland. The last available that I could find were in October 2007 for youth unemployment. They said the unemployment rate at that stage for 15to 19-year-olds was 19.4 per cent, and I fear it is much worse now. In fact, I fear the hidden unemployment could be worse, with a number of young people being forced to leave my communities to obtain work outside the region. MAIN COMMITTEE",176,Adjournment
268,Mr Chester (Gippsland) (12.40 Pm),"I rise to highlight an issue of enormous concernThe experience in particular in Morwell, in the Latrobe Valley, worries me greatly. The last available figures on the federal parliamentary website from December last year had the overall unemployment rate at Morwell at 7.7 per cent, which was double the national average at that time. It was in that context that I wrote to the Minister for Education, Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and Minister for Social Inclusion in September this year seeking an explanation as to why Gippsland was excluded from the program of local employment coordinators to assist with developing projects to stimulate employment opportunities. I am yet to receive a response from the minister in that regard but I will be following it up with her because I believe that the region, given its high unemployment rate, should have been one of the first to have been included in that program. I commend the government for the program but ask the question of why Gippsland, in particular, was not included in it. On a separate but related matter, I will also be seeking an explanation from the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs following a decision to cut the funding for specialised Centrelink officers to deal with young people. It has been reported to me in the Latrobe Valley that unemployed youth are no longer able to access a specialised youth worker and receive the one-on-one service that they used to be able to receive in our region. Instead, I am advised that they must deal with whichever Centrelink officer is available at the time that they visit the relevant office. This means that they may deal with different staff each time. If anyone is familiar with the issues of youth unemployment, they will know that there is a lack of trust there to a large extent and there needs to be an opportunity to build a relationship with the individual officer to manage the case. I think this is a step backwards from the high quality of service and support that was provided in the past. Locally, qualified youth social workers have contacted my office to report that the Centrelink staff used to be able to arrange courses or training for unemployed young people and provide that level of specialised support which I think is very important and influential in helping some young people back on the right track. I am told that the practice has now stopped, apparently due to reduced funding availability for the Centrelink officers. I must say that I am not here to criticise the individual Centrelink officers involved, because, by and large, in my experience, the Centrelink officers in Gippsland do a remarkable job with often very difficult cases. They are quite magnificent in the way they manage some quite awkward situations. But young unemployed people do need a level of specialised assistance, particularly, in my experience, in cases where they have come from a broken home and have experienced little adult supervision during their lives. Many also come from a background of almost institutionalised welfare dependency now. We have young people who have experienced several generations of unemployment in their families and do not have great role models to turn to for how they break the poverty cycle and get themselves engaged in our community. To break that cycle we need to get those young people engaged in practical and productive work that offers the prospect of regular employment in the future, and I think the opportunity of specialised assistance through Centrelink is one of the avenues we need to explore more fully. I believe that the decency of a job stands at the heart of our contract with young people. We need to be continually striving to create the right economic environment for businesses to prosper and to hire young people in the future. For those young people in my community who MAIN COMMITTEE do need a helping hand, we need to have the appropriate support services in place in our regional locations to ensure that they are assisted and given every opportunity to achieve their absolute best. I recommend that the government looks seriously at what youth support services are available through the Centrelink offices in the Gippsland region in order to assist those young people to achieve their best. Messinian Association of South Australia 25 October, to be invited to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Messinian Association of South Australia. I would like to congratulate the Messinian Association for all the good work that they do in the community and in the western suburbs of Adelaide in South Australia. As I say, I had the pleasure of attending that celebration last Sunday, together with the Attorney General and a state minister, the local member for the area, Tom Koutsantonis, and the Mayor of West Torrens, John Trainer. The association was formed in 1959, and Sunday’s gathering was to celebrate the 50 years of this association’s existence. It was founded by Greek migrants from the Messinian region of the south-western tip of the Peloponnese. In 1959, fifty years ago, a group of people got together and thought it was appropriate to form a social club to service the needs of those very early migrants who had migrated from that region to South Australia. The Messinian Association has serviced the community for 50 years, and it has expanded from those early days when it was basically a social club for those people. Today it has a very successful soccer club and social club. It has dance classes. It has morning teas for pensioners and a monthly barbecue. The club has grown to a membership of 400 or 500 people at this stage. Many of the people who became members and were part of the inaugural group in 1959 were there, and major awards were given out to two of them. One award was to Angelo Bouzalas, who was a founding member and on the steering committee that got the club going. It was lovely to see him on Sunday and have a chat to him. The other award was to Theodora Mihalopoulos. She had served on the women’s auxiliary for many years and has been one of the engines of the club, always working in the kitchen and always one of the first to put her hand up to volunteer. The club would not survive without the many volunteers it has, and they do work very hard. I know this first hand, because I was a member of their committee for many years. They work extremely hard. They bought a building back in the late 1980s and today they have converted that building into a beautiful reception centre where they have all their functions and lots of other events for the local area. The Messinians who came to South Australia back in those days can be very proud people. They have had children and grandchildren, and there were many there on Sunday from the third generation, many of them in the professions. But I will make a quick mention of the politics that runs in the blood of these people, because here in Australia alone we have quite a few members of parliament who are either children of some of those Messinians who migrated to Australia back in the early fifties or are themselves Messinians who came over here at a very young age. For example, John Pantazopoulos, the former minister for tourism and member of the upper house in Victoria is of Messinian descent. Steven Kons, the Attorney General of Tasmania, is a descendant of the Messinians. Tom Koutsantonis is the Minister for Volunteers and Minister for Correctional Services in South Australia. Jenny Mikakos is also from the Victorian state parliament. Nick Kotsiras is from the opposition in Victoria. And MAIN COMMITTEE",178,Adjournment

I am sure I have missed someone; if I have, I apologise to them. The Messinian Association is an important part of the vibrant multicultural fabric of the community of South Australia. As I said, the association is a centre of cultural activity. We see many cultural events in this magnificent building that they have down in the suburb of Torrensville. Again, I would like to congratulate the volunteers; the president, Andrew Marantos; the secretary, Con Bouras; and the whole committee, for putting the event together. I am sure that the foundations they have built there will serve many more generations of GreekAustralian Messinians for many years to come in the western suburbs of Adelaide. Mr William Joseph McMaster McMaster at the Holy Family Church at Maryknoll on 16 October 2009, under celebrant Father Tim O’Toole. Father O’Toole was gracious enough to allow me to speak at the funeral, but I will come back to that in a moment. Bill’s family chose to write on his order of service this: That man is a success Who has lived well, Laughed often and loved much Who has gained the respect of men and women And the love of children; Who has filled his niche and Accomplished his task; Who leaves the world better than he found it, Who has never lacked appreciation of Earth’s beauty Or failed to express it; Who looked for the best in others and Gave the best he had. This guy was a friend of mine, a father, a husband, a leader, a community representative and a councillor and shire president of the Shire of Pakenham, with a rascal streak that was always expressed through his marvellous humour. He was a soldier, a rear gunner in the Air Force by choice and survived-obviously, or he would not have lived such a long life. He was an engineer, a fitter and turner, a welder, a businessman and a benefactor. Maree Dore in her beautiful oration about her father explained his deep and abiding Labor roots, about the split in the Labor Party and why they moved from Melbourne to Maryknoll after this enormous split. She said how the Catholic Church was so important to him that he went to Father Pooley and said, ‘I want to bring my family from Melbourne to come to this Catholic commune.’ Father Pooley thought about it for many days before he allowed this man to come up and live in the commune which is Maryknoll. I call it a commune because that is what it was. It is an integral part of the history of our community. As I was sitting there and Marie talked about these issues I thought: ‘Goodness gracious, Russell, you are about to speak and you are a protestant Liberal. This is going to be rather difficult.’ But it was not difficult because he was an easy man to speak about. He came to MAIN COMMITTEE",180,Adjournment
270,Mr Broadbent (Mcmillan) (12.50 Pm),"A funeral mass was held for William Josephcouncil because he was needed as a running mate in those days for another councillor who wanted to continue his time on the council. Little did they know, in all their expertise and wonder-and this is only a rumour-that this man was so well thought of in his community that he won the election campaign, ousting the person for whom he was meant to be the running mate. I spoke of one of the jousts Bill had on the council with a former mayor and very important person in our local community: councillor Kel Anderson. Councillor Anderson was having a blue with Bill McMaster over sealing a road in Maryknoll. Anderson eventually turned to Bill McMaster and said, and I mentioned this in the address: I know all about Maryknoll. I know about what you are trying to do, Councillor. But I can tell you about your community. I know that there is no sin up there, there is no sex and by the way there going to be no sealed road. The beauty of this man was not only his family and all that they have done but the great legacy he has left through his family. His daughter Julia sent me a note. It reads: Just a note to say Thank you so much for your lovely words at Dad’s funeral. It was so nice to have someone speak of what a wonderful community man Dad was and speak candidly of his larger than life personality. Dad always spoke very fondly of you and how much he enjoyed his time with the Shire of Pakenham. I know he was very proud that you had gone on so far with your career, so it meant a lot to our family to hear you speak so well of him. He was easy to speak well of. Julia’s note went on: Thankyou for helping to make a sad day very special. Best wishes, Julia Taylor (McMaster) and the entire McMaster clan. Bill McMaster was a larger-than-life figure. He was shy in himself in one way but was always there to lend a hand to his community and his family. He loved his children, his grandchildren and all of those women that he loved to go and help in his community of Maryknoll and beyond. What a marvellous life he led. What a wonderful legacy he has given to us. He was always very shy when it came to his presentations at council but we, as a community, are very proud of him, his life and his family. Deakin Electorate: Building the Education Revolution Program bate about some of the great work going on in terms of construction at my local primary schools in the electorate of Deakin. Last FridayI visited St Luke the Evangelist Primary School in Blackburn South and then followed that with a trip down the road to Burwood East Primary School to see how their construction works were going. Deb Egan, the principal at St Luke the Evangelist Primary, along with William and Isabel from prep and Alyssa from year 5, took time out from their busy day to show me their brandnew library and classrooms being built. The project is being constructed by Melbourne based builders Johns Lyng and there are around 12 workers on the site at the moment. Of course, this project was only made possible due to the school receiving a $2 million allocation under the Primary Schools for the 21st Century program. As you can imagine, the school community are very excited about their new library and classrooms. The school itself is quite old-it has been there for many years-and this is the biggest thing that has happened there in a long, long time. Their building works are well advanced. Not only has the concrete slab been poured, but the frames are up, the structural steel is in place, the roof in on and the block work is happening-and the kids are very, very exMAIN COMMITTEE",181,Adjournment
271,Mr Symon (Deakin) (12.55 Pm),"TodayI would like to speak in this adjournment decited. William told me that he is very much looking forward to reading books and learning in the library. St Luke the Evangelist Primary also have a new toilet block, which was finished a few weeks ago, and are installing a synthetic surface on part of the school oval, including a running track behind their classrooms, with their National School Pride allocation of $125,000. It is a great makeover for the school. It is definitely needed and will be very much appreciated. The principal at Burwood East Primary School, Jos Mills, introduced me to a group of year 4 students-Maggie, Omar, Liam, Abbie and Rhianon-who guided me through their existing school buildings to visit the site of their new school hall. Burwood East Primary School is growing, and that is a wonderful thing. Their prep enrolments for next year are increasingand that seems to be quite common to many of the schools in my electorate. A few weeks ago I visited the same school and the principal, Jos Mills, took me to some of her classrooms where the school had used their National School Pride funding of $125,000 to tidy things up and make things look a little bit newer. Many areas of the school are very old. The children had some choice in the range of colours the classrooms are now painted. So there is lime, pink, a very enticing shade of purple and a few other different colours. I asked the children there if they were going to stop giving their rooms numbers and start calling them by colours, and they had thought about that but had not decided yet. Burwood East Primary School was established well over 100 years go, but unfortunately has never had a school hall. Their school assemblies are held in their quadrangle-and, when it rains, students and teachers alike get wet. I know; I have been to those assemblies and got wet myself. So the school is absolutely delighted to be getting a brand-new multipurpose hall with their allocation of $2 million under the P21 program. I know they will appreciate it for all sorts of uses-not just for assemblies but also the sorts of things they cannot do at the moment, like hold music classes inside or have a gathering of more of the children. At present there simply is not the room inside to have more than a couple of classes. Construction is well underway. The concrete slab has been poured, the structural steel and the external and internal timber frames are up. Also, the site foreman from LU Simons, a Melbourne builder, mentioned that the bricks were being laid over the weekend and that glazing would be installed very soon. Both of these construction projects, and so many others in my electorate, are using local Melbourne based construction companies, employing Melbourne based construction workers and all the trades and subcontractors that go along with that. The kids at the schools think it is great. They watch just about every brick being put in place and every steel girder. They know what is happening with the project. They know where it is up to. If ever I need to know something about what is happening at the school, I do not have to ask the builders most of the time; I can go in and talk to the children. The principal will lead me to them and say, ‘They know exactly what is happening because they are always asking.’ It is great that communities are getting involved-not just parents but the children at the schools as well. So many children and so many schools are benefiting from the P21 program, the national schools program. I will come back to the chamber at another time and talk about more of the schools that are benefiting from this wonderful Rudd government initiative. Question agreed to. Main Committee adjourned at 1.00 pm MAIN COMMITTEE Government Subsidies on Environmental Enhancement Products (Question No. 955) Mrs Gash asked the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts, in writing, on 20 August 2009: Are the Government’s subsidies on environmental enhancement products such as ceiling insulation batts, solar power generation, solar hot water systems, heat pump hot water generation and the like, open to Lot Owners in domestic strata unit schemes; if so, what are the eligibility criteria; if not, why not. Home Insulation Program: Yes, lot owners can be eligible to receive assistance for the installation of ceiling insulation under the Home Insulation Program, provided the lot owners meet the Home Insulation Program (HIP) eligibility criteria. This includes having obtained the approval of the owner’s corporation if applicable. However, not every lot owner will have a ceiling that is able to be insulated to the minimum requirements under the program, due to the construction of the roof and ceiling. For example a 1st floor apartment in 5 storey building may not have a ceiling cavity that is able to be insulated. Eligibility criteria are available on the Department’s website at : www.environment.gov.au/about/programs/index.html. Solar Hot Water Rebate: Yes, lot owners in domestic strata unit schemes are able to apply for the Solar Hot Water Rebate, subject to meeting program eligibility criteria. Owners or tenants of strata title units should obtain approval from their body corporate prior to installing a solar or heat pump hot water system. Eligibility criteria are available on the Department’s website at : www.environment.gov.au/about/programs/index.html. Solar Homes and Communities Plan: The Solar Homes and Communities Plan closed on 9 June 2009. Renewable Remote Power Generation Program: The Renewable Remote Power Generation Plan closed on 22 June 2009. Solar Credits Individual residents of retirement villages and individual owners in domestic strata title schemes were eligible to receive the rebate for the installation of photovoltaic panels under the Solar Homes and Communities Plan (SHCP), provided they met the other eligibility requirements of the program. With the closure of the SHCP, this eligibility continues under the new Solar Credits scheme which takes effect from 9 June 2009. Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (Question No. 1016) Ms Julie Bishop asked the Attorney-General, in writing, on 15 September 2009: In respect of the listing of Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) as a terrorist organisation-",182,Adjournment
272,Mr Garrett,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(1) Can he indicate which countries have listed LTTE as a terrorist organisation. (2) Has the Government decided to proscribe the LTTE as a terrorist organisation in Australia; if so, what are the reasons; if not, why not. (3) Has there been any intelligence assessment for LTTE; if so, (a) on what date did it start, (b) on what date did it conclude, (c) on what date was it provided to the (i) Attorney-General, and (ii) Prime Minister, (d) what was the nature and recommendation, and (e) what was the level of threat. (4) Has any Australian intelligence or security agency recommended that LTTE be proscribed; if so, by which agency, and on what date. (1) Australia has listed the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) as a terrorist entity under the Charter of the United Nations Act 1945 for the purposes of Australian anti-terrorism financing measures pursuant to the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1373 (2001). The LTTE is listed as a proscribed terrorist organisation by the governments of Sri Lanka, India, the United States, the United Kingdom and Canada. The LTTE is also listed by the European Union for the purposes of its anti-terrorism financing measures. (2) The Australian Government has not proscribed the LTTE as a terrorist organisation under the Commonwealth Criminal Code. The issue of terrorist groups and whether or not they should be proscribed is under constant review by Australia’s security and intelligence agencies. Consistent with long standing practice, it would be inappropriate to comment on the status of any consideration being given to the listing of this or any other organisation under the Commonwealth Criminal Code. Before listing an organisation the Attorney-General must be satisfied on reasonable grounds that the organisation is directly or indirectly engaged in, preparing, planning, assisting in or fostering the doing of a terrorist act or advocates the doing of a terrorist act. The legislation does not require that a terrorist organisation presents a direct threat to Australia’s security interests before it can be listed. The Attorney-General takes advice from the Australian intelligence and security agencies prior to listing an organisation. For an organisation to be listed, a majority of states and territories must not object to the listing. As part of the standard process, the Attorney-General writes to the Premier and Chief Ministers of each state and territory to seek their agreement to the listing and provides them with a copy of the Statement of Reasons. However, the decision to proceed or not proceed with the listing of an organisation remains the decision of the Attorney-General. (3) The issue of terrorist groups and whether or not they should be proscribed is under constant review by Australia's security and intelligence agencies. Consistent with long standing practice, it would not be appropriate to comment on specific details of intelligence assessments. (4) As indicated in answer to (2), it would be inappropriate to comment on the status of any consideration being given to this listing and whether any advice or recommendation has been provided by security or intelligence agencies.

273,Mr Mcclelland,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:Mr Stephen Smith-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (a) In 2009-10, $3.8 billion of assistance to developing countries will be provided under Australia’s aid program and the Government has committed to increase the aid Budget further to 0.5% of gross national income by 2015-16. The objective of this funding is to assist developing countries to reduce poverty and achieve sustainable development in line with Australia’s national interest. The Australian Government is committed to the MDGs– which requires action on a number of fronts and has brought them to the centre of Australia’s aid program. This includes strong support to promote economic growth which is the most powerful long-term solution to poverty when translated into development that is accessible by all, fair and environmentally sustainable. Further, in 2009-10 the Government will be increasing its support to the key MDG areas of education, health, gender and environment. In relation to MDG 5, improving maternal health, the Government continues to make substantial commitments. It is estimated that in 2009-10, $595 million will be expended on health under Australia’s aid program, an increase of 35% from 2008-09. Much of this funding will aim to enhance the performance of health systems which remains at the heart of improving maternal health. More specifically, at last year’s High Level Event on the MDGs in New York, Prime Minister Kevin Rudd committed Australia to spend $250 million over four years (2008-2011) to improve women’s and children’s health, with a focus on Asia-Pacific countries where maternal and child deaths remain high. This includes $42.5 to the United Nations Population Fund, the lead UN agency on MDG 5. Countries receiving the $250 million and providing programs include Indonesia, Burma, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Philippines and Nepal. This is on top of substantial funds provided for health in countries such as in Papua New Guinea. The Government is also providing $93.6 million over four years (2008-2011) to the United Nations Children’s Fund and $64 million over four years (2009-2012) to the World Health Organization, both of which have a strong focus on maternal and child health. I recently announced further commitments of $250 million over 20 years to the expanded International Finance Facility for Immunisation, and $26 million (2010-2015) to Nepal to help the world’s poorest countries deliver better health programs to their people. These commitments also aim to improve healthcare for women and children through strengthened health systems. (b) The objective of the Australian aid program is to assist developing countries to reduce poverty and achieve sustainable development in line with Australia’s national interest. Central to this is helping developing countries achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Progress against the MDGs requires action across a number of fronts, including fair and sustainable economic growth. As such the Government does not earmark a percentage of aid program funds to a specific budget line for MDGs or population initiatives. Rather, the aid program as a whole contributes either directly or indirectly to meeting the MDGs and achieving sustainable population goals. The Government has committed significantly increased resources to two of the sectors most directly relevant to the MDGs, namely health and education. In 2009-10, $595 million will be committed for health initiatives representing around 16 per cent of the total aid program. Allocations support basic health care and infrastructure; governance and sector wide activities; medical services; education and training; infectious disease control including sexually transmitted infection and HIV, and reproductive health care. An example of work funded under health, is funding to the United Nations Population Fund, which supports key work on population dynamics, including growth rates, age structure, fertility and mortality, all central to eradicating poverty and achieving sustainable development. In 2009-10, education expenditure is estimated to be more than $690 million, approximately 18% of the total aid program. Increased engagement in the sector over the next few years will see education become the flagship of the Australian Government’s aid program. Australia's education assistance is comprehensive, supporting national education plans and extending from basic through to tertiary education and skills training. It focuses on assisting countries to achieve universal primary education (MDG2) and ensuring girl’s attendance. Hence this focus on education particularly girls, is also central to eradicating poverty and achieving sustainable development including sustainable population growth.",185,Questions In Writing
