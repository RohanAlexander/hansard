I regret that the references to the matter appear not to have been made in the interest of either the Northern Territory, the Commonwealth, dr South Australia. further question of the Prime Minister, and, by way of explanation, I shall quote from the speech of the Prime Minister delivered upon the motion of the honourable member for Grev with reference to the transfer of the Northern Territory to the Commonwealth*. The Prime Minister is reported at page 1068 of Hansard, of 5th July last, as having statedI f they come down with a practical proposal, we will with pleasure and promptness submit the matter to this House. What we want to get from them-if I may be pardoned for saying so, with every respect for their previous letters on the subject-is ,1 reasonable offer. I look upon the proposal, deeding us to construct a railway, and dictating conditions with regard to it, as not being such an offer as we ought to be asked consider. He said furtherI trust that we shall soon be able to deal with a business question in a business-like manner. Are we to infer from the answer of the Prime Minister that negotiations are pending upon the basis of some new offer, or which make that-supposition impossible. some suggestion for a variation of the old offer made to the Prime Minister? the honourable and learned member has than is the young honourable member for quite correctly quoted, relate to the offer Kalgoorlie. last laid before this House. It was then, about wrongs done to other people. and is still, the desire of the Government to obtain an offer worthy of submission to very considerable criticism af my,, statethis House. This involves an alteration ments. in some respects of the offer previously submitted. That offer, as the honourable has done so, it must have caused him [116] and learned member is aware, was based on a resolution carried in the South Australian Assembly. Since then, I have received a communication in writing from the South Australian Government directing I have read the remy attention to the resolution, and certain other matters, and I have received the assent of my colleagues to a reply in which an attempt is made to bring the question to a more definite issue. In themeantime, other communications have been passing, and as soon as the prospects are of a satisfactory character, a reply which I hope will bring matters to a definite issue will be communicated to the South Australian Government. the indulgence of the House, and by wav of personal explanation, I should like to call attention to the extraordinary perversion of some remarks which I made here on Tuesday last, in reference to the conI should like to ask a tingent vote proposal.

In the Age, his remark appears thusrication of the Age. When an honourable member makes a statement, this newspaper twists his words in such a fashion as to convey a directly contrary meaning. If this were the only instance in which that had been done, I should be inclined, as we all are, to charitably suppose that a mistake had been made; but there are three deliberate alterations, one after the other, getting very sensitive in his old age.

As in those three instances this newspaper has reported honourable members as saying exactly the opposite of what they did say, its conduct suggests something veryserious. right honourable member "" set."" ""set""; no doubt, under the same old instructions. I wish now to refer to another matter in connection with which I have reason to make a complaint. It is suggested in the Age that the honourable member for 'Melbourne Ports was responsible for the misquotation of a passage in my Free-trade Essays, about which I complained yesterday, because in a letter appearing in its columns this morning, signed "" Your reporter."" it is stated that the writer saw the honourable member during the afternoon, and took down what he read to him, afterwards attending his meeting, and checking the notes by what was said from the platform. The inference is, therefore, that the mistake was made by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, not by himself. Strongly as we differ in our political views, I do not suppose that there is a man in the world who would accuse the honourable member for Melbourne Ports of reading out from a prepared document a quotation which was absolutely wrong, having been twisted. I acquit the honourable member of any such proceeding. By the frequency of their repetition, the abominable wrongs perpetrated by this newspaper are becoming notorious, and I deeply regret them. It is a great pity that the statements madein this Chamber are deliberately twisted, and reported to the public in a form which makes honourable members appear to have said the reverse of what they have said. The press must be allowed the fullest liberty in deciding what shall be reported. It is entirely for its representatives to decide whether anything shall be reported; but when an honourable member's remarks are given, they should not be have just referred, on three occasions-to make it appear that something has been said quite contrary to the remarks actually uttered. We remember the indignation of the Attorney-General, which dissolved the House in tears, when a slight reference was made to something of which he should be proud, although he took it as a reproach. proach; but I objected to the statement being made as a reproach. with the honourable and learned member, and cried over the occurrence with him. What lie had to complain of was not, however, so bad s these instances in which a the words of honourable members have been deliberately twisted to make them appear to have said the very opposite of what they did say. I do not think that there could be a worse offence on the part of a reporter. As to the attempt to put me forward as the enemy of Australian manufacturers, which the Aee is constantly makinc, I should like, with the indulgence of the House, to make a short quotation from an essay which I wrote thirty-three vears ago to show that I was perhaps the first in Australia to denounce the unpatriotic prejudice against colonial goods. In that essay I saidThe encouragement by consumers of industries which prove their utility by the production of good and cheap articles is a duty in which both free-traders and protectionists can and ought to heartily unite. Our local manufacturers have difficulties enough to contend with, without struggling, as they too often must, against the silly and unpatriotic prejudice which depreciates their goods, simply because they have been made in the colony. . . If everybody were actuated as they ought to be by the desire to try a local article, it would be better for industries than a protective duty. . . . A little good feeling on the part of consumers towards local producers would accomplish all the benefit protection could give us in a far better form.

So far from having said, as in yesterday's AgeI am reported to have said, that I admit that manufactures can exist here only with the aid of sweated and pauper labour, in the essay to which I have referred, which was written about the time when protection was first introduced in Vicferred. toria, I pointed out that there were in those days 1,020 manufactories here which were not indebted for their existence to a protective policy. out, as I do again now, that the expressions of which I made use were directed to the examination of a proposition constantly put forward in the early days, though since abandoned. tion is that, if protective duties are imposed for a limited period, the industries which they protect will become strong enough to compete in the open markets of the world. tion, I pointed out that our industries could compete in the open markets of the world only if we had cheaper raw material, which is impossible, better machinery, which could not be expected, or cheaper money, which is not likely. ferring to the subject of wages, I said that so long as Australian wages were hicher than those of other countries, as I hoped they always would be, we could not regard with satisfaction the adoption of artificial methods for encouraging competition with the sweated industries of Europe. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports, when I referred to this matter on Tuesday, admitted that the industries which are protected here are those in which sweating occurs elsewhere. should be protected which have to compete with low-paid labour elsewhere. essav was written, the views in regard to what is now called the ""new protection"" [116]2 had not been ventilated.

The fundamental principle underlying our electoral system, so far as the House of Representatives is concerned, is that of single electorates. of the Commonwealth has been divided into single electorates, and the prin-ciple of the Electoral Act is that there shall be, as nearly as possible, an equal number of voters in each -constituency. Of course, as honourable members are aware, a variation is allowed from the quota under certain conditions. That is the fundamental principle underlying representation in this House-that we shall have single electorates in accordance with the provisions of the Electoral Act. This Bill does not seek to interfere with! that principle, but it aims at affording the majority of the electors in each of the elecmajority of the votes recorded. If he toral units throughout the Commonwealth an opportunity of recording the order of their preference in respect of the candidates who present themselves for election -the idea being that each successful candidate may represent a majority in the electorate. The Bill has not been introduced from any party motives. It is a measure which is submitted, upon its merits. We constantly hear the statement made that in Australia we should endeavour to secure the enactment of laws which truly reflect the will of a majority of the people. In other words, appeals are constantly being; made for majority rule. to get the electors to vote before we can into provide an electoral system for a contisure that. the objection which is raised by those with whom the honourable member is associated politically.

If he chooses to abstain from doing so, we can utter no complaint. which is in vogue in Queensland? point presently. The whole will give the House his experience as a lawyer of the Queensland system. giving my experiences in that connection. Several alternative schemes have been suggested. For instance, it has been suggested that we should adopt what is known as the "" second ballot,"" with the French system as a model. But I do not think that that system can be considered a satisfactory one from an Australian stand-point. Under it an election takes place upon a certain day. A number of candidates present themselves, and no candidate can be elected unless he obtains an absolute does not secure an absolute majority, a second poll is taken at a later date. No restriction is imposed as to the number of candidates who may come forward, and upon the second ballot the individual who heads the poll is declared elected irrespective of whether he has obtained an absolute majority of the votes cast or not. That system has been adversely criticised. Another suggestion was that in the event of no candidate securing an absolute majority at an election, we should take a second ballot at a later date and allow the electors to pronounce their verdict in respect of the claims of the two candidates only who headed the first poll. But honor-, able members must recollect that we have nent in which the population is exceedinglyscattered. It will readily be recognised that if we adopted the system which I have just outlined, a period varying from a fortnight to eight weeks-accordin g to the exigencies of the case-woul d have to elapse before the second poll could be taken. Take the electorate of Grey as an example. The chief polling centre in that constituency is Petersburg, situated in the southern portion of South Australia, but a great many other polling places are located in the Northern Territory, so that before we could get the electoral machinery into operation to enable the second ballot to be taken a long interval must Under this Bill it .will be necessarily elapse, during which there would be confusion, turmoil, and uncertainty.

In some instances the contingent vote has been exercised there, and a different result obtained on the second count.

I have circulated amongst honourable mem bers a memorandum showing exactly the method pursued under this measure. given in that memorandum does not necessarily show majority rule. ing of the principle. Under the Queensland system), if four candidates stand for a single electorate, the elector exercises his option by casting his primary vote for the candidate of his first choice. Having done that, he may place the figures 2, 3, and 4, in the order of his preference, opposite the names of the other candidates. But when the scrutiny is made cognizance is taken only of the first two candidates on the p o l l ; the other two are declared defeated. tor does not exercise the option offered him under this Bill, and votes for only one candidate ? law an elector may cast his primary vote for one candidate, and refuse to exercise his option to declare his order of preference for the remaining ones. Under the Queensland system the two candidates lowest on the list are declared to be defeated, and the contingent vote is allotted to the first two, according to the preferences. The one who secures the larger vote of primary and contingent votes, when added together, is declared elected. ThisB ill , however, embodies a modification of the principle. When there are four candidates under the system proposed in this B ill , the candidate who is third on the poll might, after the preferences have been taken into account, be placed first on the list. We propose to allow every elector to exercise, in addition to his primary vote, a contingent vote. The elector will vote for the candidate of his first choice by putting opposite the name of such candidate the figure 1. If there are three other candidates, he will place opposite their names, the widest possible selection. in the order of his preference, the figures 2, 3, and 4.

The reason for this is that the electors have pronounced their judgment-the v have shown that he is the least favoured-and accordingly he must drop out of the count. on the first count might be first on the second. taken into consideration. As I have said, the candidate lowest on the list drops out, and all the ballot-papers on which No. 1 has been marked opposite his name are taken into account. The contingent votes of the electors who voted for the candidate who is lowest on the count in the first instance, are then distributed among the other candidates not excluded. on the second vote under this Bill? it would have the same value as a primary vote, because it would represent the opinion of the individual elector as to who should be chosen to represent him.

I do not intend to draw any invidious distinctions between one class of works and another, because what is fair for one is fair for the other. Clause4 relates to reciprocal provisions for the protection of copyright within the Empire, and, I think, will meet with the approval of honourable members. It is providedWhere it is made to appear to the Governorproprietors in some of the States copyright General that any part of the British Dominions their cable news? has made satisfactory provision for the protection in that part of the copyright in books, the performing right in musical or dramatic wjorks, or the copyright in artistic works, first published, performed, or made in Australia, the Governor General may, by order, declare that all or any of the provisions of this Act shall, subject to such modifications and conditions as he sees fit to direct, apply to the copyright in books, the performing right in musical or dramatic works, or the copyright in artistic works, first published or performed or made in that part of the British Dominions : Provided that the period of protection in Australia shall not exceed the period of protection in that part of the British Dominions or the period of protection under this Act. That is intended to give effect by enactment to legislation which may be passed in any other part of the British Dominions. There is another point to which I wish to direct the attention of honourable members. It was brought to the mind of the Government after the Bill had been distributed, and is a very important one. Honourable members may recollect that when the Copyright Bill was before us last session the Senate introduced provisions relating to the exclusive rights of newspaper proprietors to publish cable news. I propose to read the provisions contained in the Bill as reported in the Senate and forwarded to this House. In the Bill as it then stood, clause 34 read as follows:1. The proprietor of any newspaper or news agency, who alone or in conjunction with others has obtained specially news of any fact or event which has taken place beyond the limits of Australia, shall, as against all persons who have not obtained the news independently, be entitled for the space of twenty-four hours immediately succeeding its publication to the exclusive right of publishing that news. I should like to explain what that means. Copyright, so far as it relates to literary matters, gives the exclusive right of producing copies of works in a particular form, in particular language, and under a particular arrangement. It does not relate to the substance of the information conveyed, but to the form in which it is cast. This provision which I have just quoted purports to give to the proprietors of newspapers, or a news agency, something which the common law does not give them-somethin g to which they are entitled as a matter of honestv. because news is a commodity which has to be paid for in hard cash, and should, therefore, be protected in the same way as if it were of a visible and tangible nature. that is so or not. The clause from which I have been quoting provides further2. Any person who publishes any news protected by this section, without the consent of the person who is entitled, to the exclusive right to publish it, shall be liable to a penalty not exceeding One pound for each copy of the newspaper or document in which he publishes the news, but not exceeding in the whole F if t y pounds. 3. For the purposes of this section a person shall be deemed to publish any news protected thereby if he publishes the whole or part of the news or of the intelligence contained in the news or the substance of the news or intelligence contained therein. 4. Proceedings for the recovery of any penalty under this section may be instituted by or in the name of any person aggrieved in any court of summary jurisdiction or court of competent jurisdiction, and the penalty sliall be paid to him. 5. An injunction or order restraining the repetition of any contravention of this section may also be awarded and granted by any court of competent jurisdiction. 6. Subject to the regulations, the Minister may, if he is satisfied that any combination of newspaper proprietors exists for the purpose of obtaining telegraphic news of any facts or events which have taken place outside Australia, and has refused, without reasonable cause, to admit any newspaper proprietor to membership or tf. the benefits of membership in such combination or to supply him at reasonable rates for imme diate publication in his newspaper with such news obtained by such combination, order such combination to supply him with such news for publication in his newspaper at such rates and on such terms as the Minister deems reasonable, and if such combination fails to comply with such order the rights of such combination or the members thereof under this section shall, so long as such failure continues, cease to be exclusive as against the proprietor of such newspaper. For the purposes of this sub-section a rate in respect of any news shall not be deemed to be reasonable if it substantially exceeds the proportion of the cost of obtaining such news to any newspaper proprietor who is a member of such combination.",25,Johnson Som E O F The Electors Section

156,Mr Isaacs,"I do not know whetherWhen these provisions came before Parliament, the matter proved to be so difficult, and the session was so far advanced that the Government agreed that, if the clauses were withdrawn, they would give honourable members an opportunity for the discussion of the whole question this session. The attention of the Government h;is been drawn to that pledge, and I now propose to carry out the undertaking then entered into. The first five sub-clauses, although they extend the rights of newspaper proprietors, afford them very proper protection. titled to a copyright in regard to any news that they may obtain at their own cost, but that does not apply to cases in which they merely pick up information from other newspapers. with. If , because of the ethics and the justice of the case, we confer additional rights upon newspaper proprietors, they may be called upon to recognise that the public are entitled to have news disseminated so long as those who have to pay for it are not subjected to any loss, and that they should consent to allow other persons to publish their cables provided that fair and equitable terms are offered. The proposal is to make some verbal alterations in the first five subclauses. that newspaper proprietors shall bear all the expense and risk of their enterprise, whilst any other person may share in the benefit if he pays for it?. poses of discussion, to provide6.

In case of difference, the question what terms are fair and reasonable may, on the application of either party, be determined summarily by a Judge of the Supreme Court of a State. It is just that the risk to which the honorinformation-ca n be pirated so long as the able member refers should be taken into form of it is not stolen. In other words, a consideration, and, no doubt, it would person may take the kernel so long as he have great effect upon the mind of the does not annex the shell. The proposal Court in determining what were fair and in the Bill will confer additional benefits reasonable terms. taken into account, it would make the person who desired to share in the benefits of any arrangement, also bear his proportion of the burdens attached to it. We should not say to a newspaper proprietor, or combination of proprietors, who have to pay large sums of money for their news, and to take considerable risks, "" You take all the risks, but must allow other persons to come in and share in the benefits of your enterprise, upon merely paying a proportion of the cost of the cables."" That would be unfair. All the circumstances should be taken into consideration. If that is done, and we protect the newspaper proprietors, not only in regard to the verbiage with which they clothe their news, but also in regard to the news itself-whic h is not now, at least in some parts of Australia, protected at all it may be considered a reasonable thing that other newspaper proprietors who have not the means at their disposal to inform the public, by means of special telegraphic news, should have an opportunity of sharing in the benefits of the service upon reasonable terms. Of course, the Court could not make an order compelling a newspaper proprietor to permit others to share in the benefits of his service, but the Act could make it clear to him that he could not enjoy certain new privileges in connection with the protection of his news unless he was prepared to comply with the conditions laid down. right under common law ? able member refer? of the information which is contained in law right in that respect.

I shall be very glad to hear what honourable members have to say as to the fairness or otherwise of such a provision. newspaper proprietors be protected? I should very much like to hear the views of honourable members upon this question. To my mind it is a most difficult one. It is a question which involves private rights and public advantages, and it is one which is open to a great deal of consideration and argument. and I do not pretend for one moment to say that it is one-sided. I have placed the matter before the House, and I am sure that the Government will be infinitely obliged if honourable members will give them the benefit of their opinions upon this matter. It seems to me a shocking condition of affairs that newspapers should not be protected in the matter of the news for which they pay. the newspaper proprietors should be able to form a combination to which they refuse to admit anybody outside the present ring. considerations which affect the public beyond those which I have mentioned. proprietors were protected for twelve hours in the matter of their news, does the Attornev-General think that would be sufficient ? ber will place his views before the House pledge had been given by the Government, the Government will be very glad to conand, in order to discharge that pledge, I sider them. have last referred have been placed before the ordinary practice. honourable members in the best shape that we can put them in order to give effect to THOMSON) adjourned. a pledge which wasi made by the Government last session.

The custom is that, upon the motion for the second reading of any measure, its general principles, but not its details, reserved for consideration in Committee. ""Upon the present occasion, however, I have noticed that the Attorney-General, in moving the second reading of the Bill, has devoted more time to the discussion of some clauses which it is proposed to insert at a later stage than to the clauses which are actually' contained in .the measure. HisI t is a difficult question, speech, therefore, involved a discussion, not so much of the provisions which are in the B ill , as of provisions which may be inserted. Of course, I was not able to discover this except as sentence after sentence fell from his lips, and therefore I did not feel justified in interfering. As I did not interfere with him, it will be necessary for me to allow every other honourable member the same liberty that he has enjoyed. I should like to say, however, that I do not think that I ought to allow It is also shocking that the practice which has been adopted on the present occasion to become a precedent. Upon a second-reading debate I do not think that we ought to permit the discussion chiefly of clauses which are not in a Bill, but which it may be proposed to insert at a later stage.

Asf a r back as 1870, Sir John Robertson took action, and urged the Imperial Government to take possession of New Guinea, but they failed to do so, and, as a result, a large portion of the island passed under the control of Germany< It was very much the same in the case of New Caledonia and other islands in the Pacific.

Very recently the officials in Papua were astonished to discover a plantation which had been laid out by prison labour under Sir William McGregor, and which had been lost sight of since his departure from the Possession. permitting prison labour to be employed in that way. It seems an admirable way of employing native prisoners. In bringing under Government influence members of savage and semi-savage tribes, it is necessary to hold some under some kind of duress until they realize what white institutions really are. . These men have to be fed and employed in some fashion, and Sir William McGregor entertained the very wise idea of utilizing their labour to put in Government plantations of cocoanuts. With his departure that method'of employing them was allowed to cease.

All that I have heard regarding his treatment of the natives, his safeguarding of their interests, and his securing for them freedom from molestation at the hands of the miners and other white settlers, is of the most favourable description. Concerning this gentleman, in a subordinate position, as Commissioner of Police, and subsequently, as Acting Administrator, there is not a word of criticism, but everything i,ri the nature of commendation to be said so far as his treatment of the natives is concerned.

285,Mr Watson,"The regulations whichSupply the natives upon the occasion, in question. But, irrespective of the consideration of whether O'Brien had a right to remain in custody, I say that the Administrator did not rise to a proper appreciation of his responsibilities when he allowed the notice to which I have referred to be issued by the magistrate without reproving him for his conduct. That notice was brought under his attention when he was asked to furnish a report upon the subject. As a matter of fact, he even forwarded the notice with the other papers bearing upon the case, but without uttering a word of comment in respect of this grave proceeding. In the case of Chief Surveyor Richmond, there is another circumstance which, to my mind, is a direct reflection upon the Administrator. When Richmond made his charges the Ad-/ ministrator suspended him. In doing so he acted strictlv within his rights. But the proper tribunal to decide whether or not Richmond's charges were correct was the Commonwealth Government. Instead, however, of leaving the determination of the matter to the Government, the ActingA d ministrator decided to bring it before the local Executive Council, of which Richmond was a member. When it was found that a number of the members of that body were likelv to side with Richmond, the extreme course was resorted to of swearing in a new member in order to secure a majority against him. a new member make more than the proper number of members upon the local Executive Council? but that is not material to the point at issue. The point is that the Administrator was so anxious to secure a> majority in the Council against this officer-the Chief of the Survey Department-that he swore in a. new member. That gave him a majority. new member was sworn in for that purpose ? sworn in immediately before the question was dealt with by the Council, and it seems to me that practically there is no answer to my contention. To my mind, that act was an evidence of incapacity on the part of the Administrator. Any sensible man would have referred the whole question to the Commonwealth Government or to His Excellency the Governormember think that, if we induced Lord General. [REPRESENTATIVES.] Bill (No. 2). ness. stand-point, the incident does not appear to reflect credit on a man occupying such a position. I do not wish it to be inferred that I am insinuating that Captain Barton deliberately went out of his way to injure Mr Richmond, but I do say that he has throughout shown a lack of capacity. He has shown, to begin with, that he is not able to manage men or to control affairs in the way they should be controlled by one holding so important a position. That is the only charge-if it be a charge-that I. desire to make on the present occasion. Coming to the question of the responsibility of the Government, it seems to me that they must have made up their minds some time ago that Captain Barton was not the best man for the position of Administrator. If they did not arrive at that conclusion, why did they consider it necessary to go to so much trouble in endeavouring to secure the services of Sir William McGregor? I admit that Sir William McGregor did splendid work in Papua. becoming an elderly man. fifty-nine years of age. stand the Treasurer, who is only fifty-nine, regarding that as a comparatively earlv age. of fiftv-nine is at his best. honourable gentleman would hesitate to undertake in the tropics work that he would ha\te been prepared to carry out thietre twenty or thirty years ago.

A t all events, the attempt' on the part of the Government to secure the services of SirW i l liam McGregor was a clear indication that they had arrived at the conclusion, after an experience extending over several years, that Captain Barton, although he might be an honourable and an estimable man, was not fit to discharge the important duties intrusted to the Administrator of Papua.

328,Mr Crouch (Corio) [7.30],"I regretmistakes, and the T a f t Commission was appointed to inquire into the administration of their oversea territory. No doubt the Commonwealth, too, will make mistakes in its administration of Papua. Democracies and republics arc not ready enough to recognise that a benevolent autocracy is the form of government best suited to coloured peoples. cratic methods is to court failure. What is necessary is the strong man with the strong hand, whose internal administration-as long as it is fair and just-wil l be uncontrolled. While the 600 whites in Papua understand constitutional democratic government, the natives there have always been accustomed to be ruled by brute force. teach them to recognise the Government which is seen to have force and power behind it . In regard to the O'Brien case, I do not know who was in the wrong, but I would point out that on the confines of the Empire we cannot govern in kid gloves. A white man cannot be allowed to flout law and order merely because his gaoler is a black man, and should not expect to be treated in Papua exactly as he would be treated in Melbourne. should keep within the laws laid down for their guidance. pears the most illegal process is the wisest and best to pursue. I understand that O'Brien was locked up on a charge of assault, and made his escape in defiance of the authorities. If that is so, it was the duty of the magistrate to assert his position, so as not to allow the natives to think that white men or black can flout the power of the Commonwealth. O'Brien should have been shown that he would not be allowed to break the law merely because his gaoler was a black man. servance of the law being required; but have already spoken upon it . the magistrate said that, O'Brien might be opinion, the Government have not kept faith shot on sight. that? in the papers. was declared an outlaw, but no doubt the interests, but they cannot do that without King's authority had to be maintained. learned member would not have tolerated tion from the Administration which is their it had he been concerned. cumstances in which, if I were a magistrate, I would feel it my duty to act very summarily, and ho doubt the honorable member for Bland would support me in. doing so.

If the Ministry think that information is required which can be ojbtained only by this means, well and good. The fact that its report"" cannot be presented before the dissolution of the present Parliament is immaterial, because the next Parliament will have a free hand to deal with the whole matter, and its memTheir traditions and their laws bers will be fortified with the evidence placed before them by Commissioners whom I have not heard spoken of as either incapable or objectionable. For my own part, I shall welcome information in regard to the best way in which to administer Papua, no matter whence it comes. We have no right to criticise those who are administernig this Territory, unless we have f u l l knowledge of all the facts. They are engaged in performing a very difficult task, and if we weaken their hands by adverse criticism without knowing the real facts, we shall not only injure them, but shall injure the Commonwealth, too. A white population, living in the midst of a large black population, is always inclined to be turbulent, and discontented, because its members have been used to constitutional government, and are not favourably disposed to other methods. Consequently, the Administrator and his officials have a very difficult task, and it is our duty to see that, so long as they do right, they are assisted in upholding and asserting the supremacy of the flag and the authority of the Commonwealth and of the Empire. one objects to obshall not labour this question, because 1 In my with honourable members in appointing this of the Commissioners, I do not think that people who have gone to New Guinea have, developing the resources of the Possession, due.

Mr Hunt, in the concluding paragraph of his report, says:I hope that f u l l recognition will be given to the two duties to which reference has been made ns being impofed on us by our acquisition of British New Guinea : the one to our dark-skinned fellow-subjects-to give them the advantages of civilization, divesting them, so far as we are able, from the evils that too often follow in tlieir train; the second to ourselves-to make the fullest use of the goodly heritage it is our privito conform to laws which they do not lege to possess. I do not think that the people of the Commonwealth know what a goodly heritage the Possession is. Hitherto the Administrators of the Territory have not done their best to develop it. I have no personal knowledge of Captain Barton, and therefore have no feeling against him or his predecessors; but, in my opinion, while they have been trying to bring the natives under the influences of European civilization, and to get them to conform to our customs and habits, they have not given that attention to the development of the resources of the Territory which they should have given.

The condition of affairs should"" be very different in a country like Papua, where the possibilities are so great, and where the soil is f i u a l in fertility to any in the world. When we compare what has been done in Papua, with what has been accomplished in German New Guinea, we have every right to declare that the administration of I do not think that any one has the former has not beena success. The Germans have accomplished infinitely more Although Mr than we have done, although the possibilities of their territory are not so great as are those of Papua. It is a matter for regret to me, as an Australian, that Germany was ever allowed to set foot upon They the island. Like many other persons in Queensland, I was politically opposed to the late Sir Thomas Mcllwraith, but I recognise him as one of our. Empire Miners are always a builders, because of the action which he took in connection with New Guinea. He did the right thing at the right time, but Britain did not support him. If it had not been for the remissness of the Imperial authorities upon that occasion, we should have been in occupation of that portion of New Guinea now held by Germany, and we should not have had a power, which may possibly become hostile-althoug h I hope not-withi n easy reach of our shores. To our shame be it said, that Germany has developed her portion of the island, whilst we have allowed our Territory to remain in a state of nature, and have contented ourselves with trving to induce the natives understand. the honourable member's argument, Germany should have taken possession of the whole of the island. that we should change our policy, and maintain the prestige of the British race, which has been the great colonizer of the world in modern times. I think that Great Britain is losing her prestige as a colonizing power when she permits another nation to eet ahead of her upon territory adjoining her own, and possessing smaller potentialities.

The question has fairly been asked, why Ministers, while recognising the difficulties in the way of the present Administration, considered the possibility of persuading Sir William McGregor to return from Newfoundland, where he holds the honourable position of Governor-in-Chief, to a country with whose early days he was associated. Frankly, from this distance, and with the light thrown .upon the position by official reports and conflicting communications received from time to time, it is impossible for a Minister to sav how far any delay in providing means of access to the mines, or in putting settlers in occupation of land, is due to the circumstances to which I have referred-the distances, the difficulties of transit and of examining the country, and the smallness of the official staffand how far to other causes. honourable and learned gentleman say that the land laws have been practically suspended ? . render it impossible to grant leases, although there has been great delay even in dealing with applications for short leases.

With his knowledge of work and conditions in tropical climates, and his capacity for controlling men, he would have been able to step in and decide how far the existing personnel of the Administration was capable of carrying out the forward policv we desire to see adopted. The very fact that we looked to Sir William McGregor implied a certain 0 Read what Mr recognition on our part of the fact thati the Territory has not made the progress we The white residents of expected or desired.

So far as I can see, the Mr Hunt called attention to the officials of Papua are, on the whole, a fairly efficient body of men. Captain Barton is a most amiable gentleman, very Sir deeply interested in the care of the natives. Further, he made a most excellent officerwhen he was in charge of the constabulary. He has under him a number of other apparently good men, most of them thoroughly interested in their work. In fact, I do not know how any man could remain in such a country, unless he was interested in his work. But there are two distinct lines of thought among those who are resident in Papua, including those who are charged with official duties. Almost the whole of the miners and storekeepers This developclaim that the administration is unsatisfactory, and is not calculated to induce white people to settle in the country or to It seemed to us make the best of its resources. This-is also the' opinion of a few of the chief offiand difficult circumstances, cers of the Territory.

461,Mr Watson,"Has not Captain Bartonpeaceful control am sure that we are all in accord that this should continue to be the main object. A number of the white residents say-and some of the officers, too-that whilst continuing paternal care for the natives, and protecting them as at present, we can bring the unused lands of Papua under tropical cultivation. They urge that this should be done, not only with a view to the profit of the whites, but in order to enable the natives to lead' a healthier life. It is an undoubted fact that since village has ceased to war with village, the physical condition of the natives is deteriorating. Nearly every village may be said to be occupied by a separate tribe, and prior to British occupation of the Territory outbreaks used to occur, almost yearly between them. This kept up the stamina of the natives, and maintained them in better physical condition than, they show when they are mere idlers no longer called upon to protect themselves. especially commented upon by the Administrator and his officers, of deterioration among the residents of those villages which have been control.

When Papua produces something besides copra, which is free, and a few other articles, which are of no concern, we shall have to consider the question of providing a market for the products of the Territory. I have no doubt that the House will then be prepared to cope with it. It has to be admitted that in Papua there are two currents of opinion, towards one of which the white population inclines, and towards which I think this Parliament is also bound to incline. I think that honourable members will be in favour of adopting an Australian policy of development for the Possession. We alreadv have a considerable area of unused There are signs, lands, and could easilv obtain more without depriving the natives of the very large tracts reserved for their use, which are carefully guarded against encroachlongest under our ment.

It must be admitted that, achave the support of the cording to the statement of the miners and when they say that manv of the traders, mining and settlement have hitherto received scanty encouragement.

On the one hand, there are the advocates of the old Crown Colony policy of protecting the natives and resting content with that. On the other hand, there are those who support a progressive policy, which, although not less regardful of the interests of the natives, aims at the development of the country, and its garrisoning by means of white men, not paid as an army of occupation, but using the land under such conditions that they can obtain a reasonable return for their labour. Papua, although it is only a portion of the island of New Guinea, is, as Mr Hunt vividly points out, a land of contrasts. It possesses inaccessible mountains and sodden morasses. In some portions it has a heavy rainfall, whilst in others droughts prevail. It has soil of all classes, and is capable of producing a variety of products. It has great mineral resources, which ought to be tested and developed; and presents great facilities for the development of some tropical products which ought to be profitable. Now that we are becoming directly responsible for this Territory, the Ministry of the day and the Parliament behind it cannot evade the responsibility of deciding for one policy or the other, and of also deciding by whom that policv shall be carried out. It would have implied no personal reflection upon Mr Barton, who has been Acting Administrator of Papua for two years or more, if a man like Sir William McGregor, so much his senior in years and standing, and possessing greater experience in the Territory itself and elsewhere, had been asked to occupy the position of Lieutenant-Governor for the next three years. It would have conveved no reflection on the existing Administration if Sir William McGregor had been asked to set our house in order in the manner that his judgment and knowledge would have enabled him to do.

Towards the The place and its people I have every desire to act justly and wisely.

It was while I was thus perplexed that I received with surprise a letter from the Acting Administrator. So far as I can judge from the date of that communication, I do not think that any news regarding the offer which had been made to Sir William McGregor could then have reached him. The letter was written in July last, and readsSir,-An idea having, by some means, gained ground in Australia that the present Administration of British New Guinea is unsatisfactory, I have the honour to request that a Roval Commission may be appointed at an early date to visit this Territory, with a view to inquiring exhaustively into the matter.

Mr Richmond has appealed. officer who appeals after the consideration of his case by a 'Board is allowed the appointment of a Royal Commission, we shall have Commissions going to New Guinea every few months. The only excuse for re-opening this case is that, as the Commission has been appointed to visit the Territory, we may as well take advantage of the opportunity to examine Mr cient Administrator, and leave matters in Richmond and his witnesses. In addition to a number of other matters to which the Prime Minister has alluded, the Commissioners are asked to report how far and in what manner the Government can assist the development of the Possession, whether the existing personnel of the administration should be altered, and, if so, to What extent. It is stated, in regard to the natives, thatThere appears to be no reason to believe that in the past their interests have been to any noteber blame Parliament for that? worthy extent diregarded, but any suggestions from you that will tend to enhance their well-being will be welcomed -between the Parliament and the Ministry, The Commissioners are also told that the question how to further the mining industry will doubtless receive their best attention. Some of them, no doubt, have had no experience in connection with mining, and none of them know anything of the conditions under which' it is being carried on in New Guinea. little about mining. He has had experience in Northern Queensland. missioners are to report on the state of the law in regard to mining. They are also told that the agricultural development of the country largely depends upon the land laws and their administration. This forms another subject of inquiry. The letter concludes with the statement that it is the desire of the Government that the Territory shall be rendered self-supporting at as early a date as possible, under which head suggestions will be looked for in the report, while its contents are not to be regarded as in any way attempting to limit or regulate the scope of the inquiry, but simply as pointing out the directions in which improved methods are possible. I do not know when the Commissioners will come to the end of an inquiry such as they are asked to undertake. They cannot deal with all these subjects in the time at their disposal. that they think it necessary to consider. their report has been received the Ministry must deal with it, and then it must come before Parliament. When are we to get finality ? a start. opinion, we are beginning wrongly. It would have been better to appoint an effihis hands. A policy of drift has existed since the Commonwealth took control of the Territory, for which both the Ministry and Parliament are responsible. In 1902 the Prime Minister assured us that it was necessary to take speedy action in legislating for the administration of the Territory, but the Papuan Constitution was not passed by this Parliament until 1905. say how the blame should be apportioned but, in view of the fact that Parliament includes the Ministry. I take it that Parliament is mainly to blame. I think that some reproach attaches to those honourable members who elevated a comparatively small matter into a position of the first importance, and prevented the Bill from becoming law until that matter was settled. With regard to the proposal that an Australian should be appointed as Lieutenant Governor of Papua, I should be very pleased to see an Australian appointed, if we could feel assured that he would prove a. successful Administrator. We must procure the services of a man who has had experience in the handling of native races. Our treatment of native races has not been such as to indicate that a purely Australian policy would result satisfactorily to the coloured inhabitants of Papua.

562,Mr Dugald Thomson,"I do notthat the clesire of this Parliament is that the natives should be treated as they have been in the past, under British control. The treatment of the natives in Australia in the past, even up to the present day, has not been such as to lead us to believe that an Australian would necessarily prove the best Lieutenant-Governor who could be chosen for the Territory. flecting in any way upon Australians. I believe that they are capable, and that many of them would be animated by a desire to govern the Territory to the satisfacspects suitable for the position-althoug h tion of all concerned. the first instance, we should indicate the policy that we desire to be carried out, especially as applied .to the natives, and then select the best man that we can find, whether he be an Australian or otherwise.

The first qualification of. the Lieutenant Governor, whether he be an Australian, or not, should be capacity to handle native races. dictum that it will be impossible to outline a policv for Papua, except by means of a Commission, they will go a long way towards admitting that the Possession should be governed by a Commission. hope that no consideration will be given to any suggestion of that kind. government has been shown by experience in British possessions of this character to be the best and most successful. glad if Sir William McGregor had been able to undertake the government of the Territory, which he so ablv administered in days gone by. As the Government have not been able to secure his services, and as it is clear that they are not satisfied in all respects with the present Ad ministrator, they should have grapnled with the question themselves, without falling back upon a Commission. When the report of the Commission is received, Ministers will have to decide two matters, namely, as to whether the present Administrator shall be retained, and as to what weight should be given to the Commission's recommendations. They will further have to decide whether we should appoint a new Lieutenant-Governor before we give, effect to the recommendations of the Commission. I am not refor the appointment of the Commission. Government are satisfied-as they seem to be-that Captain Barton is not in all reButI think that in his suitability in some respects is admitted-the y should face the position at once. The Commission may find that there is nothing to be said against Captain Barton -that he is not to blame for the present position of affairs. What will the Government do in that case?

I do not for one moment say whether Captain Barton is not a suitable man. I am not in a posiI f a spark were kindled by tion to judge. But it would be most unwhom the Government think is not would suitable. The position of Lieutenant-Governor of Papua is a most important one, in view of the foundation work that will have to be done. Difficulties will have to be met and removed, and openings will have to be afforded for a sufficient number of white settlers of a desirable character. If the Government lav down the Care will have to be exercised to guard against the introduction of undesirable characters who mav cause trouble with the natives. The desires of the white settlers must receive every reasonable consideraI tion, but they must not be conceded merely because requests are preferred. There is Personal very great danger of a conflict of interests between the white settlers and the natives, especially in a place like Papua where the latter so f u l l y occupy the ground. It I should have been very might be pointed out that the natives do not find it necessary to work, and that it would be better for them if they did work. That might be so. We can always find a reason why some other man should work. It might be claimed by some of the Settlers that they should be allowed to engage natives to work for them, and when it was discovered that the natives were not anxious to work, it might be recommended that, in the interests of the natives themselves, they should be made to work. Then the trouble would begin. Either the",57,Supply Bill No 2 Order Of Business Administration Of Papua Re Introduction Of Aus Tralian Produce Appointment Of Justices

Therefore, we should have to be very careful in listening to the recommendations of those whose interest it is to obtain labour as cheaply as possible, so that they may become wealthy in a short time, and clear out of the country. Then again, we should be very careful in dealing with complaints preferred by settlers against officials. Very often intense feeling is excited will not allow settlers to make the use they desire of the natives. trator has been approved of, we must stand behind him, unless the very strongest proof of his incapacity is produced. I say that every complaint ought not to be brought into Parliament. The Administrator should be supported until circumstances arise which demonstrate that he is unsuitable for his position. I really do think that during the short life of the Commonwealth Parliament, we have already gone far enough in the way of appointing Royal Commissions.. They are very expensive bodies. In my opinion they do not which cannot be better obtained in other ways, and when they do elicit it, it is at an unnecessary cost. must recollect that, although Members of Parliament serving upon Commissions are not paid, their travelling expenses in visiting different parts of the Commonwealth represent a considerable sum. Therefore I am sorry that this Commission has been appointed. I do not think that it will produce as satisfactory results as might have been obtained by other means. I believe that its appointment will delay the selection of a thoroughly suitable Lieutenant-Governora selection which, to my mind, is the key of the whole position in New Guinea. The sooner such a selection is made the better. The appointment of this Commission will delay the choice of a suitable Lieutenant-Governor, and instead of the Ministry being in a better position to make such a selection after the receipt of the Commission's report, I believe that it will be in a worse one, because we shall have to decide manv matters which should have been dealt with by him, but which will have been reported on by the Commission. with the honourable member for North Sydney in expressing appreciation of the speech tion which he has placed before the 'Committee in regard to the resources, climate, and. other conditions pertaining to New Guinea. But I cannot refrain from remarking upon the singular unanimity which exists among the members of the Labour Party in their wholesale condemnation of the action of the Government in appointing a Roval Commission to investigate the charges of maladministration levelled against officials, because they against the Acting Lieutenant-Governor of the Possession. its appointment. that.

We must be the most spiritless and complaisant one that ever existed. I cannot help feeling that there is something in the contention of the honourable member for Wentworth that there is a motive underlying the desire of the Labour Party to get rid of Captain Bartona motive which, so far, has not been disclosed by them in this debate. It is true that it has been hinted at by the honourable member for Wentworth, and honourable members are at perfect liberty to draw their own conclusions in this connection. I have no desire to impute any dishonourable motives., ber doing ? to the suggestions of the honourable member for Wentworth. It cannot be denied that the removal of a certain gentleman from another place would afford the Labour Party an opportunity for a possible accession to its numbers, which no party can afford to despise. I do not say that there is anything improper in that, but I do say that it is possible for an unconscious bias to exist in the minds of honourable members a bias which may act prejudicially to the most capable Administrator.",58,Supply Bill No 2 Order Of Business Administration Of Papua Re Introduction Of Aus Tralian Produce Appointment Of Justices

But we cannot close our eyes to the fact that specific charges have been levelled against the Acting Administrator of New Guinea. We have no means of ascertaining the truth or otherwise of those charges, except through an independent tribunal, which can investigate them upon the spot. Personally, I share the opinion of the honourable member for North Sydney, that they might perhaps have been better investigated in some other way than by the appointment of a Royal Commission. But the Acting Administrator .having been made the subject of those charges, he is certainly entitled to an opportunity to clear himself of them. him is not one of mal-administration, but of want of progressive administration. consider all the circumstances attaching to a position of that kind we have to make very great allowances.

The present Administrator is only acting, and the Prime Minister has explained the object which he had in view. The fact of an offer having been made to Sir William McGregor was not tantamount to an expression . if want of confidence in . the present Acting Administrator. I think that the Government are to be commended for having endeavoured to secure the services of the best possible Administrator, and I hope that that policy will be pursued. I have no sympathy with the cry that we should insist upon the appointment of an Australian, as Administrator of Papua. If the best man obtainable is an Australian, let us by is a all means appoint him ; but if a better mail can be obtained from outside, let us have him. We had first of all the cry of "" Australia for the Australians "" ; we have now the cry of ""Papua for the Australians."" Presently we shall probably have the cry of "" the wide wide world for Australians."" I think so. I am glad that some honourable members are beginning to have broader views. If it be necessary to make a change in the Administrator of Papua, the Parliament will insist on the services of the best man available being secured for the position.

The insinuation made by the honourable member is a most unworthy one. pose to quote the opinion of one of the most eminent and patriotic of Australians, the late W. B. Dalley, on the cry of "" Australia for the Australians."" In a pamphlet entitled Federation, National and Imperial, which is in the Library, he made the following statement. I not only do not sympathize with the policy of "" Australia for the Australians"" as a just and patriotic national aspiration, but I regard it as injurious (if, indeed, it ever could be possible) to the best interests of these Colonies, to the occupation and development of large portions of valuable territories in these seas, and as hostile to the legitimate claims and rights of other portions of the world. It is, it seems to me, to shut ourselves out from the other civilization of Europe, and not only to deprive ourselves of its inestimable advantage, but to provoke its hostility; and to do this when we are entirely without the means of occupying with advantage the teititories which we should only hold for the purpose of excluding ethers. true one, and the truth never dies. the exclusion policy. "" Australia for the Australians "" does not exclude white men. tralia for the Australians"" means the exclusion of British people as well as of other white races. quire what has become of the Minister of Trade and Customs, who is so frequently absent, and who has recently framed, under the Customs Act, a regulation which I consider most reprehensible, and entirely without justification. which was approved by the Governor General on 13th July last, reads as follows : Section 151 -Re-importation goods, the produce of Australia. In addition to the conditions prescribed by question of the control of Papua, I may Regulation 103 of the Regulations under the sav at once that it has been a vexed one Customs Act tooi (Statutory Rules; 1906, No. 1), almost from the inception of the Parliament. , the following condition shall be a condition under which goods, the produce of Australia At different times and from different sources [REPRESENTATIVES.] Bill (No. 2). sent out of .Australia, may be re-imported or brought back lo Australia free of duty, namely : -(d) The Minister must be satisfied that the re-importation or bringing back of the We are able to secure capable adgoods will not unfairly disturb the market for the goods in Australia generally, or in the place or town where the goods are proposed to be I prolanded. Goods which have actually been manufactured irr* Australia are, under that regulation, to be prohibited from re-entering Australia, unless the Minister is satisfied that they will not disturb the market. This is, in my opinion, a gross abuse of the powers conferred on the Minister by our legislation. I think that we are entitled to an explanation. This regulation shows the danger of placing such unlimited power in the hands of any Minister, no matter what his fiscal faith may be. Under our legislation, we have afforded Ministers power to frame regulations, and to do acts which were never contemplated. The Minister of Trade and Customs should be here to explain the administration of this Department, when we are asked to grant supplies in respect of it. I wish to repeat the statement that, in my opinion, we should not grant supply until the Ministry tell us whether they intend to deal with the Tariff question before the session closes. I shall reiterate this request for information until I receive something like a satisfactory reply. honourable members of the Opposition so dearly love an atmosphere of suspicion that even a Supply Bill cannot be discussed without honourable members being made the subject of innuendoes, which are unworthy of any responsible assembly. The innuendo which they have hurled at members of the party to which I belong is hurled also at a member of their own party.

595,Mr Brown (Canobolas) [10.27],"Som erepresentations have been made, which appear to indicate that the Administration is not as satisfactory as could be wished. I agree with the honourable member for North Sydney that there are many difficult problems associated with the control of the Territory. Owing to its remoteness, much has to be left to the Administration, and there is often a disposition on the part of those clothed with a little brief authority to -harshly exercise that authority when they are not under the immediate supervision of their superiors. It is true that private insuited in all respects for the responsible terests have often to be dealt with and curbed, and the probabilities are that even the reasonable exercise of control would lead to friction, and to many of the charges levelled at these officers. But whilst every allowance must be made for that fact, it seems to me that statements have been made which demand investigation. Those who have made these charges ask for an impartial investigation of all the circumis Colonel Mackay, whom I have known stances by unbiased persons, which makes me think that their complaints are not altogether, groundless. Last session a Mr duty to the best of his ability. I have J. W. Craig, a former resident of Papua, laid before a number of honourable members an account of his treatment by the officials of the Territory. His complaints were investigated and reported upon by the Secretary to the Department of External Affairs; but those who heard his statements, and have read the report, will hardly be satisfied with the conclusions arrived at, many of which were foreshadowed by Mr which will protect witnesses from petty Craig himself. He said that, having rendered himself obnoxious to certain officials, he was subjected to petty persecution, making it difficult, and practically impossible, for him to carry on his business, or to remain in New Guinea. he was charged with most of the crimes iu the calendar, from murder downwards; but the supposed records of the proceedings against him have been lost or mislaid, which is a very unsatisfactory state of affairs. Two other cases requiring investigation are those in regard to which the papers have been laid on the table, while there is also the case of Captain Strachan, whose action against the Commonwealth has formed the subject of several questions recently. The papers in his case are not yet available; but if his disclosures to me in the early part of who showed the strongest disposition to the week were accurate, I say unhesitatingly that there is need for radical reform in the administration of the Territory. I am not acquainted with Captain Barton, who mav [,18] be an admirable man in many respects, and yet may not be suited for the position which, he holds, which requires exceptional ability in the occupant. It would bevery difficult to find another man asable as Sir William McGregor, and the attempt of the Prime Minister to again secure his services was very laudable. But, without disparaging the present Administrator, I say that we must know what ground there is for the complaints which have been made whether he is position which he fills, and whether his officers are able and trustworthy men, who are discharging their duties in a manner creditable to themselves and to the Commonwealth. The Prime Minister has indicated that he does not feel able to decide this matter without the assistance of a Commission of investigation. The only Commissioner with whom I am acquainted for many years as earnest, able, and conscientious. I feel sure that he will do his been assured by those who are familiar with the Territory that, unless exceptional steps are taken, the Commissioners may return no wiser than they went, because a system of terrorism prevails by reason of the ruling officials making things intolerable for residents whose presence is disagreeable to them. I am informed that, unless the Commission is armed with powers persecution, it will not get at the facts. We are, however, giving to the people of the Commonwealth an opportunity to voice their grievances, and I hope that they will take advantage of it, because the sooner these matters are dealt with the sooner will According to his account, a change for the better take place. The Commonwealth Tariff is unduly restrictive, so far as New Guinea is concerned, and I endeavoured, when it was being passed, to get some concession. As the duties stand, the settlers of New Guinea will always be handicapped in trading with Australia. The honourable member for Wentworth indicated that the members of the Labour Party were not prepared to extend to Papua any consideration in this regard. If he had been in the first Commonwealth Parliament, he would know that those honourable members extend consideration to the white settlers in Papua, and even in the New Hebrides, belonged to the Labour Party. Moreover, I would tell the honourable member that unless some members of his. party have changed their views, they would not support him in carrying out the liberal policy he has advocated. I trust that, as the outcome of the investigation that is about to be made, the administration of New prepare and bring in . a Bill to carry out the Guinea will be placed upon a proper footforegoing resolutions. ing, that all causes of grievance will be removed, and that the utmost benefit will and passed through all its stages. be conferred upon the Possession and all concerned.
