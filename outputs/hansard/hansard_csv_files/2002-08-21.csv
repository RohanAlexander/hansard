But I have to say that so often of tadpoles. It is an analogy which works for in this debate I am reminded of the judgment me and I would commend it to those who, that Graham Greene attributed to the ‘quiet for understandable reasons, have some diffiAmerican’ of his novel: ‘I never knew a man culty with the concept that an embryo is huwho had such good intentions for all the man life. At the very least it seems to me that trouble he caused.’ the embryo is worthy of respect. At the very It seems to me that at least some of the least it seems to me that it cannot be treated proponents of embryo research are peddling with no more respect than a laboratory rat false hope to vulnerable people. They are destined to be sacrificed for the sake of scipromoting the myth that it is possible to have ence. a life entirely free from pain and suffering. We have heard again and again in the Would that it were so. But none of us, if we course of this debate the argument that, as a are honest to ourselves and to others, would result of the IVF process, we have these say that it is. There are huge problems with spare embryos, they are going to be wasted, treatments based on embryonic stem cells. so why not use them rather than waste them?

There are the problems of rejectreated seriously. It is a plausible argument tion of foreign cells, even embryonic stem but a dangerous one. The distinction between cells.

It is one of the funcells could create the medical miracles which damental ethical underpinnings of Western are now so commonly claimed, I would be civilisation and it was absolutely central to against it, because there are some things that the euthanasia debate which this parliament we cannot do, no matter how good the cause. had just a couple of years ago. It is the disEmbryonic research has been sold again tinction at the heart of the euthanasia debate. and again in this debate and elsewhere as Taking an embryo out of storage is akin to offering hope to those who are vulnerable, to turning off life support. Deliberately dethose who are weak, to those who are sick, to stroying an embryo, for whatever reason, is those who are wretched. I would accept that akin to giving a lethal injection. SoI say that that is the intention of the proponents.

Let me make the bryos? The difference seems to me fundafundamental point: if something is wrong, it mentally to be that those who say we can cannot be made right by regulating it. Let me destroy embryos are targeting entities who make another point: we simply will never cannot answer back. It seems to me that the know what is going on in someone else’s real moral coercion is telling IVF parents laboratory. Once a green light is given for that their embryos ought to be treated as if this, who knows what moral boundaries are they were no more or no greater than just going to be crossed in the name of science, another tissue sample. in the name of offering hope to the sick We have heard it said by speakers in this and-most likely-in the name of commerdebate that the community supports embrycial exploitation of some breakthrough? onic stem cell research.

Patrician Brothers College, Blacktown, opened its doors in 1952 and has strived for excellence ever since. It is a school dedicated to achieving the best outcome for its students academically, culturally and creatively. As the school writes in A reflection on 50 years: Staff strive to provide a solid, comprehensive educational foundation enabling each student to explore his own particular gifts in spiritual, academic, technical, cultural, social and creative fields. This is a school that believes in more than just the syllabus. It encourages extracurricular activities, such as making sure that each year 9 student obtains at least their resuscitation certificate-and most get their bronze medallion. Public speaking, debating, the Tournament of Minds and the Duke of Edinburgh Award are all activities encouraged by the school. The outdoor education program generally challenges the students to work with the tough Australian environment and with each other. The school also has an impressive trophy cabinet for its sporting achievements. The students at Patrician Brothers consistently score higher than the state average for the HSC, allowing a greater number of options for tertiary entrance. There is one phrase in A reflection on 50 years that I think sums the school up, and that is ‘real growth towards maturity’. Schools are not simply childminding services; they are places where the future leaders of our community are moulded and where they are given the opportunities to become who they can be. Patrician Brothers College at Blacktown understand this, and they have put it into practice every day over the last 50 years. My wife, Jan, and I have had a long relationship with the school. Our own sons, Tony, Steve and Vincent, are among the thousands of students who have attended the Brothers school since they began operating 50 years ago. Brother Patrick Lovegrove, the current principal, and all the staff, both past and present, need to be congratulated for the efforts they have put in and the results they have achieved. I wish them all the best for the next 50 years. Health Services: Weipa and Resources) (9.43 a.m.)-I rise to offer my very strong support for the Weipa town committee chairman, Michael Rowland, and the Weipa community generally in their endeavours to have an appropriate health service-in particular, a new hospital-in the Weipa town area. We have an absolutely disgraceful situation up there at the moment in that the hospital is halfa-dozen demountables, serving a population in the Weipa-Western Cape area of some 10,442 people. There are two other health regions in the area that are very similar that you can draw comparisons with: the Torres Strait and the northern peninsula area of Bamaga. For a population of 10,442 people in Weipa, covering an area of 14,000 square kilometres, there are 16 beds located among these demountables, one permanent doctor, no specialist services, no visiting specialist services, no primary health care, no aged care and no dentist.

In the NPA, with a population of 1,745 people and an area of 171 square kilometres, there are 15 beds in a brand-new facility, three doctors, a range of specialist services including visiting specialists, a primary health care centre, an aged care facility and a public dentist. So you can understand that the community of Weipa feels extremely deprived. I know that health professionals in the Weipa community are working very hard to deliver what they can, but it is not enough. Recently, the community offered 50 acres of a greenfield site in Weipa as their contribution towards a new facility. The state Minister for Health, Wendy Edmond, said that it was not necessary, that the community had had enough. I think that is an absolute disgrace, and I am calling on the state Minister for Health, Wendy Edmond, to engage with the community, offer support and talk to the community about getting an appropriate facility in the Weipa area. It is a disgrace that the community has to endure what limited facilities are there, and I would hope that she would listen to Michael Rowland and the Weipa community and start a process so that we can deliver appropriate health services in that region. Insurance: Medical Indemnity this morning the impact that the medical indemnity insurance crisis has had on the medical practitioners and patients in my electorate of Lowe. In my electorate of Lowe, I have had many doctors, both specialists and those in general practice, contact me expressing grave concerns about the collapse of United Medical Protection. The common theme expressed is that there must be bipartisan support by the federal and state governments to solve this crisis. I agree with the doctors who have contacted me that the way the Howard government has handled the UMP medical indemnity insurance crisis has been disgraceful. The government has turned lazy, last minute responses into an art form at the cost of doctors and patients across Australia. The government failed to act on the long-term issues until much too late. It belatedly called a summit on 19 December last year and then failed to progress the issue until it finally convened on 23 April this year. On 28 March this year, the government gave UMP a $35 million guarantee without apparently knowing the state of the budget and without starting any work to deal with the looming short-term crisis. The government then allowed the perception to build in the industry that, whatever happened, it would stand behind UMP, only to decide the contrary on the eve of the summit. The guarantee that medical services would continue as normal was hollow and without a plan. When UMP announced it was seeking provisional liquidation, the government conceded it had no plan and could not bind future governments. This sent shock waves through the 32,000 general practitioners and specialists insured by UMP. Is it any wonder that many in the medical profession, particularly those in the high-risk specialty areas, have no confidence in the government’s attitude and position on this matter? What is the result of the government’s indolence on this matter? I will tell you: (1), doctors faced with impossible medical indemnity insurance costs, leading to doctors not being able to afford to offer bulk-billing; (2), patients paying for increases in doctors’ medical indemnity costs through increased consultation and service charges or, in some cases, no longer having convenient access to the medical services they need; and, (3), an increased burden on the public hospital system as a direct result of the declining levels of bulk-billing. The government refuses to recognise there is a bulk-billing problem. The latest Medicare figures show that the rate of bulk-billing throughout Australia is in serious decline and risks going into free-fall. Since 1996, it has become harder to see a bulk-billing doctor and more",126,Representatives Main Committee
229,Mr Murphy (Lowe) (9.46 A.m.),"I would like to bring to the attention of the parliament5424 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 21 August 2002 expensive for Australians to see a doctor who does not bulk-bill. As a result, there is now greater pressure on the emergency rooms of our public hospitals. Unless confidence in medical indemnity is restored, premiums are held at realistic levels and restoring bulk-billing is made a priority by the government, there is a real danger that bulk-billing practices will disappear. Doctors and patients in my electorate of Lowe deserve a lot more than the shameful, inadequate response offered by the government to date. Environment: Kurnell Peninsula Sandmining phatic opposition to the development application lodged by Rocla to further expand their sandmining operations on the Kurnell Peninsula and to take their mining operations five metres below the surface. I speak on behalf of people not only in the electorate of Cook but in the wider area of Sydney with respect to the devastation to this peninsula. Kurnell Peninsula is the birthplace of our great nation. It is where Captain James Cook first landed and the place where Europeans and Aboriginals first met. Today, the Kurnell Peninsula is characterised by land that has been raped and pillaged, land that has experienced extremes of environmental vandalism. What once stood as towering mountains of sand have been reduced to a series of pools of toxic waste and landfill. The site is dominated by Sydney’s largest oil refinery and overhead flies 55 per cent of the air traffic movements in and out of Sydney airport. The importance of the birthplace of our nation has been totally ignored. Firstly, it has a long history of neglect. Despite its historical and environmental significance, the original beauty of the Kurnell Peninsula has been decimated by years of neglect. Sandmining activity at the site in question has reduced what was previously a large collection of impressive sand dunes to a series of pools and ugly landfill areas. The enormous dunes at Kurnell were an attraction to people from around Sydney and further abroad, due to their beauty and uniqueness. There is now almost nothing left of them, despite two very significant films. Secondly, the significance of Kurnell as the birthplace of modern Australia has been neglected. The crew of the HMS Endeavour, led by Captain James Cook, came into this area and, since that time, very little significance has been paid to it. In the USA, Plymouth Rock is a revered site; in this country, Kurnell is a neglected site. As a community, we now have an excellent opportunity to begin redressing some of our past mistakes. We can achieve this by allowing the existing sandmining site to recover and regenerate and by preventing the continued exploitation of the natural environment as proposed in the development application. Thirdly, there is strong opposition in the community to this proposal. All my consultations with the local community have resoundingly indicated to me that they are concerned about the environmental degradation that has occurred on the peninsula to date and are strongly opposed to any extension of sandmining activity there. A postcard petition organised by Sutherland Shire Council entitled ‘Save our Sandhills’ received the largest response ever recorded locally for any such initiative. Some 7,000 cards were received. The two final matters are the significance of the area in question for the local Aboriginal community and its proximity to three areas of environmental significance: Towra Point wetlands, a Ramsar site for migratory birds and Botany Bay National Park. (Time expired) Roads: Princes Highway Ms GEORGE (Throsby) (9.51 a.m.)-I would like to raise the concerns of my constituents in relation to the Princes Highway or, as some have named it, the highway from hell. The Princes Highway is the major arterial road and the only transport link for Australia’s south-",127,Representatives Main Committee
230,Mr Baird (Cook) (9.48 A.m.),"TodayI wish to record in this place my reserved and emWednesday, 21 August 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 5425 east coast from Sydney to Melbourne. Between Yallah in my electorate and Sale in Victoria, only five per cent of this highway is dual carriageway. A recent report by the Bureau of Transport and Communication Economics suggests that roads which carry 10,000 to 11,000 people a day justify being divided into dual carriageways. On average, 58,758 people choose the highway each day. This represents an increase of some 37 per cent since 1990. At peak times, such as on public holidays and in the vacation period, traffic is known to increase by 75 cent and delays of 2½ hours are very common and regular-let alone the delays one experiences in the event of a motor accident on the single lane highway. Recently, the NRMA completed an audit of the highway and reviewed the performance from a motorist’s perspective. The report found that significant advances had been made over the past decade. However, improvements had failed to keep pace with the higher demands placed on the road. Through surging urban growth in the neighbouring electorates of Cunningham and Gilmore and within my own electorate, the pressures on the highway are greater than ever before. The fact that the performance of the highway is reported as among the worse roads of south-east New South Wales comes as no surprise to the residents of Throsby. The NRMA identified 141 accident black spots in the New South Wales sector alone. Crash rates continue to rise. Since 1997, there has been a 17 per cent increase in the number of crashes on that road. More than 4,000 people have been killed or injured since the NRMA conducted a similar survey in 1990. I repeat: 4,000 people have been injured or killed on that road since 1990. Recently, the former member for Cunningham and I conducted an economic forum, which involved a lot of stakeholders in the region of Illawarra. They identified the upgrade of the highway as a matter of primary importance. It is true that the highway is a state road; however, we require a cooperative approach to the problems faced by those who use it, rather than the buck-passing between the state and federal governments that we are now witnessing. Upgrading the Princes Highway is essential to the future growth of the Illawarra region.

The forum subsequently provided school leaders from six of the local high schools, and their principals, with the opportunity to discuss youth and education issues in a full and frank manner with Dr Nelson and me, with the purpose being the creation of a direct channel of communication with young Australians so that their views can be taken into account in the policy making process. I commend the students who participated, including Jonah Hanlon and Chris Sparks from Mt Maria Senior College; Craig Hynd, Emily Absolon, Lisa Rosta and Ian Farina from Albany Creek State High School; Adam Napier, Angela Stonier, Adrian Crawford and Kim Garozzo from Ferny Grove State High School; Chris Clark and Amanda Boyd from Dakabin State High School; Robert Carey, Jennifer Tummon, Dan Booshand and Angela Christie from Pine Rivers State High School; Stephen Reibelt, Sigrid Sawdon, Chantal Baker and Marco Israel from Kolbe College. The Dickson Young Leaders Forum was a success and will be held many more times. It gave me great satisfaction to hear the positive comments made by many of the attendees and, in particular, by Emily Absolon, the captain of Albany Creek High School, who was quoted in",128,Representatives Main Committee
231,Mr Dutton (Dickson) (9.54 A.m.),"I would like to briefly inform the parliament of5426 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 21 August 2002 the local Northern Times as saying, ‘It was a good initiative as it gave all involved an insight into schools in the area.’ The value of open communication with the youth of today cannot be underestimated. As a government, and as a parliament, we owe it to the future leaders of this country to give them the chance to influence the decisions made today that will decide their futures tomorrow. The school leaders in Dickson appreciated the respect that was given to them, and in return they made a positive contribution to relevant issues of youth and education in Australia today. The principals and students who attended the inaugural Dickson Young Leaders Forum should be commended for taking the opportunity to speak directly with the federal education minister. The minister spoke about many issues, including fresh opportunities both in and out of the tertiary system for young school leavers. He spoke about great apprenticeship schemes benefiting young Dickson residents, like those offered by East Coast Training and by BIGA Training. He also spoke about the incredible success story of the Jobs Pathway Program operating out of Dakabin State High School. The young leaders forums in the future should involve young people from a broad cross-section and should cover issues including not just education but also broader issues affecting youth and our society generally. While our youth are our future, it is important that we recognise the ever-increasing age of our population as well. That is why I also recently held the inaugural forum for seniors in Dickson-the Dickson Seniors Council. This group has been formed to allow me to further understand the everyday differences that can be made by good policy to the lives of our elderly citizens. I thank those who attended, including Keith Madden, Keith and June Thompson, Jane Lord, Jean Green, Joyce Wills and Bob Appleton, for their interest in the program. In the same way young people enjoy being able to make a positive contribution, so do seniors. It is critical for me, in achieving my goal to be a good representative, to hear what these people are saying and to make a difference for them. As an elected member of this parliament, I can best do this by knowing what my constituents think about issues in the broader community. By providing these two avenues of communication in Dickson, I can demonstrate to them that I am here to listen and to act on their concerns. (Time expired) Second Reading Debate resumed from 26 June, on motion by Mr Truss: That this bill be now read a second time. Funding Bill 2002 will enable new levies and charges to be paid to Plant Health Australia Ltd through the normal appropriation from consolidated revenue. The bill also provides a mechanism for moneys collected in excess of a plant industry’s liability to PHA to be appropriated for research and development activities. PHA was established in April 2000 as a Corporations Law company responsible for coordinating national plant health matters. The Commonwealth, all states and territories and a number of plant industries make up its membership. In 1996 Professor Malcolm Nairn reported, following a review of quarantine in Australia. That review was commissioned by the last Labor government. The concept of a national coordinating body to deal with plant health flowed from the Nairn review. I for one am pleased that the incoming Howard government followed up on this Labor initiated strategy. In early 1998, the industry and government, through a ministerial council senior officers group, began working on the concept of a national coordinating body to address plant health issues. That process eventually led to the registration of Plant Health Australia Ltd in April 2000.",129,Representatives Main Committee
232,Mr Fitzgibbon (Hunter) (9.58 A.m.),"The Plant Health Australia (Plant Industries)Wednesday, 21 August 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 5427 The role of this organisation has four key elements: (1) it is an adviser to both industry and governments on plant health issues; (2) it is a promoter of international and domestic confidence in Australia’s plant health status; (3) it is charged with the responsibility to develop effective, consultative, transparent and auditable plant health management systems; and (4) it is charged with the responsibility to develop and manage plant health programs. It is an important organisation that has a key role to play in the future of some of our major export industries. Industry members of PHA cover the grains, cotton, vegetable, potato, sugar, wine grape, nursery, apple and pear, rice, banana, fresh stone fruit, nut, honey and strawberry industries. The purpose of the bill is to help plant industries fund their share of PHA’s costs. PHA’s running costs of approximately $1.5 million per annum are shared between its members. The plant industry’s share of PHA’s costs is approximately $500,000 each year. As the minister pointed out in his second reading speech, there has been an interim measure in place pending the development of these new arrangements. Industry members of PHA have been funding their share of PHA’s costs, either directly from the industry association moneys or through their industry’s research and development corporation. Under PHA’s constitution, these costs are shared between its plant industry members, based in part on the value of production of the various crops. The minister has advised that the legislative mechanism was developed in consultation with PHA plant industry members. It is designed to limit the appropriation made to PHA to exactly that of each plant industry member’s share of PHA’s annual costs. Once an industry’s share of its annual contribution to PHA has been met, the bill provides for moneys collected in excess of this amount to be redirected to that industry’s R&D corporation and be deemed to be an R&D levy or charge. This R&D component will be matched by the Commonwealth, as is currently the case. The new PHA levies and charges component will not be matched. Clearly, the benefit of returning any excess levy contributions to research activities is that the industries will benefit from the government’s matching dollar for dollar research and development funding. The bill also contains measures that will enable a plant industry member to raise additional funds for special projects that the member wishes to be undertaken by PHA on its behalf. In accordance with PHA’s constitution, PHA’s members have to agree to these before the start of the year. While the plant industries have sought to pay for their yearly contribution to PHA from a new PHA levy and charge, there will be no increase in the overall levy and charge burden on industry members, and we welcome that. The minister advised in his second reading speech that this is because the proposed operative rate of PHA levy or charge for initial participants will be exactly offset by a corresponding decrease in that industry’s existing R&D levy and charge rate. In addition, the impact on business will be minimised, as existing levy and charge collection arrangements are to be used with no change to the paperwork required for businesses or producers already paying levies and charges. The minister has also advised that the legislation has the full support of industry groups and producers. It establishes arrangements for the long-term funding of PHA’s plant health activities. The opposition, through Plant Health Australia, have confirmed that to be the case. I am pleased to say, in the minister’s presence, that the opposition support the bill wholeheartedly. reply-I thank the honourable member and the opposition for their support of the Plant Health Australia (Plant Industries) Funding Bill 2002. It is, of course, uncontroversial, and it is receiving the support of the industries, but it is significant legislation and it does put in place the",130,Representatives Main Committee
233,Mr Truss (Wide Bay,"Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry) (10.04 a.m.)-in5428 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 21 August 2002 mechanisms for plant industries to contribute towards a range of pest and disease eradication initiatives in a way that has not been possible in the past. I think it is an important step forward, therefore, in Australia’s ongoing campaign to maintain our clean and green image and to ensure that our industries are protected from pests and diseases that we do not want in this country. The bill provides a mechanism to enable plant industry members of Plant Health Australia Ltd to pay their share of PHA’s costs by diverting a portion of existing levies and charges to PHA. The legislative changes proposed give effect to plant industries’ requests not to increase the overall levy and charge burden on producers. PHA was established in April 2000 as a Corporations Law company responsible for coordinating national plant health matters. Its members consist of plant industries in all state, territory and Commonwealth governments. The industry members of PHA cover the grains, cotton, vegetable and potato, sugar, wine, grape, nursery, apple and pear, rice, banana, fresh stone fruit, nut, honey and strawberry industries, so it is a comprehensive group and there is hope that its membership may extend even further as years go by. The legislative mechanism was developed in consultation with PHA and its members and has the full support of the industry. It is designed to limit the appropriation made to PHA to exactly that of each plant industry member’s share of PHA’s annual costs. The existing levy and charge collection arrangements, as I indicated in my previous remarks on this bill, are to be used. The bill also contains measures that will enable a plant industry member to raise additional funds for special projects that the member wishes to undertake on behalf of PHA. In accordance with PHA’s constitution, PHA’s members have to agree to these before the start of the year. It is difficult to set a levy rate that will collect a precise amount of money and no more. Those plant industry members expected to use these arrangements are intending to seek the imposition of operative levy and charge rates at a level that will comfortably collect funds in excess of their liability to PHA. The bill makes provision for these excess funds to be redirected to fund research and development activities. There will be a slight reduction in Commonwealth contribution to research and development because of the diversion of some industry funds to PHA. As the intention of the bill is to facilitate the disbursement of levies and charges to PHA, there are no other financial implications to the Commonwealth. I commend the bill to the Committee.

234,Mr Melham (Banks) (10.08 A.m.),"The provisions of the Customs Legislation AmendWednesday, 21 August 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 5429 make some minor amendments to the trade modernisation act and to the provisions which will be introduced by that act, to create a system under which remail reporters may be registered and may provide less information in respect of remail in their cargo reports and to clarify existing circumstances in which the passenger movement charge is not payable and include a new group of people who do not have to pay that charge. The opposition has no wish to impede this process. The purpose of the Import Processing Charges (Amendment and Repeal) Bill 2002 will ensure that the Import Processing Charges Act 1997 continues to apply after it is repealed. One of the key purposes of this customs bill is to ensure that the various acts to which it refers are consistent with the Criminal Code. It is designed to ensure that financial penalties are consistent within the Customs Act. Section1 deals with the issue of consistency of language in determining financial penalties. Current dollar amounts will be altered to reflect equivalent amounts in penalty units. Schedule1 also deals with offences which are not explicitly expressed as strict liability offences but which are, however, regarded as strict liability. This will ensure that the principle of strict liability will apply, and that is appropriate. There are also a number of offences that this bill will make strict liability offences and that deal primarily with reporting requirements or failure to comply with conditions. The penalties involved do not have imprisonment as a penalty, and almost all have a low pecuniary penalty. This schedule replaces the phrases ‘knowingly’ or ‘recklessly’ by ‘intentionally’ to clarify the intent of the offences identified by the legislation and to ensure consistency with the Criminal Code. I am a great believer in consistency in the law and agree that these changes make the law simpler to implement from a judicial perspective. Schedule2 of the bill deals with what has become known colloquially as the Toyota case. Specifically, it deals with value unrelated matter. Item 3, subsection 154(1) of the Customs Act 1901 repeals the definition of ‘value unrelated matter’ and replaces the words in the definition of ‘price’ in the Customs Act with the word ‘rebates’. Under the valuation provisions in the Customs Act, components of the price of imported goods cannot be deducted from the customs value for duty purposes which are contrary to the Agreement on the Implementation of Article7 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994. The opposition accepts the position taken by the Australian Customs Service that Australia, as a member of the World Trade Organisation, is obliged to ensure that its customs valuation legislation is consistent with the valuation agreement. The genesis of this part of the bill lies in a decision by the full Federal Court in 2000. In CEO of Customs v. AMI Toyota Limited 2000, the court found that the warranty component of the price paid for imported motor vehicles should be deducted from the price paid and the customs value for duty purposes. The valuation agreement requires that the customs value of imported goods to be the total of payments made for the goods, with certain allowed adjustments such as rebates. It does not allow the deduction of warranty costs from the customs value. This part of the legislation will ensure that Australia conforms to its obligations, and it is appropriate that it does so. The bill will delete the whole definition of ‘value unrelated matter’ to end the uncertainty on the valuation of goods imported with a price inclusive of warranty. Given the potential application of the valuation to a wide variety of goods, this step is entirely necessary. The government’s failure to act on this sooner is costing Australian taxpayers an estimated $300,000 per month. Schedule3 provides amendments to the Customs Act 1901 dealing with provisions as they will be introduced or amended by the Trade Modernisation Act. It will repeal the Import 5430 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 21 August 2002 Processing Charges Act 1997, which will be replaced by the Import Processing Charges Act 2001. Most of the amendments have not yet commenced. Schedule4 deals with matters relating to the rights and privileges of Torres Strait Islanders operating in the protected zone. Under the Customs Act, officers can only seize special forfeited goods without a warrant if those goods are at or in a container at a Customs place. Certain vessels operating in the protected zone are exempt from these provisions; these are the traditional inhabitants undertaking traditional activities. Thus the traditional inhabitants are able to move freely within the protected zone, which is the relevant part of the Torres Strait, Papua New Guinea and Australia. These vessels are not required to enter at an appointed port and are not required to have a certificate of clearance or be brought to a boarding station prior to departure. Customs officers are not able to search these types of vessels in an appointed port and thus are not able to seize special forfeited goods without a warrant, other than narcotics. Given the nature of these special forfeited goods, there is a belief that Customs officers’ safety is at risk while they spend time telephoning for a warrant. The process of obtaining a warrant can, particularly in adverse weather conditions, take several hours. I am advised that the desire to ensure personal safety of both the Customs officers and the traditional inhabitants underpins this section of the bill. These amendments will allow Customs officers to seize without a warrant special forfeited goods and evidential material on board exempt ships and in limited circumstances on land in the protected zone. The Attorney-General in his second reading speech noted that-and I quote: Customs has consulted with and received support from the Torres Strait Regional Authority for this proposal. I am pleased that consultation has occurred. The Torres Strait Regional Authority indicated that they also are concerned about the impact of the importation of special forfeited goods on the welfare of the people of the Torres Strait. It is vital that the government continue to consult with Indigenous people on such matters. Schedule5 of the customs bill deals with the issue of remail. Couriers or freight forwarders will import mail and then place it into the domestic mail system in Australia or deliver the mail articles themselves. Due to the nature of remail items, Customs considers it less likely that they will be imported in contravention of Commonwealth laws. The proposed amendments will allow registered remail reporters to provide Customs with less details in respect of remail items. The effect of clause 5 of the second bill, the Import Processing Charges (Amendment and Repeal) Bill 2002, is to continue the operation of the Import Processing Charges Act 1997 beyond the date on which it is repealed by the trade modernisation act. The continuation will be triggered if not all the import reporting and entry processes detailed in schedule 3 of the modernisation act have commenced, and will continue until all the import reporting entry processes amendments have commenced. Clause6 of the bill has the effect of continuing the operation of the Import Processing Charges Act 1997 for the purposes of charging the cargo report processing charge during the moratorium periods of up to two years after the new integrated cargo system is required. During this time, cargo reporters may continue to submit documentary cargo reports. Clause7 imposes charges for clauses 5 and 6 of this bill. It was intended that the Import Processing Charges Act 1997 would be repealed at the same time that the trade modernisation act made substantial amendments to the import reporting and entry processes. It was also intended that the repeal of the new processes would commence on a day to be fixed by proclamation, and if the provisions were not proclaimed then they would commence automatically two years after Wednesday, 21 August 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 5431 the trade modernisation act received royal assent. The trade modernisation act received royal assent on 20 July 2001, so all provisions must commence by 21 July 2003. According to the government, it has recently become apparent that the industry may not be ready to use the integrated cargo system by July 2003. As a result, and using the Customs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002, this date is to be extended until 21 July 2004. Many of the provisions of the trade modernisation act depend directly or indirectly on the introduction of Customs’ new integrated cargo management system. It should be noted that the very fact that these bills are currently before the House could be seen to indicate that there has been insufficient planning for the implementation of a new computer system. This has implications not only internally for the Customs Service but for industry as a whole. The timetable was questioned by industry in both the Senate committee hearing into the original legislation and a later Senate inquiry into the outsourcing of the Australian Customs Service’s information technology. For example, Mr John Begley from Tradegate gave evidence to the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee inquiry into the outsourcing of the Australian Customs Service’s information technology. Mr Begley said: The other thing that has to be taken into consideration is that this industry-the Customs brokingfreight hauling industry-is made up, to a great extent, of a lot of SMEs. To some extent, the viability of these SMEs is at risk if sufficient time is not given to incorporate a lot of the changes that have to take place. Customs have been extremely active and have generated interest in computer activities, and our industry has been fully supportive of that. The thing is, though, that the industry itself needs time to know about the changes. We have to work with our software providers, we have to integrate the changes within our systems and we have to train our own individual staff. That is not going to happen in five minutes. It will take some considerable time, and we also do not know the costs associated with doing all that extra activity. So that is a concern for industry out there. The government and the Australian Customs Service indicate that the change to the timetable enacted by this bill is to assist industry. Mr Paul Zalai, of the Customs Brokers Council of Australia, is quoted in the Financial Review of April 30 2002 as saying: The extension provides Customs and industry with a more realistic ability to adequately develop, test and implement the software and communication changes associated with the cargo management reengineering initiatives. This comment was made in the context of welcoming the new timetable and seems to imply that the initial time frame was not realistic. Ms Jenny Peachey from Customs is reported in the same Financial Review article on 30 April 2002 as saying that the extension has been sought to give industry more time to comply with the new cargo systems and not because of fears that Customs’ system development would not be finished in time. Whichever explanation is the reality, it amazes me that appropriate consideration was not given to the extent and ramifications of a project of such magnitude, particularly in its implementation schedule. How is it that such a major change affecting a large government department and all the businesses which import and export into Australia cannot have been more thoroughly examined? In his second reading speech, the Attorney-General stated that ‘industry would not be in a position to implement its computer system changes by July 2003’. While I applaud the concern for industry, it seems logical that industry could not be in a position to implement systems directly linked to Customs’ computer system until the Customs system is up and running. As I intimated earlier, the opposition will support these bills. stration) (10.21 a.m.)-in reply-At the outset, I would like to thank the honourable member for Banks for his contribution.

235,Mr Slipper (Fisher,"Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Admini5432 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 21 August 2002 behalf of the opposition. I also commend the amendments contained in both bills to the chamber. We are debating cognately the Customs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002 and the Import Processing Charges (Amendment and Repeal) Bill 2002. The amendments to the Customs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002 continue the harmonisation of Customs offences with the Criminal Code to ensure that where a fault element is not required these offences are described as strict liability. The amendments also ensure that there is consistency in the way that financial penalties are expressed in the Customs Act. Another set of amendments to this bill will ensure that the way in which imported goods are valued is consistent with Australia’s international obligations under the World Trade Organisation agreement on the implementation of article 7 of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994. The WTO agreement requires the customs value of imported goods to be the total of payments made for the goods with specific exceptions. These exceptions do not cover payments for warranty costs. The amendments in this bill clarify that the warranty component of the price paid for goods imported into Australia is included in the customs value. Another set of amendments improves border security in the Torres Strait by allowing Customs to seize, without a warrant, prohibited imports and exports found on a vessel in the Torres Strait protected zone. As the member for Banks indicated in his speech, these amendments have received support from the Torres Strait Regional Authority. There has been consultation and the government places very great importance on such consultation. The bill provides a registration scheme for the reporting of remail cargo as the potential for this type of cargo, as defined, to harbour prohibited goods is low. A person who registers as a remail reporter will be required to provide fewer details about this type of cargo when reporting to Customs. The Customs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002 also clarifies the existing exemption to the passenger movement charge for persons who make more than one departure from Australia during a journey incorporating both air and sea legs and extends the exemption from this charge to persons covered by the Overseas Missions (Privileges and Immunities) Act 1995. Finally, amendments in both the Customs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002 and the Import Processing Charges (Amendment and Repeal) Bill 2002 continue the process of modernising Australia’s cargo management systems. This process began with the passage of the Customs Legislation Amendment and Repeal (International Trade Modernisation) Bill 2001. The amendments in these bills allow for an extension of the proclamation period for the trade modernisation act from two years to three years until 20 July 2004 and ensure that the import processing charges imposed by the Import Processing Charges Act 1997 will continue to apply during that extended period of time. I am pleased to assure the honourable member for Banks that the extension of the proclamation period will allow sufficient time for the trading community to be in a position to use Customs’ new cargo management computer system, the integrated cargo system. Since the trade modernisation act was enacted it has become apparent that, due to the scale of change involved in the replacement of Customs’ current cargo management computer systems, a phased approach to implementation is preferred. The trade modernisation act currently requires all provisions to be repealed on the same day and these amendments allow for the repeal of provisions that govern the operations of the current system to commence on different days. By repealing provisions on different days a phased implementation of the new cargo management computer system can be undertaken in consultation with industry. Customs has had particular regard for the concerns of small and medium enterprises. I am pleased to also point that matter out to the member for Banks, who mentioned in his speech the situation of those very important enterprises which play such a vital role in the Australian Wednesday, 21 August 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 5433 economy. I thank members of the House for their support and commend both of these bills to the chamber. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time.

Main Committee adjourned at 10.28 a.m. The following answers to questions were circulated: Indigenous Affairs: Native Title (Question No. 458) Mr Bevis asked the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, upon notice, on 3 June 2002: (1) What Government assistance is being provided to native title corporations in managing native title lands post determinations. (2) Has funding been allocated specifically for training of registered native title bodies corporate to ensure that native title lands can be managed sustainably so as to generate a viable income; if so, what sum; if not, will funds be provided through the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission and the Indigenous Land Corporation. (1) The Government provides direct funding to native title representative bodies via the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) for those bodies to perform their statutory functions. Those statutory functions include the provision of facilitation and assistance, dispute resolution, notification, internal review and other functions in respect of registered native title bodies corporate (RNTBCs). In 2001-02, the Government provided $43.66 million to ATSIC for that purpose and will provide a similar amount in 2002-03. ATSIC will also receive an additional $4.7 million from the Government in the 2002-03 financial year for the specific purpose of improving the capacity of representative bodies to deal with native title matters and for strategic litigation. consideration of matters such as the operational and establishment costs to RNTBCs of performing their functions under the NTA and complying with other regulatory requirements. (2) No funding has been allocated specifically for training of registered native title bodies corporate (RNTBCs) and the Government has not yet considered the issue of whether to provide such funding through ATSIC and the Indigenous Land Corporation. Isaacs Electorate: Nursing Home Beds (Question No. 477) Ms Corcoran asked the Minister for Ageing, upon notice, on 5 June 2002: (1) On most recent data, how many nursing home beds are there in the electoral division of Isaacs. (2) On most recent data, how many of these beds are in use. (3) On most recent data, how many beds have been allocated in the electoral division of Isaacs which are yet to be occupied. (4) Of the beds that are yet to be occupied, when were these bed licences allocated. (1) The electorate of Isaacs is part of the Southern Metropolitan Aged Care Planning Region.
