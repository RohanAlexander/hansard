The letter is as follows:I have been advised to write to you and explain my case. I was invalided home from France with V.D.H. of the heart and trench feet. Two years ago I received 15s. per week pension, and went to work as groom in a coal mine.

We cannot afford to let the men who fought for us be treated in this way. I have nothing to say in regard to the taking away of pensions from men who have been fully lestored to health, but I claim that they should be granted to men who are still suffering. I believe that over 90 per cent, of the staff of the Repatriation Department and the War Service Homes Department are returned soldiers. that is that there is too much Army routine about administration. accepting these positions it was the worse, thing that could have happened to the They would administration of these Departments",20,Adjournment

15,Mr Charlton,"Yes. When webeen left in the hands of more capable officers. member for Illawarra ( Mr Lamond) has just interjected, the officials in these Departments have got into a military routine, and imagine that eVerything can be done in a mechanical way without giving proper consideration to the matters which come before them. The returned soldiers are suffering from the application of that method. As I have often said, I pledged my word, to see that justice was done to the. men. who went to the Front, and as long as I remain in this HouseI am going to do as much as I can in their interests. Therefore, I call upon the Government, who were so lavish in their promises for returned soldiers, particularly in respect of pensions, to take a hand in this matter, and not allow understrappers to continue to run the Repatriation Department. the administration of pensions, on a proper footing, and see that justice is done to the men who are suffering to-day. It may be said that because this Parliament enacted legislation which does not give the Minister the fullest possible power to control the administration of the Repatriation Department, his hands are tied, but, as a matter of fact, the hands of a Minister are never tied, because if an Act under which a Department is administered prove uni satisfactory^ it can easily be amended. This House and the Minister who is 're. sponsible to it should always have the fullest control over any Government Department. little encouragement from the honourable member's party in connection with a matter concerning another Department. Repatriation Department has shown, beyond all shadow of doubt, that there is room for improvement, and, if the Minister feels that there is need, for amendment of the Act, I am sure that this -House, within less than half-an-hour, would give him whatever legislation he deemed necessary in the interests of the soldiers. However, I ask him to make a searching inquiry into this Department, as well as the War Service Homes administration.* If he does so he will not require me, Or any other honourable member, to furnish him with specific cases of inAs the honourable justice, because he will find them by the bushel in the files. In the meantime, will he ask his officers for a return as to the number of men receiving war pensions at the time that they were ad' ministered by the Treasury, the number receiving pensions at the present time, and the number who, after receiving them, have had them curtailed since the transfer of the control of pensions to the Repatriation Department? ingly. numerous in other electorates as they are in the Hunter division, the total number will be very large. However, I trust that the Minister, if he has not sufficient power to deal with the administration of his Department will come to the House and They ought to put ask it to amend the Act in order to place' affairs on a more satisfactory footing. I regret that the honourable member who introduced the subject-matter of this discussion did not give honourable members some indication of his intention. There are numbers on all sides of the House who are prepared, given a little time in which to get their material together, to show that administration in connection with the affairs 'of the returned soldier has been by no means whai was promised. In the Pensions Branch there are many cases of very severe hardship. I have a sheaf of letters a foot or two deep emanating from all the States, and, had I been given opportunity to prepare, I would have selected a number of the most moving cases from which to quote. However, I have one or two at hand from which I shall draw, and which will be sufficient, I think, to support my criticisms. I have a communication from the secretary of one of the State branches of the Officers' Widows and Dependants' Association. If there are any people who should receive reasonable treatment at the hands of a Government who have promised to extend it , they are the widows of officers who fell at the Front. ticularly the dependants of ofiicers.

Their husbands went to the war with the promises of a generous Government in their minds.; but their widows and orphans have been left practically without support, and with no ordinary knowledge and experience or general means wherewith to make a living. The position of some of these widows is not only individually disastrous, but amounts to a grave discredit to Australia. Here is the substance of the letter from the Officers' Widows and Dependants Association:I have to inform you that the Prime Minister was approached immediately after the new year, and stated that the matter would be looked into. Nothing further apparently has happened, and, if allowed to rest, it may be overlooked. There is indicated the pathetic hope that something will be done. But we know that nothing is being done or has been done. The sufferings of the dependants of some of our returned men, and of those who have fallen, are sueh that if I were administering the Department I would be unable to sleep at night. Letters similar in character to that which I have quoted have reached me from the branches of the same organization in Western Australia and New South Wales. ' I believe, indeed, that in every State-mor e shame to Australia-ther e are women who have been gently reared, and are not fitted for the struggle of life, who have been left without any one to protect them; and the Government are not fulfilling their undertaking to oc<mpy the position of their protectors. Not only the widqws and orphans, but in many cases returned soldiers themselves have grave causes for complaint in respect of the dealings of the Government. Here is another typical letter:Your letter to hand, 27th March, 1921, from Department of Eepatriation, for which I thank you for the trouble you have taken on my behalf, although it is not satisfactory to me. The letter states that I have lost only one-tenth incapacity, but I may state here that I have lost one finger and another is damaged and at times quite useless to me, and I think, at least that 8s. 3d. per fortnight is hardly enough for a married man who has got to depend on his hands. Thanking you for your kindness. This generous Pensions Department, in respect to whose activities the Government were so lavish in their promises, gives an injured married man, who has. to make his living with his hands. 8s. 3d. per fortnight with which to help maintain his family. 'Examples such as this could be multiplied by'hundreds, if not by thousands, by honourable members generally. I want to see that the Government accept their voluntarily undertaken responsibilities. They have failed in their administration of returned, soldiers' affairs, and, unless they wake up to the facts, very soon the position in Australia will be . ] ""I IfltfJ much more serious than any one qares to anticipate. [11.26] I also, like the honourable member for -Robertson ( Mr Fleming), regret that honourable members generally were not made aware Of the intended introduction of a discussion upon the subject-matter of pensions this morning. Had notice been given me, I , too, would have been prepared with numbers of striking individual causes of complaint. I cannot, however, take up the position of the honourable member who has just resumed his seat with regard to the responsibility of the Government, although, if I cared to do so, I could show that I am in a much stronger position than he, for he was one of those honourable members who insisted on compliance with the soldiers' demand for independent tribunals to administer the matters in which they were involved, free of political control. I never conceded the right of the soldiers to take these matters away from the purview of the representatives of the people in this Parliament. voted for pensions to be taken over by the Department which is now handling them. true; but I was not going to put the present Government out and the honourable member's party into power merely because a majority of honourable members took up an attitude in connection with the administration of pensions of which I did not personally approve. I would point out to the honourable member for Robertson that, against whoever these charges in regard to the administration of pensions and soldiers' matters generally",22,Adjournment

24,Mr Tudob,-The honourable member,23,Adjournment
25,Mr Hector Lamond,"That ismay lie to-day, they cannot be levelled at Ministers, from whom this Parliament deliberately took control. else that the honourable member for Robertson said, and in all that I heard the honton) say, I concur. Administration today is infinitely worse under the controlling body demanded by the returned soldiers themselves than it. was under the authority of responsible Ministers, and we are. in the unhappy position that, while under the system of responsible government we were able to make our opinions known and felt, the administration sof the tribunals now in control are beyond the reach of Parliament. I hope that this morning's criticisms will result in a return to correct methods of control. I understand that a direction has been issued to medical ofiicers in relation to their determinations concerning whether soldiers are suffering from incapacity due to the war. That instruction., I am told, is of such a nature that the medical ofncials are not free to act as they could have done formerly. If such is the case, the responsible Minister should discover the facts, and take action. orable members that I know nothing of this. vinced of that; but, from the cases which have come under the notice of all honourable members, it is apparent that there is some determination ""on the part of those controlling the administration of pensions at present to cut out, or, at any rate, to cut down numbers of individual pensions in order to show better financial results than hitherto. I know of a specific instance in which a soldier had been receiving a pension because of his incapacity. He was called before examining officials, however, and his pension was reduced to such an extent that it is practically useless. That man is fighting for his life. He is unable to work, and, therefore, is not in a position to buy much thab is needful to him. These are not isolated cases. The fact that there are scores of them in every electorate suggests that they must be all part of a carefully devised plan. They cannot be due to accident. I can well understand that one or two such cases might creep in under the wisest administration; but the widespread cancellation of pensions, without the soldiers concerned being given any reason for their cancellation or afforded an opportunity In everything of being heard before cancellation, and the fact 'that outside doctors have certified that a soldier is suffering because of war servioe and unable to work, while official doctors of the Department haye said that he is not suffering on account of war service and is able to work, go to indicate that within the Department itself there is a determined effort to deny to the soldier his rights. I feel sure that the Minister, knowing as he must do, after this debate, the general character of the complaints against the administration of the Department, will exercise such powers as remain to him to see either that this condition of affairs is remedied within the present Department, or that the powers df that Department are taken away and the whole system restored to the control of a responsible Minister. is generally admitted that the administration of pensions to soldiers and dependants of soldiers is in a most lamentable condition. Ib is not for me to say with whom the fault rests; but it ie the duty of the Government and of honourable members on all sides of the House to see that the complaints are dealt witb and justice meted out. Here is the case of a soldier named Lawrence, now living at Leichhardt', Sydney. After about four years' service at the Front he came back an almost helpless shell-shock case. For nearly two yearsthatvinan has not been receiving a penny from the Department, and he can get no satisfaction from it or its medical officers. Private medical men who have examined him -say that he is quite incapable of working, and he is in such a pitiable condition that as I told the Controller in Sydney, "" it almost gives one the creeps fco look at him. He is a married man with a family, and yet because 'the medical authorities of the' Departmenthavesome idea that his case is not what it deems to me, although private medical men have assured me that it is quitegenuine, he is not receiving any assistance from the Department. A ""committeeof business men in Leichhardt took up his. case, but after dealing with it for some time found it impossible to obtain any satisfaction and asked me to assist them..

The authorities in Sydney said that the case would have to be referred to the head office in Melbourne for consideration. "" Melbourne "" has been sitting on it for the last six weeks. Meanwhile this man and hia wife are receiving nothing. The man cannot work, and the woman has to go out to work to maintain her soldier husband who 1 fought for his country.

Do to this man the justice that he did to his country. As illustrating the attitude generally adopted by the Government towards our returned soldiers, I propose to relate to the House the action taken by New South ""Wales members of the Labour party in reference to soldiers' grievances. We held a meeting of our party in Sydney, after representations had been made to us by soldiers and the dependants of soldiers, and decided by resolution to wait upon the only Commonwealth Minister then in Sydney-the Treasurer ( Sir Joseph Cook)-and place before him the complaints that had been submitted to us. The honourable member for South Sydney( Mr Riley), the honourable member for Gwydir( Mr Cunningham), and I were deputed by our party to place the facts before the Treasurer. Wie did so, and were told by him that we had better submit our complaints to him in the form of a memorandum. If we did that, he said, he would take the memorandum tp Melbourne, and place it before the Cabinet and the Department.. We reported to our party, and subsequently drew up a memorandum which we presented to the Treasurer on 1st February last. From that day to this we have not had one word from him, the responsible Minister, or the head of the Department in reference to these complaints. cannot say that he has ever submitted to tribunal, it'was said to be a "" camouflage "" me a case with which I have not dealt. memorandum to the Treasurer who, as I have said, was the only Commonwealth Minister then in Sydney, and he promised to bring it before the Cabinet.

That telegram has not even been acknowThe memorandum which we submitted to the Treasurer was as A meeting of members of the Federal Parliamentary Labour party was held at the Commonwealth Bank Buildings, in Sydney, on Tuesday, 1st February, and resolutions were passed which were subsequently placed before the Treasurer, the Bight Honourable Sir Joseph Cook, by representatives of the meeting, Messrs. Riley, M.P., Mahony, M.P., and Cunningham, M.P. The members of the Par. liamentary Labour party complained of the following matters :(1) The reduction and practical discontinuance of the living allowance of mothers, widows, and other dependants of deceased soldiers, by reason pf a regulation issued by the Repatriation Commissioners, fixing the maximum amount which could be drawn, including pension, was not to exceed 35s. per week, &c. (2) The reduction of military pension by reason of the receipt of an invalid and old-age pension. When provision was made by Parliament for the granting of pensions to widows and other dependants ' of deceased soldiers, it was distinctly understood that such pensions were not to be reduced by reason of the receipt of invalid and old-age pensions, and it is claimed that the will of Parliament Bhould be carried out in the spirit in which the Act providing for military pensions was passed.

That would be giving the soldier what every' Democrat desires to give him, namely, a civil right over a military right. In Western Australia he has had that right and is satisfied. I know that before the pensions I were controlled by the Repatriation Department the medical referees rejected cases which subsequently came before me as Complaints Officer, and on many occasions, after I have explained the circumstances to the medical officers, they have reviewed their decisions. If any instruction, such as has been referred to by the honourable member for Hunter( Mr scribe certain financial limitations. Charlton) has been issued by the administrative head, who is a soldier, the Minister"" should see that the regulation is revised in the interests of the men who fought for this country, and by their sacrifices made it possible for this Parliament to be in session to-day. I endorse the remarks made by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie ( Mr Foley). People have come to me and complained about their pensions having been cut down, and investigation has revealed many cases of hardship. One man, who enlisted from the New South Wales Railway Department, returned from the war invalided.

He returned -to the Railway Department, -and, on being examined by two Governanent doctors, he was rejected for employment in the service because he was not physically fit. I sent to headquarters an appeal against the treatment this man received, but he has obtained no redress, although he is a married man with a young family. Cases such as his are the most heart-breaking that honourable members have to deal with.

If a widow who is an old-age pensioner cashes her war bond her pension is immediately cut down. That was never intended by Parliament, and paragraph 7 of the rules printed on the back of the bond states that upon no consideration will a pension be reduced on account of the cashing of the bond. Who gave instructions that the pension should be cut down in those circumstances ?

I admit that in the administration of the war pensions many cases of hardship, which called for Tedress, have been brought to my notice, and I , personally, am doing everything within my power, which is limited, to see that those cases are dealt with as speedily and equitably as possible. But I take very great exception to the statement .made by the honourable member for Robertson ( Mr Fleming), that the Government have failed in their duty to the soldier.

In fact, I intended to bring the case under the notice f of the Minister before mentioning it in the House; but, inasmuch as the honourable member has raised a discussion on this question,. and the Minister has replied, I shall take this opportunity of dealing with it . The widow concerned was the wife of a medical officer who lost his life at the war. She was receiving a pension of £2 10s. a week, but it has now been reduced to £1 15s. a week. I want to know who is responsible for making that reduction, and whether the Minister considers the amount adequate? The country must do justice to the dependants of deceased soldiers. money we spend on repatriation generally, and upon the building of war service homes, is an indication that this Parliament is. willing to do that justice, but it is no indication that each and every dependant is receiving fair .treatment compared with the total amount spent, or compared with what others are receiving.

I did not say that it had been taken out of my hands. to provide a remedy. I cannot deal with the Commissioner or with any of the officials. I agree perfectly with the honourable member for Hunter when he says that the soldiers have not received sympathetic consideration from some of the officials of the Departments who are returned men. I have never advocated that soldiers should be appointed to these positions quite apart from their ability or capacity to do the work they are called upon to perform. There are officials in the Repatriation Department and the War Service Homes Department who are absolutely unfitted .for their positions, and who give no sympathetic treatment to other soldiers who approach them. There are some in the Department who could not get a job elsewhere. The good men who returned from the Front were speedily picked up by employers. Those who could not get jobs elsewhere were put into Government Departments. They are not fit to wear one stripe as soldiers. They have no sympathy for the men who approach them. I have had this experience myself when going into the office seeking information. It was not known that I was a member of Parliament. The officials could not supply me with the information I required. I was passed on from one man to another, until I realized that no one knew his work, and I felt that not one of them cared very much whether the seeker for information got what he desired. Speaking as a soldier, I am perfectly sure that the appointment of these men to the Repatriation Department The amount of has led to bad administration. In fact, the woTst administered Department in the Commonwealth to-day is the Repatriation Department. Now as to the remedy. The Minister has said that he will have a f u ll investigation. It is very necessary. But I cannot hold the Minister blameless. As head of the Department he must be aware of the faults in administration. ' However, now that he is about to make an investigation, I hope he will act promptly. He asks what he is to do, and whether he has power to do anything. If he has not the power to dismiss the head of the Department, should he think it necessary to do so, we are indeed in a peculiar position in this Parliament. If a Commissioner or any official can be appointed by the Government and cannot be dismissed, even if found to be grossly incompetent, the sooner the matter is rectified the sooner we shall have a chance of having reasonable administration in our Departments. ber knows of any definite reason why the present Commissioner should not hold his office, I shall be glad to know it, and if it can be proved I will take definite action.",29,Adjournment

As to where the responsibility lies, if it is not a Ministerial responsibility at present, the fault does not rest with honourable members of the Country party. The vote taken in this Houso which transferred pensions from Ministerial responsibility was not supported by my colleagues in this corner. spect to the statement of the honourable member for Illawarra ( Mr Lamond), I would point out that, no matter how ho . may have thought or expressed himself at the time, he voted for the transfer of control to the present body, while I note that the name of the honorahle member for Bobertson ( Mr Fleming), whom he criticised, does not appear in the division list at all. I wish again to place it-on record that the Government have notexeroised thooontrol over funds for returned soldier purposes which was intended by Parliament. I am glad to perceive that in that regard 'even the Treasurer ( Sir Joseph Cook) has come round to our woy of thinking. Some months ago he himself took exception to the fact that the money which has been distributed to the States for purposes of land purchase and soldiers' settlement has been allowed to pass, iu the sense of control, entirely out of the hands pf the Commonwealth Government. This Parliament should have retained -control both of the money itself and of the method and, particularly, the rate of speed of soldiers' settlement. significant fact, by the way, that a Sydney weekly paper, which supported the Government party with the whole of its forces at the last elections, should now be publishing every week a page which is headed, "" Cyanidi.ng the Soldier's Widow."" We are asking for -justice to returned men and to their dependants. We complain that, emanating from some source or other-and ultimately the Government cannot escape responsibility-ther e appears to .have grown up a narrow policy which Dr. Earle Page. has gripped the whole of the administration of pensions and of repatriation generally. The views which have .been expressed on all sides of the House demonstrate that that Bpirit should not be .allowed to prevail; and if the Govern-: ment are -being overridden .by ofncials it is their duty to displace them, no matter whether they be returned men a hundred times over. We do not say that 'because a man is a returned soldier he is thereby qualified to take any and every position open. I strenuously object to the imputation cast by the honourable member for Hunter( Mr Charlton )upon returned soldiers generally, when i e said that reAnd, with returned .men have been responsible for the bad deal which has been given to other returned soldiers in respect of the subject matters under review.

If the honourable member were to make a selection for the same work from among men who are not returned soldiers it would be found that they would be giving a worse deal than is the caseto-day.

It is possible for any medical man to be permitted to change his opinions. It is not proper that because a disabled soldier was before a Medical Board a year ago, or three years ago, and that upon theevidence then offering the Board took a certain view as bearing upon his pension, their conclusions should be held as good and sufficient for all time.

I know that acting eololy on hospital experience I arrivied at quite an erroneous conclusion concerning the percentage of disability which should be allotted when those men went out into ordinary life. It was only by review, and bydiscussing matters with many of the men themselves, who had no axe to grind, and who did not wish to lean upon the Commonwealth for any pension whatever, that I made up my mind that the attitude of the departmental officials was often wrong and unjust to the soldiers. As an outcome of that altered personal view-point, I am glad to say that a'better deal'has been secured in respect of pensions allotted to numbers of maimed men. It will be necessary to review past decisions in a more generous rather than in a more critical spirit. In many cases, for example,' the men's papers have failed to indicate disabilities which had not been noted by the medical authorities at the time. Sometimes, no doubt, those disabilities were not apparent; but the oversight may have been due to carelessness, or to the congestion of an officer's duties at the time when the final medical examination was conducted: I repeat that very often a medical historyespecially when he was referring to the sheet is misleading and incomplete, and sometimes the men concerned have had to pay for a private operation which was rendered necessary solely as an outcome of active service. condition would be shown on his medical historjHsheet, and if that report by a medical officer were misleading, should the individual be compelled to suffer? .that matter later. .1 have in mind the case of a man who lost the whole of an arm.

We whom He had been told to report insisted that the returned man should not be treated as though he were completely incapacitated, but as having a 50 per cent, disability. They reduced his pension by one-half, and the local doctors and I had to fight for six months to get the pension restored. This man had not only received an injury from which few recover, ' but was labouring under' that mental condition whicli must result from such an injury. this period he had not only to look after his own work, but -to suffer the mental distress associated with thefighting of his case. I appeal for a wider and more liberal interpretation of the law. There should be appointed a Board, not altogether of the character suggested by the honourable member for .Kalgoorlie ( Mr Foley)., but-consisting of district medical men, to deal with.these matters. The members of rthe Board should consist of medical men in general practice rather than consultant surgeons. They would be able readily to visualize the conditions under which most of these people are living and working, and would therefore be better fitted to appraise 'the percentage of return for services which they should obtain from the Commonwealth. son) -The honourable member's time has expired. was pleased to hear the reply made this morning by the Assistant Minister for Repatriation ( Mr Rodgers).

P r i or to Uhe war I should probably have been termed a fanatical Protectionist, as I was prepared to go to the extent of the absolute prohibition of the importation of goods that oan be manufactured in Australia, but during the war it was the .unfortunate experience of the people of Australia to be robbed as mercilessly by I s it too' late to move, Australian manufacturers as by the i m porters of foreign-made goods. It may be contended that it is infinitely preferable that we should be Tobbed by our own countrymen than by the people of other nations. 'We have contended throughout that thc people might bo protected, but because of the extraordinary conditions prevailing no action was taken by the Government to protect them.

The position of the farmer, so far as agricultural implements are concerned, does not differ in any way from his position in respect of his utilization of other articles and commodities. Just. as the farmer has been robbed unmercifully by tiie farming implement manufacturers of Australia, so he has been robbed just as unmercifully in connection with the clothing he requires by the woollen manufacturers of Australia -by reason of the support of the Country member would, impose higher duties in order that he might be robbed to a greater extent? sistance of the members of the Country party in order to restrict and prevent the exploitation of the farmer. The party to whicli I have the honour to belong stands for the new Protection. It guarantees a fair deal to the manufacturer-and I helieve that the average manufacturer requires no more-and at the same time desires to protect the interests of the consumer and nroducer. But when an opportunity occurs, and mar>y have occurred during the past three years, to restrict the operations of people who have been exploiting the whole community, the members of the Country party are found to be the first to support the Government. It is of no use for the members of that party to rail against the iniquitous treatment of the farmer by the implement manufacturers if they are not prepared to do something to put an end to it . able member propose that we should do? to go so far as to say that the benefit of ordinary governmental utilities should not be extended to persons who are not prepared to treat the people properly. Wle have placed restrictions on many thousands of people in Australia. We have prevented people receiving letters. We have prevented firms from transacting business with Departments of the Commonwealth. By withholding from them the service of the utilities which we control 'we can restrict the operations of exploiters of the public. That has been put forward time and again; but the Government have always contended, contrary to the best legal authorities, that it is not possible to do this. This restriction, which is now applied to a section of the community might be applied to others. If at any time the members of the Country party show that they are in earnest about protecting the farmers, they will receive every assistance from honourable members on this side. But the members of the Country party are not in earnest -that is the whole trouble.

Sliould you, Mr Chairman, rule me out of order, I candidly say that I have a way in which I can get over the difficulty and be enabled to make the speech which I now desire to make. I am free to move that the first item be postponed until after another division of the Tariff has been considered. This would give me an opportunity of showing how little truth there is in the statements of some members of the Country party. Those honourable members have either deliberately or unknowingly confused the issues. They have included in the 35,000,000 bushels of wheat which are consumed in Australia the amount of seed wheat which is only of advantage to the farmers. This annum, and it means that £4,000,000 of the £11,000,000 goes directly into the pockets of the farmers. I could show, from Knibbs that in the five years ending 1919 over 40 per cent, of the wheat was consumed locally, over 73 per cent, of the butter, SO per cent, of the cheese, and 90 per cent, of the mutton, lamb, and beef. These figures show that it is the home market that is of advantage to the farmers, and not the export market.

I am sorry that the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Tudor) is not allowed the opportunity to make the speech he desires. I had expected this debate to extend into next week. However, as it seems likely that it will close unless some one speaks, I desire to make some observations, particularly directed to the speeches of the members of the so-called Country party, and, generally, outlining what I conceive to be the policy of the country on the question of a Protective Tariff. I do not hesitate to say that I am a Protectionist. I think the policy of Protection is the only sound policy for a country like Australia; it is the only policy under which we can become the great self-contained riation we desire to be. in the Government comer, if I have apprehended their speeches correctly, claim that they are the sole representatives of the farmers. they are under a great misapprehension -the y are not. the farmers; and I desire to point out that, in my opinion, a large section of the farmers of Australia do not agree with their views on the Tariff. the sole representatives of the farmers than are honourable members opposite the sole .representatives of Labour. drawn away by the disorderly interjections of the Treasurer, who has already aaused some trouble to-day. As I understand the contention of the Country party, it is that the farmers ought to be allowed to go into the markets of the world to purchase their agricultural machinery-the y desire Free Trade for such commodities. I start with an admission of the necessity for manufacturing our agricultural machinery in this country-wit h an admission of the necessity for making this a great self-contained nation. If we do not start from that basis we have utterly failed to learn the I lessons of the war. When we cast our minds over the war period, we realize that if we rely on agricultural machinery coming from oversea under a Free Trade policy, we shall find that, instead of having the markets of the world open to us, we shall not be able to purchase any machinery at all. to start with an admission that we must manufacture all such commodities within the boundaries of Australia. at a fair price. ture all we can manufacture, and we must have such a policy as will enable us to manufacture at a reasonable profit.

If we reasonthe necessity for manufacturing in Australia those implements which are used in Australia, we are inevitably driven to the conclusion that there must be such a Protective Tariff as to enable that to be done against the competition of the outside world. I am prepared to go further. Having imposed a Tariff sufficient to enable the manufacture of these implements in Australia, there must be another branch of law to insure that the manufacturers do not make exorbitant or unreasonable profits; the farmers must not be exploited by our local manufacturers. vent anything like that? at the same time, that is not an objection to the Tariff, but an objection to the absence of some regulating law or power to insure that the farmer, or any other person, who buys goods manufactured in this country shall do so on the basis of the cost of production, plus a reasonable amount for added profit. man will admit that it is not possible to make that provision in a taxation measure, and that we require another Act. and for that reason I have not directed my criticism against the Government on the matter. Rather, my reply has been directed to the interjection by the honorner ( Mr Maxwell), and say, workers in able member for the Wimmera( Mr the broadest sense of the term. Stewart). It cannot be done in the Tariff. It most be done by other legislative means, and I hope the Government will, as part of their policy, go further, Herbert( Mr Bamford), the honourable and bring in a measure to provide that the consumers of those goods that are manufactured within our borders shall be able to obtain them at a reasonable price. If this is done, the Government will do a very great service. I realize that this is not in any sense a party question. It is unfortunate that in the debate on such a great issue as this there should be any attempt to make political capital out of it for party purposes, because, after all, we are shaping a national policy under which we hope to be able to build up this great country of ours. I feel satisfied, from my experience of the House as it is constituted at present,. that honourable members are quite capable of putting party considerations aside for the moment, and combining in an endeavour to give effect to a fiscal policy that will make for national progress on the lines I have indicated. It is not possible for me to go into details of the Tariff. I merely wish to outline my views on a Protective Tariff, with its concomitant .legislation-cal l it new Protection, or what you will-whic h will enable the primary producer to obtain the locally-manufactured article at a reasonable rate. To me it comes as a surprise that the position of the farmers should be stated as being antagonistic to the interests of the rest of the community, because the interests of the man who applies his labour to land ar© identical with the interests of the worker in the factory. claiming that the interests of -the man on the land are antagonistic to the interests of the worker in some other direction fails to realize that no party can aspire to govern unless its policy is framed witb a due regard to the interests, of all sections, and it stands for the workers as a whole, because, after all, the workers of a country in every branch of industry are the backbone of the nation. broadest sense. honourable friend, the member for Fawkself as well as the honorablei member for 1 member for Fawkner( Mr Maxwell) the honourable member for Wfimatnera ( Mr Stewart), and) indeed, all honourable members who at all events ought to be workers.

Not only have they failed in this respect, but they have failed also to apprehend the opinion of those they purport to represent-the primary producers, a large number of whom believe a protective policy is essential if Australia is to be deconsideration of an issue so important as veloped on sound and right lines, and made a self-contained .nation. I know that very many of my personal friends among the pastoralists hold this view. They believe it is necessary to increase our population, and by that means ease the load of taxation that will be required for defence purposes, because we can have no better guarantee of immunity from external aggression than the peopling of our own country with a virile population of workers, and the adoption of a policy to make it self-contained. We do not want to go overseas for any of our requirements in time of war. What does history teach us ? Take the case of the great TJnited States of America. Willi t be denied that the development of that country was the direct result of a Protective policy ? same conditions here for the workers as in the United States of America under a high Tariff? the internal conditions of thc TJnited States of America. I am speaking of the policy that made for the development of that great commonwealth in the west. If the people of the TJnited States of America had continued the policy of Free Trade, they would not have been able to build up the great self-contained nation we see to-day. have had one-tenth of their present population. would Therefore, we should direct our energies to the same end. I believe the farmers are entirely with us in this matter I am satisfied that they are just as intelligent, politically, as any other -section of the community; and that they will give their endorsement to the fiscal policy that will allow of the manufac-. ture, locally, of agricultural machinery. [297] farmers selling in a Protectionist market at Free Trade rates ? 1 for Wimmera is now deducing some facts into a formula with which I cannot agree. His is a wrong formula. In the this, we must take the broader view, and not confine our attention to the interests of a particular class, in the community. I do not admit that the interests of the producers are in any way injured by the imposition of a Protective Tariff. On the contrary, I think they are safeguarded. We must get down to the foundation of nationhood. How are we going to make this country a great, self-contained nation? our rural lands, and not crowding our people into the cities. turing all those things that are necessary for the development of a country. to do for a market for your manufactures when you have met all local requirements ?

But the fact that there are secessions from the party indicates that there are members on the Ministerial side who realize that their party is not quite' popular with the great body of the public.

If honourable members were sincere in desiring to destroy this Tariff, all they had to do was to inform the honourable member for Perth that they would support his m'otion, which embodies I . am. not the first plank of their own platform.

Minister agreed to report progress in order to allow honourable members to make a few remarks upon the subject. the Standing Orders and the practice and custom of Parliament, and if we are to set them aside, on every occasion we shall have chaos through the careless conduct of public business. There are right and wrong ways of doing, these things. The Standing Orders specifically prescribe a time limit to a special motion for adjournment. That limit had expired before the House decided' to take any action in the way of an extension of time, and therefore, as has been previously ruled, the debate on that motion cannot be revived in the same, sitting. ever, if honourable members desire to discuss soldiers' grievances generally without making particular reference to the definite matter which was the subject of the motion for adjournment they may do so. They may not refer to the cancellation or reduction of war pensions, which was thespecific subject of the special motion. . discussing the administration of the Repatriation Department ? ber may discuss the administration generally without reference to the particular matter which has been already debated abled soldiers. The Commissioner's attiministration of the Repatriation Department in connection with the claims of tubercular soldiers? only thing excluded is the specific matter embodied in the motion discussed this morning. months tubercular soldiers have been agitating through their association for better -treatment at the hands of the officials. [297]2 They are the most unfortunate of any of our soldiers. A returned man who has been permanently incapacitated in other ways knows exactly where he stands, because his pension is definitely fixed. -The honourable member will not Ninety-nine per cent, of the tubercular soldiers have to be treated in hospital, and while there they receive a pension of £2 2s. per week; but as soon as the progress of the disease is arrested the doctors advise that they be discharged. When they leave the hospital they continue to receive the same pension of £2 2s. per week. Several honourable members, with representatives of the Tubercular Soldiers Association, waited as a deputation upon the Commissioner for Repatriation, and also the present Assistant Minister for. Repatriation ( Mr Rodgers), and, later, the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes). The last-named was most sympathetic, and said that, in his opinion, the Commissioner had ful l power to deal more liberally with the tubercular soldiers. On their discharge from hospital they are advised by the doctors to follow a certain line of treatment. The diet alone costs them £2 5s. per week. How are the soldiers to pay for board and clothing? The doctors say, also, that Howthese men would fare better if they could get light employment.' Would any honourable member take a sufferer from tuberculosis into his home or business and allow him to' mix with his family or employees? These soldiers walk the streets in search of light employment, and, continually receiving refusals, they commence to worry, which the doctors say is the worse thing they can do. The Commissioner admitted that these men could receive the f u l l pension of £4 per week if they wereclassified as totally and permanently incapacitated. The Prime Minister said that if such was the case they must be treated similarly to other distude is, however,, that if the men are so discuss the adbad that they can be classified as totally and permanently incapacitated, they are a menace to public health, and should not be allowed out of hospital. In that respect the returned soldier is being treated differently from the civilian.

196,Mr Mathews,"A civil tubercular subeah if he is an invalid. first be picked up in the gutter. say whether my authority is official or otherwise-that the soldiers' pensions have been cut down to the extent of f1,600 per month. I had under my notice the case of a woman with five children, whose husband was in the Asylumf o r Insane at Callan Park, Sydney, and she was receiving the magnificent pension of f 1 15s. per week. It is impossible for a woman to feed herself and five children on that sum. was that woman getting originally? The Board say that they must be guided by the doctor's certificate, and when I interviewed that the Sydney Board, of which General Bennett is chairman, has overridden their certificates. It hurts me, as a returned soldier, to have to admit that in my experience the soldier members of the Board have dealt less sympathetically with our applicants than have the civilians. . I have particulars of a case of a widow woman who had. four sons, three of whom served in the Army, and one in the Navy. Three were killed, and only one returned to Australia. These four men kept their mother, and «he now receives the magnificent pension of £ 1 per week. I have submitted this case to the authorities time after time, and since my taking it up her weekly pension has been reduced by 5s. per week. honourable member had better drop it . I see justice done. In this particular case the Repatriation Board inSydneyi n itructed an official to make inquiries in stead of approaching reliable officials in the community, such as postmasters, or police officers, or others occupying public positions. The only evidence this investigating official took was fro m a woman next door who was living with a man as his alleged wife, and it was on her evidence that the pension was reduced, as that is the only paper on the file. The woman who gave the evidence had-had her pension reduced, and would not associate with the woman next door, so she reported to the Repatriation Board that In New South Wales he this unfortunate widow had sufficient to live on. In this State he must I have another communication from a man whose pension has been reduced, and in the letter he states, among other things, that the Department has come to the decision that he is not suffering any war disability. He says that the Department grants h i m a tram and train pass because he is unable to walk; but six weeks afterwards it reduced his pension to a minimum of 5s. per week. The whole position is farcical. This man was. an employee of the Railway Department before going abroad, and the doctor will not allow h i m to return to work because he is unfit. Notwithstanding this, W h a t pension the Repatriation Board allows him a pension of 5s. per.week and a railway and tramway pass. Is he expected to live on the passes which are supplied ? These are typical cases which need more the doctors they said sympathetic treatment at the hands of the Repatriation Board. As one daily hears numerous complaints and statements that men are receiving pensions when they have no right to"" them, it is the duty of the Government to be fair, first of 'all, to the incapacitated men and war widows who have made such great sacrifices. -When the debate was proceeding this morning the Minister was asking honourable members to submit concrete cases. I can refer him to an honourable member who can supply, not only one concrete case, but a truckload of them. I can also refer the Minister not only to concrete cases but cast-iron and cast-steel cases, all in the vicinity of Brisbane. T f such is the case the case up there, and the honourable member will find a sheaf of correspondence in t h» I will not drop it until Brisbane office. to hear that such is the case. Since the Minister was in Brisbane honourable members have been inundated w i th applications from men and women asking why their pensions or their living allowances have been reduced. It is the reduction of the living allowance particularly that is causing such great hardship. I have always been under the impression that the administration of war pensions should be in the hands .of returned soldiers, because I thought they would be more sympathetic towards their fellow men. It is not altogether the fault of the Act, because in",43,Adjournment Repatriation And Soldiers Pensions Administration Prosecution Of Bandsmen Soldier Apprentices

206,Mr Jamespage,"I am pleasedmany instances it is the officers in the lower positions who are responsible. know that when these cases are brought before the Minister he will give them the careful consideration he gave those that were submitted to him in Brisbane. There is another matter which I wish to bring before the House, because, possibly, many honourable members on both sides of the chamber have not read the report in yesterday's Herald concerning the treatment of certain street musicians. I think this is one of the cruellest cases that has ever come under my notice. The magistrate who heard the case is a sympathetic. man and a great patriot, and he said that it pained him very much to have to fine these men for playing in the streets of Melbourne. It will, perhaps, be better for honourable members not to take my word, but to follow the report in the Herald, which I do not think was a biased one. It readsFive familiar faces were seen torday in the District Court, when Robert Golding, Ormond Croz, Arthur Williams, Charles Moy, and Jack Moy, returned sailors, who have been performing as a Returned Soldiers' Band in .the city streets, were each charged, on the information of the City Council, with having played a musical instrument in Bourke-street to the obstruction of the pedestrian traffic, on Oth March. All pleaded not guilty. Each was fined £1, with 2s. 6d. costs. I shall leave out the evidence tendered, and quote the statement of Mr Wade, the magistrate. When he asked if these men would desist from playing in the streets they replied in the negative. Mr prosecution. It 'is an accursed action. Wade saidI t goes very much against my inclination to fine these men, as I have always believed that returned soldiers should be helped as much as possible. But as they will not promise to desist a fine will be imposed. "" If -it were not for tbe soldiers some of the business men who have been complaining would not have businesses,"" said Mr Fogarty. Those are significant words. Mr punished in the way they have been. Fogarty was appearing for these men. What would the people of Amiens have to say if they were asked if an-Australian soldiers' band, playing in front of their establishments, would interfere with their trade? They would not only be glad to allow them to play, but would express the thanks of their people for what the Australians had done for them. If it were not for the men who went away these people in our city streets would not have any businesses. This is I one of the most astonishing cases I have heard of in my life, and it is incredible that our City Council should prosecute them because they were rendering musical selections in the street. men? / not say that they were injured, but merely refers to them as returned soldiers. Mr Wade, in reply to Mr Fogarty, saidYes, I well remember the time when the business men who are now complaining, stood on lorries in the streets and made speeches with bands playing all round them. This was when the soldiers were leaving Australia, and the obstructions that these men now object to were then common occurrences. What crime have these men committed, and why should they be prosecuted and fined £1 and 2s. 6d. costs for playing in the streets? In this chamber we have passed resolutions of thanks to those men for what they have done for Australia and the Empire, and the action of the City Council is a decided blot on its escutcheon. Many of those who complained and who asked men to go to the Front and sacrifice their life and blood for the Empire were nothing more than "" cold-tea"" patriots. It was very easy for them to say, "" You go and fight and I will stay at home."" But when these brave men have returned and are endeavouring to earn an honest livelihood, instead of making things easy for them, they have been responsible, for their There has been no protest fromi the Returned Soldiers Association nor from any returned soldier members in this House; but I would be prepared to move heaven and earth to have those fines repealed and the money repaid. Those men are not criminals, and those who class them as such should be I hope the men will send in a petition at the earliest moment. There is no sham about me, because I feel I cannot do too much for the soldiers who have done everything, for me. They have not only made Australia free, but have assisted in freeing the whole world. Those business men are under an everlasting debt of gratitude to the men who went to fight for us, and I feel with Mr Wade when he says that",44,Adjournment Repatriation And Soldiers Pensions Administration Prosecution Of Bandsmen Soldier Apprentices
207,Mr Considine,Wer e they injured,45,Adjournment Repatriation And Soldiers Pensions Administration Prosecution Of Bandsmen Soldier Apprentices
208,Mr James Page,"The report doeswe cannot do too much for the soldier. Knowing Mr Wade's feelings concerning the soldier, I know it must have pained him very much to impose a fine. Before the war it was a common sight to see German or Austrian bands parading our main streets, and.no objection was taken; but when these men return and choose to follow some suitable employment the men whose interests they have been away to protect are the first to object. This is what one of the leading newspapers of Melbourne saysFive returned soldiers who were fined at the District Court yesterday for having played music in the streets, contrary to the City Council's by-laws, refused to promise to cease playing when offered certain favorable conditions by the magistrate. Favorable conditions! It is really comic opera. There were no favorable conditions offered to these men when they were asked to go overseas, and, if necessary, to sacrifice their lives in the cause of the Empire. They were told that if they left the positions which they then occupied"", those positions would be restored to them upon their return. We know how that promise has been kept. Many of their former employers gave them their jobs back when they returned, but sacked them within a week, when they discovered that they were not as competent as they were previously. The inference is that tliese men, presuming upon 'their 'former association with the Australian Imperial Force Presuming, indeed ! Truly that is a gem. The inference is that these men, presuming upon their former association with the Australian Imperial Force, feel 'that they have rights not enjoyed by other citizens. So they have. They certainly should have rights which .are not enjoyed by citizens who stayed in Australia and kept the home fires burning. I hope that they will stand up for their rights. honourable member will get our Lord Mavor to Tecognise their rights. enough for mei to attend to our own Lord Mayor without looking after the honourable member's. Such a view,, if generally held, would bring great discredit upon a noble name. Whatt r i p e ! Moreover, the action of the City Council in passing the by-law is being misunderstood. There should be no need for returned men to earn their living as mendicants, and the Australian Imperial Force has most to gain by the closing of this avenue to an easy means of livelihood, however tempting it may be to some of its former members. There is sterner work to be done by able-bodied men, and for the incapacitated there are occupations which they may have by right, and not by charity. This crowd evidently wants the German, Austrian, and Hungarian bands back again. Because an Australian band plays in our streets it is no good to the Argus newspaper. Here is a case of more Free Trade-Fre e Tradei n bands. What a different tune is being played in 1921 from that which was played from 1914 right up t ill 1919! These men were then told, that it was their duty to lay down their lives, if necessary, in the interests of the Empire. If the Government will, not take action in this matter, the Returned Soldiers Association ought'to do so. They are strong enough to demand that the Australian Imperial Porce shall not be dragged in the mud. Only a few inonths ago, when I was speaking of the treatment which was being meted out to returned soldiers in out-back areas, the honourable member for Robertson ( Mr. Fleming) interjected, "" That cannot happen now. The Returned Soldiers Association will take the matter in hand."" Unfortunately, I cannot become a member of that association, although I am a soldier, because I served only in the I m perial Forces. But I appeal to the hon' orable member for Robertson, as a member of that association, to see that something is done in this connection. It is a case in which he should interest himself with a view to insisting that these men have the fines which they have paid refunded to them, and that their convictions shall be expunged from the Court records. They are not criminals, and should not be branded as such. [3.35]' I desire to bring 'under the notice I hope that the .of the Acting Minister for Repatriation ( Mr Rodgers) an important matter in connection with the soldiers who, at the It » is quite time of their enlistment, were apprentices, and who had had previous compulsory home service. A decision has been arrived at by the Commission that a returned soldier who was employed on home service shall not receive payment for the difference between his apprenticeship wages and a journeyman's wages for the time that he was engaged in home service. This may at first blush.",45,Adjournment Repatriation And Soldiers Pensions Administration Prosecution Of Bandsmen Soldier Apprentices
209,Mr Hector Lamond,,46,Adjournment Repatriation And Soldiers Pensions Administration Prosecution Of Bandsmen Soldier Apprentices
210,Mr Jamespage,,46,Adjournment Repatriation And Soldiers Pensions Administration Prosecution Of Bandsmen Soldier Apprentices
211,Mr Hector Lamond ( I L L A WA R R A),"appear to be quite a reasonable proposal, because, in tbe ordinary course, after the expiration of his indentures, the apprentice would have to make up the term during which he was absent from his trade on home service. But the fact has evidently been overlooked that the apprentice who enlisted deprived himself of the opportunity of completing his indentures during his younger years, with the result that after having served for five years at the war he is now called upon to complete them when he is a man, in many cases a man with a family. The action of the Commission is so indescribably mean that I feel sure it has not the 1 those centres. It frequently happens approval of the Minister. I hope that he will look into the matter, with a view to extending more generous treatment to these men who did so much for their country. The honourable member for Maranoa( Mr of what ought to be done in each case. Page), iu the speech which he has just delivered, referred to the great number of returned soldiers and dependants who daily came to see me in Brisbane during the past four months. I am glad to .say that in a great many of these cases we were able to secure an adjustment; but, nevertheless, quite a. number of cases have not been adjusted.' I am sure that nobody, either inside or outside of this House, has done more for the welfare of the returned soldiers than has the Assistant Minister for Repatriation ( Mr Rodgers). recently he visited all the States of the Commonwealth. He came-to Queensland, and it is no exaggeration to say that Homesi n my own electorate. I am he spent night and day listening to the numerous complaints which were submitted to him, not only in connection with repatriation, but also in connection with War Service Homes. Personally, I feel that the Government have done all that they could to honour their obligations to our returned soldiers. our statute-book prove that. But when we come to the administration of the Department, that is another matter. We all know of many instances which .point to unsympathetic administration, and I was glad to hear the statement of the Assistant Minister that he will personally investigate the complaints which have been made. Whilst he was in Brisbane., a great many specific cases were placed before him, and I have since received his assurance that he has investigated the whole of them, and communicated the result to the Returned Soldiers Association in Brisbane, the executive of which brought these matters before him. I would like him to seriously consider one thing, namely, the medical examination to which returned soldiers are subjected in connection with the cancellation or reduction of their pensions. I am of opinion that a local Board of medical practitioners should be appointed in the various centres to deal with the cases of men in that advice of the Repatriation medical officers is not accepted by the Central Administration, and it appears to me that a Board of local practitioners, who-could see each individual applicant for a pension, would be better qualified to judge [3.40] -I . was extremely pleased to hear the Assistant Minister for Repatriation ( Mr Rodgers) promise that he would look into some of the cases which have been mentioned here ""this afternoon. Such a pledge, coming from him, means something. Upon every occasion that I have communicated with him, he has exhibited an earnestness to do justice to the individuals concerned which is quite refreshing in a Ministerial Department. I particularly wish to bring under his Quite notice a matter in regard to which I have recently experienced considerable trouble; I refer to the purchase of War Service sorry that a decision has been arrived at, which seems to be final, -that no more purchases 'are to be made of homes which are already in existence. cumstances.

Already the Department has paid out in cash about £1,750,000 for war gratuities. All that has to come out of our revenue balance. It has to be raked up from one quarter and another, because money does not drop down to us from the clouds. That is why we would rather that -somebody outside should cash these bonds, if they would do it reasonably and fairly. the trouble.

RecentlyI sent to the Department the the Governclaim of a widow whose circumstances to-day are the same as they were six months ago, but whose pension has been reduced from £2 to 15s. per fortnight. The blame forthat cannot be put upon a doctor, and it seems to me that there is something in the suggestion of the honourable member for Kalgoorlie ( Mr Foley) that some sort of order or instruction has been issued for the cutting down of pensions in tlie interests of a » false economy. has this widow? * as I know, only one dependent upon her. widow cannot ibe reduced unless she remarries. cumstances. legal, inalienable right to her pension. to your administration.",48,Adjournment Repatriation And Soldiers Pensions Administration Prosecution Of Bandsmen Soldier Apprentices

262,Mr Ttjdor (Yarra) [4.11],"I have placed under an X-ray examination atremembering, however, that it is far better to err on the side of liberality than on that of harshness. I do not say that all the men who have returned from the war are angels; but the very fact of their service demands that we should treat them with absolute fairness, and deal with their dependants in that spirit of generosity which we promised to show them. Minister for Repatriation) [4.17] I am very much impressed with the suggestion of several honourable memhers that in the matter, not of the assessment, but of the reconsideration of pensions, the soldier should have the benefit of civilian doctor representation. It would be impossible to control or administer pensions if one were to hand over the matter of appeal altogether to an outside Board which would be in no way responsible to. the Department. I cannot undertake that; but in view of the representations -which have been made to-day, and knowing, as I do, the feelings of honourable members, and of the returned men themselves, the whole case of the soldier will be gone into again from every point of view, and more fully. I shall make representations, in connection with the Appeal Boards, to permit the attendance of civilian doctors as well as of the Department's medical officials. [4.18] I have a case which I wish to make known. In 1916, when the men were leaving for the Front, with all the bands playing and the flags flying, they were heroes. There was one such hero from my district who was a husband and a father, and his family, too, were heroes. We hailed them as such, and we promised that we would look after-them. Until 1918 that man fought and was wounded, and fought again and was wounded; and then he was reported ""A.W.L."" him again. He was missing. They do not know to this day where he is, or what has become of him, and his wife and children are starving. Maybe his body is lying shattered, or blown to pieces,, in France; but he is "" A.W.L."", and his de. -pendants to-day are getting no assistance of any sort from any source. should they be punished merely because the letters' "" A.W.L."" stand, at the Defence Department, against the man's name? I appeal for fresh consideration of the cases of such unfortunate people."" If the father had not gone to the war, or if he had returned and were here to-day, he would have been their supporter. The family, therefore, is suffering directly from the causes of war. I hope that, as an outcome of the consideration of this case, all cases of "" A.W.L."" will be reopened and considerately examined. I can speak with some authority upon matters having to do with soldiers, so far as this State is concerned, since I am the only member of the original enlisting Committee who began with that body and remained with it until the end. I spoke from many platforms. I did not ask any man to do what I had not ofiered to do, but on account of my"" age I was refused permission to go on active service. From a thousand platforms we pledged ourselves to look after the women and children. Have those promises been kept? I am not blaming the Government or any Minister. I have one case in mind which -was brought under my notice iby a magistrate. The husband was in a house of detention for six months. He was mentally unhinged. Now he has disappeared; no one knows where he is. The Defence Department is looking for him. Meanwhile the wifa and child, who received a pension, have had it taken away from them. I protest in the name of humanity. It was a calamity when the care of pensions was taken from the Pensions Department. I do not suppose that any honourable member has had as many returned men and dependants through his hands as I . I keep a clerk doing nothing but the work of soldiers and their dependants, and of old-age pensioners. I have had a man appointed as a commissioner so His people never heard of that he may be in attendance at my office in order to assist me ih the taking of affidavits. This is all very well, and one does what one can; but it is not right that applicants for pensions should be compelled to come to members of Parliament in order to secure justice. I am sure that the Government desire to do Why only -what is right. I welcome the announcement of the Ministeri n regard to the matter of Appeal Board assistance",51,Adjournment Repatriation And Soldiers Pensions Administration Prosecution Of Bandsmen Soldier Apprentices

But I would not like to see poor people having to pay for the services of a private medical man to fight a Department in their behalf. It is impossible to fight a Department. I know many soldier medicals who have returned from active service. Some of these have not my respect or regard; most of them have. They should be put upontheir honour to treat as a younger brother every soldier who comes before them, and the dependants of our soldiers should be able to obtain treatment free of chaTge at any Government hospital. Isi t any wonder that some of those who went through the horrible turmoil of the war, with its brain-Tacking experiences, are absent without leave? As the honourable member for -Hunter( Mr Charlton) has said, if these men had not left home to fight for their country they would not be absent . without leave to-day. They responded to the call of their beloved country, and from every public platform were told that their dependants would be"" looked after if anything happened to them.' In theso circumstances, if we err at all, it should be on the side of generosity. Do not let us forget that every penny given to the dependants of our soldiers is spent in OUT midst. Under the present system an allowance is made in respect of only a limited number of children in each family. In the name of the future units of the StatesI ask what the seventh, eighth,, or tenth child in a family has done that reasonable provision should not be made for its support. Why. should not the child of a soldier whose bones have been left on the frontier be allowed by the Government at least as much for its support as an ordinary Police Court will allow in making a common maintenance order?
