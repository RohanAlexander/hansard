0,"House Of Representatives. Tuesday, Ss November, 19s1. Took The Chair At 3 P.m., And Read Prayers. Sale Of Wool. Ter And Attomeygeneral) [3.1]","(B y leave) I desire to make a short statement iu regard to the regulations which were passed in May last under which the export of wool from Australia was regulated. At that time, owing to a fall in price of all wools, and a complete cessation of demand for certain classes, the wool industry was threatened with financial disaster, and as the financial prosperity of this country is closely interwoven with thc wool industry, the Government considered that any action which it could take to prevent the collapse of one of our, and incidentally many other dependent, primary industries was justifiable. Honourable members will remember that when the position was placed before the House, Parliament agreed to the issue of regulations governing the export of wool for a period of six months. These regulations expired on 9th November, 1921, and the Government has been urged to agree to a continuance of the restrictions, it being represented that the action taken by the Government had materially assisted in restoring stability to the wool market. Honourable members are aware that it is the policy of the Government, as expressed on frequent occasions in connection with the various commercial activities of the Oommonwealth, to return as soon as possible to normal conditions. Government interference with trade is only justified when such interference is desirable in the interests of the whole of the community. The Government does not consider that the ^continuance of the wool regulations is justified. The conditions at present existing are not at all analogous to those which existed six months ago. The increased demand for wool, particularly on the Continent, is a most important factor in the improved condition of the industry, tbe position being that while in January last the Continent took only 33 per cent, of the total sales, in June 65 per cent., and in July 63 per cent., were taken by the Continental buyers. After considering the matter, it was agreed that the regulations should he continued for fourteen days from 9th November, which period expires to-day. The Government does not propose to further extend these regulations. If , however, circumstances should arise in the future which make further regulations or restrictions desirable, if, for example, there is a threatened collapse of the market either as a result »f a "" bear "" movement or from any other cause, the Governmeut proposes to re-impose the present regulations. Minister intend to amend jthe Income Tax Assessment Act during this session by increasing the exemption in respect of children and removing the double taxation of members of co-operative societies ? well aware of the anomalies in the taxation of the Commonwealth, and of the need for a comprehensive measure to adjust these on. the basis of the recommendations of the Taxation Commissioners. If time permits-whic h will depend largely on the attitude of honorahle members towards the business of the House the Government will introduce such a measure this session. THE NEW LEDGER. ter aware that the New Ledger, the journal of the Australian ClericalAssociation, has been refused by the postal authorities registration as a newspaper? Will the honorahle gentleman look into the matter, and see whether, as. the trade journals of the organizations of the employing classes are granted registration, this journal should not be registered? ter.",19,Setup

As soon as I receive an answer to that cablegram, I shall make *n announcement on the subject to the House. ANTI-DUMPING LEGISLATION. ister aware that during the past six months 63,000 tons of steel have been imported into Australia-muc h of it practically dumped here-and that the Newcastle Steel ""Works canDot carry on unless they are given protection from such competition? Will the Government proceed with the Tariff Board Bill and the Anti-dumping Bill this session, so that this protection may be given. times that it is the intention of the Government to go on with that legislation. The honourable member for Newcastle ( Mr Watkins) brought the matter up last Friday, and I then again set out the policy of the Government in regard to it. I hope that the Anti-Dumping Bill will be introduced this week. NEW ter and Attorney-General) [3.6] -The expropriation of properties in New Guinea having been completed, the Government has given careful consideration to the -policy to be followed in regard to the plantations there, and has decided that for every reason it is better that it should ment and of the House? cease to own them. They will, therefore, be offered for sale, special provision being made for preference to returned soldiers. The regulations which will be drafted will be made available to honourable members at the earliest possible moment. Friday last, when the temperature was very oppressive, owing in part te the humidity, the conditions in this chamber were very disagreeable, and I wish to know from you, Mr Speaker, if a special effort could not be made to improve its ventilation? First class engineers, skilled in questions of ventilation, might be asked to make an investigation of the problem, so that when we again get weather like that of last week, the air in the chamber may be purer and cooler. son) -As the honourable member knows, the weather last week, and the conditions in this chamber, were more than ordinarily oppressive, but it is a fact, nevertheless, that whenever there is a ful l attendance of honourable members, and a large number of persons in the galleries, the air of the chamber quickly becomes vitiated. Attempts have been made from time to time to improve the ventilation of the chamber, after expert advice has been obtained, and considerable sums have been expended upon them, but the results have not been satisfactory. The main difficulties in the way are due to architectural 'defects in the planning of the chamber. I am having tests made of the atmosphere of the House by professional experts, and I expect to have a report during the week as to the results of the tests. After that I shall consider what remedial steps should be taken. at home, will the Prime Minister consider the advisability of following the splendid example set by the Prime Minister of New Zealand in regard to the reduction of the salaries of members of the Governfjiend the Prime Minister of New Zealand has had his photograph taken, iu evening dress, and with a flag in his hand. I shall be very glad to follow that example.",19,Income Ta S Assessment Act Amendment

15,Mr Hughes,"My right honorableOIL PROSPECTING IN vernment are dealing with the .plantations in the Mandated Territory of New Guinea, will the Prime Minister see that some provision is made whereby Australians, and especially returned soldiers, who have been asking, for some time for .permission to search for oil there, may be afforded opportunities to do so? the right honourable gentleman see if someright that we should protect the interests thing cannot be done in the way of throwing, that country open to Australians who desire to prospect for oil at their own excase, those who were guilty of cruelty have pense ? favour of such a course. The Government of this . country have incurred great expense in connection with these Mandated Territories, and oil, if oil there be, is one of the assets to which the Government must look. The Government are paying a great deal of money for prospecting; we have employed the best experts available in the world; and we do not propose to allowi by dummying and those other circuitous processes which are not unknown to oil companies, these valuable deposits to get out of our hands. FLOGiGING IN NEW GUINEA. Minister, at an early date, make a statement to the House in regard to the alleged cruelty to natives in New Guinea, in addition to the pleasant generalities which the right honourable gentleman has already had published in the press? public a statement in regard to this matter, after looking into the facts very closely. German rule there was cruelty to natives, and discipline and order were maintained by corporal punishment. Since civil administration has been established in New Guinea, the only cases of corporal punishment that I know of are those set out in the statement. I made available yesterday. I think honourable members will agree with me that everything that can be done has been done to deal with those who were guilty. I might call the attention of honourable members to certain facts, which, I think, we cannot ignore. There is a tendency amongst the natives, according to the report, to prowl around the bungalows of white women, to frighten and to molest. This cannot be permitted. This practice has grown to such an extent that something has to be done. If punishment were administered in these circumstances, I do not know that any honourable member would censure it, if his own wife, or other Will female relatives, were the victims. It is of the natives, but we must not forget the interests of the white population. In any been punished, and dismissed; more than that we cannot do. for Trade and Customs aware that the activities of the Bureau of Science and Industry are considerably hampered owing to lack .of funds? In view of the very important work that is carried out by the Bureau will the honourable gentleman take steps to make the necessary funds available? that the amount of money which might be desirable has not been placed on the Estimates this year for the work of the Bureau. A t the same time, we are endeavouring to use the funds that are at our disposal in the best.possible way, concentrating on those things .ve think are likely to lead to practical results, and laying the foundation for a number of investigations in the future, when a little more money will, probably, be available. The position is -this: Under STOBBS op MEAT IN BBITAIN. I asked the Prime Ministeri f he would confer with the British Government, and the other -Governments interested, to see' if means could not be devised to free for the starving people in Russia the meat now stored iu Britain, and thus permit the meat now wasting in Australia to be sent Home to occupy the released space? under consideration by the Government for some time, and has been the subject",20,Guinea Plantations Parlialmentary Salaries

23,Mr Hughes,"This matter has beenof communication between this Government and the British Government. We were desirous of following in the footsteps of Britain, and asked for advice in regard to the matter. It is obvious that if the object Australia and its citizens have in view is the relief of starvation in Russia, the subscribers must be assured that the money subscribed will be available for those who are in need of it. Such assurance could not be given by His Majesty's Government, and, in the circumstances, the Commonwealth Government thought it could not take the lead in this ceuntry. I have read the statement by Sir Philip Gibbs in this morning's newspapers; the condition of affairs portrayed is positively appalling. But the responsibility for that lies, of course, on the Government which is solely responsible. We are not, however, to deal with the sins of Governments, but to consider the state of those unfortunate people who are starving. Speaking for myself, I say that if we have the assurance that the money subscribed will reach those unfortunates, and be used for their relief, this Government will be prepared to make a recommendation to the House and the country in regard to it. statement made by the Assistant Minister for Defence( SirG anville Ryrie), r in Sydney, that the honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr Marks) would be invited to join the Ministry in due course, and in order to allay the anxiety of other Ministerial supporters, will the Prime Minister let the House know what the Government propose to do in regard to either the formation of a Coalition Ministry or the reconstruction of the present Cabinet? nouncement at such a time as will allow honourable members to regale themselves with it on the festal day of the yearChristmas Day. for Trade and Customs inquire by cable or letter regarding the report that paper is being made from grape-vine branches? trol of Shipbuilding has offered a lease of the make inquiries in due course. NEW HEBRIDES. that the French Government are strenuously opposing any sale of land in the New Hebrides to the Australian Government or anybody else, does the Prime Minister intend to proceed with the debate upon the option of purchase by the Commonwealth, or will he strike that Order of the Day off the notice-paper? ment to the House on this subject some time ago, I expressed a doubt as to whether the French Government would agree to such a sale; I knew that it would not. I shall be very glad to make an opportunity for discussing this matter if honorably members so desire, but there are very many other items of business to be discussed. well be struck off the notice-paper. asked the Minister representing the .Minister for Defence, upon notice1. What remuneration in the aggregate is paid to the Fire Brigade Department for service rendered by it to the Defence'Department? 2. How much per day is allowed for each man? swers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:1. The annual payments at present rate of expenditure for Military and Air Services in Victoria amount to £1,644. This amount covers the cost of patrol services by firemen only. Provision for the maintenance in a satisfactory condition and supervision of fire appliances is made by the Department of Works and Railways. 2. The firemen are paid an hourly rate of Is. 9d. per hour.

Have payments not been made in such oases by the Treasurer? 3.

The reports received do not show that Mr the highest received, Farquer lost his sight on duty. 2.

In Committee of Supply (Consideration resumed from ISth November, vide page 13009): AIR SERVICES. Proposed vote, £400,000. This is a vote that requires very careful consideration at the hands of the Committee. We are all desirous of developing aviation, but I think the development should be along civil rather than military lines. Government propose to> branch out very extensively in the provision of air services for purposes of defence. financial year we spent only £77,040 upon the acquisition of sites and provision of aircraft equipment and plant for Military Aviation, b u t this year we are asked to vote £375,985 for the same purpose, an extra £298,945. No money was spent last year upon the acquisition of [520] sites, &c. for civil aviation, but this year we are asked to provide £55,216 for this purpose. voted last year for air services? with the actual expenditure of last year. amount voted last year, b u t by the amount actually spent. All honourable armaments. has been made that aviation ought also to be ruled out as being a barbarous method of warfare. about to quote the following from this morning's ArgusSpeaking at Ajmiens to an Anglo-French audience, Field Marshal Sir Henry Wilson, Chief of the Imperial General Staff, said that the development of the aeroplane movement seemed to him to be the development of a movement for killing women and children. Soldiers did not like it. He questioned whether air forces ought to be developed. If those who controlled the world wished to limit the sorrows of future wars, they should consider whether it woull not be better to limit aeroplanes than submarines. This military authority questions the wisdom of spending any money on air services for defence purposes, and yet we in Australia are proposing to spend still more in this direction. I quite agree that civil aviation ought to be developed on sound lines for the benefit of our remote districts, and, therefore, I take no exception to the proposed expenditure on the civil branch of aviation, but I must oppose the proposed heavy additional expenditure on the military branch. A i r Force works under the These Estimates show that the control of the Department of Works and Railways are estimated to cost £200,260 this year. Last year no In the last money was spent in this direction. There seems to be no justification for this proposed expenditure. The Prime Minister. ( Mr Hughes) announces that he is prepared to reduce the A i r Services Estimates by £100,000.

When every one is putting forward efforts to premitments. vent expenditure on military preparations, I think that we could easily mark time i u this direction. In the future we could review our position, if it should be necessary to do so. however, we are not justified in voting this additional expenditure. there are some very good and brave men in our A i r Eorce, whose services I would like to see utilized in civil aviation, where they could do good work, but according to the Estimates under the control of the Department of Works and Railways, we are providing only £14,000 this year for the cost of building hangars, workshops, barracks, & c , for civil aviation. Two hundred thousand two hundred and sixty pounds is estimated to be spent on building hangars, workshops, barracks, & c , for the military branch. We are informed in the schedule that the expenditure on air services under the control of the Department of Works and Railways, totalling £214,260, is less an amount of £86,260 which it is estimated w ill relian A i r Force, £375,985. main unexpended at the close of the year; and that the A i r Service votes under the control of the Department of Defence, totalling £431,201 , are less £159,201 which it is estimated will also remain unexpended at the close of the year. I do not understand why amounts are placed in the Estimates which it is not intended to spend, except that it is a notification of the intention of the Government to continue the expenditure in the next financial year. If we do not clip these intentions in their infancy, later on we may find the expenditure on our A i r Porce growing togreat proportions, possibly amounting to millions of pounds. A t any rate, after deducting the amounts estimated to be unexpended at the close of the year, the net vote for A i r Services this year is £400,000, as against an actual expenditure of £77,040 last year, or an additional proposed expenditure this year of £322,960. £200,000. tend to move.

That is explained by a note to the item to which .1 have referred the honourable member. to which the Minister refers me; but I cannot understand why no amount should appear in the column for 1920-21 opposite subdivision 1 of Division 14. The Estimates should be set out in a way in which the votes will be plain to honourable members, and they should not be called upon to search pages of the Estimates to discover how much has been voted or is proposed to be voted. perfectly plain.

Roughly speaking, the commitments amount to £126,000 or £127,000. Of the £400,000, the total vote for Air Services, the Government propose to take off £100,000, and the difference between £127,000, the total commitments, and £300,000, or £173,000, is the amount which the Committee is being asked to appropriate. expenditure proposed for this year is far too much. We are not justified in such a heavy expenditure on this service at this juncture, when there is so much doubt regarding this form of defence. Pending the Tesult of the Conferences that are being held abroad on the question of defence, and in view of the opinion of the leading authority I have quoted, as to whether, in view of the destruction of women and children it is adof defence, we shall, I think, be acting wisely if we reduce the vote proposed very considerably, without regard to commitments. member mean by his reference to women and children? destruction in warfare by A i r Forces.

I should like to say, with regard to the honourable gentleman's statement as to the possibility of fighting from the air being prohibited in warfare because of the possibility of the destruction of women and children-< will never trouble the militarist. honourable member might wait until I have finished before putting in a dirty remark like that. I agree that something should be done to prevent the possibility of air-craft being used in time of war to drop bombs upon non-combatant civilians, thus causing loss of life among innocent meu, women, and children. Such a horrible thing should not be possible; but it does not follow that we must lead the way towards bringing about the prohibition of such a practice by scrapping whatever preparations we have made in connection with the establishment of our Air Force. Rather, there should be international regulations governing the whole matter. Of course, if the League of Nations is tofunction at all, it should be easy for that body to frame laws, or regulations, regarding the use of air-craft in warfare. limit the spots on which bombs may fall. I orable member is constantly gabbling; he 'is a chattering nincompoop. It should be a simple matter for the League of Nations to frame restrictive rules; and, perhaps, such a body could enforce them. Only in that direction can we look for"" anything in the direction of safeguarding non-combatant peoples! But for an honourable I intend member to suggest that, in order to prevent possible loss of life among women and children by aerial attack, the Commonwealth should scrap its new organization for the creation and maintenance of an Air Force is ridiculous. The ideal, of course, would be, for all the nations to agree to aerial disarmament. Thereafter, I would immediately say, "" B y all means, let us scrap the Australian aerial organization."" test? Was not the use of poison gas and flame projectors tabooed by the nations prior to the great war ? so; yet, as every one knows, they were used to the fullest extent. International agreements did not prevent their employment. Perhaps an agreement, based upon the prevention of the use of air-craft over non-combatant territory, thus imperilling the lives of innocent people, would also be broken under stress of actual war conditions. But I repeat that, if it could be shown that there was a probability of the nations scrapping their air organizations, I would be agreeable to the same course being adopted in Australia, despite the fact that the procedure would involve a great upheaval in this country. I have previously mentioned that there is a staff now employed upon our A ir Services numbering 350. It was the policy of this Parliament and country that an A i r Force should be established. The necessary staff, which includes married men, has been appointed, and contracts have been entered into, in respect of a number of individuals, covering a period of six years.",30,Departments Of Navy And Defence

On the naval side of the Services, the Government have already scrapped one squadron of flying boats, following upon the original cutting-down of these Estimates by the late Treasurer ( Sir Joseph Cook), ere ever the figures had come before honourable members. there are such considerations as the establishment of hangars and the housing necessary for all kinds of stores and equipthe honourable member would still have ment.

The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN ( Mr Watkins) -Order! Every honourable member is entitled to be heard by the Chair without interruption. the honourable member for Batman would go for a flight in one of these machines; he might possibly break his neck. I emphasize that, with a definite commitment of £82,000, the Government are left, for all purposes, with £148,000. orable members cut off another sum of £100,000, the remainder might be sufficient to build a couple of hangars; but that would be about all. The position would be absolutely ridiculous. It is absurd, therefore, to suggest that a further amount of £100,000 can be cut off When I first introduced the Estimates for the Air Services, I stressed that I would not have it understood that the Government were ready to bargain, and to whittle something off here and something else off orable member. I pointed out that I had worked the whole matter down practically to the lowest possible sum. Yet, without any bargainingj I afterwards agreed to cut down the Estimates to the extent of £100,000.

If I had indicated in the first place that I would be agreeable to a reduction of £200,000, said the same. he should have said. not much matter what honourable members the Deputy Leader of the Opposition proposes to do.

I am prepared to encourage civil aviation as far as I think the finances of the Commonwealth will permit. enormous advantages upon some of the wayback parts of Australia. In the far north of Western Australia fhe settlers are weeks, and sometimes months, without a mail, and the conditions are almost intolerable. It is quite impossible to expect settlement on a scale of any magnitude in such conditions. enormous areas of country aTe peopled by a few white men, the great bulk of the work, including boundary riding, being done by aboriginals. It is unreasonable to expect families to go back into that country unless they are given some better means of communication with the centres of population than they have at present. The same conditions apply in the Gulf country and in the north-west of Queensland. civil aviation, I believe that the Assistant Minister for Defence( Sir Granville Ryrie) will have the sympathy of the Committee, but too large a proportion of the vote is set aside for military, and too little not' desiring to pose before the Committee as one who has any knowledge of military affairs, I can say that I believe that one of the best means of defending Australia would be to encourage civil aviation. We would then have a body of trained aviators and machines ready at any time, if called upon, for defence of the countiy. If the Assistant Minister presses his vote for this large sum for military aviation, I think the Committee will decide upon making a further reduction than that proposed. No member of this Committee wishes to be very severe on these items. do not care very much. the Assistant Minister will acquit honourable members of any desire to be unduly severe on him personally. To enable the Commonwealth to pay its way there must be a total saving on the Estimates of upwards of £2,000,000. The Committee has to achieve its object by lopping off so Retrenchment is necessary, much here, and so much there, as the items come before it . The Committee is not able to deal with the situation as it ought to be dealt with. So far 'as I am concerned I mean to effect some very considerable reductions in the total amount I believe that aviation will confer of the Estimates. Cannot the Assistant Minister see his way to increase largely the civil aviation portion of the vote, and reduce the military aviation portion ? If there is one thing which is going to benefit settlement in Australia, and bring something like encouragement and hope to the people who have gone out to the back-blocks, it is improvement in the At present means of communication. By a system of civil aviation the outlying portions of Australia can be brought very much closer into communication with the world and the centres of population in the Commonwealth. This would promote settlement, and would be of enormous advantage to Australia generally. I followed the speech of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton) very closely, and I could see in it no hostility to 1 In his proposals for assisting the civil aviation portion of the vote. If the Assistant Minister will transfer a portion of the vote from the military to the civil side of aviation, he will get a very much larger total vote than if he insists upon keeping the larger portion for military purposes, whilst throwing for civil purposes. While only a morsel to civil aviation. Military airships are taken out occasionally for jaunts, but civil machines and their pilots may be employed regularly under contract to carry mails into the back blocks. I believe that mails will ibe carried shortly between the mainland and the island State of Tasmania.' I believe an offer has already been made to the Department with that end in view. If the daily and weekly avocation of the men and their machines is to carry mails under contract, a force immensely superior to any that could be trained under a military system would be ready in time of trouble. I appeal to the Assistant Minister to meet the Committee in this direction; otherwise, he will probably have his vote reduced beyond the amount he suggests. ter for Works and Railways) [4.9] I want to point out to the Committee exactly what the effect will be if this vote is reduced by £200,000.",32,Departments Of Navy And Defence

In the work of fixing sites, and so 'on, they will be able to do a lot of useful survey work. Under this heading the Committee is asked to provide £400,000. If the amount is reduced by £200,000, the position will be extremely difficult. The Defence Department is already committed to the expenditure of £82,000 in connection with the ordering of machines, supplies, &c.; and there are commitments totalling £24,606 for works under the Works and Railways Department; tenders have been called for works at Point Cook, estimated to cost £15,237. In addition, there is an amount of £69,216 for civil aviation-£55,21 6 under the Defence Department, and £14,000 under the Department of Works and Railways. Therefore, if the total vote be reduced to £200,000, there will be only about £10.000 or so for the provision of hangars and other essential requirements. That amount will be useless. If the vote be reduced as proposed, it will mean practically wiping out the whole A ir Force. Would we be justified in doing that? It is admitted that an efficient A ir Force is essential for the adequate protection of this country. Therefore, honourable members should consider carefully what will be the position of the Army and the Navy if the Air Force is practically cut out. The Assistant Minister( Sir Granville Ryrie) points out that this proposed drastic reduction of the vote will result in bilities to mankind. When the Deputy the dismissal of some hundreds of men, some of whom have been engaged on sixyears' contracts. ingly heavy reductions in the vote, and the compromise should be accepted in a fair spirit. I ask the Committee not to carry this policy to excess by practically destroying what must always be regarded as an essential part of our defence scheme. The Assistant Minister( Sir Granville only £77,000, but are committed to Ryrie) has, I think, supplied very good £100,000, and the figures are being reasons why the vote should be reduced, twisted in such a way that it is difficult seeing that the proposed expenditure will to ascertain the exact position. I am be confined chiefly to new works. The quite prepared to give a vote which will expenditure last year was £77,000. If we add to that another £100,000, there should be sufficient to pay wages and keep in employment the men at present engaged. There is a remarkable discrepancy between the amount asked for purely military aviation and the amount required for civil aviation development. It is extraordinary that nearly six times as much should be spent on activities designed for the destruction of human life and property than is asked for constructive civil work. We all know how the castiron regulations of the Defence Department will work. Machines designed for defence purposes will not be made available for service in a civil capacity. They will be engaged on purely military work. As the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton) has already pointed out, there is a likelihood of military aeroplanes being scrapped, and they, ought to be. Poison gas, as an agent for the destruction of human life, is mainly distributed by means of aeroplanes; and if the Washington Disarmament Conference deals with this aspect of warfare, the use of military aeroplanes might be abolished There should be no increase in our defence vote under this heading, at least until the Washington Conference has come to some decision upon the use of aeroplanes in warfare. If Australia builds up her Military and NavalA i r Forces, and if other nations do likewise, and if professors and scientists continue perfecting methods for the production of poison gas, we may quite safely scrap all our naval vessels, and still be able to carry on a devastating war from the air. The development of a military Air Force is pregnant with the most disastrous possiLeader of the Opposition was speaking, the Minister for Trade and He has made exceedCustoms( Mr Greene) interjected that last year the Government did not spend the amount asked for.

If the expenditure on the military side were reduced, even to the extent of discontinuing all work, I would be prepared to vote a good deal more for the development of a civil air force, because in extending that branch we would be training men who could be transferred to a military air force should the occasion arise. A t present we axe only tying up £200,000 to £300,000, and needlessly employing men, when the money could be profitably utilized in other directions. If these men were being usefully engaged, and could be transferred to the military branch in time of war, I would be prepared to support the vote; but w i th the information now before us I intend to support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Hunter( Mr Charlton). While I desire to see this vote considerably reduced, I do not wish to do anything to destroy the efficiency of our A i r Service. I think that, subject to certain promises and considerations, we might very well be satisfied in reducing the vote by £100,000. ' In the first place, I should like the Assistant Minister( Sir Granville Ryrie) to assure us that none of the promised reduction of £100,000 will be taken from the civil aviation branch. to give that assurance. that honourable members appreciate the travelled. Greater assistance should be value of civil aviation, and realize the given in the matter of subsidizing services possibilities of opening up the country by over a sparsely-populated country than this means.

The natural assumption is that we are giving the Government the right to proceed with works which will cost £375,985, which they propose to spend, less £159,201. ing new in this vote. only one object, and that is to let the Committee know that the Department does not intend to expend' the whole of the money in the present nnancial year. Personally, I am quite prepared to support a reduction of £100,000 on this vote, subject to no reduction being made in the amount to be granted for civil aviation. I think it is the desire of a big majority in this Chamber that civil aviation should be encouraged to a greater extent, and that there should be less expenditure on aviation in the Defence Department. hope the Committee will accept the proposal of the Assistant Minister for Defence( Sir Granville Ryrie), who has stated quite definitely that there is no inin civil occupations to resort to bartention to interfere with the development of civil aviation. One honourable member has said that, until the Washington Disarmament Conference has dealt with air defence, the Committee should take no action whatever; but the honourable member immediately went on to say that, if he were given the opportunity, he would vote against any expenditure on aviation in connection with the Defence Department. In that respect I think the honourable member was inconsistent. The question of air services has not been discussed at the Washington Conference, nor have we any intimation that it is to be considered there. that in the event of an attack on Australia we should have to depend a great deal on aerial craft for defence. With an efficient air service we might be able to keep in check some foe inclined to break every rule of warfare agreed upon between the nations. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton) stated that aerial craft would be used in killing women and children. The world was definitely promised before the late waT that poisonous gases would not be employed under any circumstances, but we know too well that they were used. Where would Australia be to-day if , as part of the British Empire, it had not employed those gases against its late enemies! It is useless to say that all armaments should be scrapped. Some honourable members would prevent Australia from retaining any Forces at all, either for home defence or for use overseas. Although armaments should be limited, there is just as great a necessity as ever for us to be prepared for war. We should not only have the necessary number of men trained, but the best possible equipment should be obtained for them. Another honourable member has stated that nothing of a humanitarian nature has ever been done by the iron hand of militarism. Let me remind him that, when a civil aviator got into trouble between Victoria and Tasmania, the authorities did not rely on civil aviators going to his assistance, but sent the best military aviator the Defence Department could despatch. It is a mistake to imagine that military men are fond of causing bloodshed. They are no more likely to disgrace their uniform than are men barous practices. The Committee has been informed that the commitments under this vote amount to about £124,000. Are we to repudiate them? The question of how many men may be thrown out of employment by the proposed reduction of this vote does not come into consideration. When a mine is closed, hundreds of men may be sent on the tramp, and' it may be a couple of hundred miles to the next mine, but those miners do not complain. They make far less fuss than is made when fifty men are rendered idle at some factory. If a. cessation of armaments It must be admitted could be brought about, I would support it, even if it meant every man employed in the work being idle for six months; but honourable members must realize that a complete elimination of armaments is impossible. While we have them, we must have'the best.

125,Mr Foley (Kalgoorlie) [4.32],"IWith a big coastline such as that of Australia, seaplanes are absolutely necessary. The other day I had a letter from settlers in the south-west of Western Australia, who depend for all supplies, other than those they can grow for themselves, on a vessel which serves their part of the coast. They complained that there is now no boat calling, and these conditions have lasted for a month. Were there military or civil seaplanes available, the Prime Minister( Mr that no money shall be taken out of other Hughes) would not have given me the answer which I received when I asked if anything could be done for them. He said that nothing could be done because no vessels were available. Were there seaplanes available, this or any other Government would have sent them to the assistance of settlers who are doing good work in opening up the country. Civil aviation will be a costly affair, and what has been done in Western Australia has already cost this Government a good deal; though I trust that the result will be an adequate compensation. The north-west part of Western Australia needs opening up inland, and excellent work is being done in providing aeroplane communication there, although this is costing the Australian people a good deal of money. If the use of aeroplanes is found to improve the conditions of out-back centres, and to make life there more beara""ble, more people will go out-back, and there will be less discontent in such places. Had the estimate not been cut down, the Minister could, I think, have provided for a serless system and aeroplane services worked vice of seaplanes along the coast. There are parts of the coast on which vessels cannot travel safely at some periods of the year. We know what has been the fate of vessels that have met a willywilly on the Western Australian coast. A steamer of the largest size may never be heard of again if she encounters one of these disturbances. vice, however, military or civil, could patrol the'coast-the seaplanes would not keep right out over the ocean, of courseand this would greatly benefit the people residing in those parts. A great deal of the money spent on military aviation has really been in the interests of civil aviation,' because it has provided for landing grounds and aerodromes. done in connection with the survey of air Mr Foley. routes from Adelaide to Kalgoorlie and to Norseman, from Fremantle along the coast to Geraldton, and inland from PeakH ill to Leonora, has ibeen provided out of the military vote for aviation, but has been really in the interests of civil aviation. The greater part of the work has been done by military air ofiicers, and military mechanics have been lent for the assistance of civil enterprise. The Minister has given a definite promise votes for military purposes. Economy is all very well, and, no doubt, members sincerely desire to economize, but it is not always economy merely to buy the cheapest thing obtainable, or to spend the least possible amount of money. We possess a great asset, and we should spend suflicient money to make the most of it. Our airmen have proved themselves the best in the world, or, at least, as good as any that are to be found elsewhere. In civil aviation in. Australia there is not a man, with the exception of perhaps two, who was not a military officer. Our civil aviators have been recruited from the military, and they are busy teaching others the game. Having the right class of men, we should provide them with good material. Lateri n the consideration of these Estimates we shall be dealing with proposals for wireless expenditure. Will our friends who talk economy unceasingly wish to cut down the vote for wireless communications, seeing how necessary these are in Australia, which has such wide spaces to bridge ?

If they are not prein the United States of America being pared to do that, the people will deal with treated in the same way. them. is anticipating too much. duce the parliamentary allowance, because my election was a declaration on the .part of my constituents that they favoured the present amount. Aviation is necessary for commercial reasons, and a proper commercial system would prove of great advantage from the military stand-point should war ever break out again. Every honourable member desires to do the right thing in regard to these Estimates. Personally, I am satisfied that the work done so far in connection with aviation is merely experimental, and will have to be scrapped. We have yet no proper Air Service. Citizens of Sydney, who have spent a considerable sum in trying to dethat to occur. I am told by well-informed velop aviation, have told me that the Government and private persons will do well to go slow in their experiments in this direction. We do not know whether the great instruments of destruction in future wars will travel on the water, under Government had the confidence of the the water, in the air, or on the land. We read in periodicals such as the Scientific American that a gas is now known which could destroy every living thing within an area of 2 or 3 miles surrounding any place where a bomb containing it was dropped. Therefore we are at present much in the dark as to the defence preparations which we should make. If I thought it necessary that the Government should make aeroplanes on a large scale, I would suppor.t the proposal; but in our financial circumstances, and with so much uncertainty as to the future, we should not embark on any greater expenditure than may ibe absolutely necessary. I think that it will be a wise course to reduce the vote under consideration. At the inception of electricity, I was engaged in the ordinary way of my business, on an installation in one of the largest offices in Sydney; but owing to the then scant knowledge of the generator all my work proved useless, and other means of light had to be obtained. All the early telephones have been scrapped, and there is now talk of the latest system In view of these facts, it would be wise for the Committee to insist on a reduction of this vote. Of course, if some system of aviation were found that would be permanently efficient, Parliament would have no hesitation in providing the necessary money for its adoption; but we are not now warranted in spending money on experimental work, or imposing on. ourselves a heavy load in connection with defence. We have sent what we may call an ambassador to the Washington Disarmament Conference, and it would be ridiculous to undertake great expenditure on defence works of any kind until the result of that Conference is known. We have been told that the number of employees connected with the Air Services has been increased from 130 to 350, and I confess I do not understand the action of the Government im permitting persons that invention is as yet a longway from providing any flying machines suitable for commercial purposes. I am not asking that this vote shall be reduced simply for the sake of reduction. If the House Government have the confidence of the House? the Government had the confidence of honourable members, the position might be different. In my opinion, the present Government have made greater mistakes than any other Ministry in Australia; too much has been done by regulation, and never before have we seen so great a departure from constitutional government. The Minister( Sir Granville Ryrie) has given us all the information he can, but, really, I do not think be.possesses much knowledge regarding the vote before us. I feel quite confident that the great majority of the people outside, even supporters of the Government, feel that the proposed large expenditure on experimental work connected with aviation is unwarranted.

Many of us were quite jubilant when peace was declared, but there is not a syllable in the 92,000 words of the Peace Treaty about economics and exchange, which are really at the root of all our troubles to-day. The best minds, not only in Australia, but throughout the world, are baffled by this problem, which at present appears almost insoluble. The Government ought not to Tegard the amendment as moved in the spirit of antagonism, for it is really submitted in the best interests of the country, and my vote will be given in its support. a reduction in the vote by 25 per cent, as fairly substantial, and I am pleased to note that the Minister( Sir Granville Ryrie) is prepared to leave unaffected the allocation for civil aviation. In a young country like this, however, with the limited means at our disposal, there ought to be more co-operation between the civil, military, and naval services. In civil aviation men could be trained for military work, and, with a view to economy, a scheme should be devised by which each branch might dovetail one into the other. The training might be undertaken by the military, and landing places utilized for both civil and military purposes. is proposed. ceeds on those lines, the whole of the £300,000 could be spent on aviation for Australia-civil , military, and naval. I do not feel that this vote should be struck out altogether, for we must keep abreast of the times. I do not fear any immediate attack on Australia, but, while devoting the greater part of our attention to civil aviation, we should keep in touch with naval and military aviation. This would insure regular communication between the large, spaces of Australia. am prepared to support the amendment of the honourable member for Hunter( Mr Charlton). Eveni f the proposed reduction be made, there will still be ample funds to carry on the Air Services more efficiently than last year, when we spent only £77,000. We have been informed that the number of employees has been increased; but the reduction pf the vote, if made, ought not to interfere with the continued employment of the larger number. Like some Jew shopkeeper, the Government have "" come down "" £100,000. that. last year we spent only £77,000, and, even with the reduction, the .proposed expenditure is a big jump.

We ought to ""mark time"" in regard to our A i r Services as in the case of the Army and the Navy. There is no economy in abolishing our submarines and battleships, and. at the same time, spending double the money on our A ir Services, which, as I have said, are subject to such rapid developments.

WhilstI agree with the honourable member for Dampier( Mr Gregory) that, if possible, we should 5ote more money for the encouragement of civil aviation, I deThey should be in a class sire to pat the Government on the back for what they have done in that direction during the last twelve months.

The air mail service is an important initial step in the direction of commercial aviation. Sir F. H . Sykes, than whom, I suppose, no man in England knows more about flying, in responding to the toast of "" The Imperial Forces of the Crown,"" proposed by the Prime ""Warden at a Livery dinner of the Fishmongers' Company on 16th July last, saidThey were trying to put aviation on a commercial footing, because it would be a tremendous step forward in the improvement of inter-communication, especially within the Empire, and because they believed that air supremacy would not be obtained by building up military air fleets at a large unproductive expenditure, but by expanding trade, facilitating travel, and harvesting profit from) the air. They hoped that commercial aviation would play a similar part in the country's prosperity as the mercantile marine had done heretofore. All history proved the close connection between progress, power, and communication. In the future development of civil aviation they looked for the assistance of the Dominions. The Imperial authorities may be looking to us for our assistance, but we shall not be giving it to them if we reduce this proposed vote by £100,000. member think that the amount which will be left will be a very good start ? ache, I go to the dentist; if I want my boots repaired, I go to another expert. The Ministers sitting at the table are the experts upon these Estimates, and when they tell the Committee, as they have done, that a reduction of these Estimates by £200,000 will mean the closing-down of the aviation establishment, I am not prepared to vote for such a reduction. They have a more intimate knowledge of the facts than I have. happening in Japan, Java, and China, just north of Australia? Large air fleets are being built up, especially in Java. say that they are intended for purposes of aggression, but air fleets are developing rapidly in those countries, and mostly under British tuition. Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton) has told us that Field-Marshal Sir Henry Wilson is reported in to-day's newspaper as having said that we should wipe out the air services because they kill women and children. I worked in close conjunction with the air services on the Belgian coast when they were bombarding Zeebrugge, Ostend, and other places. The air squadrons usually started on their mission at about midnight, and to watch them starting was an interesting and weird experience. There would be perhaps thirty or forty machines lined up in a row, and every pilot in turn would be called before the squadron leader, who was, perhaps, a young fellow of 22 or 24 years of age, with two rows of ribbons, all earned, on his breast. Leaning against the corner of a shanty and smoking a cigarette he would call up his different pilots"" No. 4. Have you got your chart? Do you know your objective j "" "" The submarine dock, sir."" "" All right, get ready."" "" No. 5. Do you know your objective?"" ""Sheds Nos. 3 and 4, sir."" And so every man in turn was questioned. Each had a chart upon which his objective was clearly markedWhen everybody was ready, the order would be given to stand by and then let go, and one after another the machines, without flights, rose into the air, manoeuvred for a few minutes, and then made for their objectives. A t daybreak all the machines that returned were counted in. Some never returned, and, subsequently, little pink envelopes were sent to relatives in England. The Squadron Commander would interrogate his pilots"" No 5. What did you get?"" ""Sheds Nos. 3 and 4 sir."" "" All right, check in."" "" No. 4. What did you get?"" And so on, right down the lane. A ll those pilots were definitely instructed not to destroy women and children if it was avoidable, but to concentrate their bombs on the fortifications or What is other definite objectives.

""What he said was perfectly correct. ¥ c should have more sea-planes than land machines, and I refer honourable members to the map of the Australian coastline for the reason. Along the New South Vales coast, for instance, there are, north of Sydney, great rivers at intervals of twenty-five miles, and on thc south side there are Jervis Bay and various other sheltered inlets providing calm water upon which the machines can descend in any weather. Just before I left EnglandI had the pleasure of seeing nine great seaplanes that were ready for the bombardment of the German coast. They were enormous machines.

But another method of communication has now been made available to us through the conquest of the air, and this vote brings the matter directly under consideration by the Committee.

We may say what we please about our expectations of the great good that is to come out of the Washington Conference; but as yet it is but a project which has not taken definite shape. Many projects, not less ambitious than this, have been put forward from time to time, and, indeed, have, emanated from the most unexpected quarters. Long before our time the Czar of all the Russias put forward a proposal of a like kind. The dove of Peace was to spread its soft wings and fly freely over a world sick of war. such a proposal should emanate from such a source, was in the seventh heaven of delight. All nations were enraptured over it. into empty air, while the world went on its bad old way, stumbling at last into the bloody morass of the great world war. It is one thing, of course, to limit armaments; is another thing to tear out from mankind those deeply-seated, deeply-rooted motives and impulses that make for war, and implant in their place a love of peace. Whether the Washington Conference can do this or not, time will determine. one thing is certain: that five and a-half million people cannot afford to beat the sword into the ploughshare and quietly lay down with nothing between them and destruction, without reasons much more substantial than a mere resolution of the Washington Conference, which, even if given effect to, does not abolish war, but only limits naval armaments. We should not take the first step in a matter vital to our existence while other nations do nothing. has approved a proposal to limit naval armaments, yet it was only yesterday that the very nation that made this proposal launched a great battleship, and within the next few days its example will be followed by another of those who embrace the proposal for disarmament with great enthusiasm-Japan is also to launch a big warship. The only nation which has been consistent, and shown its bona fides, is Great Britain, which has given an order striking consternation into the hearts of the people of England, and, incidentally, throwing thousands of men out of employment. ilfr. Hughes. we live in a world of stern realities. Australia has no great battleships, and the effect of the decision at Washington will leave us untouched, or nearly untouched, so far as our naval expenditure is concerned. The battlecruiser Australia is already* out of commission, and whether it be scrapped or not it does not affect the issue, because it does not exist as a fighting unit. If now we are to scrap our Air Eorces, a means which has been fashioned by circumstances expressly for the use of a small body of people like ourselves, to The world, though astounded that whom has been intrusted the destiny of a great continent, we shall be placed at an appalling disadvantage. I am surprised that honourable members should suggest a But it passed, and dissolved further reduction of this vote by £100,000. I agree with the honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr Marks) that it would have been better had we stood by the vote as first submitted. It is only because I am satisfied that it is impossible to spend it the £100,000 during the current year, that the Government have made the suggestion to reduce the vote to that extent. Under cover of this vote, I want the Committee to consider another matter But which, strictly speaking, is outside the Scope of our present discussion, but is certainly relative to it, and which I mentioned when I had the honour of presenting to honourable members the report of the proceedings of the Imperial Conference. I refer to the question of airships. The time at our disposal for saying "" Yes"" or "" No"" to this proposal will shortly expire. Opportunity is now presented to Australia to take advantage of this new method of communication, and bring itself within eight The Washington Conference or nine days of Europe. The matter is enormously important to this country. If it be merely regarded as an advertisement, it will be the cheapest advertisement we could have; but if l i e experiment proves successful, as I fully anticipate it will, we shall in one bound be loosened from the fetters imposed by our remoteness and brought in close touch with the western world. I hope honourable members will give earnest consideration to the recommendation which I had the honour of submitting to them some weeks ago. I informed the House that the British Government had We love peace, but decided to scrap the magnificent fleet of air-ships it had secured as the result of the expenditure of £40,000,000, but had abstained from doing so in order to give this Parliament a chance of saying -whether it was prepared to take advantage of the unique opportunity of ascertaining by experimental flights whether air-ships could safely make a journey between Australia and Europe. I then ventured to hope that this Parliament would express its opinion on the matter at an early date, and that it would do so in the affirmative. was placed on the Estimates which would enable honourable members to discuss the question? been placed on the table before I had an opportunity, of speaking on the subject. This is clearly a matter for which no Government shoidd be asked to accept sole responsibility; Parliament. I do not place the proposal before honourable members as part of the Government's policy, but I bring it forward because I think it is the duty of this Parliament to say whether it should or should not take upon itself the responsibility of carrying out the experiment. shortly, in terms of financial responsibility. perimental operations there would be involved an expenditure of £1,339,000, or, allowing for expenditure upon experiments of flying to Australia, £1,647,000. The idea was that Britain and those of the Dominions concerned in the scheme would contribute as follows:-Britain one-half and the Dominions the other half. I am not in a position to say what Britain or the other Dominions will do. But what I would ask the Committee to express an opinion upon is this: Assuming, for the sake of argument, that £1,647,000 represents the total expenditure of Great Britain and all tbe Dominions for giving effect to the scheme, it would mean a yearly expenditure of £""800,000. mating the Dominions' share of that yearly expenditure at £400,000, and that our share of that would be one-half, the expense to Australia would be £200,000 for each year of the two-years' period. That is the expenditure involved in a scheme in which Governments only would take part. Mr Ashbolt, the Agent-General for Tasmania, and a most capable business man, put forward a scheme which was brought before the A i r Committee, composed of the highest experts in Great Britain, in which the general public would be asked to take up shares. He proposed a joint Government and private enterprise scheme, with a capital of £1,500,000. Under his scheme the Dominions would subscribe £375,000 towards the first issue of £750,000, and £375,000 towards the second issue. The general public would subscribe £375,000 towards the first issue, and the British Government would take up the whole or part of the second issue of £375,000, otherwise the general public would take it up. There would be a subsidy of £500,000 per annum for ten years, the British Government contributing £250,000 towards this for ten years, and' the DoI t is a question . fqr minion Governments £250,000 also for ten years. I shall not delay the Committee by attempting to elaborate these details. If honourable members consider the question of sufficient importance, and if prima facie their minds are not hostile to the proposal, but they are willing to consider it, I shall have prepared, and I want to put the position will table, a statement setting out the prospective liabilities of the CommonEor a two-years' period of exwealth Government, if it should become a party to the proposal, and will then fix a convenient day on which to give honourable members an opportunity of saying yes or no to the scheme proposed.

As soon as I have a definite proposal on the subject of wireless communication I shall table it, and honourable members will be able to discuss it. WhatI ask now is that the Committee should say whether it is desirous of discussing this matter of air communication. If it says that it is, I shall assume that honourable members are prepared to consider the proposal on its merits, and are not irrevocably hostile to it. able gentleman not move the addition of some words to the Air Service Estimates which would enable the Committee to consider the* matter? does approve of the scheme, the £100,000, by which the Government propose to reduce the Air Service Estimates, might very well be used for the purposes of such a scheme as that which I have mentioned. I shall leave the matter now. confident that we shall lose a very great opportunity, which will never recur, if we allow this matter to pass. airships cost in the aggregate millions of money. They are to be handed over as a free gift to give effect to the scheme I have outlined. That they can make the passage from England to Australia. I am as certain as that I can walk down the steps of this building. The question is, have we faith and are we prepared to spend a little money in order to demonstrate this to the people of Australia and to the whole world? Once we have demonstrated it, the development of this means of communication must rest on a business basis. But the Government must come in to pioneer the way. If we can bring mails from Englandi n this way it will give a great impetus to civil aviation in this country. I shall not detain the Committee any longer. I hope in the first place that honourable members will not agree to the proposal that £200,000 should be struck off this vote, and secondly, I hope that they will indicate briefly whether they approve of my suggestion that, after tabling some information which will be useful, I should seek an opportunity to fix a date for the discussion of the airship proposal. The Government have proposed a reduction of the vote for Air Services by 25 per cent. If we reduce the vote of £400,000 by £100,000, that will leave £300,000. If from that amount we take £122,000 for commitments, that will leave £178,000, and as £69,000 is the vote proposed for civil aviation, that leaves only £109,000 for the Air Service for the Military. If we believe in defence at all, we must give the Defence Department some money for this service, and in my opinion £109,000 is little enough for this branch of defence. I consider aviation is the most important branch of defence for a country like Australia. This should be evident when we take into consideration the way in which it may promote the development of the continent. Our battleships and military forces do not contribute one iota to the development of Australia. But the expansion of aviation, whether under military or civil control, must materially assist in the I am development of our unoccupied spaces. I have been very pleased to listen to the advocacy of civil aviation. My These only complaint is that the vote proposed to assist it is insufficient. Already there has been an arrangement entered into with a Western Australian company for the carriage of mails, involving a sum of £25,000 per annum.

For the assistance of these services, I find that apart from votes in these Works Estimates for the construction of hangars and so on, there is set down in the General Estimates a sum of only £17,000. It is, possibly, out of order for me to refer to the General Estimates, but my purpose is to suggest that as there probably will be some unexpended balances of the votes appearing in these Works Estimates, I should like to see the amounts unexpended on these votes transferred to the votes appearing in the General Estimates to be used for subsidizing commercial air services throughout Australia. If the Government would give the Committee an assurance that that course would be followed, it would, possibly, induce honourable members to pass these Estimates as they stand. With regard to the service mentioned by the honourable member for Dampier( Mr Gregory) to the Northern Territory, I should like to say that ever since February last a company has been operating in the interior of Queensland, with head-quarters at Longreach, and running north to Cloncurry, and at times coming down south ag far as Charleville. That company has been operating fairly successfully, but, as honourable members are aware, it has no mail contracts such as the Western Australian, company has, and has had to depend for its revenue entirely on passenger traffic and special traffic from different towns into outlying parts of the country. The position has been reached that it has been found impossible for any company to carry on if it is to be entirely dependent upon such sources of income. People at present do not greatly trust aeroplanes. They may venture in them for a joy-ride, lasting fifteen or twenty minutes, but, generally speaking, they do not regard them as quite safe and dependable. We are in such a position now that if , because of lack of support, these commercial air companies should cease operations the effect may be that civil aviation may be set back possibly ten or twenty years. Once people lose capital in a venture, it is difficult to induce them to make a fresh start. If , as I suggest, unexpended balances of the has votes appearing in these Works Estimates are transferred to the General Estimates for the purpose of subsidizing civil aviation, we shall be iga a position to favourably consider applications for assistance from any company operating throughout Australia. The Prime Minister has referred to the loneliness of many of the great outback areas of Australia. When little more than a boy, I lived for a time in the north-west of Queensland, and I was struck with the lack of womenfolk in those empty lands. The life there was such that holders of properties would o not think of bringing the women of their households away from the towns and cities to share the harsh, isolated conditions with them. The domestic servants were chiefly Japanese. In the absence of the women of the families, there was no home-life; and, altogether, little inducement was offered to extension of settlement. I was once travelling in the north-west areas, when I came to a station which was 160 miles from the nearest railway line. ThereI met a little woman, the wife of the manager. Six months previously, before her marriage, she had been in a millinery establishment in Brisbane. I asked her if she did not feel lonely. She admitted that she did, but added that, since the telephone had been .connected with the station, she was now able to talk with' her neighbour. This neighbour, I might add, was some 40 miles distant. Even so, the presence of this modern facility made the lady's loneliness somewhat less marked. With the extension of the use of the telephone and of the motor car the great empty distances out-back have been, to some extent, bridged; thus, the conditions of settlement have been made a little more bearable, and, to that extent, just a little more attractive. It does not necessarily follow that the telephone and the motor car are in general use throughout the back country, but that the facilities arei there, to be drawn upon when necessary, for the purpose of getting into touch with civilization. Similarly, with the establishment of aeroplane services, it is not so much a question of additional provision for regular travel to and fro across the lonely parts of Australia, but that the people out beyond may know that, in case of actual need, they may swiftly get into touch with civilization hy way of such speedy services. miles from the railhead may be very quickly bridged by a flying machine. The Government would be acting wisely if they were to provide a little more to assist the development of civil aviation, so that the services already in existence might be still further developed. would be an encouragement to development out-back if the air services were conton Conference, I can only say, for this ducted, not only along the main routes, such as, for example, between Sydney and » Darwin, but if branch services could be established in other directions. such opportunities for maintaining contact with civilization, settlers would not be so averse, perhaps, to taking their womenfolk into the lonely regions. This country cannot be settled in the absence of women. It is essential that conditions of life should be made better for people in the distant areas of which I have been speaking. Concerning the matter immediately before the Committee, I am totally opposed to the views expressed by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Deputy Leader of the Country party ( Mr Charlton), and I shall vote against the amendment. consistent is the honourable member, remembering the vote which he gave a little while ago. pared to vote with the object of bringing about a reduction of the general Defence Estimates, it is not to be assumed that I believe that this country requires no means of defence whatever. cess of the amendment would entail scrapping all measures of defence by way of the air. The proposed expenditures, both upon the military and the civil side of the services, are fair and reasonable. And they would be more so if it were provided that the portion devoted to the miliright this time, anyway. tary works, if not expended, should be transferred to the development of &he civilian service. The Prime Minister has suggested that matters touching upon international air services, wireless, and the like, should be dealt with by Parliament prior to the consideration of the Estimates; but that ^ Minister is trying to make it appear that the subjects, generally, are interwoven. Even distances up to 600 I do not propose to debate that aspect, especially since the Prime Minister has promised that an opportunity shall be afforded for honourable members to go into the whole matter on some future occasion. But, as for the further statement of the Prime Minister, that honourable It members' views are being influenced and their motives actuated by the Washingside of the House, that the Opposition has made its position perfectly clear, and that its members are consistent. I am surWith prised, however, in listening to the views of members of the Country party. With the press of Australia behind them every time, they constantly talk, outside of Parliament, of what they intend to do, in Parliament, in the matter of retrenchment. But their actions are utterly inconsistent. Only a little while ago they voted to secure a reduction of the Estimates by the amount of the estimated deficit. Today, however, they oppose a specific proposition for reduction. The experienced Gregory), who has been, the bridge-builder for the Government all the time, has spoken in this Committee with one voice to-day; but the young and inexperienced Leader of the Country party has been speaking with another While I was prevoice outside of Parliament. These inconsistent views are only emphasized by the opposition of the Country party to the amendment which I have proposed, and it is time the public learned The sucwhere that party really stands. Its members must be either for one thing or another; but they do not appear to know from one day to the next where they are or how they will vote. are, from the point of view of the Minister controlling the air services. It will be agreed that the Country party is getting a lot of publicity in its campaign for retrenchment. But, inside of Parliament, its members are not true to their colours.

The Prime Minister has invited the sense of the House concerning such questions as an airship service between Great Britain and Australia. It has been said that a certain class of people rush in where angels fear to tread. Great Britain has been spending scores of millions of pounds upon .the airship problem; but now she has given up her activities in that direction as a hopeless and altogether too expensive job. That is the decision of Great Britain, with all her resources. But the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth has returned from Britain with his head, so to speak, in the clouds. And he proposes to submit to the Commonwealth Legislature a scheme by which we may be committed to an expenditure of several hundreds of thousands of pounds annually. If there were anything commercially feasible in an airship service, it would be first established between America and Great Britain. On no condition shall I be led to vote any money in support of this scheme for linking up Australia and Britain with an airship service. Australia already has too many expensive white elephants, such as Australia House, Canberra, and the Northern Territory, and we ought not to add to them. The honourable member for Moreton( Mr The reason for that is seen immediately Wienholt) seems to consider that the announcement by the Assistant Minister for Defence( Sir Granville Ryrie) that he proposes to cut £100,000 off the Estimates, represents some sort of concession to the principles which the Corner party have been espousing for the last few weeks. The Prime Minister( Mr Hughes), when speaking on this question, told the Committee that he suggested taking £100,000 off the Estimates because the Government had not time to spend it. Minister did not say that. ter said the financial year was so far advanced that the Government suggested taking £100,000 off the Estimates. The obvious inference is that there is not sufficient time for the Government to spend the money. The same explanation was put forward by the Prime Minister in connection with the previous Estimates, 4 ' when he said that five months of the financial year had expired, and, therefore, there remained only seven months iu which to spend the money. If the honourable member for Moreton decided not to spend something because there was not time to spend it in, he would hardly be entitled to regard that as a saving. I suppose the position is such that honourable members in the Corner party are quite content to clutch at a straw. If the Estimates are to be reduced, the only way to reduce them is to carry the amendment moved by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton), which, when the Prime Minister's statement is taken into consideration, means that the real Estimates will be cut down by £100,000. ""A sum of £100,000 will be cut off because the money cannot be spent in the time, and another £100,000 if the amendment is carried. Much has been said' about the Washington Conference, and Great Britain has been cited by the Prime Minister as a shining example, because it has suspended its shipbuilding programme, and thrown some thousands of men on the Clyde out of employment. Great Britain, the United States of America, and Japan are, we are told, coming to some sort of arrangement not to do away with armaments for naval and military purposes, but to adopt a species of truce for ten years, leaving the naval and military armaments, however, in relatively the same position as before. one tries to understand the economic position of those three countries. We see Great Britain getting out of Mesopotamia and limiting her expenditure there. A t the same time there is a proposal for cutting down the Naval Estimates. Great Britain, when she went to the Conference, proposed to launch a programme of four ships which were to cost from £8,000,000 to £10,000,000 each. This means that if a naval agreement were arrived at there would be a saving of at least £40,000,000. The same forces are operating to cut down the huge naval programme in the United States of Ameriea. At the same time; there are millions of unemployed in Great Britain, and from 6,000,000 to 85000,000, according to different computations, ih ,the United States of America.

Therefore, I shall support all amendments moved in this House for the purpose of wiping out votes for armaments for the Army, Navy, or Air Services, which will be used by the representatives of certain interests in this country for the purpose of embroiling our workers with the workers of some other country. I cannot understand any one supporting a reduction of armaments because of the Washington Conference. That Conference, in my opinion, is one of the greatest hoaxes that has been perpetrated on humanity. The Prime Minister mentioned, incidentally, that we should remember attempts that had been made in a similar direction in the past. He recalled the action of In Australia the Czar of Russiai n convening the First Peace Convention at The Hague. A few years later Russia was at loggerheads with Japan. Notwithstanding that the arbitration tribunal had been If it were not for the set up at The Hague, as soon as the Russian concessionaires on the Yalu got in ""holts"" with the Japanese timber merchants war took place. The same position may develop as the outcome of the Washington Conference. We hear a lot of talk about the new democratic method of diplomacy, and of that hardened old diplomat, Mr Balfour, who is supposed to be one of Britain's most astute elder diplomats, being converted to the new system of open-door diplomacy. Thus the stage is set at Washington with senators and congressmen in the galleries vociferously applauding all that is being said about disarmament and the ""five, < five, three"" standard. But immediately the Conference proceeds to discuss the real business, that is the Far Eastern problem, away goes all this business of the new diplomacy, and we find the delegates meeting in secret caucus behind closed doors. As soon as it becomes a question of parcelling out territory, they drop the open-door diplomacy. Discussions about the limitations of battleships and other types of warships takes place in the open, because decision on these matters will not make any material difference to the principal nations engaged in the Conference, seeing that the power of Great Britain, of the TJnited States of America, and Japan will be just as effective after as before the Conference.

I am trying to show the fallacy of that argument by drawing attention to the fact that the work that has been done openly at Washington cannot affect the international situation actually, and that we know really nothing about the real business of the Conference which, as I have stated, is being transacted behind closed doors. This secret business vitally affects Australia. It may involve this country in war. My purpose in voting to cut down these Estimates is to curtail the power of those people in Australia 'who, in common with their kindred class in other countries, are at any time responsible for warfare. Seeing that I cannot get rid of those who manipulate politics in such a fashion as to force the working men and women of various countries into war, all I can do is to endeavour to curGreat Britain, is absurd, because the protail their power as far as possible by voting to cut down Estimates of war expenditure, such as are now before us. I agree with other honourable members as to the wisdom of spending, for the development of civil aviation, the amount proposed to be cut away from the military side of aviation. Honourable members do not want the peculiar conditions of this country to be stressed at any great length. travelled throughout Australia realize what an incalculable benefit the development of civil aviation would be. Great benefits may also be expected from the development of air communication with Europe and America. I shall do what I can to cut to the lowest possible amount the sum to be spent on defensive armaments, whether on land or sea, or in the air. Sitting suspended from 6.29 to 8 p.m. endeavoured to follow the speech of the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) in regard The honourable to an air service between Australia and Europe, or Australia and Great Britain, and its relation to this vote. The right honourable gentleman endeavoured to create the impression that in casting a vote for or against this amendment we would be recording a decision on the other question. The Prime Minister distinctly stated that he wished us to express an tween Australia and Great Britain should or should not be discussed, and that this was the only opportunity that honourable members would have of doing so.' The only way that the Committee can express an opinion is by voting on a specific motion. Whether the question is worthy of consideration or not, it is the duty of the Government to allow an independent vote to be taken. I do not know if honourable members realize that they will be committing themselves in the manner suggested by the Prime Minister; but I wish it to be clearly understood that my vote on this amendment will not give any indication as to how I shall vote on the other proposal. To say that by supporting the amendment moved by the honourable member for Hunter( Mr Charlton) o we would be jeopardizing the proposal to establish an aerial service between Australia and Europe, and Australia and posed vote is largely for Defence purposes, and the proposal outlined by the Prime Minister has, I understand, no relation to Defence at all. These separate proposals should be treated on their merits, and my vote on this occasion cannot be construed to mean that I am voting for or against the suggestion to establish a service between Australia and Europe. All who have In view of what the world has gone through, and which we hope, by the wisdom of those gathered together in Washington, may be prevented in the future;",50,Departments Of Navy And Defence

194,Dr. Maloney (Melbourne) [8.4],"this is the one branch of our Defence system which is most likely to secure my support. The Government are prepared lo reduce the proposed vote by 25 per cent.; but I would have preferred to have seen them scrap all their ships, because we would then have had an opportunity of utilizing the money in a more useful direction. We have 12,000 miles of coast-line, and we have been informed that the cost of a single super-Dreadnought would be sufficient to establish aerial staglad to know that there is likely to be tions around the whole of it . It would, 1 some agreement on that point. suppose, be necessary to erect one or two such stations on the long stretch of coast between Perth and Adelaide; but between Adelaide and Melbourne, Melbourne and Sydney, and Sydney and Brisbane, I do not think there would be the same necessity. If we exclude the distance between Adelaide and Brisbane from the total distance around the Australian coast, 8,000 miles would have to be protected. If we allow a radius of 200 miles for each station, 400 miles would be covered, so that it would require 20 aerial stations to enable practically the whole of the Australian coast-line to be under observation. Speaking subject to correction, I think it can be said that the danger in the air is infinitely greater than the danger under the water, and it certainly is when the number of men employed in the respective services is taken into consideration. Every man who renders servioe in the air incurs great risks, and I have often wondered why those who risk their lives in this way should not receive similar payment, wear a similar uniform, and partake of similar food. There does not seem to be any valid reason why there should be any such absurd distinctions in connection with the Defence Eorces of Australia such as prevailed in the recent great war. The Minister for the Navy( Mr Laird Smith) said that a super-Dreadnought costs about £9,000,000, and I have been informed that a Dreadnought similar to that which the Japanese will launch in a few days, including all armaments, costs at least £12,000,000. I estimate that one-half of that amount would be sufficient to establish twenty fully-equipped air stations round the Australian coast. I think honourable members will agree with me that no method of defence is likely to be of more use to mankind than aviation. The arguments of the honourable member for Maranoa( Mr Hunter) were good, for it is true that this vast continent has only been embroidered with population, and that, beyond the coastline, many parts of the interior axe unexplored, and their possibilities unknown. An air service manned by men of experienpe would, therefore, be of considerable importance in opening up the interior. I understand there is no desire in this House to limit the cost of civil aviation, and I am Professor Luff, one of the keenest professional men in Great Britain, said that, in his opinion, before very long, a meeting of chemists would be of far greater importance to the defence of a country against an enemy than a meeting of generals; and if honourable members cared to peruse Martindale, they would find more substantial facts than some which have been submitted here. They would learn that the Germans devoted years of study to ascertaining how gases of a vile description could attack human beings in such a way as to prevent them from using their limbs. Gases were manufactured which would cause severe irritation where perspiration was most1 likely to occur, and where they would be most horrible in their action. It therefore seems to be a mistake on the part of the Government to reduce the aviation vote. I would have been more pleased if they had swept all other Defence expenditure into the limbo of oblivion, and devoted their energies in fully equipping a modern servioe in the air to defend this great Commonwealth. I glory in the belief that Australians enjoy greater freedom than the citizens in Great Britain because, in that country, even after the horrors of war, and the supposed improvement in thej conditions of the people, the men and women, fo a large extent, have to occupy a degraded position. Their franchise is only to be laughed at; but the time will come when even the aristocrats of the Homeland will learn common sense, and will follow the practice adopted in the Dominions. When we consider the main Estimates, I shall be prepared to assist the Government in increasing the expenditure on air defence, so that our coastline may always be under proper observation, because, after all, it is the most effective form of defence. I hate and loathe the idea of war, and of civilized human beings being responsible for bloodshed. that 5 per cent, of the world's popuMajesty to the service of the year 1021-22, for lation is civilized. that China is the only country which ings, &c., a sum not exceeding £2,518,411."" has been able to live in comparative peace, and extend its boundaries without war and bloodshed, but even adopted.

The proposed expenfor 1921-22 is £5,597,174, or an increase diture on the items set forth in the Works of £1,719,262. This increase is made up Estimates totals £5,597,174, all of which of the following amounts:is covered by this B ill ; and, in addition, provision is made to the extent of £370,000 against the possibility of expenditure on ship construction proceeding at a greater rate than is anticipated; and £72,476 is set down for expenditure at the Federal Capital, that being the unexpended balance of £150,000 that was authorized to be expended last year. Lastly, there is provision for the redemption of £3,000,000 worth of Treasury bills. These sums total £9,039,650, from which is to be deducted £669,244, the amount available under appropriations authorized by previous Acts; leaving the sum of £8,370,406, which we now ask for authority to appropriate. The Trust Fund investments of the Treasury include Treasury-bills amounting to £6,094,153. The moneys derived by the sale of Treasury-bills to the Trust Fund were used for works from time to time, payable from Loan Fund. By the end of the present year, however, the Trust the Fund will probably be depleted, so that it will be unable to carry the whole of this investment. Authority is therefore sought to redeem £3,000,000 worth of Treasury-bills, and thus to restore to the Trust Fund the necessary cash.

A portion of the provision for the current year is to meet purchases made last year which were not delivered by the 30th June last, and includes the sum of £901,239 for telegraph and telephone works, &c, which honourable members, no doubt, will approve. clude, without alteration, the items of the Loan Estimates? those Estimates. The proposed loan expenditure was bound up with the other Estimates of Expenditure, so that honourable members might have the fullest information about the financial proposals of the Government. realize that this is a Bil l to be discussed, board shed; and we ought to remember not on the second reading, but in Committee; and that its schedule embodies the Estimates of Expenditure out of loan funds. Evidently it is intended to use upthis year the surplus at the credit of the Trust Eund. dicated will be required, and,, therefore, we must replace in the Trust Fund the money used for the purchase of Treasury bills. of getting on with business, I shall defer most of what I have to say until, in Committee, we come to deal with the schedule of the Bill. I understand that whatever the Committee may decide in regard te the items of the schedule will take effect; that any reductions it makes must be carried out. An item to which I shall draw attention in Committee is that affecting immigration. I notice, too, that the Defence expenditure out of loan is to be greater this year than last. The Prime .Minister( Mr Hughes) has indicated that if honourable members wish to reduce any of these items, the Government will be only too pleased to comply; and we ought, therefore, to carefully scrutinize the figures in Committee, and give the Government a lead. I do not know what the temper of the House is, but I am quite sure that honourable members do not understand what is proposed by this Bill. We have been given very little information in that regard; but I gather that this is the first time that we have proposed to erect post offices and meet the expenses of immigration out of loan moneys. It is a most pernicious system to so provide for such liabilities. It is proposed that we shall continue, as Tqe are now doing, to issue loans at £95 instead of at par, and to pay 6 and 6^ per cent., which really schedule inmeans about £6 14s. 6d. per cent. grants are worth it all. children to bear the cost of bringing immigrants to Australia, because we have not the courage to bear it ourselves. I notice in the schedule an item of £4 for the erection of a wireless station at Port Moresby. I suppose this is a weatherthat some years ago there was some public agitation because a State Parliament provided, out of loan, for cups and wooden spoons for the use of the Governors of the various States. Has the National Parliament actually reached that level? Very many country post-offices are exceedingly f r a i l buildings, and yet the Government are asking this House to meet the cost of them out of loan, instead of out of revenue. Surely the time will come when the public men of this country will realize that this sort of borrowing must cease-ther e must be a limit to it. It has been said that the policy of Australia is one of ""boom, borrow, and bust""; at any rate, that is the sort of policy we are asked to adopt now. A t the present time, there is no part of Australia where the eye does not rest on pleasant and fertile landscapes, with sheep and cattle browsing in grass up to their knees; yet we are proposing to borrow money for such purposes as I have referred to. Since Australia has been Australia, no loan has proved so expensive as those floated by the ex-Treasurer ( Sir Joseph Cook). Hitherto we have met the costs, of immigration out of revenue, and we ought to continue doing so, for we must remember that some of these immigrants will have died a short time after their arrival.

213,Mr West,"But it is asking ourwelfare of the Empire. That honourable gentleman has appealed to the Dominions not to raise loans in England just now; and it is true that unless eare is taken we shall never get rid of our economic and exchange troubles. We should export as much as possible, and do everything we can to diminish imports, with a view to bringing about the equilibrium of the money market. If there was any special need for a rush of immigrants, there might be some grounds for the provision proposed to be made by means of this Loan Bill, but such necessity is not suggested. In private business, when money is urgently required, an overdraft is obtained, or short-dated debentures issued, provision being made for redemption; and that is the sort of thing we should do. I have heard honourable members make strong remarks about wholesale and indiscriminate borrowing by the States, but the Commonwealth is going the same road, as this Bill shows. The Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) does not attempt to deal in the proper way with the position; he regards matters in an . elastic expansive sort of way, and does not care where the money comes from, or what may occur in the future. I urge honourable members to pay a little more attention to the financial position of Australia. The ex-Treasurer ( Sir Joseph Cook) some little time ago gave us figures showing the taxation per head in Australia, New Zealand, and Great Britain; but if be had been honest and told all the truth, he would have added that Great Britain paid 33 per cent, of the war cost out of revenue, and to-day is devoting 33 per cent, of the revenue to the reduction of the war debt. That is an example we are called upon to follow in Australia to-day. I cannot make any proposal at this stage, and I do not know what the members of the Country party intend to do; but God help posterity if its fate is left in their sort are at work in the Treasury, so long hands, and its prospects are bad enough in the hands of the Government. It is for the Opposition to bring the Government and the country to an appreciation of sound financing. We know that all the extravagance is due to the abundance of loan moneys. The Government are something like a man who goes on the "" bust "" ; there is no worry about the future, and an absolute indifference in the expenditure of borrowed money. I know these facts are distasteful to' some honourable members, but it is time to make the truth known, and rouse public men to a realization of our actual position. In the States, too, as States, there seems to be just as much indifference to proper responsibility, and to the future; the only idea seems to be to create a glorious time by raising loan moneys. Have no honourable members had any commercial training? Have they had more connection with finance than the spending of their own parliamentary ""screw?"" Do they think that everybody can be made happy and comfortable simply by borrowing? Surely there must be some desire for honest financing? Production is going ahead in Australia now; but God help us if we have a drought! Our friends of the Country party have never enjoyed better times or more luxury than now, but they ought to remember that there is a possibility of other droughts. We should then, of necessity, have to borrow; but there is no necessity now. There is abundance of wealth in Australia. When the last Commonwealth 1 loan was being floated at £96 instead of par, Sif Denison Miller, Governor of the Commonwealth Bank, said that there was £147,000,000 in Australia bearing no interest, £157,000,000 bearing interest, and £121,000,000 in various institutions that should be put to use; therefore there was no need to worry about the raising of a paltry £10,000,000. If Federal finance, instead of being controlled by men connected with insurance companies, banking companies, the Broken Hill Proprietary Company, and other big commercial institutions, were controlled by Treasury officials paid to watch the best interests of the Commonwealth, the last loan would never have been offered to the public at £96. So long as influences of that will we have a continuance of this reckless indifference, and this unhealthy desire of certain men to enrich the companies in which they are shareholders. One man draws from an insurance company over £5,000 per annum, and as he cannot serve two masters, the company that pays his salary, and not the nation, is the master that he serves. He merely usee the nation to assist to make his company wealthy, and every £ 9 6 which the company paid into the last loan immediately appeared as £100 amongst its assets. Thus the directors are able to claim credit for the successful work they have done in the interest of the shareholders, who pay them handsome salaries to manage the company's affairs.

No man is more affected by the high rate of interest than is the man on the land. I remember that when the Labour Government were proposing to establish the Commonwealth BankI was canvassing in the Werriwa district, and, at the suggestion of the manager of the local branch of the Bank of New South Wales; I addressed a meeting in front df the bank on a Monday morning. There are very many Scotchmen in that district, and my hearers were very anxious to gain some information about the projected Commonwealth Bank. They told me that they feared the consequences of its 'establishment. I endeavoured to explain to them what the Bank would do. I must admit that it is not doing all I would like it to do, or all that the people expecwe wonder at the marvellous manner in ted and the Legislature empowered it to do. They said, ""We are afraid that if another bank is established the restilt will be an increase in the rate of interest."" However, I was able to tell them that there was no such possibility. I pointed out that a Government institution would not need to earn profit; that sovereigns would ibe of no value to it, because, having the Commonwealth at its back, it had greater credit, and that its more extended opportunities for trade would enable it to reduce the rate of interest, and they would be shareholders. result was that more Labour votes were polled in that locality at the subsequent election than had been polled there be.. fore. I had no intention of speaking at length to-night. HadI been prepared I could have given honourable members much more information than I have given them; but possibly when we are dealing with the general Estimates, if I am sufficiently recovered from the cold from which I am now suffering, I shall be able to say something more upon the finances of the Commonwealth. It is a subject that deserves all the consideration honourable members can give to it. If Australia is to be put on a sound basis steps must be taken to prevent the wholesale borrowing of money at high rates of interest. If I had my way, there would be only one borrowing authority in this country, because if a State goes on the We must discontinue the money market, and gets into disfavour, the effect on the whole of the Commonwealth is extremely serious. The expense of our last loan flotation of £5,000,000 in London was enormous. After being issued at £96 to the underwriters, a discount of 7s. 6d. had to ibe paid on £2,000,000. Transactions such as this affect our financial stability, and teach us that we ought not to be obliged to go to any private office in London, but should issue our loans through our Oommonwealth Bank agency in London. Under the present system, the people of England, outside a charmed circle in the private office from which our loans are issued, know nothing of an issue for four or five days. In the meantime, the underwriters take up the loan at £96, and issue the stock to the public at £98, thus making £2 per £100 profit. Can which some people "" get rich quick"" ? I am sure that if the public of Great Britain had had the opportunity they would have subscribed to our loan at par. It was a gilt-edged security, upon which there ought not to have been need to pay a high rate of interest. This may not be the proper time to speak on these matters; but to me the proper time is when the opportunity offers. I have waited a long time for my chance to speak upon the deplorable inadequacy of our present system of borrowing. I was grieved to Well, the think that our last diggers' loan was issued at £96 instead of par. Patriotism? God knows it is merely pocket! Before the issue I sought an opportunity to bring the matter under the notice of honourable members, but could not get it, though I sat here for hours watching for it. I knew that the people of Australia would have applied for the stock at par, instead of at £96. I was sure that the true Australian spirit previously displayed would not fail again; and I was never more surprised in my life than when I .heard the ex-Treasurer ( Sir Joseph Cook) state the terms he proposed to offer. Those insurance and public companies who subscribed to that loan at £96 will have a splendid asset to show in their balance-sheets next year, and one which has cost them nothing. I do not suppose that they will pay income tax on that £4 per £100 presented to them by the Commonwealth Treasury. I have tried to rivet the attention of honourable members upon matters I regard as of supreme importance in the interests of Australia, and I do not think that.my words will have been wasted. Some honourable members, at least, realize the position. Some one must do the work for the people, and I am prepared to take my share of it . The people expect the public men to give them a lead in such matters, and to tell them if the Government are following the wrong road in the matter of the issue of loans. They look to their public men to do what the public men in the land of my birth, Great Britain, are doing. The statesmen of Great Britain do not stoop to do what our politicians are doing. They are struggling hard to bring their country back to its former position, and are imposing taxation on themselves so that there may be no repudiation, and so that interest will not be flowing into certain people's pockets. 'For this they earn the applause of the citizens of their land; yet in Australia we, with better opportunities and with the best of seasons, must borrow money to put up a £4 weatherboard shed in Papua, or a £63 weatherboard shed somewhere else. not stand the light of day. We are asked to borrow money to build a little post office which may be obsolete within twenty years. Loan expenditure should be confined to great national works, such as railways, which will earn interest. If we were to expect our Postal Department to earn interest on capital expenditure, we should never develop the service. There might be a possibility of it with five times not, we must realize the importance of a our present population, but there is no chance of it when there is still so much developmental work ahead. This is the first occasion on which we have had proposals for borrowing money for expenditure on postal requirements. Sir Joseph Co' k told us in his Budget speech that these postal buildings and these sheds, costing £63, or £4, should be built out of loan funds. Of course, we know why he has transferred expenditure from revenue account to loan account. He has done it in order to avoid having an inflated Budget. A blackfellow in Mr West. Papua could do the same. The people of Australia look to its statesmen to give them something better than this; they expect them to look a little ahead, and not merely act as politicians. Honourable members opposite when they appeal to the electors wish to be able to tell them what great fellows they are. They wish to be able to say that they have built post-ofiices without imposing fresh taxation. It may be considered fine to gull the public in that way, but in my view that method of dealing with the finances of the country is as full of deception as an egg is full of meat. I do not know whether honourable members are anxious to get through the business of the House before Christmas, but at all events I have given them something to meditate on during the coming recess, if they have the interests of Australia at heart. The position of a member of the House of Representatives is the highest in the gift of the people. It is one which every member of the House should be proud of, and we should be prepared to make sacrifices in the interests of the people, who have conferred this honour upon us. That is what is expected of us. Parliament must solve the problems that are ahead. It is only Parliament that can solve them, because we have a better knowledge of affairs than can be possessed by the people outside. A man who Matters like this will has been a member of this House for a few years gains experience and knowledge if he attends to his business as he ought to do, and the knowledge he acquires should be used for the benefit of the people. I do not think that I have failed in this respect. I have constantly sought advice, and I learn something every day. I have learned that the time has arrived when, whether we like it or proper understanding of the financial position of the country. It is no pleasure to me to have to direct the attention of honourable members to these things, but I feel that I should not be doing my duty if I did not bring them under their notice. I do not know how best to move in this matter at the present time. If I or members of the party to which I belong offer opposition to this Bill the result may be to delay the prosecution of public works which are necessary. A t the same time. I think it is wicked to deceive the people by telling them that the Government have brought forward a great Budget, when at the same time they float loans at 96 and at 6 per cent, interest. members that in 1923 about £35,000,000 of loan money must be redeemed. Most of that money was borrowed at an average rate of interest of not more than 3£ per cent., and we shall be unable in 1923 to borrow money to redeem those loans at less than 6-J per cent. 1 made a short calculation a few months ago, fro m which I discovered that the increased cost from interest would represent the taxation of every man, woman, ""and child in Australia to the extent of 5s. per head. people of Australia will have to bear to meet the difference between the rate of interest at which some of our loans have been borrowed. and that which we w ill 0 have to pay for money to redeem those loans. thinks that the rate of interest w ill be kept up to 6 per cent, or 7 per cent, u n t i l 1923? will be possible to float loans at par in 1923 for less than 6£ per oent. should be evident if we look at what is taking place on the other side.. of the world. The only possible relief in this respect may arise from the fact that the American people have to-day about two-thirds of the actual gold in the world. Some of the southern countries of the American Continent are dealing in gold to-day. because gold w ill be of no use to the Americans, as they w ill be unable to trade with it . That is the only hope I see for a lower rate of interest in 1923. concerned, if we desire to do what is essential for her welfare we shall not go upon the London market, for money for another twelve months. I am satisfied that if the Government cabled to England to-day on the subject, the reply they would receive would be, "" D o not worry us at present for fresh loans, or u n t il we are able to put our own financial affairs on a sounder basis."" I should like to have said something further on this matter, but I shall probably have another opportunity to refer to the subject before Christmas."" I shall be pre[521] pared to give the House any knowledge I have or can obtain on the subject in an endeavour to restore the finances of AusLet. me inform honourable tralia to a normal condition. Unless we do so we cannot hope to do away with unemployment and discontent. Nothing will so certainly remove discontent as the finding of employment for the people of Australia. There is, undoubtedly, a good deal of horse sense in the remarks of the last speaker, concerning the very large increase of borrowing in Australia. I realize the difficulty of making satisfactory That is the burden which the arrangements between the Commonwealth and the States with regard to borrowing, but, undoubtedly, borrowing by the Commonwealth and by the States during the last few years has been alarming. When we consider the enormous debt of over £8.00,000,000 which has been incurred by the small population of Australia, and that a large proportion of the money has been spent on works which cannot be said to be reproductive; when we realize the large increase of taxation, necessary to meet our annual interest bill, and. reThat member that between this and 1927 £150,000,000, borrowed by the States, and £200,000,000, borrowed by the Commonwealth, must be redeemed, and that in respect of almost every loan that has been borrowed, an increased rate of in terest w ill have to be paid for its redemption, it should make us very careful in deed, when dealing with a Loan ApproWe may get cheaper loans priation B ill , to see that the money appropriated shall be only for works that w ill be reproductive. This is not a time at which to advocate the cessation of all borrowing, because there is a good deal Sof a r as GreatB r it a in is of unemployment in the country, and money must be provided for the carrying out of public works that are essential, and which can be shown to be of value in increasing the productive capacity of the country. I should ha sorry to say, at this juncture, that I am adverse to all borrowing by Australia, but one cannot help realizing that we are faced with a very grave danger as a result of the abnormal borrowing of the past few years. We must pay a very heavy bill for it in the near future. I do not wish to appear as a pessimist, but I cannot, overlook the difficulties which now confront",57,Second Reading

I realize that, in consequence, during the next year we shall find it a very difficult task to finance the Commonwealth and States of Australia. There are honourable members who say that we must increase taxation. We must be very caref u l about doing so, because every penny taken from the people in. the way of taxation must l i m it their opportunities for the production of wealth. row, dr tax. * honourable member w ill agree that there must be some l i m it to borrowing by the people of Australia.' He must recognise that, if he considers the enormous sums borrowed and expended during the war period. While realizing that it is essential that money must be borrowed, honourable members should assure themselves that the expenditure, whether from revenue or from borrowed money, is upon' works which w ill be valuable to the people of Australia. I hope that the Government will not endeavour to p u t the whole of the schedule through to-night. Much more information than has been made available should be furnished. There is one particular item having to do with the redemption of ' Treasury-bills raised out of Trust Fundsf o r works, amounting to £3,000,000, which is provided for in this loan authorization. I can quite understand the Treasury-probably not having loan funds availableborrowing money from Trust Fundsi n order to carry out certain authorized works; but this is a B ill , not for loan authorization, b u t for loan appropriation ; and here is an item of £3,000,000 which has been expended. I want to know what the sum. has been spent upon. It appears to me that the money has been devoted to paying for works in regard to which Parliament has had no say. money spent upon works which were authorized last year-work s which have been carried out and have been paid for by the Treasury-bills which are about to be redeemed. The whole amount has to do with public works. that information. I note, further, that there is a very large amount placed to ' the credit of the Postmaster-General's Department. The sum is to be spent upon works into whioh the Public Works Committee has inquired, and in respect of which it has made certain recommendations. That is all very well; but, surely, it is right that when Parliament is voting sums of money, even upon such matters as the construction of automatic telephone exchanges, the whole of the particulars should be made available. The automatic telephone exchanges which have been authorized in the various cities will cost an enormous sum of money, b u t only a comparatively few thousand pounds are set down here. The sum represents merely the cost of the buildings in which the* automatic exchanges will be accommodated. The actual apparatus will involve, in each instance, from £60,000 to as much as £90,000.

The honourable member is not raising a point of order, but is making a personal explanation. it to be made clear that I have not mentioned the subject of building small post offices, and I am certainly making no attempt to withhold money from being spent in that direction. My references are to theTcost of automatic telephone exchanges; and I have pointed oub that, in the sum set down in the schedule under the Postmaster-General's Department, the amount is by no means large enough to cover the expense of installation.

Isi t right to authorize the expenditure of £1,500,000 by a Department which is not asked to indicate how that money is to be spent?

Por that reason the measure should not be disposed of to-night. Apparently, however, it is desired to have some .of the items disposed of with the aid of a "" thin "" Hotise. Sir [9.58] I draw attention to an improper departure which has been made in respect of the appropriations sought to be included in the schedulea departure which is unjustified, and which occurs in connection with one item only. The practice is that, where votes have been passed, the moneys for which are payable out of revenue, the balance unpaid on the 30th June each year lapses. When sums have been appropriated out of loan, the procedure is thab the unexpended portion of the appropriation is taken from the total Bill last introduced simply appropriates rally followed in respect of fourteen items appearing in the schedule under consideration; but it has been departed from in regard to one item only. When examining the Estimates, honourable members were led to believe that £200,000 was jsought to be spent this year on Canberra. As a matter of fact, what is desired to be appropriated by this B ill , and spent this current year, is a sum of £272,000. Honourable members should be made aware of this. This is the only instance in the B ill in which the previous practice, 'and the usual practice, has been departed from. TheB i ll contains a schedule, and in that schedule there are three columns. The first column provides the amount required for 1921-22. The amount which appears in the first column is in every case that which appears in the Estimates. The second column provides, "" Already available under appropriations made by previous Acts,"" and in that column appears the balances unexpended in regard to loan appropriations on the 30th June. In the t h i r d column there is sought to be appropriated the balance of the gross amount after deducting the unexpended appropriations of last year. That practice has been followed in fourteen cases in the B ill ; but as f a r as Canberra is concerned the practice is totally different. Therefore, we find ""Federal Capital at Canberra-to wards cost of establishment, £272,476."" That is the amount required, according to the first column, for the year 1921-22. This is grossly misleading to the House. In the Estimates all that was sought to be spent for tihe year was £200,000. In the Appropriation B ill it is not put down as £200,000, but £272,476. That is to say, last has been, in this solitary case, added to the £200,000. In all the other fourteen items in the schedule now before us, those amounts have been deducted.

The amount to be appropriated for passage money of assisted immigrants is £162,000. the position may be put shortly. Under the joint immigration scheme agreed upon between the Commonwealth and States, it was arranged that the Commonwealth should be responsible for the recruiting of immigrants abroad, and for .their transport to Australia. An agreement was entered into with the shipping companies by which the immigrants may travel from the United Kingdom to Australia at a minimum fare of £ 3 8 , of which £ 12 is contributed by the Commonwealth, leaving only £ 26 to be paid by the immigrant or his nominator. In approved cases, up to £ 1 6 of this £ 2 6 may be advanced by way of loan by the Commonwealth to the immigrant to be repaid by h i m in instalments extending over a period of up to twelve months from the date of his arrival in Australia. Under the British Overseas Settlement scheme, which expires on 31st December, 1921, free passages to the Dominions are granted under certain conditions to ex-service men and their dependants, and every endeavour has been made to utilize to the fullest possible degree the proviI t must sions of this scheme by confining,as f a r as possible, the immigration activities to the end of this year to ex-service men and their dependants. This item may be set out under two headings. The Let the Committee amount provided under the first heading -£126,000-shoul d be sufficient to pay 14,000 assisted passages at £ 1 2 for adults, and, pro rata, for children, and th© amount under' the second £70,000 should provide for 7,000 advances, averaging £ 1 0 each, Less repaymentssay, £34,000-thi s item will be £36,000, and -the total for immigration purposes, £162,000. These figures w ill , of course, be subject to variation according to the proportion of passage money which each immigrant, or his nominator, can pay outright. Advances outstanding at 30th June, 1922, would be recovered and available for further passages in the succeeding financial year. The position, I think, is quite clear. This money is for part payment of passages of immigrants silos and other appliances, to this country at the rate of £ 1 2 per head. Further, we lend, in approved cases, £ 1 6 to the immigrant who repays the loan in instalments within twelve months of his arrival in this country. Instalments on such loans already made are being paid in a steady stream. I m migrants of this class are nominated by In respect of this matter, their friends, or other persons in this country, and I think it will be agreed that they are the best kind of immigrants we can get. As honourable members w i ll see, we test their tas fides by not paying the whole of their passage money. We advance only a proportion, about one-third, but in esfsecially approved cases, up to £ 1 6 , which is repaid in the manner I have described. .1 think the item is one to which the Committee might fairly agree.without .cavil. This covers the whole of the items under the Prime Minister's Department.
