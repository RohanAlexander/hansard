218,Annually In A Population Of 22 Million Benefit Mr Martin Ferguson (Batman,"Thursday, 18 March 2010 ----Mr Arshag Badelian recognise the Armenian genocide that occurred in 1915. In the past month, the Swedish parliament and the United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs have both recognised the genocide. These are very welcome developments. More and more legislatures are voting to recognise this past injustice and it is time that Australia joined in. It is all the more important as we remember that so few witnesses to the genocide remain alive today. The few that do survive deserve justice and deserve to leave this world knowing that this atrocity is no longer being swept under the carpet by nations in the name of diplomacy. In this context, I want to reflect on the life of one of the last survivors in Australia, who recently passed away. Arshag Badelian passed away early this month at the age of 100. Mr Badelian’s story is one that should motivate us all. He was born in the western Armenian district of Kharpert, now in modern-day Turkey. At the age of about six, his family were driven out of their village on the orders of the Ottoman government. Unlike many of his friends, he avoided being drowned in the Euphrates River. He credited his miraculous escape to his mother’s intelligence and tenacity. Mr Badelian’s love for his homeland meant he returned to his home after the genocide and the fall of the Ottoman Empire, only to be evicted, along with all other Armenians, from his village in 1927. He fled to Aleppo in northern Syria-which is in fact where my grandfather was born-and ended up in Beirut in Lebanon before migrating to Australia in 1980. After arriving on our shores, Mr Badelian became one of the most respected members of the Australian-Armenian community. His was a well-known face at Armenian commemorations and events and he supported community organisations like the Armenian Relief Society, through which he sponsored three Armenian orphans. He has left a legacy of knowledge, personal testament and life experience that can never be replaced. I therefore take this opportunity to remember the life of an amazing Armenian-Australian who endured the ordeal of living through the genocide and, motivated by that great sense of community that is so typical of Armenians, dedicated his later years to helping others. My thoughts are with his family in this difficult time. His passing on the eve of the Armenian genocide’s 95th anniversary also gives us cause to reflect on these terrible events and to recommit ourselves to the mission of ensuring that such a travesty is never again inflicted on any people simply because of their race and their culture. Deakin Electorate: Springvale Road the official opening of the new smart bicycle cages at Nunawading station in my electorate of Deakin.

221,Mr Symon (Deakin) (9.33 Am),"Last Friday, 12 March, I had the pleasure of attendingUnlike the empty promises of the previous Liberal government, who made promises but built nothing at Springvale Road, this is a real project that is right here and right now. The boom gates are gone and six lanes of traffic are flowing without the interruption of 218 trains per day going across the road. We have a brand new landmark underground station that is fully staffed from first train to last, and we have new pedestrian access under Springvale Road along with new car parking facilities and landscaping. The old cold and draughty, asbestos ridden station has gone. The centre of Nunawading is now into an exciting phase of renewal. It took Labor governments to build this project, working together to achieve a great outcome not just for the residents of Deakin but for the tens of thousands of people who use the rail line or Springvale Road every day-delivering in full on the promise made in 2007, on time and on budget. Joining me at the opening were Martin Pakula, the Victorian Minister for Public Transport; Tony Robinson, the state member for Mitcham; and representatives from Bicycle Victoria, VicRoads and the Springvale Road Rail Alliance. These new bike cages are accessed by use of a swipe card and are secure, well lit and under video surveillance, with access at the push of a button to the remote control centre for users who have difficulty with the system. Only a deposit is needed to access the system. I am sure that many more people will use their bike to get to Nunawading station if they know that it will still be there when they return from their journey. At the opening I also spoke to Michael Hassett and others from Whitehorse Cyclists about this project and about their proposal for the Box Hill to Ringwood rail trail. This proposal involves using new and existing pathways and roads in and alongside the rail reservation, providing for a safe and relatively level connection between these central activity districts in the eastern suburbs-Box Hill and Ringwood. Using 910 metres of existing shared use paths, 4.6 kilometres of new shared paths, 3.2 kilometres of road paths, 700 metres of upgraded and widened existing paths along with two new overpasses the initial proposal is costed at around $7 million. As the traffic volume in Melbourne steadily increases and traffic congestion builds every year, I believe that encouraging bicycle transport is vital. I look forward to receiving a detailed proposal from Whitehorse Cyclists in the next few weeks as to how this project could be undertaken with support from the City of Whitehorse and the state and federal governments. Gippsland Electorate: Building the Education Revolution Program Building the Education Revolution program and Primary Schools for the 21st Century. I note from the outset that the costs have blown out for this program by more than $1 billion. My key concern relates to the issue of value for money and the lack of strategic direction in the program. Anyone can dream up a good idea and come up with a policy initiative, but the challenge is delivery on the ground. That is when the reputation of a minister is either made or lost. I can tell you now that the Minister for Education’s reputation lies in tatters around every school construction site in regional Victoria. I raised this issue with the minister in May last year in relation to opportunities to make sure that schools get the fundamental issue of value for money covered off in any program to dole out funding for construction projects. I argued at that time that the schools should have the opportunity to receive funding directly to ensure that they could drive value for money MAIN COMMITTEE",124,Constituency Statements
222,Mr Chester (Gippsland) (9.36 Am),"I rise to raise my concerns about the so-calledand drive local employment opportunities in their own communities. Schools from right across Gippsland contacted me at that time and told me they would prefer to hire local contractors to undertake the work in their area and create local jobs in their local communities, particularly providing local jobs for apprentices in our region. The schools needed the flexibility also to get what they actually need rather than what they were told to receive by the state government, which is in charge of managing the program. The principals who contacted me directly believed they could do a better job and secure a better price if they had that direct access to the grant money rather than following these strict government guidelines and seeing their funding absorbed by bureaucratic costs at head office. I invite the schools in my electorate now to write to me-anonymously if they need to, because they are not allowed to speak out on anything against the state or federal governmentto raise any concerns and any rip-offs they have seen in their own community from the state government creaming money off the top or from building firms inflating their prices. I note the concerns being raised by the members opposite, and I just say for the record: this is all about value for money; this has got nothing to do with the original decision. I actually supported a smaller package at that time and argued that it was in the best interests of our community to make sure it was strategically delivered to schools who needed it most. But value for money has completely gone out the window while this government has been shovelling money out the front door. The education minister has a basic character flaw in that she can never be wrong-she can never accept that other people may have advice to offer to her which is constructive and can work in favour of Australian taxpayers. The education minister is a bit like Imelda Marcos in the shoe shop: she is out there just keeping on spending-and let the peasants pay for it! Australian taxpayers are tired of being treated like peasants. They are demanding value for money and demanding that the minister intervenes to stop the rip-offs under this program. I cannot name a single numeracy and literacy benefit to come from the $16.2 billion program. This has all been about shovelling money out the door in a panicked attempt by the government to buy its way out of trouble when it thought the global financial situation was out of control. There is no strategic direction in the program and there is no commitment to the fundamental responsibility of value for money.

A few people in the area no doubt enjoy the spectacle of the Grand Prix; thousands of others will have their weekends ruined by the 180decibel drone coming from what for many years had been a tranquil area. For more than a decade my constituents, particularly those in Albert Park, South Melbourne and West St Kilda, and commuters from surrounding suburbs have been restricted and denied access to the recreational facilities in the middle of my electorate by the Grand Prix. Several weeks ago Linfox proposed construction of a purpose-built racetrack at Avalon Airport. I think this proposal deserves more consideration. Numbers attending the Grand Prix have drastically declined over the last number of years. More than 400,000 people attended the first one; it is down to 105,000 now.

223,Mr Danby (Melbourne Ports) (9.39 Am),"Albert Park, in my electorate, is one of theis causing the state of Victoria unforeseen losses climbing to over $250 million. This includes licence fees paid every year to Formula One boss, Bernie Ecclestone, that perhaps top $50 million. In the first year the Grand Prix lost $2.7 million. It will lose 20 times that amount this year. As Alan Howe said on 28 February: It’s not just locals who have turned off; the international television audience has plummeted by more than 83 per cent since 2000, and these are viewers unaffected by Melbourne’s fickle weather … That’s why the Australian Grand Prix organisers struggled to get a naming rights sponsor until last week … Qantas has signed up but, tellingly, only for a single year. It is time the Grand Prix found a new home, and that home is Avalon. I believe the vast majority of my constituents will agree with that. I wish the Grand Prix no ill, but it is better off out of the inner city, away from the recreational areas and disrupting public transport in Melbourne for weeks and weeks. I am sure the state government will bring to mind the rational economic reasons for moving it when it decides, eventually, not to renew the contract of this organisation the Ecclestone Grand Prix. Swan Electorate: Swan and Canning Rivers in my electorate of Swan. I have on many occasions in the past spoken in this place about the high concentration of nutrients in the Swan and Canning river system. Mr Sidebottom interjectingested in the environment. A significant proportion of the Swan River’s nutrient load comes from the upper reaches of the Swan in Perth’s food-producing wheat belt region. However, nutrients also enter the river from the lower reaches of the Swan in the Perth metropolitan area, including from my electorate of Swan. Members may recall that last year I spoke about the debate in my community about the relationship between the racecourse industry and the river. I spoke about the need to hold a local community forum involving all stakeholders to discuss these matters in some further detail and allow us to move forward as a community to protect our environment and our valuable racing industry. Eventually I managed to get the stakeholders around the table in my office to discuss this issue at the beginning of March. Community representatives and stakeholders from the Swan River Trust, the racecourse industry, two local council representatives and local environment groups were invited to attend, and I am pleased that many did. There was a productive discussion about the relationship between the racecourse industry and the river system, and the community stakeholders briefed the group on the challenges that needed working on and the progress that is being made. Discussion then moved to the other sources of nutrient flux into the Swan-Canning river system. After some discussion stakeholders noted the most preventable cause in the local area was nutrient seepage from properties and industrial areas unconnected to the local sewerage network. The mayors of the City of Belmont and the Town of Victoria Park both noted that this was an issue in their local council area. According to the City of Belmont, the suburb of Kewdale, and the industrial area in particular, is affected by this problem. The Town of Victoria Park have also indicated that the industrial land and a small piece of land at the end of Goodwood Parade, which has the potential to be developed into a high-density residential property area, needs to be connected to the infill sewerage.

225,Mr Irons,"I hear the member for Braddon supporting my call and I know he is intermade a priority area under an expanded infill sewerage program and I will certainly support those calls. Other issues discussed at the forum included the state government’s Fertiliser Action Plan, the impact of the Belmont Park foreshore development, the Town of Victoria Park’s recent survey of its drainage system and the Burswood Casino levy. All attendees agreed that the Rudd government’s funding cuts to the Perth NRM and the withdrawal of federal funding to a vital river-monitoring program were unhelpful and made it harder to look after and care for the river. Members also noted that one of the most significant problems affecting the Swan River was the deterioration of the river wall infrastructure. I again urge this government to fund the project submitted to Infrastructure Australia by local councils back in 2008. This project has merit, and I am disappointed that the federal government continue to ignore it. It should not be too difficult to find $85 million when they have spent $2.7 billion on a failed and dodgy pink batts program. In conclusion, this was a productive meeting that highlighted some key issues for the Swan River in my electorate. Hindmarsh Electorate: Pooch Park today to speak about an issue of importance and concern in my local community regarding the safety of pedestrians and the safety of families and their pet dogs around Pooch Park. Pooch Park is a joint project by the City of West Torrens and the City of Charles Sturt councils in my electorate. It is a great concept where owners can take their pet dogs along to this park and let them off the leash so that the dogs can get exercise and feel free to run around. It represents an absolutely outstanding achievement for the local community, who have embraced this particular space with gusto. The park has off-leash running space for dogs and is fully equipped with a double gate entrance, agility equipment, benches, tables, gazebos for shade, water fountains for both people and dogs, and doggie bag dispensers and waste bins. The park has become increasingly popular with dog owners not only from my electorate but from all over the city, who use the facility to allow their dogs time to socialise, play and exercise. If you go down there on a Saturday or Sunday morning, it is absolutely jam-packed with cars et cetera. I am a dog owner myself, and my wife Wendy and I regularly take our Maltese-cross terriers, Coco and Bella, down to Pooch Park. I was alarmed to hear recently about an accident on the road adjacent to Pooch Park in which a dog was run over and killed while crossing the road with all the mayhem of parking and congested traffic there on the weekends. Fortunately, neither the driver of the car nor any other person was injured. One of my constituents, Wayne Brown, of Fulham Gardens, regularly attends the park with his two dogs. On this particular day he witnessed this accident and as a result felt compelled to contact me to see if anything could be done to reduce the risk of future incidents. Because of the popularity of the park, there has been a significant increase in the amount of foot traffic and car traffic in the area, with no extra precautions to warn motorists that there are walkers, dogs and children to look out for. This tragic accident highlights the need for better signage and awareness of the increased pedestrian traffic to the area so that motorists are adequately warned that circumstances have changed and they need to be more careful when driving through the area. At the time, I wrote to the South Australian transport minister, Patrick Conlon, and the mayors of both the cities of West Torrens and Charles Sturt, requesting action be taken to reMAIN COMMITTEE",127,Constituency Statements
226,Mr Georganas (Hindmarsh) (9.45 Am),"I am very pleased to have the opportunityduce the risk of further accidents. I am pleased to say that the South Australian Department for Transport, Energy and Infrastructure recently confirmed as a result of our requests the upgrade of signage in the area to the latest standard by the end of March 2010. This achievement may seem trivial in the context of billions of dollars announced, but it is the local issues that matter to my constituents, and I stand here today to represent them. I congratulate my constituent Wayne Brown for speaking out to protect his community and the City of Charles Sturt Council, the City of West Torrens Council, the South Australian state government and Minister Patrick Conlon for responding in a timely and effective manner. (Time expired) Barker Electorate: Digital Television bone of contention with many of my constituents in Barker but particularly those in Mount Gambier and also the Barossa and, more specifically, Angaston. The government plans to introduce some legislation into the House today regarding digital television which is a massive turnaround from what it had proposed initially. I note the member for Braddon would be well aware that, if his residents, like mine, were missing out on their TV services, they certainly would not be very happy chappies. The Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy had recently dismissed legitimate concerns of regional residents and the government seemed to have a very careless attitude towards improving their services. I called on the minister numerous times to give regional Australia a better deal, and this legislation is certainly a step in the right direction. I think it is important that you give credit where credit is due. I hear all the time from my constituents in Mount Gambier that they have a bit of a raw deal down there, and quite rightly as they currently receive only two channels, whereas most of the rest of Australia receive three or more commercial stations. The government has proposed that the broadcasters will have to roll out this full suite of channels or the residents will go to satellite. This is a pretty big stick against the broadcasters that I have to say I am not entirely comfortable with, but if it achieves what we want then we will have to consider that. The proviso is that the channels will only be in standard definition to start off with. I hope very much that the changeover to high definition happens quite soon after, but I do have concerns about how long it will take. The minister’s office has suggested that it will be only a matter of months, and I will certainly keep the minister to that. The infrastructure involved in this sort of upgrade will be quite costly, and I will be keen to know some definite time lines, which I hope the minister will be providing. For Mount Gambier residents this is a good thing. For areas such as Angaston and the Barossa, where I also get a lot of complaints about reception, it is not such good news at this stage. The signal there is touch and go and, where analog would perhaps be fuzzy, digital will drop out altogether. In these areas, residents will have to apply for satellite services. Again, from the minister’s office I understand that they will be given the benefit of the doubt, but I have concerns here also that the residents will not in fact come out in front. I am keen that the government take the concerns of rural and regional Australia seriously and take measures to rectify what was a very dim future for digital services in these areas to ensure residents are provided with a service of the same standard as that of their city counterparts. MAIN COMMITTEE",128,Constituency Statements
227,Mr Secker (Barker) (9.48 Am),"I want to speak today on something that has been aYouth Allowance opposite there was good news yesterday in the House that the youth allowance and student support system will now go through. I know that thousands of extra families throughout Australia will benefit from this, particularly in rural and regional Australia. I reiterate for the record that all students who receive youth allowance will receive a $2,128 start-up scholarship every year, indexed for inflation, beginning at $1,300 in 2010. Students who live in very remote, remote and outer regional areas who have to move away from home to study and whose parents earn less than $150,000 a year will be eligible for the existing independence test criteria. The parental income test will be raised so that families with two children studying away from home can earn more than $140,000 before their allowance completely cuts out. Students who choose to move to study may be eligible for an additional relocation scholarship worth $4,000 in the first year of study and $1,000 in each subsequent year. From1 July 2012, students will be able to earn $400 a fortnight, up from $236, without having their payments reduced. Finally, the age of independence will be reduced progressively from 25 years to 22 years by 2012, which will see an estimated 7,600 new recipients of the independent rate of allowance. This is very good news, in particular for my region, with so many more families being eligible for youth allowance and the independence allowance. However, I am disappointed, along with other members in this House, that two places in my electorate, Devonport and Latrobe, are not eligible for the independence allowance because of the agreement struck with those opposite on the AGSC criteria. my side and others will be, to see how this anomaly can be overcome. WhatI do not think we ought to lose sight of in all this is that this system will benefit so many students whom the other mob were quite happy to deprive of the opportunity to go to university and have financial support. When it really comes down to it, those on the other side are all talk, plenty of obstruction and no action. I will be working with my communities to get those two centres under the eligibility rules and to look at a different matrix than the one agreed to by those opposite, which has now put us in a relative straitjacket.

In doing so, I join my colleague Senator David Johnston, shadow minister for defence, in saying absolutely and unequivocally that those Australian Defence Force men and women involved in the SIEV36 incident should be hailed as heroes. I was personally disappointed with the responses of some commentators who insinuated that ADF personnel somehow acted inappropriately by not first rescuing Afghans from the water following the explosion. I personally conveyed those very sentiments to the Chief of Navy, Vice Admiral Russ Crane, after the incident and to this day I remain disappointed with the unfair treatment those ADF personnel had to endure at the hands of sensationalist commentators and pundits.

The Northern Territory coroner’s report on the SIEV36 incident was released yesterday. While the report identified some issues with regard to the manner in which the vessel was searched, which I understand have now been remedied by Defence, Coroner Greg Cavanagh categorically supported the conduct of the ADF personnel. In the report, Coroner Cavanagh said: There were many heroic acts that morning in the process of saving the passengers and crew of SIEV36 and also in their treatment thereafter. He also said: The fact that the ADF members were recovered and then assisted in the timely rescue and treatment of passengers probably saved many lives. He went on to say: … I have concluded that action taken by navy personnel was appropriate and more passengers might have died but for the action they took. The actions of those ADF personnel involved on that day were those of dedicated, brave and compassionate individuals. They acted with the highest level of integrity and professionalism in what was a very difficult and dangerous set of circumstances. They are the ones charged with the responsibility of dealing with the predictable repercussions of the Rudd Labor government’s failed border protection policy-a policy that will continue to unnecessarily put people’s lives in danger and a policy that will eventually see illegal immigrants processed in Australia. It is a policy that will see refugee visas granted to those very persons responsible for this tragedy. Our ADF personnel not only followed standard practices which have been proven to save lives; they acted with bravery and compassion for their fellow human beings. They should be praised for their actions on that day, not criticised. Workplace Bullying Services and Parliamentary Secretary for Victorian Bushfire Reconstruction) (9.57 am)-I rise to speak on the issue of workplace bullying. We would not think it was acceptable for people to come to work and be exposed to asbestos or toxic chemicals. We should not think, therefore, that it is appropriate for them to be exposed to the toxic behaviour that is sustained and malicious bullying. I believe that this kind of bullying is something which can be eradicated. We have changed attitudes on smoking in the workplace and on sexual harassment; there is no reason why we cannot eliminate forever bullying in the workplace. Bullying is an absence of kindness and empathy toward one’s fellow human beings. We cannot eradicate the monster of unkindness which lives within some people or make it illegal, but we can remove it from the artificial environment which is the workplace. Bullying does not happen in a vacuum. It flows from the general culture of a workplace. If respect and dignity are absent from a workplace then bullying and cruelty are given a chance to thrive. We also need to encourage people to report bullying, and there are those who need to be listened to.

232,Mr Shorten (Maribyrnong,"Parliamentary Secretary for Disabilities and Children’sone wants to admit that their organisation may have a problem. Too often when cases of bullying are eventually exposed we wonder why we did not spot the signs earlier and why nothing was done to intervene. Tragically, the issue has come to public attention in recent months through the heavy fines laid against four men over the death of Brodie Panlock, a 19-year-old Victorian girl who committed suicide after what a magistrate described as ‘persistent and vicious bullying’ at a cafe in Hawthorn where she worked. The details of the bullying were horrendous. They included physical assault, intimidation and a level of relentless emotional degradation that was enough to make a wonderfully happy and stable person from a loving family believe that suicide was her only option. The men were charged by WorkSafe Victoria for failing to take reasonable care for the health and safety of persons, and were fined $335,000 by the courts. I think that the unprecedented level of the fines and-even more importantly-the public outrage over the men’s behaviour shows that there is a new lack of tolerance for any such kind of conduct. Safe Work Australia records that over 4,000 complaints of workplace bullying or harassment were reported to state authorities over the last three years. Sadly, 50 of these cases resulted in suicide or attempted suicide. And these cases are only the ones that are reported to the authorities. For adults in positions of responsibility and authority to bully their fellow workers is absolutely unacceptable. Work makes up a big part of our lives and is a big part of how we define ourselves. To feel unsafe, humiliated or worthless at work damages a person’s life, and the effects last long after the person has left the workplace.

The February 2010 hearing with the Reserve Bank was set against an optimistic forecast for growth and stability. It is notable that Australia was one of the very few advanced economies not to fall into recession. Through 2009 gross domestic product grew by about two per cent, and in 2010 GDP is expected to reach about three per cent. Unemployment is trending down and hours worked are increasing. The strength of the upturn in the Asia-Pacific is quite strong, which is helping Australia to achieve higher growth prospects. In the large industrial countries, however, growth has been more tentative. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, the OECD, examined the impact of the global recession on growth prospects for member countries.

235,Mr Craig Thomson,"The Australian economy has performed exceptionally well andamongst the lowest in the OECD. Both fiscal stimulus and monetary stimulus have meant Australia has averted the permanent skills and capital distraction that generally accompanies deep downturns and have meant less permanent damage to our economy. When the government announced its Nation Building Economic Stimulus Plan in February of last year, our economy had contracted in the December quarter of 2008 and was on the brink of recession, and we were facing the bleak prospect of a million Australians out of work. As a government we were determined to do whatever we responsibly could do to protect our economy, to protect jobs and to protect small business. One year on, a combination of economic stimulus and the resilience and hard work of Australian families and businesses has meant we have avoided recession and saved the jobs of tens of thousands of breadwinners. Together we have achieved stronger growth than any other advanced economy. We have created 112,000 jobs over the past year and have so far kept unemployment to under six per cent. Australia’s strong economic performance was highlighted by global ratings agency Standard and Poor’s earlier this month in the Asia-Pacific Sovereign Report Card, which noted: Australia has been the best performing developed economy in the world in recent years … There are encouraging signs of Australia’s continued recovery and more evidence of how well our economy has performed in the face of strong headwinds from the global economy. The recent retail trade figures show that the value of retail trade grew by 2.1 per cent through 2009, notwithstanding a 0.7 per cent fall in December. The volume of retail trade rose by a strong 1.1 per cent in the December quarter to be 3.4 per cent higher through 2009. This demonstrates the role stimulus has played in giving consumers the confidence to keep spending. Building approval figures were also encouraging. These showed that total residential building approvals were up 2.2 per cent in December, increasing by 53.3 per cent over 2009. This was the strongest annual growth in almost eight years. Last month the Access Economics Investor Monitor showed that investment in our economy was helped by the government’s infrastructure stimulus. Compared with a year ago, there has been a very big increase in the value of defined projects that are now going ahead. Our nation-building investments in schools, roads, rail and ports are a big part of the reason for that improvement. Access Economics said: … significant government investment also played a very strong helping hand, most notably the Federal Government’s schools upgrade program … economic infrastructure projects are a substantial part of the investment agenda, led by Federal and State Government spending. As a result of Australia’s positive growth prospects, the Reserve Bank of Australia began lifting the policy cash rate from its emergency lows of three per cent. The cash rate was raised three times in succession between October and December 2009. In March 2010, the cash rate was lifted another 25 basis points, taking the new cash rate to four per cent. It is worth noting that this is still some 300 basis points lower than when we came to government. During the hearing, the committee examined the RBA on the key forecasts for the economy, focusing on inflation and growth and their influence over the policy cash rate during the next 12 months. The committee examined some of the possible constraints to growth and possible impacts which could lead to inflationary pressures. In addition, the committee examined issues affecting bank funding. MAIN COMMITTEE The committee also dealt with the public claim by Senator Joyce that Australia might be at risk of defaulting on its sovereign debt. The committee is of the view that a claim like this is irresponsible and has the potential to undermine the economy. The governor advised: There has never been an event of sovereign default by Australia as far as I know, and I very much doubt there ever will be. Economists also called Senator Joyce’s comments irresponsible, especially at a time when financial markets were jittery and overseas investors might have taken his comments seriously. A key ratings agency, Standard and Poor’s, reacted to the statement about sovereign debt and said that it rated the debt of the Australian government at AAA, with a stable outlook. It said that AAA is the highest rating and indicated the agency’s opinion that the government has an extremely strong ability to meet all of its debt obligations. Standard and Poor’s added that the AAA rating was indicative of the extremely strong ability to meet financial obligations and, therefore, in their opinion, there was very little chance of defaulting on debt. In conclusion, on behalf of the committee I would like to note that this is the 50th anniversary of the Reserve Bank of Australia. On 14 January 1960, the RBA commenced operations under its first governor, Dr HC ‘Nugget’ Coombs. The committee notes the contribution that the RBA has made to the stability of the Australian economy and looks forward to its continuing contributions in the years ahead. On behalf of the committee, I would also like to thank the Governor of the Reserve Bank, Mr Glenn Stevens, and other representatives of the RBA for appearing at the hearing on 19 February. The next public hearing will be on 27 August 2010, in Canberra. I commend the report to the House. largely high-quality contribution in this place, in thanking the governor and the staff of the Reserve Bank for their cooperation at the hearing. I also acknowledge the work of the committee secretary, Mr Boyd, and his staff in putting this report together. They obviously do a lot of work to get these things ready. I thought we had a very high-quality discussion with the Reserve Bank governor. It is one of the main opportunities that the parliament has to interact with the Reserve Bank governor and ask about issues that are driving his thinking in relation to dealing with monetary policy. I thought the Reserve Bank governor was very frank with the committee. I think he was very honest and open about where he thinks monetary policy is going and the factors playing into that. It was welcomed by our side of politics, but probably not by the others so much, when the Reserve Bank governor quite clearly outlined that there is a link between reckless fiscal spending and higher interest rates. I thought that was a pretty telling moment in the morning’s proceedings. The other aspect that the governor made very clear was his very deep and clear concern that the re-regulation of the workplace in Australia is leading to increased pressures on wageprice increases, leading to bottlenecks in Western Australia through increased strikes, as we have seen. The governor expressed deep concern about that and the impact it will have on our productive performance and, ultimately, on not just interest rates but also the employment levels of Australians. The governor very specifically made that point. I think that is of major concern. It is heartening to see that the putative Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister, indicated through the Australian newspaper yesterday that she is considering winding back MAIN COMMITTEE",132,Committees
236,Mr Briggs (Mayo) (10.07 Am),"I join with the member for Dobell, following hissome of her more draconian union based laws. SoI think those were the major policy aspects impacting on monetary policy in Australia that we got from the hearing. I thought there was some other interesting discussion about the structural issues in and around the bank. We had a discussion with the governor about claims aired through the ABC Lateline Business program last year of pre-leaking of board decisions prior to the board meeting. I thought the governor was very strong in his dismissal of those accusations, and it was a good opportunity for the governor to clear that up. It was an important issue; interest rate movement is very market-sensitive information and claims that that information was being pre-leaked to the market were obviously worrying. They were worrying for this place and obviously also for the governor, because he was very strong in his dismissal of those accusations. We also had a very good discussion about the board structure. There are some who claim, and I have some sympathy for this claim, that we do need to consider this given, as the Reserve Bank governor himself has identified, that there is an increasingly difficult role for the central bank-a more complex role, interacting in global movements. There is some merit in reconsidering the structure of the Reserve Bank board. This is not because it has done a bad job over the years; certainly in recent times it has performed quite well. Part of our role in this place, and an important role of this committee, is looking at the issues that will need to be addressed by the Reserve Bank and by the parliament in the future. It is an appropriate moment, given that the governor in his 50th anniversary speech highlighted the more difficult circumstances in which the bank is operating, to give some consideration to whether there need to be some more market-based professionals, market-based economists, on the board. The governor, while supporting the board, I thought took on board some of those questions and we had a reasonable discussion. I personally would like to see that sort of review or consideration take place, to see whether it is high time to change the structure of the board. Against that there is the developing and important issue of the consideration the governor is giving to changing the way the bank operates in respect of leaning against the wind, where the bank sees a developing problem in an area like the housing market. We had a very good discussion on this. It is a contentious issue and I think it is a very big policy issue. I am very concerned to make sure that, if that decision is made, it is made in conjunction with the government of the day, with the parliament, and there needs to be a full and open debate about whether that is a good policy or not. I am concerned that with a very weak and ineffective Treasurer these decisions might be made without due consideration being given to them in this place. I am concerned to ensure that the governor undertakes any changes to the way he operates in setting monetary policy in conjunction with the parliament and the Treasurer of the day. There should be a full and open debate about this issue, if in fact we decide to go down this path. It would be a massive change to the way the bank operates and it would have a very real-world effect on people’s house prices and the interest rates that they pay. It is a developing issue. Yes, it is technical and it is pretty dry and it is not a matter that the Daily Telegraph will splash across its front page-the member for Banks does not need to worry about that too muchworld consequence which we face as members of parliament, and how the bank sets its rates MAIN COMMITTEE",134,Committees

That is my point, and I think the member for Banks and I are probably in agreement on that. If the bank is going to change the way it makes its decisions then we should be part of that process. That is a developing issue. With those short remarks, I acknowledge the work of the chair of the committee, who works very hard on this part of his responsibilities, and also again the secretary and the bank.

If a person or organisation wishes to print or publish electoral advertisements then they must include on the advertisement the name and address of the person authorising the advertisement and the name and place of the printer. The penalty for not complying with these requirements is $1,000 for an individual and $5,000 for a body corporate. On 20 November 2007, then members of the Liberal Party were involved in the distribution of unauthorised election material. The persons involved in the events in the division of Lindsay were in breach of section 328 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act. Mr Gary Clark was fined the maximum amount. Three other persons were found guilty of the crime. Mr Jeff Egan was not convicted, because he claimed he did not know that the electoral pamphlet did not contain the name and address of the person who authorised it and the name of the business of the printer. While the election pamphlet was unauthorised, it was the content matter that caused distress and disgust. The pamphlet sought to turn voters away from the Labor candidate and to incite racial tensions. The then Prime Minister, the Hon. John Howard MP, commented that the action was ‘tasteless and offensive’. All members of the committee agreed that the actions that occurred in Lindsay were appalling and needed to be stamped out with the introduction of more significant penalties. The committee recommended that section 328 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act be redrafted as a strict liability offence and that the maximum penalties be 60 penalty units, or $6,600, for an individual and 300 penalty units, or $33,000, for a body corporate. Strict liability will make it more difficult for people to claim that they did not know that a pamphlet was not authorised. I am hopeful that the government can provide an early response to this report and can draft the relevant amendments and that, with the support of the opposition, the Greens and the Independents in the other place, we can have the amendments to section 328 in place for the next federal election. I think that is important and that it sends the right message to the community in relation to the parliament’s attitude as to how this issue should be responded to. In reviewing the wider penalties of the Commonwealth Electoral Act the committee was advised that the penalties had not been updated since 1983. It should be noted that the committee, in 1989 and, again, in 1996, recommended that the penalty framework in the ComMAIN COMMITTEE",135,Committees

The committee has now recommended that the Special Minister of State, with assistance from the Attorney-General, introduce amending legislation to update the penalty provisions in the Commonwealth Electoral Act. When the amending legislation is introduced to the parliament, the bill should be referred to a committee for inquiry so that proposed changes can be publicly debated. The committee believes that these recommendations will help to strengthen the Commonwealth Electoral Act by increasing penalties to help deter electoral crimes. In the appendices of the report we have copies of the unauthorised pamphlet and copies of the judgment in the Clark and Egan cases. We also have the apologies of Mr Clark and Mr Chijoff, and copies of the bogus pamphlet that was produced in 2004 in Greenway. The report is a factual report and people can go to the report to get the full picture. I think it is not insignificant that the report was a unanimous report by government and non-government members. The dissenting report itself is from Senator Bob Brown, but that relates to truth in advertising. He has used this report as an opportunity to make some comments in relation to tackling the problem of truth in advertising in election campaigns. In conclusion, I want to thank my committee colleagues for their contribution to the report and those organisations and individuals who prepared submissions and appeared as witnesses before the committee. I would also like to thank the committee secretariat for their work in preparing the report and commend the report to the House. Electoral Matters Report on the 2007 federal election-events in the division of Lindsay. In reflecting on the incident in general, I concur with the view of the then Prime Minister, John Howard, at the National Press Club on 22 November 2007. He stated: I condemn what happened. It was an unauthorised document, it does not represent my views, it was tasteless and offensive. There are many, there are myriad legitimate criticisms that can be made of the Australian Labor Party, but I do not believe that the Australian Labor Party has ever had any sympathy for the Bali bombers and I thought it was an outrageous thing to say. That’s my view, I think the party organisation has dealt with it with lightning speed and great effectiveness. In my view, this report on that incident-which was a most unfortunate incident-presents an exhaustive and factual approach to the issue. I am grateful to the chairman, in particular, and other members of the committee for the approach that was taken. As well, it importantly reviews the adequacy of the penalty provisions in the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 in light of the events that occurred on the evening of 20 November 2007 that led to five people being charged with breaching the act. The actions of those individuals were totally unacceptable and reprehensible but I think in no way reflective of the Liberal Party, its members, supporters and candidates at large. Those events did, however, bring into focus the inadequacy of the penalties, as set out in section 328 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918, for breaching the act’s guidelines. The current penalties are $1,000 for an individual and $5,000 for a body corporate for non-compliance. Opposition members and senators agree that these penalties, which have not been updated since 1983, are inadequate and act as an insufficient deterrence. In addition to this, opposition members support recommendation 2 of this report. It states: MAIN COMMITTEE",136,Committees
241,Mr Robb (Goldstein) (10.20 Am),"I rise to speak on the Joint Standing Committee onThe committee recommends that section 328 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 be redrafted as a strict liability offence, and the maximum penalties be 60 penalty units for an individual and 300 penalty units for a body corporate. These increased penalty units currently equate to $6,600 for an individual and $33,000 for a body corporate. We believe these increased penalties and the offence being redrafted as a strict liability offence strike the right balance. As the report states: In the future, party member or non-aligned persons should think very carefully about the ramifications of undertaking the illegal practice of distributing unauthorised election material. These penalties do represent, in my view, a significant deterrence and if properly understood and made known by all parties to people associated with their party will act as a significant deterrence and strike the right balance. In brief, recommendation 1 of the report states: The… amending legislationwith assistance from the Attorney-General, should usethe schedule provided by the Australian Electoral Commission … as a guide.

Opposition members support both these recommendations. Finally, I would like to add my thanks to my committee colleagues and, in particular, the chairman, the member for Banks, for the approach taken. Also, I would like to thank the committee secretariat and those organisations and individuals who prepared submissions and appeared as witnesses before the committee. tee for the work that it has done to try to remedy the situation that led to one of the lowest acts in our democratic history. The events that occurred in the 2007 election in the electorate of Lindsay, where I was the Labor candidate contesting the seat, represented one of the worse examples of a group of individuals seeking to stoop to new lows in trying to use issues of race, ethnicity and religion to divide our community. The one redeeming grace in this whole episode is that the culprits were caught. There will be arguments about the extent to which the individuals that might have been responsible were ultimately prosecuted. I do not wish to engage in any of those. The point remains that had those individuals not been caught red handed as they were then their activities would have gone on without the public scrutiny that has occurred. It was on the basis that those individuals believed that they would be able to do that without getting caught that they engaged in those activities. The recommendations that the committee has brought forward will be significant because of the way in which they have increased the penalties and changed the nature of the offence so MAIN COMMITTEE",137,Committees
242,Mr Bradbury (Lindsay) (10.25 Am),"I wish to add my congratulations to the committhat it is a strict liability offence. Many people would find it very difficult to believe that seasoned campaign professionals, as some of the individuals involved were, could participate in the distribution of materials of this sort and then be exonerated on the basis that they did not understand or know that the material was distributed. These proposals are not just targeted at the seasoned campaign professional; they are targeted at all individuals. The act of distributing material in a political and campaign context is an act that should always attract some degree of caution and obligation on the part of the person who is distributing that material. Clearly these proposals will go some way towards requiring that of individuals. The previous penalties were clearly inadequate-$1,000 for an individual or $5,000 for a body corporate-for someone guilty of being in breach of section 328 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act. These proposals would increase those penalties to a maximum penalty of 60 penalty units or $6,600 for an individual and 300 penalty units or $33,000 for a body corporate. Significantly, as I mentioned earlier, this offence will be one of strict liability. Clearly people in communities should have an expectation, which should be realised and adhered to by those of us involved in political campaigns, that material that is distributed is not of the nature of the material that was distributed in this case. It was material that was factually incorrect, material that was racially and religiously motivated and material that was by its nature deeply divisive and intended to cause and incite division. It is instructive to reflect upon the contents of the pamphlet because so much commentary and discussion has occurred about the pamphlet that we have sometimes moved a little further away from the text than perhaps we should. The pamphlet itself has logos of the Australian Labor Party. It is clearly purporting to be a document distributed by the Australian Labor Party. It is headed, ‘The Islamic-Australia Federation’. I will not quote all of the contents but I will focus on a couple of the elements contained in that leaflet. In the upcoming Federal election we strongly support the ALP as our preferred party to govern this country and urge all other Muslims to do the same. It goes on: The leading role of the ALP in supporting our faith at both State and Local government levels has been exceptional and we look forward to further support when Kevin Rudd leads this country. I think it is worth making the point that I was the Labor candidate at that election and had been a long-serving member of the local council. So, clearly, there was an implication here that, as the Labor candidate and someone who had been involved in local government, I was being drawn in personally to the comment being made. If we go on, the leaflet reads: We gratefully acknowledge Labors support to forgive our Muslim brothers who have been unjustly sentenced to death for the Bali bombings. What a disgraceful suggestion. What a disgraceful comment to make. Anyone who had any basic sense of morality or understanding of the need for tolerance in our community would agree that to tell a bald-faced lie of that nature, which was clearly intended to be very divisive and to reflect poorly upon the Australian Labor Party, was disgraceful. We all know it was untrue. We all know that the Australian Labor Party and members of the party were as dismayed, disgusted and appalled by the events surrounding the Bali bombings as any other Australian. The suggestion here that somehow the Australian Labor Party was forgiving of the MAIN COMMITTEE individuals involved was clearly designed to push certain buttons within the community and create division over this particular issue. The pamphlet goes on to say: Labor supports our new Mosque construction and we hope, with the support and funding by Local and State governments, to open our new Mosque in St Marys soon. Well, there is no existing mosque, there is no new mosque and, as far as I am aware, there is no proposed mosque. Once again, this was a bald-faced lie and an attempt to create division within the community. The pamphlet goes on, but I do not wish to quote any further from it other than to make the point-a point that is beyond contention, and I acknowledge that those on the other side do accept that this is the case-that the comments that were contained within that pamphlet were clearly factually incorrect. AndI think that, as to the motivations of those who penned these comments, we all agree that the comments were intended to incite division and racial and religious disharmony. This has been an exhaustive process and I do commend the committee for their involvement. But I wish to focus in on some of the unanswered questions that I have an interest in having answered and which I think many members of my community also have an interest in getting to the truth on. I wish to raise a matter that I have raised previously in the House. I have raised the matter to try and seek clarification and answers to my questions but, up to this point, those questions have not been answered. By way of background, I refer to an article that appeared in the Sunday Mail on 9 December 2007 written by Glenn Milne. It says: government the election. The article goes on: According to senior Liberal sources, it was Mr Abbott who advised the former Liberal MP for Lindsay, Jackie Kelly, to defend the leaflet as “a Chaser-style stunt”. The article goes on a little later to quote Mr Abbott as saying: “Jackie’s a great matethat is, Jackie Kelly, the former member for Lindsay, is a ‘great mate’of mine and the Warringah Conferencethe article notes that to be ‘ Mr Abbott’s fundraising arm’bankrolled the Lindsay campaign. The questions that I have asked and which still remain unanswered are: who paid for the printing of these pamphlets? Where were these pamphlets printed? Were they printed using either taxpayer funds-which I think would be an outrage-or alternatively funds that were provided by the Leader of the Opposition’s fundraising arm, as this particular article states? As I understand it, the quote that I have just read was attributed to the Leader of the Opposition. I am not aware of any statement that he has made to distance himself from the financing of the Lindsay campaign, but the question remains: were any of the funds that were raised by his fundraising arm used to print this pamphlet? I do not think it is too much to ask the question and expect that someone who is putting themselves forward as the alternative Prime Minister will answer that question. That is the first question. MAIN COMMITTEE One of the other questions that arise from this particular report, as appendix I of the report indicates, is about the bogus pamphlet against the ALP that was distributed in Greenway in the 2004 election. It had some remarkably similar themes in it. In the 2004 election there was a bogus pamphlet distributed-and a copy of this is enclosed as an appendix-where a picture of Ed Husic, who was the Labor candidate for Greenway in the election, appears. The banner sitting underneath the picture says: ‘Ed Husic, Labor candidate for Greenway.’ Then there are some very simple dot points. The pamphlet reads: ‘Ed Husic is a devout Muslim. Ed is working hard to get a better deal for Islam in Greenway.’ We still do not know who printed this pamphlet. In this particular case, the distributors of the pamphlet were not caught red-handed in the early hours of the morning in some sort of almost SWAT-style operation. That is what it took, unfortunately, to uncover the activities in the Lindsay campaign in 2007. So we have this pamphlet. It seems to me that there is a clear pattern here. We might not know who did it, but I think the Australian people have enough circumstantial evidence to draw their own inferences as to what occurred there. As far as I am aware, the current member for Greenway has not sought to dispute whether the local Liberal campaign had any involvement in this particular leaflet. I am certainly not coming into this place to make an accusation of that sort, but I think it would be helpful for the member for Greenway to clarify her position and to rule out any involvement on the part of those individuals that were working on her campaign in this particular episode. All in all, I think that the measures that are being proposed are good ones. I dearly hope that they are able to ensure that in the future these sorts of activities are not undertaken. If, at the end of the day, there are people who are not prepared to allow their own moral compass to stop them from engaging in activities of this sort then it is the role of the state to put in place penalties that might discourage those individuals from engaging in these activities. I hope the way in which the penalties have been increased and the way in which we now have a strict liability test will weigh heavily on the minds of many individuals, whether or not they are supported by a party organisation, if they are ever considering printing and distributing a pamphlet of this nature. It was an outrage. I come to this place having lived to tell the tale but only because the activities of these individuals were uncovered when they were caught redhanded. It is a shameful episode in our nation’s political history and I think anyone who reads the report that has been handed down by the committee could not help but agree with that conclusion. commend the Chair of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, the member for Banks, and the member for Goldstein for the way the committee has conducted this report and for their statements in the House today. I think it reflects incredibly well on the parliament. I think that, if the public saw the work that went into this, they would have a greater appreciation of our parliamentary standards. I really want to commend the committee for the work done on what would, in some respects, have been a fairly difficult report. Congratulations on that. Debate (on motion by Mr Chester) adjourned.

Leave granted. border is only a few kilometres away-in fact, 30-odd minutes away by banana boat-from the Torres Strait and that Australia and Papua New Guinea share a unique treaty arrangement that permits free movement between treaty villages on either side. A number of media reports in the last year or two have intimated that there is an influx of PNG nationals arriving, via the treaty, in the Torres Strait and that infection risks for communicable diseases like TB and HIV-AIDS are very high. The inquiry and a delegation of the health committee sought to examine these issues in detail. We hope that this report goes some way towards highlighting the issues in their complexity, tempering some of the unsubstantiated fears and reaffirming why we permit a relatively small number of sick PNG nationals access to health services in the Torres Strait under specific conditions. We do so for humanitarian and practical reasons, because that is what good neighbours do. The report shows that a range of structures exist and that systems are in place for managing this process from treaty consultation processes through to Queensland Health treatment guidelines. There are costs associated with treating these individuals and, while the numbers treated are small, costs for serious conditions like MDR-TB are not insignificant. It is in everyone’s interests to try to mitigate these. The committee heard and saw for itself some of the push factors for why treatment may be sought on the Australian side. There are vast disparities between health facilities in PNG and those in Australia. Major challenges on the PNG side include a lack of human resources, equipment and infrastructure, coupled with rugged geography and governance issues that make difficult the distribution of essential supplies and service delivery. The committee learnt that the problems are not solely due to a lack of money, especially in the Western Province, which is actually one of the richest provinces in the country. Australian aid in the region is substantial, seeking to strengthen health facilities along the border in the Western Province as well as the national health system in PNG and the Solomon Islands. Extra resources are being allocated to the Saibai Health Clinic-Saibai being in the Torres Strait on our side-in recognition that it caters for PNG nationals, in addition to Torres Strait residents. The Office of Development Effectiveness reports indicate that overseas aid effectiveness is a bit of a mixed bag and that it is more successful in some areas than in others. Placing Australian advisers in line agencies, such as the Ministry of Health, to work alongside host counterparts in the Solomon Islands is one strategy that appears to work well. On overseas aid it is worth mentioning something not well known: assistance flows two ways. It is not well known in Australia that PNG provided aid to Australia for its victims of natural disasters, of the Victorian bushfires and the Queensland floods. So it does flow both ways. Australia works in partnership with the governments of PNG and the Solomon Islands to achieve better health outcomes and determines priorities in both countries, in line with MAIN COMMITTEE",141,Senior Liberals Have Sought To Link Tony Abbott To The Race Leaflet Row That Helped Cost The Former

245,Mr Georganas,"Not many Australians are aware that Australia’s closest internationalwhat those governments want. PNG and the Solomon Islands are sovereign nations and Australia can only, and only wishes to, assist. Ultimately, the PNG and Solomon Islands governments are responsible for delivering health services to their own citizens. In this report the delegation highlighted the problems but also what works or could work better in Australia’s role in facilitating these solutions. For instance, Australia has clearly made a fundamental difference to the water and sanitation situations in treaty villages in the Western Province of PNG through supplying rainwater tanks that provide a minimum level of safe drinking water. The delegation also recommended that this installation program be expanded to provide more than the minimum level of water required. Installing adequate water and sanitation in villages is part of getting the basics right for better health outcomes. We saw that, if you do not get those basics right, the health outcomes that flow through obviously are not as good. We know that a lot of illnesses and diseases are eradicated just by having sanitation in these villages. The delegation also noted that the PNG government, together with Sustainable Development, have undertaken to improve water supply and would like to see this done as soon as possible. That said, the delegation recognises the very real logistic and practical difficulties that stand in the way of any speedy or comprehensive installation. In the Solomon Islands Australia has built basic but functional health clinics, complete with solar fridges for cold storage of vaccines where electricity does not exist. The delegation learnt that one-off projects, supply deliveries and volunteer or staff placements can sometimes do more harm than good, despite donors’ best intentions. The committee has recommended that a contact point be established that provides community organisations with basic information on the suitability of their intended donations in particular regions. Similarly, when building new health facilities or offering other goods and services to assist, the Australian government and Australian community organisations must consult donor partners and local communities. New health facilities must be consistent with suitable support measures that will need to be put in place for staff and to maintain that new structure. The delegation heard from nearly everyone it met with during the visit about the huge benefits of twinning arrangements between health institutions in respective countries, be they hospitals, laboratories, universities or parliaments. Developing and maintaining institutional relationships is not up to governments per se; rather, it is up to the institutions themselves. However, the delegation has recommended that the Australian government do all that it can to encourage and support sustainable schemes and exchanges. Fostering greater people-to-people links, genuine exchange and sharing of information and training lies at the heart of a new era of re-engagement and underscores true partnership. Myriad benefits are being reaped from the Australian Leadership Awards. There is the relationship that exists between the Solomon Islands parliament, for example, and the New South Wales parliament, and there are courses like those run by the Australian National University’s Centre for Democratic Institutions. Women in politics courses are designed to assist participants from the region get more women elected in their national parliaments. The delegation hopes to see more women parliamentarians elected in the region in coming years and for the Australian parliament to do all it can to support that process-hence our recommendation to the Presiding Officers to establish a parliamentary mentoring program, especially for women MPs. The MAIN COMMITTEE delegation believes such a program would have reciprocal benefits for and enrich all our parliaments. This inaugural committee delegation visit to the PNG and Solomon Islands was the first joint parliamentary delegation in recent memory to the treaty villages, and the first parliamentary health delegation in recent memory. The symbolism of such a visit is very important. The delegation visit was warmly welcomed by governments at the highest national and provincial levels, and by institutions and community organisations. Delegates were also made to feel incredibly welcome in the villages and were privileged to spend time in villages that are not easy to get to in either the Western Province of PNG or the Solomon Islands. Wherever the delegation went it experienced and shared the goodwill that exists with the people of PNG and the Solomon Islands. Of course, governments must go beyond symbolism and in-principle agreements to fund and implement the better health infrastructure and services that are required on both sides of the border. That is something which the Australian and Papua New Guinea governments have both undertaken to do with a new package of measures which is designed to strengthen health services on both sides of the border. This package is in its infancy but already the delegation heard that measures such as installing health communication officers on both sides of the border are proving effective. The delegation has recommended that consideration be given to expanding such positions in the future because their job is so vital and possibly beyond the capabilities of any one or two individuals. The delegation was told that close communication between partners is a key to any program’s success, including that achieved by the national malaria program in the Solomon Islands. The delegation was fortunate to be able to meet with ministers, parliamentarians, health professionals and communities for discussion on a range of health issues, from TB, HIVAIDS and malaria to the rise of diabetes in the region and the encroaching impacts of climate change on health. All dialogue was conducted in a frank and very open manner. Delegates were especially impressed, and indeed humbled, by all the health professionals and community workers that we met with in the Torres Strait, PNG and the Solomon Islands. They are so clearly committed to providing the best patient care they can under the circumstances, and often they have limited tools and support. They are the unsung heroes of any health system. Beyond aid, PNG and the Solomon Islands require robust integrated healthcare systems that incorporate a range of outreach services in outlying areas. Australia has rural and remote areas too that governments find difficult to service. PNG and the Solomon Islands are not alone in grappling with how best to deal with moving a fragmented health system to a less fragmented one. Australia has long struggled with the issue of major health reform, and still we hear the debates as to what level of government-national, state or local-should take responsibility for health services funding and delivery. Major structural reform is again on the agenda here in Australia, so we have something fundamental in common here. Similarly, we must all deal with the impacts of climate change on health, and we should take note of some of the experiences we learned from each other while we were over there as to what does and does not work. For example, at the hospital on the island of Gizo we saw the effects of climate change on rising sea levels where the water has come right up to the hospital’s border. They had to actually physically move the hospital and they are building a new one. Climate change is a real threat and is already affecting people’s lives. It is already having MAIN COMMITTEE an impact on health in the Pacific. The delegation’s visit played a role in that sharing and learning process in that we heard from them and they heard from us. Delegates hope to see the parliamentarians we met in the PNG and Solomon Islands back in Australia in the near future to continue our engagement. It is so important for leaders and communities in our respective countries to have ongoing dialogue about the range of health issues that affect our region. In the few minutes that I have left, I would like to take this opportunity to thank my committee-my deputy chair, Steve Irons, and the secretariat, Sara Edson, James Catchpole and Penny Wijnberg-for their assistance and their help. The secretariat did an absolutely A-class job in getting the itineraries and the meetings all set up for us and in the development of this particular report. But I must say that we were also warmly welcomed and appreciated in both countries. There was generous hospitality and support provided by our host parliamentarians and governments of Papua New Guinea and Solomon Islands, and we were assisted ably by our high commissions in both countries. We are very grateful to the many people who helped make the visit such a success. In particular, I would like to thank the Governor of the Western Province of Papua New Guinea, the Hon. Bob Danaya, and, of course, the local member for South Fly in PNG, the Hon. Sali Subam. They accompanied us on our visit to the three treaty villages-our closest neighbours in Australia-of Mabadawan, Sigabadaru and Buzi. We were warmly welcomed with full traditional welcomes when we attended these villages. The three villages, as I said, are some of the most isolated villages in the world. There are no roads leading into them. There are no aeroplanes and airports. The only way you can get to them from Daru, the capital of the Western Province, is by banana boat. We were lucky that we went by helicopter. You can see the problems in getting aid into these places, because, as I said, there are no roads or other infrastructure. I really felt for the people when we saw them. They were so welcoming and so happy to see us. I hope this report does make some sort of difference to their lives. As I said, I thank my committee colleagues on the delegation for their very hard work, and the committee secretariat and parliamentary relations officers for their efforts in coordinating the delegation’s program. I commend the report to the House. ing Committee on Health and Ageing, I am pleased to speak, along with the chairman of the committee and other members, on this report of the Australian parliamentary committee delegation to Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands. To give a bit of background about the work we did prior to making the visit, I will read from the report: Before the delegation travelled to Papua New Guinea (PNG), the Committee wanted to learn more about the Torres Strait treaty, the status of health services in the Western Province of PNG, Australian assistance to the health sector in Western Province, the health concerns of Torres Strait residents and the jointly agreed Package of Measures designed to address health problems on both sides of the border. The Committee also sought information on some of the major health issues jointly affecting PNG, Solomon Islands (SI) and Australia alike, including, avoidable blindness; child and maternal health; violence against women; water and sanitation; HIV/AIDS; tuberculosis (TB); mosquito borne diseases (malaria and dengue fever); the health impacts of climate change; and a rise in non-communicable diseases like diabetes. We have just heard from the member for Hindmarsh, the chair of the committee. I thank him for his speech, which covered the details of the report very comprehensively. I also acknowlMAIN COMMITTEE",142,Senior Liberals Have Sought To Link Tony Abbott To The Race Leaflet Row That Helped Cost The Former
246,Mr Irons (Swan) (10.56 Am),"As Deputy Chair of the House of Representatives Standedge his efforts, along with those of the other committee members who travelled, in putting this report together. I would also like to recognise the secretariat staff Sara Edson and Penny Wijnberg, along with James Catchpole. Sara and Penny produced a great effort in protecting us from mosquitoes, organising our days while we were away and providing a supply of water when it was needed. AlthoughI could not join the delegation on the Papua New Guinea and Solomon Islands leg due to community commitments in my electorate of Swan, I was part of the delegation’s visit to the Torres Strait, an account of which is included in this report. I was fortunate enough to enjoy my birthday whilst on the trip to the Torres Strait, and on that day we flew to Saibai Island. The member for Kingston was horrified that I was offered the opportunity to take control of the plane on the way back from Saibai Island. But I managed to calm her down by not taking control-and I saw the relieved look on her face. Whilst on Saibai Island we visited the local clinic, which is managed by a Western Australian lady from Mandurah. She is doing a great job there with limited resources. One of the things the committee found while we were away was that there is a lack of resources in these areas. The manager of the clinic related to us a story about a PNG national who had recently collapsed in the reception area of the clinic. The man was revived and sent to Thursday Island but died the next day. He had tuberculosis and HIV, both undiagnosed. This man had been waiting four months to get into the clinic. It is unfortunate that the state of health care on an island that is two kilometres from our resources in Australia is such that this person had to wait four months to get into a clinic and dies with undiagnosed tuberculosis and HIV. It is an indictment of the way our resources are delivered and how underresourced our clinics are. It is no fault of the people who work in the clinic; it is about the way we deliver resources to them. The visit was arranged in the context of some community concern about the treaty arrangement that permits free movement between certain villages in the Torres Strait Islands and Papua New Guinea. The committee sought to find out more about a range of health issues, including tuberculosis, HIV-AIDS, malaria and diabetes, some of which have been linked to this treaty of free movement between the villages. The report makes various recommendations to the government and I would like to take the time to discuss these in more detail. Recommendations 5 and 14 both refer to improving nutrition and tackling health issues such as diabetes. Recommendation 5 states: The Committee recommends that the Australian government partner with non-government organisations and communities to find nutritional solutions that promote healthy eating and redress malnutrition, in affected areas in the Torres Strait and Papua New Guinea. Recommendation 14 states: The Committee recommends that the Australian government support education programs about diabetes prevention and nutrition in the Torres Strait, the Solomon Islands and Papua New Guinea, in areas where diabetes and nutrition are problematic. The committee has done plenty of work on the topic of diabetes and diabetes prevention. The more research the committee does, the more we understand how this issue permeates the whole of our society. The report notes: Hypertension, a precursor to cardiovascular disease, and diabetes are on the rise (through increased salt and sugar intakes) … MAIN COMMITTEE The delegation asked what was being done in respect of preventative health and was advised that it is much more difficult to procure funding for prevention than for treatment. The hospital has recently applied for funding from the World Diabetes Foundation. I continue to support healthy living and activity in the electorate of Swan. I am pleased to inform the House that during AprilI will be starting a number of walking groups across the electorate to kick off a healthy living program in my electorate of Swan. It is good to see the member for Kingston has arrived. I will not repeat the story about the plane, but I did mention your horror, Member for Kingston, when you thought I was going to take control of that plane! Whilst type 2 diabetes is largely preventable, type 1 is not. Today’s Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation 2010 Kids in the House day brings 111 children and teenagers and their families from across Australia to Parliament House in Canberra to raise awareness of type 1 diabetes. I am pleased that Thomas Lyons, a young lad from my electorate, is here in Parliament House today with his mother, Nicki. Thomas was very happy to meet Tony Abbott, the opposition leader, as we were walking down the corridor. Thomas and his family spoke to me about the condition of juvenile diabetes and the challenges that he faces on a day-to-day basis. I was also lucky to meet this morning with Baden Ross-Willmore from Nola Marino’s electorate of Forrest. I look forward to catching up with them all at lunchtime. The Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation is lobbying for $40 million of federal government funding to establish a clinical trial network for type 1 diabetes that it says would provide a range of benefits, including access to new treatments, improved diabetes management and reduced medical and hospital costs for people with type 1 diabetes. I will be interested to see the federal government’s response to this request and I ask the government to seriously consider this funding. Going back to the report, while I am sure the freedom of movement between Torres Strait and PNG villages contributes to health issues, it is worth mentioning that there are certain benefits to that relationship. Given the health related issues, we must keep a watchful eye on this relationship and do all we can to help address the burden of issues. In conclusion, this is an interesting report that highlights a number of important issues. With you, Deputy Speaker Georganas, being the chair of the committee, I hope the government will take a serious look at the report and that the outcomes from it are beneficial to our closest neighbours. It is important that we do not forget our fellow Australians in the Torres Strait. I also thank the committee members who were on the trip. They helped me celebrate my birthday while we were up there and gave me a nice present, which was very well received. I also thank the people, particularly those in the Torres Strait, who accommodated us, looked after us and gave us all the support we needed to help put this report together. I commend the report to the House. Ms RISHWORTH (Kingston) (11.04 am)-I am very pleased to rise to speak on the Standing Committee on Health and Ageing report Regional health issues jointly affecting Australia and the South Pacific. This report is the result of the work of some months. The committee travelled to various places to gather significant evidence on some of the health issues affecting our region and, in particular, our nearest neighbours. MAIN COMMITTEE This inquiry had as a backdrop the federal government’s new era of engagement in the Pacific, and particularly it enabled not just the government but the parliament of Australia to engage directly with some of its closest neighbours, including Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands. The aim of the inquiry was to investigate shared health concerns with some of our closest neighbours, and it was regularly noted by the chair during the visit that one of the primary reasons for this was that diseases do not respect nations’ borders and therefore the health concerns of our nearest neighbours are the health concerns of us all. Papua New Guinea is Australia’s closest neighbour, and indeed, as previous speakers have mentioned, a lot of Australians do not realise just how close a neighbour it is. In some areas there are only five kilometres separating parts of the Torres Strait from the Western Province of PNG. I was surprised, as I know a lot of people were, to see that while I was standing on the island of SaibaiI could actually see the coast of the Western Province. Due to the proximity and traditional movement of the people in the Western Province and the Torres Strait, there are special circumstances that allow for the free movement of people between the Torres Strait and the 13 treaty villages on the Papua New Guinean side. The committee travelled to the Torres Strait and to three of the treaty villages to investigate how health care was provided on both sides and how the interaction between these two groups of people was impacting on health care. The committee learned that the treaty allowed for people to travel from Australia to the PNG side for traditional purposes, including for trade and family connections. What the treaty does not allow is for people to travel for healthcare purposes. However, what we did learn when we visited both sides was that there is some movement to the Australian side of people who need access to care. This was raised both in the Torres Strait and on the PNG side. We heard from many medical officers who said that for humanitarian reasons, obviously, but also for practical reasons they would not deny health care to those in need because by not treating someone who perhaps presents with tuberculosis you are then leaving both Australia and the Western Province vulnerable to the spread of that disease. We heard that for very practical reasons it is sensible, if PNG locals are travelling across the border, to treat disease. After travelling to the treaty villages, the reasons that some of the locals would travel to Australia made a lot of common sense to me. To access a hospital in the capital of Daru can take in excess of two hours by boat. Compare that with 15 to 30 minutes to get to Australia. This is one of the major issues. We also learnt that another issue is to do with the level of health services that are available on the PNG side. At times within these treaty villages the level of services can be problematic. There was certainly some discussion about this, and within our recommendations we have talked about supporting an initiative that was discussed in evidence which would allow health workers from Australia to travel directly to the treaty villages, perhaps to assist with health but perhaps also to follow up patients that have presented at Saibai. At the moment health workers would not be able to cross that five-kilometre border; they would have to go through Port Moresby, Daru and then to the treaty villages. Certainly the committee thought that this was a sensible recommendation that would help in a practical way to provide services to that border area. During our travels to both PNG and the Solomon Islands we also learnt that there are a number of things that Australia is assisting with and needs to be aware of. As previous members have noted, diabetes and lifestyle diseases are occurring in Australia and need to be adMAIN COMMITTEE dressed if we are going to improve the health of our nation. These diseases have the potential to explode in both the Solomon Islands and Papua New Guinea. These lifestyle issues have the potential to be more prevalent in the capital cities of Honiara and Port Moresby, as people’s lifestyles include more fast foods and less nutrition and they become more sedentary in their jobs. As it is in some of our remote Indigenous communities, malnutrition was also a problem in some remote areas of the Solomon Islands and PNG. We have made some recommendations on how we might look at diabetes and malnutrition, which are areas that do need to be addressed. We heard a lot of evidence about workforce shortages. We think we have workforce shortages in Australia, but there certainly are workforce shortages both in the Solomon Islands and in Papua New Guinea. This is something that both countries are struggling with. How do they train enough health workers, doctors and nurses to service their population? Because these two nations are geographically spread out, another issue confronting them both is how they can post workers out to the many islands, towns and villages that are quite a way from the capital city and keep them there. We heard evidence that, if housing was not provided for those workers, especially in the treaty villages, then they would not be able to stay there. If you cannot provide housing for the health workers who are posted there then there is not much incentive for them to stay. We recommend that, when AusAID and other aid organisations invest in aid posts, they take into consideration providing, where practicable, housing and other support for the health workers, who are often very isolated. Non-government organisations do a huge amount of work in providing health services to many people in both the Solomon Islands and Papua New Guinea. We heard evidence that, while a lot of the NGOs have good intentions, especially some of the smaller NGOs, and send old glasses to the Vision Centre at the Port Moresby Hospital, indeed it is not that helpful because it actually costs more to replace the lenses in the second-hand frames than it does to manufacture new glasses. This was something we heard pretty regularly. We heard that a lot of doctors visit the Solomon Islands and provide medication to people in the outer islands but that medication is not available from the Solomon Islands government. You can see that it will be problematic if people are provided with one type of medication and cannot get continued access to it. The committee recommended that Australia look at setting up a contact point for small non-government organisations, such as Rotary clubs and Lions clubs, to get advice on the best way to help people in the Solomon Islands, PNG and countries that require support. There are many recommendations, and I encourage everyone to have a good look at the report. I would now like to say some thankyous. We had a lot of support and a lot of help from so many different people, both here in Australia and in Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands. I thank all the Australian organisations and government departments that briefed the committee and provided submissions to the inquiry. For our visit to the Torres Strait, I extend a thankyou to the Torres Strait Regional Authority, who met with us and openly shared their perspective. I extend a special thankyou to Brett Young, who organised the visit. For our visit to Papua New Guinea, I thank all the Papua New Guinean members of parliament and officials who welcomed us very warmly to their country and were willing to have frank and open discussions with us. In particular I extend a big thankyou to the Hon. Bob Danaya, Governor of Western Province, and Sail Sabam, the local member for South Fly, who MAIN COMMITTEE accompanied us on the trip. I also thank all the PNG health professionals in Port Moresby, in Daru and in the treaty villages who shared with us their experience of training health professionals and delivering health services on the front line and provided us with their thoughts on the strengths and weaknesses in their respective areas. I have to comment on the dedication and commitment of these health workers on the front line. They were quite inspiring to me, as I know they were to other members of the committee. I give great thanks to everyone at the Australian High Commission in PNG, especially to the then high commissioner Mr Chris Moraitis. I also give thanks to all the staff, in particular Deputy High Commissioner Jon Feakes, Adrian Lochrin and Paul Murphy, who travelled with us, who provided us with guidance and were particularly patient in answering all of my questions. I also extend a big thankyou to the AusAID staff, who were able to offer a wealth of knowledge and support in the healthcare area, and in particular to Dr Ann Malcolm and Ms Fiona Cornwall. On our visit to the Solomon Islands, we were very privileged to meet with many members of parliament and officials in Honiara and in Western Province. I give particular thanks to the Premier of Ghizo Island for their hospitality. They really gave us a lot of time. I also thank the health professionals from the Solomon Islands who shared with us their front-line experience and were very welcoming and honest. I thank very much the Australian high commissioner in the Solomon Islands Mr Frank Ingruber and everyone at the high commission. I thank the AusAID staff who helped us. In particular, I give thanks to Kamal Azmi and a special thanks to Justin Baguley, who travelled with us to Western Province and provided us with a wealth of practical information about what was happening on the ground. Finally, the last thankyou needs to go to the secretariat, especially to Sara Edson, who was particularly helpful to all of us during the trip, especially when I managed to have a knee injury. She made sure that I was okay and that I got the proper treatment. Thank you very much to Sara and to the rest of the secretariat of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Health and Ageing. This report addresses some of the serious issues in our region, both for today and for the future. The recommendations in this report are concrete recommendations, practical things that Australia and the Australian government can do to further improve health in both our country and the region. I commend the report to the House. Ms OWENS (Parramatta) (11.19 am)-I am very pleased to stand and speak briefly to this report of the Australian Parliamentary Committee Delegation to Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands. I went to Tonga on a delegation last year, but not to either of those two places, with the Clerk of the House. I learned when I was there that there is something that our New Zealand counterparts do better than we do: they educate themselves about the Pacific region. In fact, members on the Labour side of the New Zealand parliament are required to spend their first study grant in the Asia-Pacific region. That is something not required of us but it is something that is very worthwhile. When you are in some of those Pacific islands, particularly in the New Zealand region, you realise how strong the connection is between our New Zealand counterparts and the members of parliament in those areas because of that consistent flow of people, which is now two-way. MAIN COMMITTEE SoI am very sad to see that, at the end of this parliament, we will lose two members of our parliament who are perhaps the most informed about the Asia-Pacific region-that is, Bob McMullan and Duncan Kerr. They are both people who have over many years paid significant attention to the needs of the region and who certainly lead in our caucus in terms of knowledge and recommendations. They will be a very great loss. But it is good to see that the Prime Minister has declared that Australia must usher in a new era of engagement with the Pacific and has begun to send delegations to that area in order for us to learn a great deal more and to engage more with what are very important neighbours. The Prime Minister has suggested that we should host next year’s Pacific Islands Forum to send a very clear message to our region that we are really back in business in our relationships with that region. The relationship is important for many reasons but, in particular, for health reasons because Australia has a very large and growing population from that region. In my area I have a very large population of people from Tonga, Samoa, Papua New Guinea and the Torres Strait Islands. They are very strong communities in my electorate and the health issues that affect their homelands also affect their communities. It goes quite quickly backwards and forwards: whatever issues are being faced in Samoa are also being faced to some extent by people within my community. There are also cross-border communicable diseases such as malaria, tuberculosis and sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV-AIDS. Australia has had a very strong commitment to providing aid in those areas over many years. When I was in Tonga, I was quite surprised by some of the health issues faced there and the reasons for them. As we all know, Tonga, like Samoa, is a very sporting nation. If you look at the rugby teams you can see their commitment to sport. In Tonga there were young men, in particular, everywhere in their rugby jerseys, particularly Australian rugby jerseys. While I was there, the Australian schoolboys rugby team played the Tonga rugby team. The Australian team only just won, by the way, and they came back looking very bruised and battered. When I asked how many Tongan Australians were on the Australian team, I found that there were six. So one could say that the Australian team had a few ring-ins from Tonga. Clearly there is a very important role for sport, yet Tonga suffers incredible levels of obesity. According to the locals, the problem of obesity was not always there and in fact is quite a recent phenomenon. Tonga used to be a whaling nation. They ate a lot of whale meat, which is very fatty, but it was one of the first countries to ban whaling, even though whale meat played such an important role in its diet and culture. But they retained their love of fat, which, when they were a whaling nation, was quite rare. The whales did not exactly float up on the beach, so it was a rare thing for the people to consume that much fat. Now when you go to the local stores you find imported cans of pork belly, which is something I cannot imagine we would eat in Australia. Yet so much of the diet in Tonga now is imported very low-quality and extremely fatty meat in tins, which contributes greatly to the obesity epidemic in Tonga, in spite of the people’s extraordinary commitment to sport. As I read this report it is interesting to note the difference in the focus when we look at Pacific nations and when we look at Australia. In Australia when we talk about our health system we are really talking about a medical services system which, over the years, has focused on the treatment of illness and, more recently, prevention in the early stages of an illnessthat is, the identification of illnesses early, such as breast cancer, prostate cancer and, more recently, type 2 diabetes. MAIN COMMITTEE This report is clearly talking specifically about issues which prevent people from getting good health in the first place. We are talking about issues as basic as nutrition, hygiene, clean water, the availability of toilets, the treatment of sewage-issues that in Australia we now consider to be quite basic but which, in countries such as these, are preventing people from being healthy in the first place. Clearly Australia has a very important role in assisting our neighbours to provide conditions in which a person can be healthy. Also, though, we have a capacity to learn from the focus on health which we provide when we talk about other nations in terms of our own health system. This is an important report. I understand it has been a very long time coming. When you read it and you see the range of recommendations and how specific they often are to one program or another, you can see how far we have to go in addressing the very real health issues of our neighbours. It is a very important report. It is a report that opens the door and asks a lot of questions of us all in terms of what we do and what we can do for our neighbours. I commend it to the House. It is important. It is a good read. As I said, it points out to me just how far we have to go in making a very real difference in the lives of our neighbours. Ms HALL (Shortland) (11.26 am)-I would like to put on record my thanks to the member for Parramatta for standing in for me and making a contribution to this debate. I know she is quite passionate about health issues. The reason she stood in for me was that I was in my office meeting with Dane and, his mother, Kim Boyd from the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation. I would like to note that we have present in the House some young people who are here to meet with members of parliament to educate us about juvenile diabetes. I welcome them to the House, and I thank the member for Parramatta for allowing me to meet with Dane and his mother. To start my contribution to the debate, Mr Deputy Speaker Georganas, I would like to acknowledge the role that you played as chair of the committee. I also acknowledge my colleague the member for Kingston, from South Australia, who was also a part of the delegation that visited PNG and the Solomon Islands. I would like to thank the committee secretariat, particularly Sara Edson, whom I notice is in the House with us today, for her enormous contribution and for looking after us. Every time we turned around she had the sunscreen that we needed and sound advice. Thank you, Sara. I also put on record my thanks to AusAID, DFAT, the government representatives we met in both PNG and the Solomon Islands and the NGO groups that we met with. I would also like to thank those in Australia-Queensland Health, the NGOs and other professionals-who briefed us on the issues prior to us visiting PNG and the Solomon Islands, and when we visited the Torres Strait Islands, which was quite an education in itself. Mr Deputy Speaker, you would be well aware that the Australian government made an enormous commitment to our relationship with PNG and the Pacific islands in the area of health in the 2009-10 budget. Official development assistance to PNG and the Pacific region was set at $1.9 billion. Of that, $133 million was to be spent in the area of health. This shows Australia’s commitment to developing a strong partnership with the Pacific nations. It was only when I visited the Torres Strait Islands and saw the treaty and how the treaty worked in practice that I truly understood how close PNG was to Australia and how there were so many shared issues between our two countries. It also made me aware of issues that existed on both sides of the border. When the committee visited the Torres Strait we met with MAIN COMMITTEE people that lived in the Torres Strait and we heard their concerns about health issues and about diseases being brought from across the border, from PNG to Australia, diseases such as TB and sexually-transmitted diseases, and their concerns that the health resources, particularly on Saibai where there is an excellent health clinic, were being stretched to the extreme. It was interesting to visit the clinic. On the day we visited Saibai there were some people who had come across the Torres Strait from PNG. As a little aside, we met some of those people when we visited one of the villages and one of the villagers remembered the member for Kingston and presented her with a spear, which I know she displays proudly. But when we were in the Torres Strait we learnt of the health issues that are so predominant in PNG. There is poor child and maternal health and the backup if a woman gets into trouble when she is giving birth is limited. We heard of an occasion when a woman had been involved in giving birth for two days and the baby was actually stuck. It was only because she could link into the health services that were available within Australia that her life was saved. I would like to turn very quickly to recommendation 2 of the report, which highlights the fact that we need to support this partnership. The recommendation was that collaborative research be undertaken between PNG and the Solomon Islands and the Torres Strait Islands into sexually-transmitted diseases and the network. There is not a lot of information around. We need to demystify a number of the issues relating to this particular area and it could best be done by collaborative research on both sides of the border. I would like to turn to PNG. There are enormous challenges within the health system in PNG. We talk about challenges here in Australia where we are looking at health reform currently. Our health reform will actually put Australia at the absolute cutting edge of delivery of health services. It is only when you visit places like Port Moresby and Daru, where we visited the hospital, that you can appreciate the challenges faced by health professionals in trying to deliver health services to people that have very high health needs. We learnt about how challenging the delivery of health services in those areas can be. And then there are the treaty villages, which are very remote. As the chair of the committee mentioned, it takes 30 minutes by banana boat from Australia, but it takes a lot longer to get to Daru. It highlighted a number of issues when we were in PNG. There is little likelihood that Millennium Development Goals4 and 5, which I believe are very important, will be met in PNG. For things to improve in PNG, we need to commit to a strong partnership with them. We need to commit to helping PNG develop their resources and we need to partner with them on programs that are directed at violence against women. I think that violence against women in PNG and the Solomon Islands is an issue that impacts on the health of both of those nations. I noticed this morning that a report has been released on alcohol abuse in both PNG and the Pacific area. Maybe as this unfolds we will find there is a correlation between the abuse of alcohol and violence against women. It is only by developing partnerships with PNG and the Solomon Islands within our law enforcement agencies, which Australia has been doing for quite some time, and between our educational institutions, health institutions, governments and government departments that this can be effective. The other thing that struck me both in PNG and in the Solomon Islands was the dedication of those health workers who are involved in those countries. Unique programs are being run in those countries. One of the programs that I found particularly exciting was the one where health workers and other people were going out and working with sex workers in the commuMAIN COMMITTEE nity to teach them about safe sex and trying to educate them in a way that would counteract the effects of HIV, because HIV is quite rampant in PNG. One of the things that actually protects certain areas is the remoteness of the country. As remote settlements are connected, it will lead to an increase in sexually transmitted diseases-in particular, HIV. There is some fantastic work being conducted by aid agencies in both countries. As I think was previously mentioned by the chair-and I am sure the member for Kingston will have mentioned it too-climate change is having an impact on those communities in the Solomon Islands. When we visited Ghizo Island we saw how the water had moved closer to the hospital, and the hospital would need to be moved to ensure its safety. We also saw the impact that climate change has had on surrounding island communities, where they had to leave their homes and move to the island of Ghizo. Associated with climate change are increases in malaria and dengue fever and the creation of more health challenges for those communities. I have to note in my contribution to this debate that there has been some fantastic work done in relation to malaria in the Solomon Islands, and we were fortunate enough to meet with some experts in that area. I think one of the things that we can really do, other than give financial support, is contribute through partnerships with different organisations and groups and develop the process of mentoring-being there and being able to provide support as requested from communities in both the Solomon Islands and PNG. We were fortunate enough to meet some wonderful women who were interested in politics. I think the women in this parliament could develop some formal relationships to help mentor those women, because entering politics and becoming a member of parliament increases their ability to have input into decisions that will influence the health of women within their nation. Another important issue is that we as a nation should listen to the communities in those countries. Any expenditure of money, any aid programs that we undertake, should be driven by the communities and countries in which those programs are delivered. We learnt that, quite often, the programs that are unsuccessful have been imposed on the communities from outside, while the ones that are successful are community driven. SoI think it is very important that what we do in relation to the delivery of health services and health infrastructure is driven by the countries we are involved with. The trip was a fantastic experience. I feel very privileged to have visited some places that have never been visited by members of the Australian parliament before. I hope that the recommendations we have made in our report will really make a difference. Once again I thank the secretariat and, in particular, Sara Edson for her contribution.

248,Mr Hayes,"I am pleased to table the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australianquired to report on the annual report of the Crime Commission, and that is what this document does. The committee is pleased to report that the Australian Crime Commission has continued to deliver efficient criminal intelligence and operational services during the past financial year. For example, during 2008-09 the ACC disseminated nearly 6,000 items of intelligence and other products to partner agencies, an increase from approximately 4,000 items in the previous year. In addition, the ACC produced more strategic intelligence reports and more operational intelligence reports in 2008-09 than in the previous financial year. What is more, the commission has continued to refine and improve its intelligence and information systems and services, which are well received by client agencies of the commission. This affects the ability of the commission to appropriately target the dynamics and changing nature of criminal activities throughout Australia. The commission has significantly disrupted and deterred serious organised criminal activity. It conducted six intelligence operations, six special investigations and two task forces over 2008-09. The ACC recorded a surplus of $8.176 million in 2008-09. The annual report states these savings arose from a rationalisation of ACC accommodation across the country, IT initiatives including contract renegotiations and a general reduction in contractors, a reduction in staff, vehicle fleet optimisation and reductions in spending on overseas travel and capital purchases. While the committee generally welcomes these efficiencies, one issue of concern is the continuing downward trend in staffing numbers of the commission which began several years ago and resulted in a decline in staff numbers in 2008-09 from 573 down to 518. The committee also knows that the number of seconded staff from state and territory police services also fell during this period, from 103 down to 74. This is something the committee feels strongly about, and the committee would like the Australian Crime Commission to encourage and increase secondments from state and territory police forces into the future. We note that the chief executive, Mr Lawler, has cited ‘effective collaboration’ as an important aspect of the Australian Crime Commission’s success, and the committee believes that secondments are to be encouraged on the basis that they provide enhanced intelligence-sharing and jurisdictional cooperation, and build a skills base both in the ACC and in the participating state and territory police jurisdictions which we believe will have a far-reaching impact in terms of law enforcement into the future. The committee believes the effectiveness of the Australian Crime Commission board has been improved through the implementation of the committee’s previous recommendation to include on the board the Commissioner of Taxation. While the board has functioned effectively, the amount of work requiring financial expertise and ATO cooperation made the commissioner’s appointment a sensible one, and the committee welcomes this change. Having conducted a thorough inquiry, the committee notes the high quality of and compliance with the annual reporting requirements and also notes the dedication of the people working for the Australian Crime Commission. It is apparent that the commission has worked in an effective and a professional manner with all oversight bodies, including all other participating law enforcement agencies. The committee would like to thank Mr John Lawler and all his officers at the Australian Crime Commission for their contribution to this inquiry and their ongoing professionalism in the way they discharge their duties. The committee looks forward to continuing a very productive working relationship with the Australian Crime Commission. MAIN COMMITTEE Before concluding, I think it is appropriate to acknowledge the committee secretariat for the work that they have performed so admirably in servicing this particular committee. I would like to acknowledge Mr Tim Watling, the secretary, and Dr Robin Clough, Dr Timothy Kendall, Ms Danielle Oldfield and Ms Victoria Robinson-Conlon. They have played a significant role, streamlining the activities of our committee and, quite frankly-with due respect to other committee members present-making the work of the committee enjoyable and probably making us look a little bit more efficient than we truly are. It is also appropriate, whilst welcoming Mr Watling, who took on his role as secretary of this committee only recently, to place on record some comments about Dr Jacqui Dewar, who served the Australian Crime Commission joint parliamentary committee and made a significant contribution to the work. We wish her well in her retirement in Queensland. SinceI am joined by one of my colleagues from the committee, Mr Jason Wood, formerly deputy chair of the committee – to colleagues by the name of their electorate. for a while! But I do acknowledge his contribution to the Victoria Police as well as the contribution he makes to this committee in a very practical and thoughtful way. I commend the committee report. great work he did previously with the Police Association of New South Wales. Today, he hit the nail on the head when he spoke of his great concern-one on which I will elaborateabout the reduction in the number of seconded members to the Australian Crime Commission. I also note the comments on this same matter made by the chair of the Joint Standing Committee on the Australian Crime Commission, Senator Steve Hutchins. He said on the public record that, if the Prime Minister knew what was going on with the cut-backs, he would do something about it. Sadly, that has not taken place. However, both government and nongovernment members realise that this is a big issue. The government plays a huge role in the ability and effectiveness of the Australian Crime Commission. The budget cuts have really hurt. At one stage, we had an economic crisis and we needed the stimulus package. Sadly, rather than see money go into law enforcement where it should have gone, the government has been cutting back on it. The efficiency dividends imposed on the ACC in 2008-09 resulted in a budget cut of 7.4 per cent in real terms. These efficiency dividends led to 15 staff taking voluntary redundancy packages. During 2007-08, there was a net decrease in ACC staff of 25, which were predominantly people employed on a contract basis. When you get rid of contract staff and unsworn members, someone has to pick up the tab and do their duties. This is similar to what occurred during my days in the organised crime squad. As soon as you lost someone in the IT area, for example, and then something went wrong with the computers that the members could not fix, someone eventually had to come in and fix it. This can happen in the administration area, and its effect can be felt the whole way through the organisation. That is why the support staff are so important. A further 13 officers seconded from state and territory forces were returned early due to budget cuts. Seconded members also play a vitally important role. For those who do not know, the best way for law enforcement to tackle very serious and organised crime is for the MAIN COMMITTEE",154,Senior Liberals Have Sought To Link Tony Abbott To The Race Leaflet Row That Helped Cost The Former

251,Mr Wood (La Trobe) (11.49 Am),"I thank the member for Werriwa, Chris Hayes, for thefederal agency, the Australian Federal Police, to work with state and territory police. There is no better example of this than in the gang capital of the world, Los Angeles, where FBI and LAPD teams work together to take on gangs. To me, that is vital in this country. Rather than cutting back the funding of the seconded members, I think the priority should be to keep them there. Obviously, I do not support any budget cuts. At the budget estimates in May 2009, it was confirmed that staffing numbers had further declined in 2008-09. At 30 April 2009, the ACC had a total of 584 staff-a reduction of 57 staff from June 2008. The decline was all in contract staff. Between 2008-09 and 2009-10, the Australian Crime Commission’s workforce was cut back from 688 to 584-a net loss of 104. More than 100 officers who had been seconded from the states and territories were sent back home, leaving only 15 full-time investigators. That is not enough for an AFL footy team. This shows us how bad it has been getting nationally. During recent inquiries into the ACC’s annual report, it was revealed that the current budget is $94.904 million. That is a reduction on the previous financial year of $2.5 million. In that time, there were also wage increases of 2.75 per cent. Last year, when there was the bikie brawl at Sydney Airport, the Prime Minister promised to act on organised crime and gang violence. When he visited Washington last year, he again promised to act on organised crime and gang violence. The committee has made recommendations time and time again, which the government has ignored. This is no fault of committee members of both sides. What has been very good about this committee is that, under the previous government, government members like me spoke out on this issue, and the current government members on the committee are doing the same now. I ask the government: what is it doing to tackle organised crime and violence, especially through the ACC? If you go back to the initial tabling of the report on the set-up of the ACC, it clearly states that the organisation’s role is intelligence gathering and investigation. If you listened carefully to the member for Werriwa’s words, a lot of them were about intelligence. The reason was that it is hard to talk about investigation when the capacity for investigation has been ripped out of the heart of the ACC. Remember that anyone employed at the ACC does not have the power of arrest and does not have the power to take out a firearm. The only way that can happen is with the help of seconded members from the state and territory police forces and also the AFP. The act says that AFP members must be seconded to the Australian Crime Commission and that state and territory members may be seconded. It is a vital partnership. There is another issue I want to raise which greatly concerns me. In the inquiry into legislative arrangements to outlaw serious and organised crime groups, a number of government members and I were greatly concerned about the lack of information on outlaw motorcycle gangs in particular. The ACC appeared before the committee a number of times and we tried to put together a picture of the impact of outlaw motorcycle gangs in this country. We specifically looked at the anti-association laws which the South Australian government had introduced. I believe Queensland, New South Wales and Western Australia have now done the same. I also read in today’s Herald Sun that the Victorian opposition have that as one of their policies. When we had the recent inquiry into the ACC’s annual report, the ACC officers and John Lawler himself were a bit perplexed when I asked what they are doing about establishing a national gangs task force. A recommendation of the inquiry was: MAIN COMMITTEE The committee recommends that the ACC work with its law enforcement partners to enhance data collection on criminal groups and criminal group membership … To me, that means looking at gangs in particular, whether it be OMcG or mafia gangs or serious organised crime groups. The quote continues: … in order to quantify and develop an accurate national picture of organised crime groups within Australia. The ACC were of the opinion that that was nothing to do with crime gangs. I recently received a letter from the ACC referring to that and to the inquiry that was held on 22 February 2010. That letter said that they had heard my reasons for setting up a national gangs database but that it was not possible because of the concerns about sensitive information on organised crime gangs getting out there. They would rather not have a national gangs database for the states and territories to use. CanI say that that is completely wrong. The ACC are so far off the mark with this. But, in fairness to them, I firmly believe it is because of government cutbacks and the fact that they do not have the ability to do it. If the ACC want to have a look at a first-class gangs database they should have a look at the background of Sheriff Baca. He was the Los Angeles County Sheriff who established the CalGang database. Cal stands for California. California is the gangs capital. His database is so good that the FBI have used it and now the LAPD are using it. It is used right across America. They realised that to have a national gangs database you have to, firstly, work out how many gangs you have in the country and, secondly, their membership. If you go to the UK, you find that they have a national gangs database. In France they also have a national gangs database. Therefore, they can work out how many gangs they have, and which gangs are the most violent and troublesome, and then they can direct their police resources accordingly. I hope the ACC really have a good look at that, because it is one thing they need to do. With that, I again thank my fellow committee members and, in particular, the committee secretary, Mr Tim Watling, and the former secretary, Jaqui Dewar. They have done a fantastic job. I therefore commend the report to the House. Debate (on motion by Ms Owens) adjourned. would like to take the opportunity to welcome representatives from the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, Sandra Genovese, Amanda Bedford and Lucy Bedford, accompanied by our colleagues the honourable member for Melbourne Ports and the honourable member for Oxley.

You represent an excellent cause. I was privileged to go to the dinner last night and I am going to the lunch today after my stint in the chair. Whatever we can do as a country to encourage research in juvenile diabetes is a step very much in the right direction.

253,Mr Randall (Canning) (12.01 Pm),"I am pleased to rise in support of the Protection oftralia’s maritime environmental protection regime in light of international conventions and standards. The coalition is committed to the sustainable growth of Australia’s shipping industry by ensuring that Australia’s maritime sector is as safe, competitive and efficient as possible. The maritime industry is an incredibly important part of Australia’s national and international transport network, with sea transport carrying over 99 per cent of international cargo by weight and domestically carrying 26 per cent by weight. This bill amends the Protection of the Sea (Prevention of Pollution from Ships) Act 1983, the PPS act, and the Protection of the Sea (Civil Liability for Bunker Oil Pollution Damage) Act 2008, the bunkers act. Schedule1 implements the revised version of annex VI on air pollution of the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, MARPOL, adopted by the International Maritime Organisation, the IMO, on 10 October 2008. Schedule2 gives immunity from liability to persons or organisations acting reasonably and in good faith to provide assistance following a spill of fuel inadvertently making the damage worse. In supporting this bill the coalition continues its long standing commitment to and involvement in the IMO and its conventions over many years. As background to schedule 1, Australia has been a member of the IMO since its inception in 1948 and has played an active role in the development of conventions and treaties over many years. The six annexes of MARPOL deal with different aspects of marine pollution, and all six have been implemented by both Labor and Liberal governments over time. While about 150 countries have adopted some of the annexes, over time Australia has adopted all six. The previous coalition government introduced the initial version of annex VI, with De-Anne Kelly, the then Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, describing the introduction as ‘continuing the coalition government’s efforts to prevent pollution by ships.’ Annex VI is intended to reduce air pollution from ships to prevent the adverse public health costs associated with it. In October 2008 annex VI was revised by the IMO to enhance its requirements and further reduce the potentially harmful emissions from ships. The changes will see a progressive reduction in sulfur oxide and nitrogen oxide from ships’ exhausts over time, with sulphur content being reduced from 4.5 per cent to 3.5 per cent on 1 January 2012. This will have little practical effect in Australia, as Australian ships already use fuel with sulfur below this content limit. Schedule1 of the bill also proposes a feasibility review by the IMO in 2018, which will consider whether further reductions to sulfur content of fuel are appropriate, which may result in sulfur content of one-half of one per cent from 1 January 2020. Finally, schedule 1 of this bill allows for the creation of emissions control areas near heavily populated zones in which further reductions in emissions will be required. Presently, the Baltic Sea and the North Sea have been designated as emissions control areas. Schedule 2, as I have said previously, amends the Protection of the Sea (Civil Liability for Bunker Oil Pollution Damage) Act 2008, the bunkers act, to give immunity from liability to persons or organisations acting reasonably and in good faith to provide assistance following a spill of fuel but inadvertently making the damage worse. In doing so, the bill introduces a so called responder immunity. The bunkers act, when introduced in 2008, was supported by the coalition, and implements Australia’s obligations under the International Convention on Civil Liability for Bunker Oil Pollution Damage, which established a strict liability and compensaMAIN COMMITTEE tion regime to apply in cases of pollution damage resulting from a spill of fuel from ships. Schedule2 amends the original act to address a particular industry concern but still maintains shipowners’ general liability for damage resulting from a spill, as well as damage inflicted either with intent or recklessly with knowledge that damage would probably result. It is interesting to note that, at this stage, we have to refer to the Pacific Adventurer spill. I note that, in the minister’s second reading speech, he attempted to tie the introduction of this bill to the Pacific Adventurer oil spill-which his government, together with the Bligh government, clearly sought to use for political mileage in the lead-up to the Queensland state election. After speaking with some stakeholders, I am aware that they have expressed their dissatisfaction with the government’s handling of this incident. According to the bunkers act, usually, if a ship is involved in an incident which causes damage, including damage to the environment, there is a limit on the maximum amount of compensation payable, calculated according to the size of the ship, irrespective of the amount of damage caused by the incident. The liability of shipowners is strict but limited. Some industry stakeholders have raised concerns about the uncertainty imposed by the government’s handling of the Pacific Adventurer spill, with the government disregarding international convention and determining that costs would be recouped from the industry at large through a 3c increase in the protection of the sea levy administered by AMSA. I understand that the government has approached the IMO to increase the current ceiling on the limitation of liability imposed by the bunkers act to increase the liability to shipowners, but this is still going through the IMO’s processes. Thankfully, incidents like the Pacific Adventurer oil spill are rare, but the risk imposed on Australia’s shipping industry by muddying the waters of liability is real and should be addressed. The government’s handling of the Pacific Adventurer oil spill epitomises its approach-that of a reactionary government making policy on the run. This is a government that, in its haste, has plunged our country into $128 billion worth of debt with its ‘spend, spend, spend’ attitude on everything, which has included spending $13 million on the failed GroceryWatch scheme; sending cheques to the value of $46 million to deceased people who were resident overseas under the cash splash; and introducing, and then suspending, its failed Pink Batts scheme, which not only has been a waste of taxpayers’ money and made use of by dodgy installers out for a quick buck but also has endangered the lives of Australian householders. All that is not even to mention the National Broadband Network that has not seen a single home connected yet and the costs of which have blown out from $4.7 billion to $43 billion. In conclusion, I am pleased to be able to speak on this bill which will further enhance Australia’s maritime protection legislation and continue our close relationship with the IMO and its international conventions. It is important that Australia has the best possible regulatory regime that keeps pace with technological and industry developments and reflects international consensus. Canning. BeforeI call the next speaker, I would like to take this opportunity, from the chair, of welcoming staff from Indonesia and from the national parliament of Timor-Leste on the professional development course. You are very, very welcome. I see you are accompanied by our former Clerk, and he is particularly welcome as well. I hope that you find your experiMAIN COMMITTEE",158,Protection Of The Sea Legislation Amendment Bill 2010
254,The Deputy Speaker (Hon. Peter Slipper),"I thank the honourable member forences educational. The good relationship that this country has with both Timor-Leste and Indonesia is well known. I hope that you have the opportunity to revisit Australia in the future. Thank you very much for being present. Ms HALL (Shortland) (12.10 pm)-I rise to support the Protection of the Sea Legislation Amendment Bill 2010. The purpose of this bill is to implement revised measures to reduce air pollution by ships in accordance with changes agreed to by the International Maritime Organisation in October 2008. It is also to ensure that persons and organisations who provide assistance following a spill of fuel oil from a ship are not themselves likely to be exposed to liability. ganisation to reduce pollution of the sea. It entered into force in October 1983 and in Australia in January 1988. Australia’s obligations under the convention were given domestic effect on behalf of the Commonwealth of Australia by amendments to the Protection of the Sea (Prevention of Pollution from Ships) Act and the Navigation Act 1912. MARPOL has six technical annexes, which deal with the following aspects: prevention of pollution by oil, control of pollution by noxious liquid substances, prevention of pollution by harmful substances in packaged form, prevention of pollution by sewage from ships, prevention of pollution by garbage from ships and prevention of air pollution from ships. This is very important legislation. It ensures the safety of our seas. It ensures that our seas are not polluted. As a representative of a coastal electorate-the electorate of Shortland, which is very vulnerable to pollution of the sea by ships traversing the coastline-I have on many occasions risen in this House to express my concerns about safe shipping and ensuring that our coastline is protected. In the electorate of Shortland, we have many pristine beaches. I believe that the greatest threat to our beaches and marine life in that area comes from pollution from ships. Therefore it is vitally important that legislation such as this is put in place to ensure protection of both the sea and the coastline. Often we forget that the ocean around our nation is a highway for ships carrying goods around our coastline, delivering from one port to another. As any highway is busy, so the highway surrounding our country is busy. We have discussed a number of MARPOL amendments over a long period of time. It is laudable that we as a nation support these amendments. Unfortunately, over the years of the Howard government, our maritime shipping industry and the industries associated with it declined. The previous government did not make a commitment to a sustainable shipping industry. Along with failing to make a commitment to a sustainable shipping industry, it also allowed practices that I feel do not ensure the safety of our sea and our environment. With us being an island nation, I believe it is very important that we embrace the opportunities that a strong shipping industry provides. As such, we need to be very supportive of the MARPOL amendments. It is interesting that countries like the UK and the USA have made a commitment to developing their shipping industry. It is only now that we are really looking at the opportunities that are created by our shipping industry in the way that we should. The MARPOL protocols are vital because, as I have already mentioned, they protect our environment. It is important from a global perspective that Australia becomes a contracting party to all these protocols because, by our ratification and by introducing legislation, we can ensure that the shipping industry worldwide is environmentally sound. In Australia we have many foreign ships traversing our MAIN COMMITTEE coastlines, so we really need to make sure that these protocols are in place. In the Shortland electorate we have the MV Wallarah taking coal from Catherine Hill Bay to the port at Newcastle on a daily basis. We are always mindful of the fact that this is an Australian ship and the standards that apply to it are supported by the MARPOL legislation. The legislation we have before us today is about the protection of the sea. It will protect the environment from activities associated with shipping. Sulfur oxide in the atmosphere is one particular thing we are looking at in relation to this legislation. It produces adverse health effects and also contributes to the development of acid rain. We therefore need to ensure that this protocol is in place and this legislation is passed. Despite the comments of the member for Canning, the government is supporting this legislation. The bill will implement incremental changes to the maximum sulfur level of marine fuel oil, as agreed by the International Maritime Organisation in 2008, leading to a corresponding reduction in the amount of sulfur oxide in the exhaust gases of ships. The bill also provides protection for persons or organisations assisting in clean-ups following oil spills. It is therefore essential that persons or organisations are not deterred from responding to fuel oil spills. The bill has been put out for consultation. I support this excellent piece of legislation. Ms MARINO (Forrest) (12.18 pm)-I rise to support the Protection of the Sea Legislation Amendment Bill 2010. The coalition is committed to the sustainable growth of Australia’s shipping industry by ensuring that our maritime sector is as safe, competitive and efficient as possible. Our maritime history is a vital component of Australia’s national and international transport network. As we know, sea transport currently accounts for over 99 per cent of international cargo by weight and 26 per cent of freight. This legislation aims to amend two schedules. The first schedule implements the revision of the annex relating to air pollution of the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, adopted by the International Maritime Organisation on 10 October 2008. The bill continues the coalition’s effort to prevent pollution by ships and maintains the close alignment Australia has with the IMO’s international conventions. Australia has been a member of the IMO since its establishment in 1948 and has played an active role in the development of conventions and treaties over many years. The coalition believes that the changes to the annex will see a progressive reduction in sulfur oxide and nitrogen oxide from ship exhausts over time, with the sulfur content being reduced from 4.5 per cent to 3.5 per cent on 1 January 2012. It should also be noted that this alteration will have little practical effect on Australian ships which already use fuel with a sulfur content below this particular limit. This legislation will allow for the creation of emission control areas in which further reductions in emissions will be required. Also, due to the progressive nature of the changes, this bill provides for the establishment of regulations to set the maximum allowable sulfur content. These amendments will come into effect on 1 July 2010. The second schedule of this legislation will give immunity from liability to persons or organisations acting reasonably and in good faith which provide assistance following a spill of fuel but inadvertently make the damage worse. The bunkers act, the Protection of the Sea (Civil Liability for Bunker Oil Pollution Damage) Act, which was introduced in 2008 with the support of the coalition, has established a liability and compensation regime to apply in cases of pollution damage which are the result of a spill of fuel oil from ships. Schedule2 creates a MAIN COMMITTEE responder immunity, meaning that organisations and persons assisting in the clean-up of a spill will not be held liable for the damage caused if they act reasonably and in good faith. This, however, does not affect a shipowner’s general liability for damages resulting from that spill. Immunity from actions, suit or proceedings will not apply in relation to actions or emissions that were intended to cause damage or which were undertaken recklessly knowing that damage would probably result. In my electorate of Forrest, this legislation will have an impact on the Bunbury Port Authority, which, in 2008-09, had a total throughput of 13.3 million tonnes with exports accounting for approximately 88 per cent of that total trade and imports 1.5 million tonnes, which included caustic soda, mineral sands, coal, urea, methanol, potash, vegetable oil and petroleum coke. The port exported a record of nearly 9½ million tonnes of alumina in that same period, as well as exporting mineral sands, silica sand, spodumene and woodchips. The port authority is forecasting a 15 per cent increase in total port trade for 2009-10 to over 15 million tonnes and there are plans to expand trade through the port with exports such as coal, bauxite and, potentially, urea. Of course, there is a genuine need for expansion of the existing port and its facilities, part of an overall $750 million worth of work needed on infrastructure in the south-west area alone. This legislation will be an issue in practical terms for the Bunbury Port, which is expecting at least 392 commercial vessel movements in the current year. The Bunbury Port Authority raised a number of questions in relation to the legislation. They questioned whether ships will require insurance certificates to be inspected and, if so, by whom. Is it incumbent on the port authority to ensure that the certificate is valid? Another area they would like clarified is whether the port is expected to provide certificates when it receives plastics and contaminated rubbish similar to the requirements for ships with garbage loads. From an environmental perspective, the Bunbury Port Authority stated that they see no detrimental outcomes from the proposed legislative amendments. For instance, the Bunbury Port Authority’s total revenue was nearly $29 million, which is significant for a regional port, particularly in the south-west of WA. A recent example relating to this piece of the late legislation is the Pacific Adventurer oil spill, which occurred in March 2009 and exceeded the $30 million in clean-up costs. Industry expressed their dissatisfaction with the government’s response to the Pacific Adventurer oil spill incident and, as a result, in August 2009 the Labor government announced that it had initiated proceedings at the IMO to increase the limit to shipowners’ liability for the future. However, there has been no further action on this to date. During Senate estimates on 9 February this year, Senator Back questioned Mr Peachey from the Australian Maritime Safety Authority on the current status of proceedings to increase the limit for shipowners’ liability for clean-up costs. Mr Peachey stated in his response that the extent of the limitation is in fact too limited. However, the information on a suitable figure and the consultation processes were vague and, in certain parts, inconclusive. The coalition takes the prevention of pollution by ships very seriously and, as I stated earlier, is committed to the sustainable growth of Australia’s shipping industry by ensuring that our maritime sector is as safe, competitive and efficient as possible. The coalition believes that the revised version of the annex and immunity from liability to persons or organisations acting reasonably and in good faith are positive steps to the further protection of the sea. I support this legislation but in practical terms seek clarification from the government on the issues raised by the Bunbury Port Authority. MAIN COMMITTEE Ms McKEW (Bennelong-Parliamentary Secretary for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government) (12.25 pm)-I thank members for participating in this debate on the Protection of the Sea Legislation Amendment Bill 2010, and the opposition for its support of the bill. I note the comments of the previous speaker but I can assure members opposite that safety is at the heart of this bill. In relation to comments made during the debate in relation to the Pacific Adventurer spill, on 10 March this year the Australian Maritime Safety Authority released the report of the incident analysis team into the response to the oil spill from the Pacific Adventurer in March last year. The incident analysis team was established by AMSA and Maritime Safety Queensland under the auspices of the National Plan to Combat Pollution of the Sea by Oil and Other Noxious and Hazardous Substances, as has been the practice in the past. The report found that overall the response to the incident was effective and generally in accordance with the policies and procedures in the national plan. The report made 16 recommendations relating to how national, state and territory marine pollution preparedness and response arrangements might be improved throughout the country. Most of the recommendations of the report are already being acted upon by agencies involved in the response. The recommendations will also be considered by the national plan management committee as part of a wider review of the national plan to be taken in 2010-11. This bill makes an important contribution to reducing air pollution by ships. Australia, of course, is almost entirely dependent on shipping for trade. This government believes that pollution from the transport sector should be reduced where practical. In shipping this is best achieved by ensuring that ships which visit Australian ports comply with internationally agreed emissions standards. This bill implements standards developed by the International Maritime Organisation to reduce the amount of sulphur oxides in ships’ exhaust gases. This will contribute to a reduction in air pollution and thereby improve human health. The bill will also ensure that people who assist with the clean-out of a spill of fuel oil will not become liable for pollution damage so long as they act in good faith. The passage of this bill reinforces the high safety standards applied to ships trading in Australia. I commend the bill to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Ordered that the bill be reported to the House without amendment. Ms GRIERSON (Newcastle) (12.28 pm)-I move: That the Main Committee do now adjourn. Higgins Electorate: Parking Ms O’DWYER (Higgins) (12.28 pm)-I rise today to speak on an issue that is critical to residents and small businesses in Higgins-extended clearway times. In my first speech I spoke of Higgins as a seat filled with aspirational people. Critical in this group are small business people-people who roll up their sleeves, take a chance and create jobs. In Higgins there are around 19,000 small businesses-from one-person operations right through to people who employ over 100 people. These businesses are part of the nation’s 2.4 million small businesses. As we on this side of the House understand, small business is critical to the engine MAIN COMMITTEE room of the Australian economy. Governments of federal and state persuasions must be evermindful of the impact of their decisions on small business, because adverse decisions can affect the viability of businesses, which affects jobs and, ultimately, affects our economy. In Higgins we have a wonderful strip-shop culture. We have: Chapel St, Windsor; Chapel St, South Yarra; Toorak Rd, South Yarra; Toorak Rd, Toorak; High St, Armadale; High St, Prahran; Malvern Rd, Hawksburn; Malvern Rd, Malvern; and Wattletree Rd, Malvern East. These are just a few. Frequented by local residents, particularly during that busy period of after-school drop-offs and pick-ups, they are very much a critical part of our community. Without warning and with no consultation, the Brumby Labor government made a unilateral decision in April 2008 that, from 1 July 2008, they would apply new and extended clearway operating times on major roads within 10 kilometres of the city centre. These extended clearway operating times would apply from 6.30 am to 10.00 am and from 3.00 pm to 7.00 pm. There was obviously an outcry in the local community. This was done without consultation with residents, small business or local council. The Stonnington council commissioned economic modelling on the impact this decision would have on small businesses, because the decision was made without any economic impact statement. The council’s economic modelling revealed that extended clearway times would, conservatively, impact daily earnings for retailers by 5.5 per cent and annually by 4.5 per cent, at a cost of around $6 million annually. Thirty thousand people signed a petition to reject this terrible decision by the Brumby Labor government. They do not want to see small businesses go to the wall. They want to be able to shop locally. What reaction did the Brumby government have to this petition? What genius solution did they come up with? They left the morning hours as they had unilaterally decided, but in the afternoons they changed the clearway times to start from 4.00pm, except within 100 metres of an intersection, where they would start from 3.00 pm. If there is anything designed to be more confusing for residents I cannot think of what that would be. This means that, on the same road in the same shopping strip, you have two different clearway times, depending on whether you park 99 metres from the intersection or 101 metres from the intersection. By stealth on New Year’s Eve, the Brumby Labor government, through the Minister for Roads, Tim Pallas, delivered notification to the City of Stonnington that it must implement this unpopular, unjust and unclear clearways policy, commencing in February 2010. This was before they had properly analysed the impact of extended clearway times already underway in Boroondara and before they had actually analysed whether these extended clearway times would in fact be effective. Today, people who are trying to park according to the street signs in the local area, on these arterial roads, are being towed and fined. The City of Stonnington have done the right thing: they have taken on the Labor government and have challenged the decision, standing up for residents and small businesses. We will know the outcome of that challenge with the conclusion of the legal proceedings, due to commence around 25 May. The clearway times have been opposed by local traders groups, the Stonnington Traders Group and the Inner City Business Group. It has been opposed by local council, as I have mentioned. The former mayor, Claude Ullin, and the current mayor, Tim Smith, have done excellent work standing up for small businesses and residents. It has been opposed by local members Andrea Coote, the member for the Southern Metropolitan Region, and Mr Michael MAIN COMMITTEE O’Brien, the member for Malvern. (Extension of time granted) One person who has been missing in action on this critically important issue is the member for Prahran, Mr Tony Lupton. In fact Mr Tony Lupton has made a very clear statement on this issue. He says, ‘This plan is good for the community, good for business and good for the environment.’ He is not opposing the decision, and it is good news for us that the people of Higgins and the people of Prahran will be able to make a decision on him in November of this year. There is a very strong candidate in Clem Newton-Brown, who has campaigned hard on this issue and will oppose the extended clearways policy. The local state government members have said very clearly that they will reject it if they win office in November. I think it is critically important that we stand up for small business and that we stand up for the local residents who reject this plan. I would like to commend the work that has been done by all in the local area on this most critical issue. Shortland Electorate: Youth Ms HALL (Shortland) (12.35 pm)-Last FridayI invited school leaders from local high schools to a working luncheon. Representatives from most schools were able to attend, and another luncheon is being organised for those unable to take part in the discussion. At the luncheon we had representatives from Gorokan High School, Northlakes High School, Lake Munmorah High School, Swansea High School, Whitebridge High School and St Mary’s High School. The purpose of this luncheon was to develop formal dialogue with youth leaders in the electorate, to learn from them what issues are important in their school communities and to provide a venue in which to share experiences. It was very edifying for me to see the level of commitment that these leaders have not only to their school community but also to the community in which they live. At the luncheon we decided that we would set up quarterly meetings with the local schools to discuss issues that were important to youth in the area and that they would act as an advisory board to me. I would like to share with the House some of the ideas that were discussed at the meeting. I would like to start by putting forward one of the activities that were undertaken by the school leaders of Swansea High School whereby the whole school community was in the high school hall and all were given pieces of paper and on their piece of paper each person had to write what they were passionate about and what they valued. Once that had been written on the paper, the paper was made into a paper aeroplane and was thrown across the hall. Every student picked up an aeroplane, a piece of paper, and read what was on it. After the exercise was completed, the school leaders sat down and composed a list of the issues. I think that is an excellent, innovative idea that that school undertook, given it involved everyone in the school community and it gave them an idea of the things that were important to students in their community. One of the things that we did at the meeting was talk about the issues that were important to students in their local area, issues such as apprenticeships, TAFE, youth connection programs, work programs in libraries and the need to have vocational courses that were important in a number of these schools. I was very impressed that the students from Whitebridge High School raised a local government issue, which was the extension of Warren Road and the impact that would have on their school community. They told me about the exercise that they had undertaken in lobbying the local council. MAIN COMMITTEE Youth centres, skate parks and other issues were raised, along with promotion of sports clubs. We then discussed what issues the representatives, the school leaders, felt were important. Sport was identified as an issue, because it improved health and happiness. It was also pointed out that good health led to good mental health. Support needs were raised, as there was a need for support for families and students within a school. The importance of the surf life saving movement was emphasised because the Shortland electorate, as I have already mentioned in previous debates, is a coastal electorate. The students also highlighted particular subjects and areas that they were passionate about, such as trades and the environment. It was also highlighted that women’s sport did not get the same level of support as men’s sport. The cultural area was also highlighted as an area of great importance to young people. Motivation and enthusiasm amongst young people should be highlighted and harnessed. It was an excellent activity, one that I was really pleased to be involved with. I thank all the students who came along to that luncheon. Lyne Electorate: Health Services Health and Ageing about an application that has been put forward under the very welcome announcement by the government in last May’s budget in regard to regional cancer centre funding. Going back to May last year, the minister made an announcement saying $560 million would be spent: … to build a network of up to ten best-practice regional cancer centres and associated accommodation centres, to help close the gap in outcomes for cancer patients in rural and regional Australia. The centres will be selected following a national tender process open to both the public and private sectors-and may establish new-or enhance existing-regional centres. This will include a centre in Canberra to service the local community and south-east NSW. We, the communities of the mid-North Coast of New South Wales, were very excited when we heard that news, because it fits in very nicely with some of the growth plans that we have in the provision of cancer services on the mid-north and north coasts. Therefore, following a range of meetings over the last six months, an application was put forward by the North Coast Cancer Institute. There are several parts to that application that I want to reaffirm for the minister and to the House this afternoon. The first and most important step for our community is to get access to a second linear accelerator. A facility has been built in Port Macquarie, where one linear accelerator has been placed, with a second about two hours up the road at Coffs Harbour. Both locations work together in radiation oncology and the provision of cancer services. The demand that continues to come from a very broad catchment around both locations now sees Port Macquarie screaming for that second linear accelerator. The bunker has been built and we are now at the point where the machine is required. There are unacceptable delays at the moment for patients with particular types of cancer-rectal cancer, breast cancer, lung cancer and prostate cancer. We are still too slow in the provision of those services, and families have to move out of town whilst those procedures take place. That is the first and most important request. The second request that we have put forward is for a small amount of funding to assist in the recruiting of trainee medical oncologists and radiation oncology registrars to assist the cancer specialists within the North Coast Cancer Institute, but also to train the next generation of regional cancer specialists. The area at the moment is very focused on the importance of MAIN COMMITTEE",160,Protection Of The Sea Legislation Amendment Bill 2010
255,Mr Oakeshott (Lyne) (12.40 Pm),"I rise today to appeal again to the Minister fortraining and building a sustainable model for the future. Some small assistance in the recruiting of trainees would be an important step as part of providing regional cancer services throughout Australia. The third, final and repeated request-and I know I am a bit of a broken record-of the government, the health minister, the Prime Minister and the executive generally relates to the Port Macquarie Base Hospital master plan and the urgent need for more beds to be provided. There are 161 beds for what is now a regional base hospital. It is a critical factor in the provision of any health service in our local area that more beds be made available. I once again ask for that to be considered as a third and critical step. In relation to cancer services, we are very lucky to have some specialists in gastrointestinal surgery, a liver surgeon, two colorectal surgeons, a breast surgeon, three urologists and four gynaecologists. It is disappointing that the beds are not there to back them up. (Time expired) Hasluck Electorate: Maddington Primary School Ms JACKSON (Hasluck) (12.46 pm)-I rise today to talk about the launch of Dave the Kangaroo at Maddington Primary School in my electorate. I was very fortunate to be invited to participate in a school assembly at Maddington Primary School on Monday, 15 February. Maddington Primary School is composed of a primary school as well as an education support unit. It is a very small school located on the very busy Albany Highway. It has about 160 students in the primary school, with 20 at the education support unit. According to the My School website it has about 16 per cent Indigenous students and a further 10 per cent from non-English-speaking backgrounds, such as refugees and recently arrived migrants, as well as the children of people on 457 visas. On the index of community socioeducational advantage, where most schools range from 900 to 1,100, it rates at 902. When the kids returned to school this year, in each classroom they encountered a halfmetre-high stuffed kangaroo. This created much mystery and suspense around the school, and that was added to by mysterious posters put up around the school saying, ‘Dave is coming.’ So the kids were in suspense, wondering who on earth this Dave might be. It culminated in a school assembly with the wonderful involvement of the staff of the Maddington fire station. With sirens wailing and horns blaring, the Maddington fire station fire-engine arrived at the school assembly and out jumped Dave the Kangaroo. Dave was introduced to the kids. He handed out key rings and bookmarks, all reinforcing the values which the school is attempting to promote from the national framework for values education. Of course, Dave stands for ‘developing Australian values education’, and Dave will be appearing every week or so at Maddington Primary School, participating in school assemblies and taking other actions to promote greater understanding of those values. The school is very much hoping that families will become involved. There is going to be a focus on a particular one of the nine values each week, and families will be asked to identify where the children who attend the school have actually demonstrated or promoted that value at home. Maddington Primary School is unique for a number of different reasons. One of the things that I really found enjoyable about the program is that Dave’s message is being administered day to day in the school by the BEEP boys. They are a bunch of black-T-shirt-wearing boys in years 4 to 7 who are taking leadership roles in the school as part of the Boys Effective Education Program, or BEEP. The black T-shirts with gold logos were provided by the local city council, the City of Gosnells, which is actively supporting BEEP. The BEEP boys are responMAIN COMMITTEE sible for organising lessons for the teachers around Dave’s value for the fortnight or week. They help with photocopying, collating class sheets and presenting the lessons to teachers. The BEEP boys have also been responsible for putting on sausage sizzles for the kids at the end of school term, and since the school established its kitchen garden I am pleased to say that this has evolved into healthy burgers that the BEEP boys prepare and hand out to students. There are currently 16 BEEP boys at the school and I commend them for their work. Maddington Primary School is being funded for this program from multiple sourceslocal, state and federal governments, as well as the Maddington Kenwick Community Leadership Network, the Real Life Church and YouthCare as well as a number of local businesses. I thank them very much for their support. I pay my respects and give credit to the staff at Maddington school for their imaginative and committed approach to instilling pride and leadership skills in the students as well as reinforcing these important values. I especially acknowledge the deputy principal, Peter Jakimowiez, and I thank him very much for the invitation to be involved in the launch of Dave the Kangaroo at Maddington Primary School. Bradfield Electorate: Building the Education Revolution Commonwealth procurement, particularly in the area of education. I refer to the specific case of the Gordon East primary school. I asked a question about this of Minister Gillard in the House yesterday and I was brushed off with the standard answer that when the government looks into these issues it usually finds that the opposition has got it wrong in some way and in fact the quote that we are comparing the actual cost of the BER funded project with is a quote that has been done on a different basis. The very distinctive thing about the case I mentioned yesterday in my question is that when I was talking about the comparator in the experience of Gordon East primary school, I was talking about actual spending in the last five years. The Gordon East primary school built a 180-square metre large special learning room for a total cost of $170,000. That comes to $920 a square metre. In contrast, the block which is presently being built at Gordon East primary school under Building the Education Revolution will cost, together with a little bit of work in the administration area, $2 million. When you do the maths, as I pointed out to the minister in my question yesterday, that produces a cost per square metre of $4,870, roughly five times as much as was paid by the school in 2005. There are, I believe, a number of important principles at stake here that demonstrate what is fundamentally flawed in the way Building the Education Revolution, so-called, is being administered. They are principles which were not addressed in the minister’s brush-off remarks to me in response to my question. She did make the point that when these matters are investigated it is often found that the comparison is not apples for apples. It is true that the comparison would not be apples for apples in this regard: the $170,000 building in 2005 included air conditioning; the Building the Education Revolution building for $2 million does not include air conditioning. So it is true that the comparison is not apples for apples, and the comparison is not a favourable one. But let us go to the underlying principle, because the underlying principle is this: the reason the Gordon East primary school secured vastly better value for taxpayers’ money in 2005 was, firstly, that the total cost of the program was not paid for by the taxpayer; there was some local contribution as well. In fact, of the $170,000, $150,000 came from a Howard government program and $20,000 was money raised by the local P&C. MAIN COMMITTEE",167,Adjournment
256,Mr Fletcher (Bradfield) (12.50 Pm),"I rise to address the issue of value for money inThe second important point is this: under the program in 2005 the parents and citizens association were given the option to go out and manage the procurement of the building themselves. The alternative was to have the New South Wales Department of Commerce manage it for, of course, a fee. I am not precisely sure what the percentage fee was, but it was a significant fee. The parents and citizens association of the Gordon East primary school chose to manage it themselves and that is why they were able to deliver such an outstanding outcome in terms of value for money and an outstanding outcome in terms of addressing the educational needs of the students of the Gordon East primary school. Because .a small proportion of the money had been raised by the P&C themselves, they naturally took very considerable care to get value for money. That is a feature which is wholly absent in the scandalous way that the Building the Education Revolution program has been administered nationally. There is no focus on value for money. On the contrary, there is simply a focus on shovelling the money out the door as quickly possible. We see a very stark contrast here which the present government would do well to reflect upon. St John’s Lutheran Church, Ipswich Bethany Lutheran Primary School 150 years of worship in the Ipswich area. I was pleased to attend the weekend celebrations on 20 and 21 February 2010, when the sesquicentenary was celebrated. It was interesting, because Johann, son of Johann Fleischmann and Charlotte Fleischmann, was born on 25 December 1859 and was baptised on 19 February 1860 at Ipswich. The Lutherans in Ipswich celebrate their 150 years of worship and involvement in the community at the same time as the city of Ipswich celebrates 150 years as a municipality in Queensland. I want to congratulate parish team pastor Reverend John O’Keefe and parish team pastor Reverend Tim Jarick for their stewardship and pastoral care of the Lutherans in Ipswich. I particularly congratulate Pastor Tim for the written history of the Lutheran church in Ipswich. A terrific service took place on the Sunday of that weekend, and Reverend Noel Noack, the president of the Lutheran Church of Australia, Queensland district, presided with a great sermon on service and community. The Lutheran church in Ipswich runs a very fine school called Bethany Lutheran Primary School. Neil Schiller is the principal there and has been for a long time. The school’s emphasis on quality and Christian education is exemplary in the Ipswich community. It has a fine reputation. The school was formed back in 1982, having been planned for many years. The Bethany Lutheran congregation began in 1970 at Raceview in Ipswich, and the school is located there. As part of the Building the Education Revolution funding, the school is receiving $2.125 million, and I know that the school is greatly appreciative of the funding that is going towards upgrading the school. I have been there on many occasions. In fact, I was there serving as an independent observer and contributor to their accreditation process. In term 3 of 2009, under the BER funding, the administration building and computer laboratory, which were built in 1995, were demolished. A library, including a new computer library, a teaching area, stacks, storage, a presentation area, a reading area, a kitchenette and a toilet area, is currently under construction and due to be completed in the next few months. A new boys toilet block is also being constructed. Unlike the previous speaker, I know that the community in MAIN COMMITTEE",169,Adjournment
257,Mr Neumann (Blair) (12.56 Pm),"I speak to congratulate the Lutherans of Ipswich onIpswich, in Raceview and beyond, is greatly appreciative of the funding under the Building the Education Revolution funding. The history of the Lutheran church in Ipswich is a fine one, contributing in many and various ways. For instance, when the terrible tragedy of Box Flat took place the Lutheran church came to the party. In 1972 we saw more than 1,000 miners attend the funeral services at St John’s Lutheran Church in Ipswich. That was the year of the beginning of the very successful Ipswich Bargain Shop. The histories of the churches in Ipswich are all intertwined, and in 1850 German immigrants settled in the Ipswich area. For many years the German language was used during church services, and almost invariably the pastor of the congregation had a Germanic surname. I said when I was speaking at the service on the celebration weekend that I do not think that the English had much to do with the settlement of Ipswich and the rural areas outside, because it was settled by Irish Catholics and German Protestants. The Lutheran church have played an important role in building communities of faith caring for our young people, helping the challenged, the vulnerable and the depressed and building up the community. They are an important part of the Ipswich community, helping those who are challenged. I can think of many people that I know who have personally been assisted by the great work and the great ministry. They have thriving congregations and a communitarian approach. They involve our young people in good-quality education. The Lutheran church are an important part of the Ipswich community and I congratulate them on their sesquicentenary. Question agreed to.
