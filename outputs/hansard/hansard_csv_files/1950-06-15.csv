1,Mr Speakeb (Eon. Axohie Cameron),"tlie Treasurer concerning the administration of the Superannuation Act. A large percentage of public servants contribute to the superannuation fund in order to receive a pension at the age of 60 years, but, in many instances, particularly at the present time, they are retained in the Public Service until they reach the age of 65 years, thereby losing five years of pension. The administration of the aot makes no provision for a percentage increase of the Government's share of the pension in euch circumstances. No provision 'whatever is made for any percentage increase of the Government's share. Will the Treasurer give consideration to amending the act or altering the system of administration, whichever may be necessary, so that public servants who contribute for pensions at the age of 60 years but do not receive thom. until some years later may be allowed to enjoy the benefit of a percentage increase of the share of the pension whioh the Government makes available to the board? matter investigated and will furnish the honoralble member with a reply.

It is admitted that noise in the vicinity of airports, particularly of large airports, causes great inconvenience to people who live nearby, but I find it very difficult to see how that inconvenience could be avoided even by the method that the honourable gentleman has suggested, because it is necessary in certain conditions for aircraft to circle an airfield before landing. I do not believe that it would be possible in other than a small minority of cases for an aircraft to be brought in, on a particular corridor of entry, to land at an aerodrome without first having circled it. In any event, most of the noise made by low-flying aircraft is caused when aircraft are taking off and I do not think that that noise could be eliminated by the method that Oriental liner Himalaya would make two Australia, Himalaya loaded huge quan-",12,Thursday 15 June 1950

7,Mr Handby,"My question tomention these facts because I know that the inadequacy of accommodation in Australia has proved a verygreat drawback to the making of any determined effort to induce Americans to visit Australia and spend dollars here. W ill the Ministerf or Supply use his best endeavours to persuade the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company to organize similar luxury cruises from tlie United States of America to Australia with the object of earning dollars for this country ? tion to the matter. A tentative proposal has been made to have the vessel M a r i posa returned to the Australian run; The vessel has been tied up since the end of the war, and the Matson line is interested in putting it back in commission for precisely the purpose that the honourable member has suggested. It is recognized that one of our difficulties relative to increasing the tourist traffic from dollar countries to Australia arises from the in adequate accommodation in this country, and it is thought by some people who are interested in the industry that one way in which to overcome that difficulty is by cruises of the kind that has been mentioned by the honourable gentleman, in which the passengers would be able to live aboard the ships during the course of the cruises among the Pacific islands and to Australian ports. I do not know whether it is a function for this Government to deal w i th that matter. All that we have done is to set up a small co-ordinating body to encourage the States and private interests to attract tourists to Australia, but 1 shall give consideration to the matter that the honourable gentleman has raised, and, in particular, I shall bring it to the notice of the Prime Minister, in whose department it now rests. WOOL. of both the Ministerf o r Health and the Ministerf o r Commerce and A g r iculture, but I notice that both of them are absent from the chamber. Indeed, only six of the nineteen Ministers are present at this stage. In the circumstances. I ask the Treasurer whether he will be good enough to answer the question which 1 had intended to ask the Ministerf or Commerce and Agriculture. I point out by way of explanation that, yesterday, the Minister informed the House that the Australian Wool Growers Council had approved of the legislation which he introduced on Tuesday evening. The Treasurer, who is the Leader of the Australian Country party, w ill doubtlesp be able to tell the House whether that approval was subject to very distinct qualifications and conditions. W ill the right honourable gentleman say whether one of those conditions is that the I shall give consideracouncil shall be informed of the precise scheme before its approval may be taken as definitive? W ill the Government give the House as much information of the detailed scheme as the Australian Wool Growers Council insists on getting before it approves of the legislation ? formation about that matter than was given by the Ministerf or Commerce and Agriculture yesterday in reply to a question by the honourable member for Gwydir, and I do not know whether the Australian Wool Growers Council has made its approval of the legislation subject to certain qualifications and conditions. However, the right honourable gentleman's question w ill be brought to the notice of the Minister, who, I am sure, w ill come into tbe chamber before the conclusion of question time.

Can he give to the House the unexpended balances held by the respective States? of the kind that the honourable member has mentioned to a recent conference of local authorities associations and I have given similar information also to various deputations that have waited upon me with respect to the financing of road construction and maintenance. As at the 28th February last, the unexpended balances of the moneys made available to the respective States under the Federal Aid Eoads Agreement were as follows:New South ""Wales Â£1,244,000, Victoria Â£1,933,000, Queensland Â£1,117,000, South Australia Â£373,000, Western Australia Â£1,734,000, and Tasmania Â£91,000.

Will he also take steps purposes will amount to Â£7,000,000 at the end of the current financial year, cominformed of such details so that accurate pared with a total of approximately Â£5,000,000 at the end of the last financial year. question asked by the honourable member for Moore, I direct a question to the Treasurer relative to the appalling condition of roads generally throughout New South Wales. In view of the statement of the State member of the Legislative Assembly for Monaro, Mr J. W. Seiffert, that more often than no""t Trades Hall officials, who control the -iustralian Labour party, adopt an attitude of complete neglect of the country point of view, and in view of the fact that the McGirr Government of New South Wales made available for developmental road purposes last year an amount of only Â£76,000 from its road funds despite the large unexpended balance referred to by the Treasurer, will the Treasurer cause investigations to be made in order to ascertain why the New South Wales Government continues to retain a large unexpended balance in its roads fund and makes only paltry sums available for the repair and maintenance of roads? been made and, as the Leader of the Opposition knows, reasons have been advanced by the State governments for the non-expenditure of large amounts of money standing in their roads funds. One of the reasons given was that there had been a lack of material and of manpower for road works. The bad condition of country roads throughout Australia is not in any way due to the failure of the Australian Government to provide sufficient funds from Commonwealth sources. for the Interior ensure that divisional electoral offices are fully staffed and that proposed transfers, or appointments, of permanent oflicers shall be made immediately? Will he ensure that divisional maps, showing boundaries and other relevant data, shall be prominently displayed at post offices and public government to ensure that electors shall be fully and up-to-date electoral rolls will be readily available when they are required ? sideration to the matters that the honourable member has raised and see whether effect can be given to his requests.

20,Mr Casey,"Proposals have beenNational Development. a question to the Minister for National Development. By way of explanation I point out that the Australian Meat Board, in its fourteenth annual report, referred to the development of the Channel country and recommended that the existing railway to Yaraka he extended to Windorah, and that the existing railway to Quilpie be extended to Eromanga. The board considers that the roads at present under construction in that area are not a satisfactory substitute for railas np doubt other honourable members ways, and recommends that while building road bridges provision should be made for the bridges to carry rail traffic with a view to saving ultimate cost. What progress has been made in the construction of these roads? Has consideration been given to the board's recommendations? If consideration has not been given to its recommendations, will the right honourable gentleman consider them before it is too late or, if they have been considered and rejected, will he state on what grounds his department disagrees with them ? giving access to the Channel country in south-west Queensland, all the plans have been drawn, surveys have been made and the work, I believe, has just begun or is about to start. The report to which the honourable member has referred is not a recent one. I believe that it was made at least a year ago. It was taken into account by the previous Government in arriving at a decision whether it should ton Tramway Company's railway line rely on roads or railways as a means of transport for the Channel country. That Government decided to rely on roads. One of the principal factors that motivated the previous Government in reaching that decision was that however necessary and desirable railways may be, they did not provide a practical proposition for giving quick access to and egress from the Channel country. Because of the amount of steel involved in railway construction and of many other reasons roads were deemed to constitute the better means of providing transport for that area. The subject of the construction of railways in the Northern Territory and in north Australia generally is now under [15 JUNE, 1950.] National Development. 4381 consideration by the Government. I am advised by my omcers that; whether or not access by railway is provided roads will eventually be necessary for the development of the Channel country and of south-west Queensland generally. of the Postmaster-GeneralI address a question to the Treasurer about telephone services, and state by way of explanation that I am receiving, are receiving, large numbers of letters from persons, many of whom are aged and infirm, who have been awaiting the installation of telephones for periods that .they state range to as much as four or five years. Will the right honoralble gentleman represent to the Postmaster General the necessity of having a complete schedule drawn up showing the periods, in years, for which people have been waiting for telephones, with the object of securing some fair order of priority in the provision of telephones, especially for people who live in isolated country districts ? honourable gentleman's question placed before the Postmaster-General who, I am sure, will give him a reply expeditiously. RAIL TRANSPORT. Minister for Supply has been involved in certain negotiations relative to the Silverbetween BrokenH ill and the South Australian border, and I ask him what action, if any, the Government has taken to acquire that railway ? Is the taking over of this service essential to the carrying out of -the standardization of the gauges of the South Australian railways? Can the Minister say which government instrumentality has agreed to conduct this service ? of my activities when I was Minister for Transport, though it has nothing to do with my present portfolio. However, I can bring the matter up to date insofar as the information that I gained up to the time that I ceased to be Minister for Transport",15,Electoral

26,Mr Beale,"This matter arises outwas up to date. As the honourable member knows, the gauges of the South Australian railways are ultimately to be completely standardized by an arrangement made between the previous Australian Government and the South Australian Government. That agreement provided that the Peterborough division of the South Australian system from Port Pirie to the border of South Australia near BrokenH ill should be standardized, and that the Commonwealth should acquire from the New South Wales Government a 36-mile length of 3-ft. 6-in. railway from Cockburn to BrokenH i ll to link up with the standard gauge from Sydney. The proposal contained in the agreement is that the 36 miles of railway when acquired shall be converted to standard gauge and vested in the South Australian When I ceased to be Minister for Transport, the Government was about to open negotiations with the New South Wales Government with the object of arranging for it to resume, under its powers as a State government, the Silverton Tramway Company's line and thereafter to vest it in the South Anstralian railways commissioners. This was to be part of the gauge standardization scheme and was to be paid for by the Commonwealth. I think that I sent a letter to the New South Wales Government on this subject just before I ceased to be Minister for Transport, but I am not in a position to tell the honourable member what has happened since then. I shall endeavour to ascertain the present position from the Minister for Fuel, Shipping and Transport and shall then supply the honourable member with the information he has requested. EGGS. which was asked earlier this week by the honourable member for Darling Downs the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture indicated that negotiations were taking place in London in regard to the price of eggs to be sold under contract to the United Kingdom.

Has he instituted investigations on whether an adequate supply of seeds will be available for the coming season? Can he indicate what the position is likely to be? aware that the succession of floods in the various States have had devastating efljcts on vegetable seed production from time to time. Arrangements have been made to prevent the export from Australia of any vegetable seeds which would be in short supply as a result of these floods and additional dollars will be made available for the import of such vegetable seeds as can be procured only from dollar areas. Steps will be taken by the Government as far as necessary to facilitate and expedite the importation of vegetable seeds from any other area so that a shortage for the spring and summer plantings will not occur. a newspaper report in which it is stated that the Prime Minister made a speech in the Sydney Town Hall last night during the course of which, in dealing with the onus of proof clause in the Communist Party Dissolution Bill, he explained the nature of the proposal to appoint a committee of five to act in certain circumstances? It is then reported that in referring to the committee of five, he saidBnt our Labour opponents won't have any Australian Government had, some conof that.

However, I am quite sure that those who were privileged to listen to it agreed completely with all that he said. for Commerce and Agriculture whether it is a fact that the Australian Government has provided funds for the South Australian Government for the payment of a grant to that State's dried fruit growers who have suffered loss through rain damage? Has the Australian Government received an application from the Victorian Government for similar financial assistance to that State to enable it to give some assistance to Victorian dried fruit growers who also suffered grave losses through rain damage? If so, what action is being taken ? was revealed that a disastrous loss had been suffered by growers in the Murray Valley dried fruit areas', the South Australian Government made a request to the Australian Government for a comparatively small measure of assistance. That assistance was granted. Recently the Victorian Government asked the Australian Government for Â£250,000 to make good the losses of growers in the Victorian areas.

The right honourable member for Barton (Dr. Evatt) has done so according to my recollection. Mr Speaker, have misrepresented sented nobody. interruptions are preventing me from making my explanation. The statement that I made was as follows:The Leader of the Opposition was also primarily and directly responsible for the depreciation of thu Australian Â£1 in terms of dollars at a time when the problem of dealing with the currency was much easier than it is to-day. I contended when that decision was announced, and I continued so to contend, that the depreciation of the Australian Â£1 would inevitably increase Uie cost of living. I emphasize that the right honourable gentleman made tliat decision at a time when the income from the sale of our exports was buoyant and high and when our financial position in respect of overseas funds was as satisfactory as it has ever been in our history. Then, in reply to an interjection by the honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr Clyde Cameron), I continuedI made my attitude perfectly clear at the time when the previous Treasurer announced thc decision to depreciate the value of the Â£1. [ said that it was fundamentally a bad, economic mistake. The honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr Clyde Cameron) may not be aware of that, because he was not a member of the House at that time.

88,Mr Riordan (Kennedy) [11.21],"has been carefully considering it. The newspapers of Australia, which are ardent propagandists for the Government, stand to gain at least Â£1,000,000 per annum if the Australian Â£1 is brought to parity with sterling. However, whilst those interests are strong advocates of revaluation, other sections of the community are conscious of the impact that revaluation would have upon themselves. But those sections are not like the newspapers. They fully realize that if the Australian Â£1 is revalued to parity with sterling they will suffer substantially. We have been told that revaluation is necessary in order to reduce the cost of living and to halt the inflationary spiral, and also that it is necessary to increase our production Since 1939 personal incomes have more than doubled. That increase indicates that in that period our standard of living generally has been considerably raised, particularly for the 100,000 persons who were unemployed when war broke out in that year. persons are now competing for goods and services and that competition has been intensified by the arrival of over 100,000 migrants in this country. Personal incomes have increased to a greater degree than production has increased. We find in this country to-day the old school of thought that says that the law of supply and demand should operate. If the Australian Â£1 is revalued to parity with sterling primary producers, including dairy farmers, wool-growers and sugar canegrowers, will suffer a substantial reduction in their incomes because they will thus lose the benefit of the present premium of Â£25 per centum. A similar loss will be suffered by manufacturers who, during and since the recent war, have established new industries or expanded their existing enterprises to such a degree that many of them are now exporting a substantial proportion of their production. They will find it most difficult, if revaluation occurs, to compete on the export markets in which they are now able to hold their own with the manufacturers of other countries. They will also be placed at a disadvantage on the home market in competition with imported goods the cost of which will be considerably reduced as the result Mr Riordan. of revaluation. In view of those facts, the revaluation of the Australian Â£1 to parity with sterling would cause many bankruptcies, particularly among small business men. That section of the business community would, be squeezed out. Such a development must cause widespread unemployment because the incomes of those manufacturers who might be sufficiently fortunate to avert insolvency would be reduced to such a degree that they would have to restrict their enterprises. Therefore, the revaluation of the Australian Â£1 to parity with sterling would cause misery, degradation and widespread unemployment. It would substantially reduce the incomes of primary producers substantially. and would most seriously affect those farmers who have managed in recent years to pay off their overdrafts and meet their various commitments. Apparently, however, revaluation is only the first step that the Government has in mind in order to implement its Those economic policy. If the Australian Â£1 is revalued at parity with sterling and the levels of personal incomes and production are to be equated, the Government will be only too ready to break down not only the standard of living but also the employment standards now enjoyed by Australian workers. When the Chifley Government was in oflice it did not oppose the application that was made at that time to the Commonwealth Arbitration Court to reduce the working week from 44 hours to 40 hours. That Government left the court to decide that matter on the evidence placed before it by the employees and the employers. When the court granted that application, the cry went up that it was too early to reduce the working week to 40 hours because the country had not fully recovered from the impact of the recent war. Thus, to-day, we hear the cry that if existing vacant jobs cannot be filled, the only way to equate the levels of personal incomes and production is to increase the standard working week. That is the threat that lies behind the proposal to revalue the Â£1. It is true that the Australian Government has power to determine the hours of employment of its own employees only. However, State Governments of the same political kidney as this Government will not hesitate to introduce legislation to increase the weekly working hours, just as, conversely, the Queensland Labour Government in 1925 reduced the standard working week of 48 hours to 44 hours by legislation. proposal to revalue the Australian Â£1 lies the threat to reduce not only living standards but also standards of employment. The degree to which it will be possible to put value back into the pound under those conditions will depend upon the ability of Australian manufactured goods to compete with imported products on the Australian market. If Australian-made products cannot compete with imported goods the Australian manufacturer will not be concerned about the value of the Â£1 because he will have no pounds in his pocket, nor will those who are unfortunate enough to be employed by him. Is it astonishing therefore that a large body of public opinion in this country should be strongly opposed to the revaluation of the Â£1. Yesterday, I asked the Minister for National Development whether his attention had been directed to a report that newsprint is to be manufactured in Argentina from megas9, which is the crushed remains of sugar-cane after the juices have been extracted, also asked him whether he would cause immediate investigations to be made with a view to the establishment of sueh an industry in this country as it would be of great value to northern Queensland and to Australia, and would provide a means of saving dollar expenditure. In reply the right honourable gentleman roared like a bull or a Bengal tiger able member knows perfectly well that he must not use such an expression in relation to another honourable member. refused to cause investigations to be made or to admit whether or not he had seen the report to which. I had referred. Instead, be hurled personal insults at me apparently because, in the preface to my question, I had referred to the fact that his numerous statements to the press about the Government's blue prints for development constitute the only outward manifestation of the Government's plans concerning development. Being greatly interested in the subject of national development I am most interested in statements issued by the right honourable gentleman and I have frequently quesI repeat that behind the tioned him a'bout them. On several occasions he has brushed my questions aside. On the last two occasions on which I questioned him on matters of importance he replied that I had .previously asked similar questions on the same subject. On this occasion he begged the question. He was not prepared to give to the House and to the people whom I represent in this Parliament an indication of what the Government proposes to do in relation to the establishment of a new industry which' would play a very important role in the development of the empty north and would provide a splendid opportunity for decentralization, about the necessity for which we hear so much in these days. Here is an opportunity for the Government to render great assistance to the Queensland sugar industry and at the same time to provide opportunities for the development of the empty north. I appeal to the Treasurer ( Mr Fadden), who has some knowledge of the 3ugar industry, to cause an investigation to be made of this new industry which is being established in Argentina. During the war I the Queensland sugar industry proved its value from a defence standpoint. An increased population in the north of Australia is essential for the development and defence of Australia, and consequently any opportunity for the establishment of new industries in the north should be given the closest consideration. RecentlyI asked the Minister for National Development, who is acting for the Minister for Civil Aviation, a question relating to recommendations which are to be made by an airlines committee of inquiry, established by the Government to report on Minister commercial airlines in the Commonwealth. Again, the right honourable gentleman became very annoyed. I have been reliably informed that the committee proposes to recommend the cancellation of the Trans-Australia Airlines service, from Townsville to Mount Isa, which serves Charters Towers, Hughenden, Richmond, Julia Creek and CloncurryFlights Nos. 467 and 468.

Most of the people who live in the areas covered by these services are separated by long distances. The Government has announced that it does not intend to dispose of Trans-Australia Airlines, but there are more ways of killing a pig than by cutting its throat. The initial establishment expenses of Trans-Australia Airlines have already been met and the instrumentality expects to be able to show a profit on its operations this year. The Government, however, apparently intends to strangle it by curtailing its activities. obtained expert reports on the potenI know some of those who have been associated with the direction, management and operation of this splendid Government instrumentality. Its success is a monument to their hard work. Trans-Australia Airlines has been established on sound business principles and like all other large undertakings it must continue to expand. It has not been suggested that services over the same routes provided by Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited should be curtailed. The discontinuance of the services now provided by Trans-Australia Airlines will probably result in the doubling of the services provided by the commercial airlines. Is it the policy of the members of the committee to strangle this important Commonwealth instrumentality? I say to the Treasurer that if effect is given to this recommendation it will cause uproar in north Queensland as well as in the western part of that State. It will be a further manifestation of the Government's policy as disclosed in connection with the investigation of the newsprint industry, and will be a fresh indication of where the Government stands in relation to the development of northern Australia. I turn now to another valuable asset of north Queensland, the Blair Athol coal-field. We have heard much about the wish of this Government to achieve a substantial increase of the supply of coal both for the -manufacture of gas and for steam-raising. A great deal Mr Riordan. has been said about the necessity of increasing Australia's output of coal in order to meet the ever-growing demand, that is caused by our expanding industrialization, which requires more gas-coal and steaming coal than is now being mined in this country. When I was a boy, which is a long time ago, the Blair Athol coal-field was regarded as one of the wonders of the world. The extent of the Blair Athol seam was not fully realized then, and, as a matter of fact, it is not fully known now. Boring is still continuing to discover just how far this great body of coal extends. It has been estimated that at least 200,000,000 tons of coal lie in the ground at Blair Athol. The Queensland Government has tialities of the field. In 1945, at the conclusion of the last war, when the Queensland Government realized that the coal position in Australia was such that every State with coal deposits should attempt to contribute something to national coal production and national development, a committee investigated Blair Athol's potentialities. In 1947, Mr Kemp, who is well known to the Treasurer as Co-orddnator-General of Public Works in Queensland, furnished a very valuable report on Blair Athol. An overseas company also furnished a similar valuable report to the Premier of Queensland. All the information contained in these reports is available to the Government. The Blair Athol field contains bituminous and sub-bituminous coal of a calorific value of 11,600 British thermal units, which has a very low ash content and does not clinker. It is not a gas-coal, but it is a steaming coal, and can play an important part in the development of Australia's industries. We know how desirable it is to produce locally all the coal that is required to carry on and extend industries that are already established. I have raised this matter for several reasons. Coal is vital to the development and expansion of our industries. There is an acute shortage of coal everywhere. Unless some large-scale coalproducing projects are undertaken now the industrial developments of Australia will be retarded, because industry will require substantially increased quantities of coal witbin tbe next few years. Tbe Government has spoken about expending Â£250,000,000 on development and I cannot see what greater project could be undertaken than the development of a field -the limits of which have not yet been finally determined. If the Government intends to do something about the development of northern Australia what better starting point could it have than the development of this field? Southern industry would benefit from the availability of adequate supplies of coal. The diffusion of the sources of supply would be of benefit by providing a form of insurance against the hold-up of supplies. From the defence aspect the production of further power-producing material is desirable. The implementation of such a project would provide a stimulus to the development of central and northern Queensland generally and would thereby increase the Queensland market for manufactured goods .from the south. The large-scale development that is possible at Blair Athol would provide a cheaper supply of coal; this, of course, would depend on shipping freights. I have been given to understand, and I am open to correction because I have been unable to obtain the official figures, that Â£1 is of vital national urgency. The the overseas shipping freight on the coal being imported to Victoria from overseas is 30s. a ton whereas our shipping companies charge 48s. a ton to carry Callide coal from Gladstone to Melbourne. The shipping companies would therefore also have an interest in this matter. The honourable gentleman's time has expired. BeforeI proceed with my general remarks I shall deal with some of the statements that have been made by honourable members opposite during the last few days. The first matter to which I shall refer is the revaluation of the Â£1. AllI wish to say about that subject is that honourable memibers opposite are either completely ignorant of matters of international finance and exchange-and I do not believe that they are-o r merely trying to cause the Government as much embarrassment as they possibly can, which is what I believe they are attempting to do. It is obvious that no information about any proposed revaluation of our currency could be given by the Government until such time as the revaluation had actually been effected, or at least immediately before it was to be effected, as otherwise a lot of the friends of honourable members opposite and one or two tycoons would make huge profits from illegal transactions. Another subject with which I shall now deal is that of putting more value into the Â£1, about which there has been a great deal of discussion lately. I was one of the people who, at the last general election, stated that if the Liberal and Australian Country parties were returned to power they would put more value into the Â£1. I am quite confident that by the time this Government's term is over that promised value will have been restored to the Â£1. I consider that honourable members opposite have merely raised that matter recently in order to embarrass the Government as much as ithey can. It would be of more benefit to the country if they did their best to co-operate with, the Government in this matter, because the matter of putting more value into the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) said recently that the activities of the Communist party are one of the main causes of the present decreased value of the Â£1. Honourable members know what the Government is trying to do to prevent a continuance of that condition. ""We have only to .recall what was happening while members of the Opposition were in office as the Government only a few months ago, to realize that a considerable degree of the increase of the cost of living is direct] v attributable to the general coal strike thaf occurred last year, which the Labour Government took so long to tackle. Honourable members who support the present Government were not in a position to take any action to prevent that strike, but now that they are able to do something to preserve peace in industry honourable members of the Opposition are deliberately trying to sabotage the attempts of the Government to get rid of subversive elements and restore some value to the Â£1. There are",24,Second Reading
91,Mr Deputy Speakeb,Order!,26,Second Reading
92,Mr Mccolm (Bowman) [11.52],"tkree causes of tlie present state of inflation. munist party are one cause. The other two can best be summed up in words which a friend of mine uttered recently when he referred to the greed and apathy of the people of our Commonwealth. It is an undoubted fact that some large financial interests and a lot of people individually have for tlieir aim in life the very greedy objective of getting as much as they can regardless of the cost to Hayman Island, off the Queensland coast. other people or to the Commonwealth. I suggest to those people that unless they there has been an unnecessary and somerealize that they are greedy they will, without the slightest doubt, get the socialism that they dislike so much and which. I dislike intensely, because a spirit of greed is bound to break any government which does not successfully oppose it. I believe that this Government will do its utmost to eliminate such behaviour. In my opinion, this can be done by the introduction of profit-sharing schemes wherever they can be applied. Another cause of the inflationary situation is laziness, or perhaps it would be better to say "" apathy"". Working hours have been reduced and I think that if every man pulled his weight and worked his hardest that reduction of hours would benefit the community, but, unfortunately, men and women are not pulling their full weight at the present time, and I consider that I should be lackthan the present Government for the fact ing in my duty to the Commonwealth if I did not say so. Many of the conscientious people in industry realize that one of the greatest drawbacks is that all men and women are not putting all their effort into their work. Perhaps they do not realize the common need for such effort, or perhaps they are actuated by laziness combined with personal greed and the idea of getting as much as possible and giving as little as possible. These people should revise their thoughts and endeavour to amend their actions. The blame for the trends that I have mentioned can, to a large extent, be laid on the doorstep of the previous Government, which, by its continued unnecessary controls and its fostering of the spirit of reliance on the Government, has weakened the will of many people to work for themselves. It has taught the The activities of the Compeople that honesty does not always pay because whenever a nation enacts stupid, unnecessary laws the people immediately evade them and once a government starts inciting people to evade laws it encourages all the vices that I have mentioned. Honourable members have heard something in the last day or so about the erection of a large luxury hotel on Perhaps in the construction of that hotel what lavish outlay of materials which could usefully have been put into homes. I am very pleased that a member of the Opposition complained about that. It is a pity that he was not in the previous Parliament because most of the shortages and troubles that are related to building materials are attributable to the lack of initiative and foresight on the part of the previous Government. Honourable members have heard mention of slum areas in large cities and of how deplorable it is that they should exist. By implication, this Government was told that it should be ashamed of itself because, after some six or seven months of office, it had not righted these terrible conditions. That is utter nonsense. The previous Government had eight years in which to do something about slum conditions. Those conditions cannot be laid at its door, but it must bear more blame that slums have not been cleared up. The policy of the previous Government, allied to a shortage of building materials, indirectly contributed to ths formation of slum areas in the future, because the vast shortage of material has limited the size of houses that can be built, a fact which will bring considerable areas of slums into being. Those may not be so bad as slums have been in the past, but they will be bad enough. I should like to direct the attention of the House to the vast difference that exists between the various audit acts in the States of the Commonwealth. I trust that honourable members will consider, as I do, that this matter affects the Commonwealth, and I urge the Government to use all the influence that it can to ensure, if it be at all possible,",26,Second Reading
93,Mr Mccolm.,"some degree of uniformity in the audit Acts of the various States. This matter has concerned Auditors-General in different States for a considerable period. Some of the relevant State acts were passed as long ago as 1874, and others -of them have not been revised for quite a long time. In 1931, a conference of Auditors-General was held in Melbourne at which wider powers were sought. Recommendations were presented to the various governments affected. They sought uniform audit legislation and greater Auditors-General in carrying out investigations of appropriation accounts, as well as an effective system of departmental checks. Whilst this is primarily a State matter, it is of some considerable consequence to the Oommonwealth in a number of different ways which I shall mention. In Queensland there is only one House of Parliament. The'Auditor-General in that State is appointed by the Governor on the advice of his Executive Council, and that mere fact must, and does, make the position of the Auditor-General extremely difficult at times because his appointment becomes a political one. I believe it was once reported that the Queensland Auditor-General, immediately prior to .his re-appointment, handed his signed, undated resignation to the Government. That is not conducive to good government. In mentioning these things I do not intend to condemn or challenge in any way the probity or honesty of purpose of most high public servants connected with them. I merely point out these matters because I think that they need careful scrutiny and possible alteration. In Queensland, the Minister who administers the department that deals with statutory corporations or businesses has no financial responsibility for the adoption and signing of annual statements. That could well be rectified if a modern uniform audit act were in force in each State. The Queensland Ministers do not disclose by declaration in writing to the Auditor-General any personal interest that they may have in contracts or transactions with the State governments. That is an extremely important consideration. Such things could be altered, and the accounting practice could be made uniform throughout all States of the Commonwealth. Some years ago in Queensland, ten different trust accounts existed and each account was in debit. The total debit was Â£750,000. That is rather a fantastic situation. ITo private business could get away with it for long before being taken to a court of law. A general tightening up of audit legislation would be very useful, particularly as far as the Commonwealth is concerned. It would ensure that both the Australian Government and, to a certain extent, the Commonwealth Bank, would be assisted discretionary powers for to ascertain the basic value of the accounts of the various statutory corporations. It would also assist the Goverument to assess its national works plan. Moreover, uniform statistics on sound lines could ""be prepared. Premiers' conferences would also be helped because I understand that at the present time the States all prepare their financial statements by different methods. It would be of great assistance to the Australian Government if the State accounts could all be prepared by the same method, because such a reform would perhaps allow the Premiers' conferences to arrive at their decisions * with much more alacrity. all right as long as the* decisions were on sound lines. would depend on who was Prime Minister. Most of these points are covered by the Commonwealth Auditor-General in his report, thus showing that he realizes the necessity for incorporating in the statute such safeguards and provisions. I ask the Government to give consideration to the possibility of getting all States to agree to a modernization and unification of their various audit acts, in the interest of the people who live in the States and of the Commonwealth as a whole.

100,Mr Minogue,"It could beNobodycan find fault with the importation of prefabricated homes. However, these structures cost about Â£2,500 each, without taking into account the costs of land and the installation of electricity, sewerage and other services. When they are ready for occupation, they are worth about Â£3,000 or Â£3,500 each. What chance has the average worker to pay the rents for such homes that will have .to be charged'. Rental charges are fixed at about 4 per cent, of the capital cost. The life of a prefabricated home in the countries from which we are importing them is about 20 years. Perhaps it will be longer in Australia. If the cost of these buildings is to be recouped, the tenants must pay rent at the rate of at least 4 per cent, on Wales, the Labour party has held the the original outlay, and that is the rate that applies generally to-day. That means that a worker who occupies a prefabricated home pays about Â£2 10s. a week in rent. Very often the house is situated a long way from his place of employment, and therefore he must also pay 10s. or 15s. a week in fares. Newly married couples, of course, must buy furniture, frequently on time payment. If all such charges are added, we find that meant that Labour governments were a working family occupying a prefabricated house is obliged to pay Â£3 or Â£4 a week in rent ancl other essential expenses before it can provide even for food and clothing. The people should be provided with good homes at rents that will enable them to live in a decent standard of comfort. But all that we hear from the Government and its supporters is a lot of tripe about what the Labour Government did! I remind them that the Laboitr party was in power for only ten of the iast 33 years and that we were at war for five years of that short period. As I have said, no supporters of the present Government suggested that the war should end because of the lack of money or that we should haggle about the interest rates that were charged for money that was raised for war purposes. Anything can be done in the name of war, and, if war broke out again to-morrow, plenty of money would be found and nobody would worry about interest charges. I remind honourable members of the owners of residential properties to install dreadful situation that has developed in bath tubs, coppers, or other sanitary States in which Liberal governments have been in power in recent years. In Western Australia, where an anti-Labour government has the whip-hand, the capitalists are assured of their pound of flesh. The workers' welfare is not considered. A similar situation exists in Victoria, where three political parties are manoeuvring to gain control of the government. I am intimately acquainted with the situation in New South Wales, and therefore I shall explain to the House what liberalism has done in that State in recent years. I am sorry that the honourable member for New England( Mr Drummond) is not present to hear my comments because he is a former Minister of that State. In New South reins of government for approximately the same length of time as it controlled this Parliament. However, it has been hampered almost throughout its term of office by the opposition of a Liberal, upper house. Only during the last eighteen months has it been able to get rid of the Liberal majority in the Legislative Council. The presence of an Opposition majority in the upper house prevented from giving effect to the wishes of the people. The Minister for Housing in the present New South Wales Government, Mr Clive Evatt, has been working not only on week-days, but also on Saturdays and Sundays, for the last two or three years, organizing a progressive home-building scheme and laying foundation stones for groups of workers' homes. Honourable members opposite may laugh, but the important fact is that 83,000 homes have been built in New South Wales during the iast three years. That record of achievement out-shines the record of any Liberal government in either the State or the Commonwealth sphere during the last 34 years. I was an alderman of the Sydney City Council, which was hampered for twenty years by the forces of Liberalism, which refused to amend what was known as the Corporation Act. When we celebrated the centenary of the second greatest city of the British Empire, we did not have a by-law by which we could compel the facilities in Sydney homes. I could take honourable members to a home at 379 Crown-street, Surry Hills, where a man, his wife and eight children had to live without a bath or proper washing facilities of any sort. That building was owned by one of the richest landlords in Sydney, Mr Eolfe. The so-called Liberal Civic Reform party refused to compel such men to provide the bare amenities that decent civilized people would expect to find in any home. controlled council? did not have a majority in the Sydney City Council until eighteen months ago. However, since then, as a result of its activities and the activities of the State member for Bradfield ( Mr Hughes) was Labour Government, many of those shacks that were a blot upon the nation have been pulled down and people have been provided with new homes. The Labour party has every reason to be proud of its achievements, which I hope it will member. He has broken up governments be able to continue after next Saturday. I have here a report on a housing scheme that was prepared by the Town Clerk of Sydney at the direction of the City Council five years ago. The council was then dominated by the Civic Eeform Party. This report indicates the housing conditions that the Liberals expect workextract from the Sydney City Council ing people to accept without complaint. It deals with an area that falls partly within the electorate that I represent and partly within the electorate of Cook, and the honourable member for Cook( Mr (e) natural lighting-8 2 per cent, subSheehan) can testify to the truth of my statements. He and I , and other members of the Labour party, tried and tried again to do something for the poor people who were living under the shocking conditions that aTe indicated in the report. Redfern district? interests that were represented then by the Sydney City Council and the Legistime? lative Council in the State Parliament, led by such men as the honourable member for New England( Mr Drummond), turned a blind eye to the disgraceful conditions that existed and boasted instead of their so-called achievements. God forbid that they shall ever regain power! The report refers only to onÂ« instance of dilapidated and degrading housing conditions. Eecently a man told me that he had to wear his overcoat to bed because the rain dripped through the roof of the house that he occupied in one of those slum areas.

Redfern who is now the Governor General of Australia. He attempted to enact legislation to extend the boundaries of the area that was under the control of the city council, just as the State Labour Government did eighteen months ago, but his efforts were without avail. His object was to include such areas as were mentioned in the report so that the slums could be torn down and decent houses built in their place, but he was blocked by the Legislative Council, which the remnants of the Stevens Government, having a majority of the total number of members, controlled. Stevens Government was a depression government. Liberal party-Australian Country party coalition governments as depression governments. The Stevens Government expended a substantial sum of money on the construction of the Spooner highway, yet we could not get a hob from it to relieve distress in Surry Hills. AntiLabour governments have been in control of this Parliament and of the Parliaments of the States for too long, and the country has suffered as a result of their administration. Honourable members opposite claim that Liberal party-Australian Country party governments are all-wise, but I reject that statewithout any laundry ment. The Commonwealth should introduce a national housing scheme. While the Government is bringing large numbers of migrants to this country, it should not lose sight of the necessity for providing homes for Australians. For 32 years, anti-Labour governments have been making promises to the ex-servicemen of World WarI . .and World War IL , and have failed to keep many of them.

Of course, that promise has not been honoured. houses that has been completed is f a r short of that figure. The honourable member for West Sydney, if he were so concerned as he would have us believe that he is about the plight of the homeless, and particularly the depressing case that he cited, could relieve their distress by offering them accommodation in one of his chain of hotels. However, that idea would not occur to hi m as a practical measure for relieving distress. The lag in housing to-day is largely the result of lack of foresight on the part of previous Labour governments, particularly the Chifley Government. In nearly every State with the exception of New South Wales the housing lag has been overcome more rapidly than it has been at any time in our history. has the best record.

I remind Opposition memhers that we are really continuing, and endeavouring to accelerate, the immigration policy that was initiated by the previous Government. devote some thought to the subject, they will realize that, by bringing migrants to this country, we shall be able more quickly to overcome the housing shortage. Migrants are being selected who are trained in the building and allied trades, and they will be able to accelerate the housing programme. Therefore, the statement that was made by the honourable member for West Sydney to the effect that the Government is bringing to Australia more migrants than can be accommodated, is fallacious. by Opposition speakers about putting value back into the Â£ 1 .

144,Mr Kekwick,"P r o b a b l y some ofGarden, who was formerly a friend of the honourable member. The objective of the Communists in Australia is to cause industrial disturbances and to mislead the decent workers into adopting a go-slow policy in order to injure our economic structure. Obviously, a slowing down of production means an increase of costs. If the slowing down process is so pronounced that it takes three times as long to manufacture an article as it should, the cost of production must be considerably increased. Every time the workers are misled into going slow, or expressed in good Australian, "" to see the boss off"", they are, in reality, "" seeing tliemselves off"", because the boss is able to pass additional costs on to the consumer. He adds a margin to the cost of production, and the worker and everybody else in the land who buys his goods pay an extra amount as the result of that short-sighted, go-slow policy that is preached far and wide by the Communist party and the Oommunist-dominated unions. The unfortunate outcome is that every man, woman and child feels the pinch. Every time production is delayed, an additional cost is passed on to the consumer. The housewives are particularly affected, because they have to bear the brunt of the increased cost of living. The workers of this country have been sadly misled by the extreme element in our midst, yet some Opposition members have done everything in their power to prevent the Government from dealing effectively with that definite menace. Every move that they have made has been calculated to destroy the Government's efforts in that direction. If value is to be restored to the Â£1, we must prevail ignored the Communist order to stop upon the decent, moderate elements in the trade union movement to adopt a common-sense, and not an extreme, attitude, and do everything possible to throw out the traitors, disrupters and disturbers of the peace who, if they are not checked, will ultimately rule this country. able member consider that the worker if always at fault? fault who fails to pull his weight. Everybody, be he employer or employee, who fails to put his shoulder to the wheel and give of his best is contributing to the higher oost of living. It is the duty of all of us to pull our weight. Sitting suspended from 12.45 to 2.15 p.m. pension of the sitting I referred to the impassioned condemnation of the McGirr Government by the honourable member for West Sydney in which he unwittingly exposed the hollowness of that Government's promises with respect to housing. His statements were as irresponsible as those that the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward) usually makes. During the luncheon recess I took the opportunity to look up some figures relating to housing in New South Wales. The Sydney Morning Herald reported' that between 1939 and 1949 the construction rate increased by only 3,000 dwellings annually, but whereas population increased by 29,000 in 1939 it increased by 113,000 in 1949. Further, more than four-fifths of the 57,000 .homes that have been constructed in New South Wales during the last three years have been erected by private enterprise in spite of governmental restrictions. So much for the McGirr Government's sham with respect to housing. I also referred to the inflationary trend for which the Chifley Government has been responsible and which is the principal cause of the present high cost of living. If we are to reduce living costs and restore the purchasing power of the Â£1, we must get to the root of the trouble by ridding the country of Communist traitors whose sole desire is to disrupt our economy and slow down all productive activities. Although it is gratifying that 14,000 workers work in certain industries throughout Australia yesterday, nevertheless many workers are still being misled by the Oommunists and extreme leftist elements in their unions. Those workers do not seem to realize that they themselves suffer most as the result of the insidious preaching of the go-slow policy in industry. The boss does not suffer when sections of workers are induced to adopt go-slow methods because he simply recovers his loss by adding a corresponding margin to the selling price of his products which are bought by",34,Second Reading

147,Mr Kekwick,"Prio r to the susthe workers and housewives who, therefore, suffer most as the result of holdups and disturbances in industry. We shall not overcome this problem until common sense prevails in the trade unions. Moderate unionists have a duty to accept office and to attend meetings in their organizations and thus help to displace the extreme elements now in control of the affairs of their organizations. It is the duty of all clean and decent trade unionists to take an active part in the affairs of their organizations. Every citizen must co-operate in the solution of the problem of increasing the purchasing power of the Â£1. It is equally important for the boss as it is for the worker to do his share of the work that has to be done. Many bosses could spend less time on the golf courses and in their various clubs than they do to-day. However, it is imperative that every employee should realize his responsibility to the community in this matter. He must recognize the basic fact that he ancl his colleagues ultimately pay the penalty that is imposed by every industrial holdup. The Government has given a good lead in its approach to this problem. It has placed before the Parliament legislation that is designed to reduce, the cost of living. Its most important objective is to destroy communism utterly. In that work both management and labour, and the Government and Opposition parties must co-operate. The cost of living can be substantially reduced if all concerned will exercise a little common sense and be guided by a common -purpose. Various firms have made sincere attempts to encourage their employees to increase production by providing satisfactory bonuses and by instituting profit-sharing schemes. Several concerns in my electorate have been operating such schemes for some years and individual employees engaged by such firms have said to me, in effect, ""As unionists, of course, we are opposed to incentive payments and profit-sharing, tnt individually we are all for them because we are doing well out of them "". It is gratifying that some employers have given a lead in this matter. Other employers who have also realized their responsibility to the community have provided greater amenities for their employees. All supporters of the Government believe that every industry should do its utmost in that direction. Obviously, the happier workers are at their employment and the more consideration they receive from their employers the more efficient and satisfactory will be their efforts; and to that degree production will be increased, costs will be reduced and the benefit will finally be passed on to the community as a whole. With sane and moderate leadership we can solve the vexed problem of the high cost of living. It is utterly useless for honourable members opposite to indulge in cheap gibes about the Government's failure to put value back into the Â£1 when they themselves are obstructing legislation that is designed to increase production. The community generally should adopt the motto, "" A fair day's work for a fair day's pay "". By increasing the purchasing power of the Â£1 we sliall help all sections of the community, particularly those on small incomes and pensioners generally. Honourable members opposite have had a lot to say about the plight of pensioners. They can best help the pensioners by encouraging the workers to increase production. Every one agrees that, having regard to the cost of living, the present rates of pensions are hopelessly inadequate. However, honourable members opposite did not do much to alleviate the position of pensioners during the eight years governments that they supported were in oifice. I believe that some degree of relief must be given immediately to the pensioners, and I shall press strongly for immediate action to be taken in that direction. The Government has hinted that it will substantially increase present rates in respect of all classes of pensions, including age, sickness, widow, and service pensions. I know that a number of my colleagues and, perhaps, some members of the Opposition, are of opinion that an immediate interim increase of pension rates should be provided, bearing in mind .the fact that ultimately those rates will be substantially increased. However, this matter is related directly to the Government's budget proposals. There must be something in "" k it t y "" before we can take anything ont of it. must obtain the necessary authority to incur additional expenditure. plight of the aged and infirm is so serious that something should be done immediately to alleviate their position, and I sincerely trust that an announcement will be made before the present sessional period concludes that such alleviation will be effected. I have had brought to my notice many heart breaking and distressing cases in my own electorate, and I have no doubt that other honourable members have had similar experiences. It is the duty of each of us to see what we can do to give some relief immediately to the pensioners. I advocate the introduction of a con tributary national insurance scheme which would provide for the contingencies of incapacity, sickness, unemployment, and widowhood as well as social services benefits generally. Unless such a scheme is established we shall not be able to abolish the means test which all honourable members will agree offers no encouragement to the thrifty. A means test is inevitable in a non-contributory social services scheme. The sooner a contributory scheme is introduced the better will it be for the nation as a whole. I have discussed this matter with life assurance experts who have informed me that a contribution of approximately ls. a week from each individual, to be supplemented by government contribution, would be suflicient to finance such a scheme. The platform of the Liberal party provides for the implementation of a national insurance scheme and I should like to see such a scheme introduced at the earliest possible moment, for it would also enable us to remedy many of the anomalies that now exist in respect of social services benefits. In return for the the Parliament into recess. I am disguarantee of economic security upon retirement or in cases of sickness, incapacity, widowhood or unemployment, no person would object to making the small contribution of, approximately, Is. a week. Our social services have failed under existing conditions, to meet the demands of the people. Unless and until we adopt a contributory scheme we shall always have anomalies in our social services system and injustices will Government continue to be inflicted on certain sections of the community. I make a plea on behalf of the pensioners of Australia realizing as I do, and as I am sure all other honourable members do, that the pensioners are in a very serious plight. wish to make a contribution to this debate. I confess that I did not expect to witness such a humiliating spectacle as that with which I was confronted in this House on Tuesday last when the No. 1 man in Australian politics, the Prime Minister of this country, humbly asked the Opposition when it would allow the Parliament to go into recess. His eagerness to rush the Parliament into recess without first having attempted to tackle the problems that confront him clearly shows the impotency of this so called strong man in Australian politics. It is well known that a trip to the Continent is in the ofling for him. The right honourable gentleman will welcome the opportunity to mix with the upper stratum of English society. Eor the last ten years he has been looking forward to such an opportunity and he well realizes that it is a case of now or never. He is determined not to miss the opportunity. I am concerned about the plight in which the people of Australia now find themselves. I was elected by the vote of 45,000 persons in my electorate who sent me to Canberra to do a job of work. ternal Affairs( Mr Spender) appears to regard my statement as amusing. AlthoughI am willing and able to do the job entrusted to me I learn with amazement that the Government now wants to hide its impotency by rushing gusted by the right honourable gentleman's proposal to close up the Parliament for four months. No doubt it will be the subject of numerous protests from all over my electorate.

Despite the Communist menace, about which members of the Liberal party speak so glibly but know so little, every question asked by honourable members on this side of the House about Government policy on that matter is brushed aside by Ministers. They have not the time either to answer questions about it or to grapple with the many problems that confront the people. The Government wishes to cloak its impotency by rushing behind the iron curtain of recess. The time 'is rapidly approaching when the Government will no longer be able to escape the wrath of the Australian people. Gratuitous insults to the workers of Australia have been broadcast to the nation through the microphones installed on the Government benches of this Parliament night and day.

Let me digress a little. Let me analyse the efforts of the agents of the so-called Australian Country party in this House, the agents for the landed squattocracy who, down the years, have done nothing else but attack the working conditions of the people of Australia and who have resisted all the efforts of Labour to organize so as to protect the living standards of the workers. A book entitled Australia's Awakening contains the story of the early struggles of the pioneers of Australia in their attempts to form trade unions and to form the first political Labour party. I advise honourable members opposite who are the agents of the squattocracy to read that book and to forsake their petty narrow mindedness and their prating about why the workers do not work harder. In the great strike in the 1890's the squattocracy of Australia called out the mounted police to shoot down the workers who were crying in the wilderness for some assistance to organize a body to improve their living standards, which were then very low. In the 1917 strike the members of the squattocracy sent their sons from the country to scab in the Everleigh Workshops. During the greater part of World WarI . , when the manufacturers of Australia tried to tack the Taylor card system on to the workers of Australia, those great patriots the squattocracy wrapped themselves in the Union Jack and proudly declared, ""We have the divine right to all the patriotism that exists in this country. We have the divine right to assault the working conditions of the brothers and sisters of the heroes who are fighting overseas "". They sent their sons to scab, but",39,Second Reading

They sent their sons to scab on the workers who were out on strike against the proposal to introduce the vicious Taylor card system. They exploited the Barnado boys who came out from England in 1912. A public scandal was caused by the fact that those boys were prevented from attending school. They were working at milking cows at 3 o'clock in the morning and were receiving no wages. The government of the day was forced to inquire into the conditions under which those boys were living. Milking cows at 3 o'clock in the morning, working in the fields all day, and milking until 9 o'clock They are the burglars! One honourable at night that time. tralian Country party would milk a cow at any time. I have merely been quoting what is stated in the report of the commission of inquiry that was held at the time. The squattocracy still carries on the same old methods. Last night and this morning we have heard honourable members opposite urging the Government to bring hundreds of thousands of migrants to Australia, irrespective of whether homes or shelter were available for them. They wish us to revert to the conditions under which the Barnardo boys lived. They would be willing to have those immigrants living in cowsheds, or tents, or anywhere else on farms just so long as the squattocracy can exploit them and squeeze the blood ont of thera day by day.

202,Mr Failes (Lawson) [3.1],"Th egentleman's own words, milks his cows from 3 o'clock in the morning till 9 o'clock at night -Some people express opinions on matters concerning which they are i l i informed. The honourable member should know that cows are not milked that late at night. An example of how the farmer assists, rather than fights, the working people of Australia is the fact that the wheat farmer is accepting '7s. l d . sibility to his electors. He has two duties. a bushel as a home price for wheat when it is' selling overseas for from ISs. to 21s. a bushel. The selling of the farmers' wheat at the home price represents a free gift by the farmer to everybody in this country. Members of the Australian Country party have been accused in the course of debates of having their eyes only on t'heir own party interests but our party is not a sectional party. That such a view is quite wrong is proved by the fact that people whom we represent are producing wheat for the benefit of the community at a price considerably below that which can be obtained on the markets of the world. An example of how the Australian Country party is considered by the electors is the fact that in the State of New South Wales five Country party candidates will be completely unopposed at Saturday's Stato elections. They and their party have given such good service to the State of New South Wales that those five candidates are not being opposed by any other party and three other Australian Country party candidates are being opposed only by independents. Which the Australian Country party might well be proud. It is most fitting that at the opening of a parliamentary session an opportunity should be given to honourable members to discuss matters which came before the electors in policy speeches. That was done in the debate on the Address-inReply to the Speech of His Excellency the Governor General. Whilst the programme of the Government is set out at the .commencement of the session, it is very appropriate that towards the end of the session the introduction of finance bills such as those now before the House should give honourable members the opportunity of reviewing what the Government has done and of discussing the manner in which it should Mr Failes. continue its administration during the period of recess. I think it is a very wise thing for Parliament to go int!o recess. I was surprised when the Leader of tbe Opposition said very definitely that honourable members were paid to sit in this House. The occupation of a seat in this House does not by any means complete an honourable member's responOne of them is to sit in this House and represent his electorate; and the other is. to travel through his electorate in order to familiarize himself with it and learn what his electors are thinking. I can only assume that the honourable member for Watson, if he wishes to continue sitting in this House, must be very glad to keep out of his electorate. I am delighted to go back to my electorate and I travel a thousand miles a week in order to be with my constituents during the week-ends and maintain continuity of contact. It would be unreasonable to suggest that the House should sit continuously and I consider that this has been a very long and successful session. Legislative measures have been intro-duced but the introduction of legislation is not the beginning and the end of the Government's functions. There is a considerable amount of administrative work to be done which is not very obvious because it is not brought prominently 'before the people but which is part of the whole make up of executive government That is a record of as it exists in Australia to-day. The Minister for External Affairs and Minister for External Territories ( Mr Spender) has devoted himself to foreign affairs and to matters concerning external territories with studiousness and has achieved satisfactory results which will go on record. It is already on record that the Department of External Affairs is being particularly well administered. A new department, the establishment of which was promised in the policy speeches of the leaders of the Liberal and Australian Country parties, is the Department of National Development. As the representative of a country constituency I have been practically inundated with letters which express approval of the establishment of this department. People are asking in what way they can take advantage of its services to develop the countryside to national advantage. I have received a considerable number of requests for the building of new developmental roads, for the implementation of water supply schemes and for the construction of sewerpresent time. I venture to say that honorage works and water conservation projects. The implementation of some of these schemes has been commenced but their progress has been delayed by a lack of money. I know that the Minister for National Development ( Mr Casey) has organized tliis new department so that it is now almost ready to commence actual developmental activities. He announced, in reply to a question earlier in the session, that he would look to regional committees to guide him on the type of work that could be suitably performed and I know, from the number of letters I have received, how seriously those committees have taken the matter and how intent they are to cooperate with him. Honourable members have heard more than enough of communism in this House over the past few months but they have seen far too little action in regard to the petrol. What has happened? The Gomatter. The Government proposed to deal effectively and quickly with that suband no ill effects have been felt. On the ' versive element and has prepared legislation and introduced it into this chamber and another place but it has been frustrated in every attempt that it has made to implement its plans. The blame for that fact lies entirely on honourable members of the Opposition who say that they support the Government's proposal to deal with these people but who do not do anything to implement that proposal. There has been a passing mention of dollars in connection with the luxury hotel being built on Hayman Island off the Queensland coast. All honourable members know how very desirable it is to increase the supply of dollars in this country and this project is designed to attract tourists from overseas a large number of whom would have dollars to spend. Yet the very suggestion that the Treasurer should officially open that hotel which, I am sure, will be well accepted has been condemned by honourable gentlemen opposite who have said that he should not do so. members of the Opposition have given no consideration to the benefit that such an hotel offers to Australia by providing accommodation suitable to the people who are likely to be attracted to this country. It is very difficult to attract people from overseas with the accommodation that is offering at the able members of the Opposition will be glad to avail themselves of the opportunity of staying at this hotel in the pleasant warmth of the Queensland winter. Prior to the last general election the Government parties made a specific promise with regard to petrol and the Treasurer and I were accused of being un-British in advocating the cessation of petrol rationing. Such a statement was made deliberately from several platforms in my electorate and it was stated that the abolition of rationing would cause chaos in the petrol industry and all the horrors that could be imagined. The worse remark passed was that members of the Liberal and Australian Country parties were un-British because they wished to embarrass the Homeland by de-rationing vernment has removed petrol rationing contrary conditions have improved as a result of that action. Farmers have been able to obtain petrol for the many purposes for which its use is necessnry to them. Within the last few weeks the United Kingdom Government itself has removed petrol rationing and has thereby justified everything that the present Treasurer said before the elections. No pre-election promise was made by the Government parties in regard to taxation but this subject was mentioned in the Governor-iGeneral's Speech. The Government expressed the intention of reviewing the taxation system and of introducing a modified form of tax assessment. A committee ""with very wide powers was formed. It has been obtaining evidence and has made good progress in the preparation of a report when it is placed before the people. The matter of pensions has been much Honourable discussed in this House. The honourable member for Watson( Mr Curtin), who has just resumed his seat, has almost turned "" increase the pensions v into a parrot cry. The point that honourable members opposite have overlooked is that during eight years in which the previous Government had an opportunity to deal with these matters, and indeed was invited to do so, pensions were entirely overlooked by it. I do not know whether consideration of increased pension rates was overlooked deliberately or casually, but in any oase pensions were not dealt with. Now we have the spectacle of the Opposition saying continually and repeatedly, ""What are you going to do about pensions "", and "" Do something for these people who are in such dire straits"", but they completely overlook the fact that they had eight years in which to do something for the pensioners and they did nothing. In contrast to the previous Government's attitude, this Government has tried to do something for the pensioners. It has appointed a committee which has been meeting recently to consider war service pensions. Recommendations directed to the improvement of pensions have already been submitted by it to Cabinet. At, a suitable time the proposals will be announced to the House. A bill was introduced to this House a few days ago for the stabilization of tbe wool industry. I am not permitted, at this stage, to refer to it in detail, but I point out that by introducing that bill the Government has shown its keen appreciation of the part that the wool industry plays in the economy of Australia. The Government is determined that no tragic happening shall occur to the wool industry which would have repercussions throughout the whole of the country. Child endowmenthas been dealt with by this House. The. Government's intention to increase endowment by the payment of a sum for the first child was made plain before the last general election. Every attempt was made by the Government to have that promise implemented, and it is due to the Opposition alone that that child endowment legislation is not ai this moment on the statute-book. Much has been said about th? cooperation 'between labour and industrial management, but even in this House honourable members have not been able to ilr. Failes. co-operate one with another. Those who represent Labour have not co-operated with those who represent industry though, of course, we represent other sections of the community as well. If there is no co-operation at the Seat of Government, what hope is there of getting co-operation in the country generally? During the passage of the Commuuist Party Dissolution Bill through this Housei t was stated by the Opposition that the measure was intended as a direct attack on the unions. If members of the Labour party wrongly accuse the Government of making a direct attacl; on unionists, how can the Government get the support and co-operation of the people outside this Parliament; yet without such support this country cannot progress. The Liberal party has reiterated that the great ideal behind its policy is co-operation between all the people of Australia. I do not claim to represent 44,000 electors, as the previous speaker claimed to do, but I say that although I was elected by a majority of the votes of the electors in my electorate, I still represent the minority who did not vote for me. I am here to see that they also get a fair deal. I shall not have it said, without protest by me, that, by bringing down legislation to deal with the Communist party, this Government is making an attack on unionism, because it is quite apparent that such is not the case. War service land settlement was dealt with by this House early in the parliamentary session. About a fortnight ago a conference was held by the Miniswith representatives of the State governments. The problem of war service land settlement was thoroughly thrashed out, and now it is merely a matter of waiting until the State representatives make the necessary arrangements for the whole matter to be made puiblic and for land settlement to be brought into line with modern conditions. The previous scheme was upset because .of a High Court ruling, but it is hoped that the new scheme will work more satisfactorily. It has become almost a parrot cry of honourable members opposite to say to the Minister for Health( Sir Earle Page), ""What are you doing",42,Cameron Th E Lahour Is Determined And The Great Mass Of The

He w ill bring to this House a scheme whicli w ill be put into operation for the benefit of all. It is useless for the Opposition to think that we shall be disturbed by their continual parrot-like interjections. Speeches like the one made by the honourable member for ""Watson will get them nowhere.

The approach to this matter by of a magic wand. Value in our money results largely from the confidence of the people in the Government. During last week, when I spent a day or so in my electorate, I found that confidence in this Government is mounting among the people. It only remains for a satisfactory conclusion of the election campaign in New South Wales on Saturday for this Government to get really into its stride. Co-operation between tlie Country party and the Liberal party exists in this House to-day. The co-operation of the Opposition has been asked for but has been refused. The result of that lack of co-operation can be overcome by the cooperation of a New South Wales Liberal Country party Government after the next State general election. Mr O'CONNOR ( M a r t in ) [3.25] is discussing financial I cannot the purpose of which is to grant Supply the Postmaster-General( Mr House w ill be going into recess, and it is to give good telephone reasonable to believe that the recess will months. That being so, I think it is some explanation of why there should be such a long recess. The failure of the Government to offer any such explanation between this Parliament and some of the There was once a Parliament known as the "" Addled honourable members on the Government side bas been marked particularly by their failure to present any specific argument in defence of the Government. They have skirted around economic questions and skipped away from questions which have Â»ome relation to international affairs and to Australia as a member of the British Commonwealth. Those honourable gentlemen opposite who were members of the last Parliament had a lot to say about these matters, and I suggest that, as they has failed to make any constructive proare very important, some reference should have been made to them by members of the Government. Up to the present time nothing has been forthcoming. Honourable members on the Government side have attempted to place responsibility for the deplorable dollar position on the previous Government. matter would take too long to deal with at the moment, but I am concerned ahout the failure of the Government, or the responsible members of it, to give this House any information at all in relation to the dollar problem. The dollar problem, as it affects this country, is very important, and although the Government has been in office for seven months not an inkling of its intentions with regard to the matter has been given to the House. It is well known that this country is suffering from a shortage of dollars. Honourable members now on the Government side were not reluctant, in the last Parliament, to criticize the Chifley Government because of this shortage; but we have waited in vain for any proposal on the part of the Government to apply a solution of this problem. What plans has the Government made to cope with the dollar problem and when will it be possible for those plans to become operative? The silence of the Government on this question leads us to believe that it has no solution in mind and that the dollar handicap from which the nation is suffering will continue to hamper our economy. In previous speeches I have suggested various methods of approaching the problem, but the steadfast reserve of the Government suggests that the problem has got completely beyond its control. During this debate Government supporters have proposed no means Ifr. O'Connor. of alleviating the shortage and, in fact, have scarcely mentioned the subject. Another serious omission by Government supporters has been their failure to make any reference to Empire relations. When they were in Opposition, one of their best talking points was their frequent criticism of the Chifley Government for its alleged weakening of the bonds of Empire. Yet throughout its seven months of oflice this Government posals for the strengthening of the British Commonwealth of Nations or for the solution of the problems that confront the Mother Country. Thc Chifley Government, on the contrary, contributed greatly to the stabilization of Great Britain's economy. Every honourable member must be aware that Great That Britain absorbs between 60 and 70 per cent, of Australia's exports. Therefore, aid for Britain is not merely a matter of patriotism; it is also a matter of good business. From a national point of view, it is necessary for us to help to stabilize the British economy and strengthen the bonds of the British Commonwealth of Nations. This Government has fallen down on its job badly as it has not made any noticeable contribution to the cause of British recovery, even though many of its supporters repeatedly criticized thc Chifley Government on the ground that it had not done enough to help the deserving people of Great Britain. The truth is that the Labour Government's efforts contributed in a very large measure to the restoration of British economic stability. The monetary gifts that Australia made to the United Kingdom under the Chifley Administration were of tremendous help to the Mother Country. The re-establishment of prosperity in Great Britain is related also to the dollar shortage. The Minister for External Affairs( Mr Spender) recently suggested that the Chifley Government had aggravated the dollar situation in Australia by depreciating the currency. He failed to point out that the Chifley Government did not act on its own initiative. It depreciated the currency only after the United Kingdom Government and the governments of nineteen other nations had depreciated their currencies in relation to the dollar. That course of action was forced upon the British Government as the result of the depleted state of its reserves. The action of the Chifley Government was an outstanding contribution towards the stemming of the drain upon the financial resources of the TJnited Kingdom. The charge that was made against the Chifley Administration by the Minister for External Affairs was grossly misleading and untrue. The efforts of the Chifley Government contributed very substantially to Great Britain's recovery, and they are in startling contrast with the "" come day go day "" attitude of the present Government. parties lost no opportunities during the general election campaign last December to tell the people that Australia's relations with otlier members of the British Commonwealth would be impaired if the Chifley Government were returned to oflice. Nevertheless, although they have been in office now for seven montbs, they have done nothing to assist British recovery. The United Kingdom was assisted to turn the corner as the result of the gifts that were made to it by the Australian Labour Government. I was amazed to hear a member of the Australian Country party state in this House yesterday that Great Britain would be helped if Australia reduced its sterling balances in London. That, honourable gentleman and -his colleagues might be interested to learn that the Chifley Government made monetary gifts to Great Britain at the request of the British Government. Before taking any action, it consulted the United Kingdom Government and asked what form of assistance from Australia would be most useful to it. The British Government asked for gifts of money. Therefore, the Lahour Government made available to it sums totalling no less than Â£45,000,000. fies for a pension as soon as he reaches The effect of those gifts was two-fold. Eirst, British debts amounting to Â£45,000,000 in Australia were cancelled. Secondly, Great Britain did not have to ship goods to Australia in order to discharge those commitments. goods of that value were released for diswill regard it in a serious light. I posal in the dollar area and thus were used to reduce the Empire dollar deficit. T have no doubt that, if the honourable member who suggested the unusual course of action of reducing Australia's sterling funds in Great Britain were to consult his party leaders, he would learn that there are very good reasons why those sterling reserves are not being used. Certain anomalies in the social services scheme require the urgent attention"" of the Treasurer ( Mr Fadden). I do not expect the right honourable gentleman to take immediate action, but I presume that he will be preparing his budget in the near future and I hope that he will then give earnest consideration to my representations. First, I refer to the Members of the Government situation of certain superannuated railway workers in New South Wales. This matter was mentioned recently by the honourable member for Banks( Mr Costa). About 15,000 former railway workers are receiving superannuation payment from the New South Wales Government. That Government recently increased the rate of those payments by 25 per cent., but the Commonwealth Department of Social Services immediately informed recipients that their social services entitlements would be reduced 'by corresponding amounts. In other words, the benefit of the New South Wales Government's gesture was promptly cancelled by the Commonwealth. I hope that the Treasurer will consider the case of these men sympathetically and agree to rescind the Commonwealth decision. That, of course, will involve an adjustment of the means test, but such -un adjustment would be well justified. T also ask the right honourable gentleman to relax the application of the means test to parents of invalids under the age of 2.1 years. At present, the means test is applied to the parents of such invalids with the result that they often suffer considerable hardships. An invalid qualithe age of 21 years, but the parents have to provide for the support of an invalid minor if they have a joint income of approximately Â£9 a week. That injustice is causing a. great deal of unnecessary Instead, suffering, and I hope that the Treasurer have raised these matters because I know that, unless they are considered by the Treasurer when he is framing his budget, it will be almost impossible for us to have anything done about them until another year has passed. T. join with other honourable members who have already pleaded the case of invalid and age pensioners. The plight of these citizens is serious, and any careful thought of their situation must arouse compassion. It is well known that 65 per cent, of the people who receive invalid and age pensions have no other sources of income. Fifteen pei' cent, of them have negligible incomes. Thus, SO per cent, of our pensioners are totally dependent upon those social services. An analysis of their difficulties at this stage tee to review ex-servicemen's pensions, would not be out of place. If we allow approximately 15s. a week as the standard outlay for the rent of rooms or other accommodation, we realize that the average pensioner has only 27s. 6d. left in each fortnightly period. After having paid his rent, he is expected to .live on the princely sum of less than 2s. .a day. Therefore, in view of the rapid increase of the cost of living, I ask the Treasurer to give sympathetic consideration immediately to the plight of those persons, and to make provision for them in the next budget. It is apparent, from reports, that the Government intends to increase ex-servicemen's pensions. it upon that decision, ancl I believe that the Parliament will support any proposal for the increase of pensions generally. However, I should like to direct attention to the attitude which the Government has adopted in reviewing ex-servicemen's pensions, because it appears to me that it is trying to make political capital out of the position. Honourable members will recall that the Chifley Government appointed an all-party committee, all the members of which were ex-servicemen, to examine representations for increases of servicemen's pensions from time to time. The present Government has apparently abandoned that idea without consulting the Opposition about its decision to do so. The Government, if I judge correctly from press reports, has appointed a committee which consists of its own supporters to review ex-servicemen's pensions. Of course, it was not compelled to confer with the Opposition on such a matter, but the ordinary forms of courtesy required that it should ilfr. O'Connor. have conveyed its intentions to the House. The Opposition has been treated almost with contempt. I am not authorized to refer to the attitude that the Labour party would have adopted in response to a request by the Government to nominate members for appointment to a.n all-party committee to consider ex-servicemen's pensions, but I voice my criticism of the contemptuous attitude that the Government has displayed relative to this matter. The Menzies Government appears to have discarded the idea of appointing an all-party commitand the only explanation that I can imagine for that decision is that the Government finds that it is able to increase pensions as a result of the successful administration of the Chifley Government. The Government proposes to bask in the glory of that decision and to capitalize the position for political purposes. I shall now summarize my remarks[ have referred to the fact that the Parliament, if it continues as at present, will be known in history as the first "" Addled Parliament "" of the Commonwealth. It is indeed interesting, and rather intriguing at times, to listen to I congratulate the attempts by Government supporters to defend their pre-election promises. They either attempt to run away from the charge that they told the people that if they were elected t.o office, they would put value back into the Â£1, or they try to break that promise dow.n. I find it significant that some of them go to the other extreme, and deny that such a promise was made. Their denials are absurd, and T leave it to the people to judge whether that promise was made by members of the Liberal party and the Australian Country party. I also referred to the Commonwealth's dollar deficits. That problem is most important and', in view of its effect upon the Australian economy, T imagined thai the Treasurer would make a statement upon it. The silence of the right honourable gentleman on the subject is all too significant. The Government either is incompetent, or has no policy for dealing with the problem, and we may confidently expect that the dollar position will continue to deteriorate. I also mentioned the strange silence, and, in fact, the failure of the Government to improve Empire relations, or to strengthen the British Commonwealth of Nations. I recall that honorahle gentleiuen opposite capitalized that matter very formidably, not only in the last Parliament, but also during the last general election campaign. The Prime Minister has expressed the hope that the House will conclude its business by tomorrow, and the failure of the Government even to mention whether it has plans for strengthening Empire relations deserves strong criticism. Finally, .1 hope that the Treasurer will make provision in his budget to increase all social services. I am glad to have the opportunity that is afforded by this debate to refer to a matter which, I think, may some time become of tremendous importance to this country, and that is the production of oil from shale. I am personally interested in that problem, because on the north-western edge of the electorate of Paterson, which I have the honour to represent, lies a tremendous field of rich oil-bearing shale at Baerami. The resources of that field are variously estimated at between 10,000,000 tons ancl 12,000,000 tons. The latter figure was checked by Professor Cotton, who is the Professor of Geology at the University of Sydney. He surveyed the field in conjunction with Messrs. Julius, Poole and Gibson, consulting engineers of Sydney, and the assay showed approximately 58 to 60 gallons of crude oil per ton of shale. In the Mulholland report, which was produced by the New South Wales Department of Mines, the figure was put down at 10,600,000 tons for that part of the deposit which had been explored. Those figures reveal that there is a tremendous field for development. Unfortunately, the Commonwealth's undertaking for extracting oil from shale at Glen Davis continues to be used as the yardstick against which all such proposals should be measured. We know from the Auditor-General's report that the Glen Davis proposition is not by any means economical. If we are to continue to use the comparison with Glen Davis, it seems to me that there are poor prospects of developing the Baerami shale field, unless it is done during a national emergency, such as confronted us a few years ago. The Government of the United States of America on that occasion sent to this country a mission which was headed by Mr Jacomini, to investigate the possibilities of developing the extraction of oil from Baerami shale, and it was prepared to make a considerable quantity of equipment available under lend-lease for that purpose. Therefore I consider that it -is necessary, for the purposes of illustration, to refer to the Glen Davis project. At the present time, the Government considers that it is wise to continue production of oil from shale at Glen Davis, even though the process is uneconomic, because of the ease with which Australia may be cut off from its overseas sources of liquid fuel. We may reasonably put that uneconomic figure down to the requirements of national security, provided we are sure that the uneconomic basis upon which Glen Davis is operating is the best basis possible on which that industry can function. The Auditor General has compiled a list of the losses that have been made by the Glen Davis project for some years. It is as follows:YearÂ£ 1943 .. .. 296,981 1944 .. 303,788 1945 .. .. 342,055 1946 .. 401,830 1947 .. .. 425,100 The total loss for a period of five years is approximately Â£1,750,000. As I have said, we need the assurance that such a Result is the best that can be produced at Glen Davis. There are two causes of the operative losses at that project. The first of them is the fact that insufficient shale is being mined to keep the plant operating at full capacity. The second is the inefficient retorting of that shale, the retorting being the basic process for the extraction of oil from the shale. Despite the disclaimer which the Minister for Fuel, Shipping and Transport (Senator McLeay) made recently in answer to questions, ample evidence is available to show that, if inefficient retorting is not the major cause of the loss at Glen Davis, it is still a very real cause of",45,Cameron Th E Lahour Is Determined And The Great Mass Of The

The results of that test apparently persuaded the Public Works Committee to report, in 1945, as follows :In the light of the latest evidence obtained Davis and shortly to be given a run of suffiUie Committee is still of opinion that the installation of the Kenco retort offers the best promise of improved results in the future, and it is urged that the work of installing und operating tliat retort in a thorough test sliould be completed without further delay. I should like to inform honourable members also of the opinion that was expressed by Mr A. K. Butler, who is now general manager of the BrokenH ill Proprietary Company Limited's steelworks and also a director of National Oil Proprietary Limited, in evidence that he gave before that Public Works Committee. He saidI have seen the Jacomini retort in operation. that the then Prime Minister gave, no 1 am definitely of the opinion that it should be tested under actual working conditions at Glen Davis-for I consider that from a chemical engineering point of view his method of heating is well nigh perfect. I was astonished as well as pleased at the rate at whicli the sliale went into the retort and was discharged from it seemingly properly carbonized. Subsequent reports from Julius, Poole and Gibson, who acted as consultants on behalf of Mr to extend over a period of three months. Moate and Standard Oil of Australia, showed that up to a given tonnage thc plant was most efficient, and the output surprisingly good. When I became a director of National Oil Pty. L t d . one of my first steps was to try to persuade Sir George Davis to buy that retort. That is the opinion of a competent engineer upon the Renco retort. The retort was impressed by the Australian Government under National Security Regulations and transferred to Glen Davis in June, 1943. The managing director of National Oil Proprietary Limited, Mr about which I offer no opinion. I simply L. J. Griffiths, when giving evidence before the Public Works Committee, in 1945, saidWc have impressed the Renco retort which was tried out in Newcastle some years ago, and have taken steps to design and build a pilot Renco retorting plant at Glen Davis. Later he saidWe will not have the Renco in operation but in view of past experience in this before thc end of this year. That seems to indicate that National ducted under conditions that will allow Oil Proprietary Limited intended to take of no further room for doubt about its some action in the matter, and in this efficiency. My interest in the subject respect the following assurance was given arises from my interest in the developby the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr ment of the Baerami field which, on Chifley), when he was Prime Minister, economic grounds, will not in ordinary in the course of a speech that he made in this House:An advance on existing processes will be achieved, it is hoped, from the Renco retort, an American installation erected at Glen cient size to enable its qualities to be gauged. Thus, from the records it will be seen that there was no dearth of optimism in the minds of people who were well qualified to give an opinion upon the retort. However, despite the apparent success of the tests that were made on the retort under the supervision of competent experts, the recommendations of two Public Works Committees, the impressment by the Government of the retort in 1943, the assurance of action on the part of National Oil Proprietary Limited and the assurance move was made to have the retort tested under government supervision until January of this year. In that month the Minister for Fuel, Shipping and Transport (Senator McLeay) announced that the Government would place the Renco retort at Glen Davis under a trial Therefore, the Chifley Government must bear a good deal of responsibility for the failure to test this equipment, which, had it been found successful, would have increased production of shale oil at Glen Davis, and thus had some relation to national security in the development of a domestic source of shale oil. An impartial review of all the circumstances discloses a reluctance amounting almost to unwillingness, to test the Renco retort for reasons that are not apparent and say that the facts are clear, and they speak for themselves.

208,Mr Fairhall,"He has returned tocircumstances be developed in the foreseeable future. However, I believe that I am justified in saying that the prospects of developing that field will be dictated by the success or failure of the proposed test of the Renco retort. That is the importance of the matter so far as I am concerned. In April, I addressed a series of queshave adduced, I urge the Government tions to the Minister for Fuel, Shipping and Transport in which I made certain suggestions relating to the conduct of the proposed test. I suggested that the equipment should be erected by a person who has had extensive experience in the operation of plant of this kind and preferably by one who has no association with the management of National Oil Proprietary Limited. assured when the Minister simply replied that the pilot Renco retort was to be tested and that the test would be conducted over a period and under conditions which it was hoped would enable its efficiency, or otherwise, to be accurately determined. I am not satisfied with that reply. If the Government is not going to put this equipment under a test that will finally resolve all doubt about its efficiency, it is useless to conduct any test at all, because time and money will thus be wasted, as the results will be inconclusive. One Public Works Committee has already reported that it was loath to recommend an expenditure of Â£300,000 upon the installation of the Renco retort. If further tests are to be inconclusive, no future committee would recommend expenditure on such work, having regard to the fact that over Â£4,000,000 has already been expended on the undertaking at Glen Davis. However, as the Government impressed the retort it has a responsibility to those interests who financed the development of the retort and also to the people generally to satisfy itself beyond all doubt on the matter. It can only do so by ensuring that the retort shall be adequately tested. In the questions that I addressed to the Minister for Fuel, Shipping and Transport I also suggested that the Government should engage the services of an independent competent consulting engineer to supervise any test that is undertaken. However, the reply Sir. Fairhall. furnished to me on that matter was also unsatisfactory. It was as follows:The Government is satisfied tliat the supervision required for the testing of the retort can be supplied by the technical oflicers attached to National Oil Pty. L t d . Therefore, the present position in respect of this matter is totally unsatisfactory. In the light of facts that I to reconsider arranging for an independent consulting engineer to supervise the test now proposed. These facts make it clear that there have been continuous and mounting losses at Glen Davis, and all reports have confirmed that the method of retorting is a major cause of those losses. I have given sufficient evidence to show that the Renco retort Therefore, I was hardly holds out hope for increased efficiency. Although the retort has been in the hands of the Government for seven years, the Government has not made any move to test it. If the proposed test should prove satisfactory, the members of the Chifley Government and the technical advisers to National Oil Proprietary Limited will be confronted with some awkward questions as to why the retort wa's not tested earlier. I do not cast any aspersion upon the technical officers of National Oil Proprietary Limited. I do not know any of them personally, and I am not qualified to speak about their work. But the plain fact is that their technical judgment with respect to the retorting of shale can be vindicated only by the failure of a test which they, themselves, are to conduct. If room is left for doubt about the conditions under which the test is to be conducted, and if the results should prove to be inconclusive, doubt must inevitably arise that the test was not faithfully carried out. The Government must resolve that doubt. It must do so in the interests of its own shale oil undertaking and also in the interests of national security as well as of the technicians of National Oil Proprietary Limited, who should not be exposed to the risks involved in the situation that I have indicated.

The second difficult and devastating problem of inflamatter that I have in mind is the failure tion.

We must attack it on blame. It was all very well for supbroad non-party political lines. Honorporters of the present Government to able members opposite trot out the story, make promises on the hustings, but as almost as old as the country itself, that tbe future, and, indeed, the fabric, of it has resulted from the laziness of the our economy is at stake, surely we should workers and the failure to l if t producexpect the Government to take a broad tion. rather than a party political outlook on this matter.

209,Mr Haylen (Parkes) [4.13],"I takethat result from the inflationary spiral in that country if increased production is the answer to all our ills? American production is sufficient to finance the extension of Marshall aid to every country that desires it, yet 4,500,000 of its people are unemployed. To descend to such a level of misunderstanding as to conclude that the worker is always to blame because there is not much value in the Â£1, or because tliere is too much money and not sufficient goods in the country, is absurd. Although economists differ on these matters they come to the one general conclusion that these are not the problems at all. Intelligent men in industry who had the co-operation of the workers during the war have gone on record to prove that that is not so. At a recent meeting of the School of Business Executives, held at Geelong, which, I understand, was attended by the Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Holt), Mr D. E. Callinan, general manager of the Russell Manufacturing Company, rebuked those people who blame the worker for the loss of production and say that thc worker is always the "" nigger in the woodpile"" during periods of national difficulty. I liave never met Mr Callinan but I admire him because he is decent to his workers and is concerned about the future of this country. Listen to what he had to say to the assembly of "" big shots "" about tliose who say what terrible people the workers are because they reduce production. Like a dash of cold water came from Mr vernment, the latest statistics relating Callinan this chilling commentManagement must not pass the buck to workers, asking them to do more and more with outmoded equipment. value cannot he judged by output alone-his skill and knowledge must he considered. The idea that the worker must do more to produce, more is a fallacy-ther e is a job to be done by management. I submit that in many instances management bas not done its job. In relation to that we have only to look at the tremendous number of small factories ancl undertakings that have grown up in Sydney-backyard factories or little better than that,-which are geared to I have further faets relating to the more produce from the labour of a few workers dismal days when real disaster came and a Â£2,000 motor car for the proprietor, the Ohifley Government was swept from a high standard of living for his family offiee because of its alleged failure to Mr Haylen. and perhaps a little week-ender at Palm Beach. Yet the equipment in those places, in which men are working to l if t production, is most primitive. We know the reason why that is so. No sensible man in business wants out-worn machinery and equipment, but because of dollar difficulties, and for other reasons, many of them are forced to carry on with it. The point I reiterate is that it conies badly from the Government always to refer to any lack of production in such terms that the impression is given that the worker has given the place away. I point out that such is not-the case because several members of the Australian Country party have referred particularly to it. The lionorable member for New England( Mr Drummond), who had a long experience in the Parliament of New South Wales and who has been a decoration of the northern part of the State in the political sense for many years, referring to employment in rural industries, said that the number employed in.those industries is now 60,000 fewer than it was some years ago. I am sure that hi3 statistics are out of date, though I have no doubt that the figures he used were the latest available to him. Listen to the productive record of those men who are said to be dragging Australia down, who will not work and are not pulling their weight. I propose to cite from the publication Fact, issued by the Goto employment. Mark that it is dated 1949, because that serves to reply to one reference that has been made by the Australian Country party to the "" dismal The employees days of Chifleyism"". This is what occurred in those allegedly dismal days:Employment: Wage and salary earners at work in Australia at the end of i.949 totalled 2,407,000 persons, an increase during the year of 80,300. Rural workers and females in private domestic service and defence personnel are excluded from these totals. The Commonwealth Employment Service reported vacancies for 101,394 workers at the end of 1949. On December 23, 1949, only 705 persons were receiving unemployment benefit. improve conditions in the country. How wrong the Conntry party is here is quickly seen. At midnight last night I.went into the vaults of the National Library and consulted tlie last available record of the financial activities of the Chifley Governinent prior to the general election, which was dated thu 7th .December, 1949. 1 quote the following headings from the Sydney Morning Herald of that date:Shares prioes up: Buoyant market. Taubmans Div. agu 174 p Â«Kauri Timber profits jump. Increase of Â£74,095. Melbourne Cement: Asbestos Cov pav 83 A p c. I could not believe that, and I read it three times. I continue with the head ingsWater Board Loan oversubscribed. Bank of A'asia announces net profit Â£280,000 -8,00 0 more than last year. That is the record of the prosperity that existed when the Chifley Government was allegedly taking the people by the throats and squeezing everything out of them. How do members of the Australian Country party think the people of the country feel about these constant cries of misery that the country is done, the wheel of the waggon is broken, and "" It ain't gonna rain no more"" ? Let us consider how the prodnotion of milk has increased. The production of milk for all purposes in 1949 totalled 1,250,253,000 gallons, which was 6S,770,000 gallons more than the total for 194S. What a way to go out backwards! What a tremendous disaster to the country! Yet members of the Australian Country party have said that the dairy-farmers have sold their stock and thnt all that can be seen are ruined homesteads. The gate is broken down, the shed is locked! Let us consider how flip production of butter has increased. In 1949 Australia produced 168,756 tons of factory butter compared with 158,589 tons in 194S, and with 60,000 fewer employees. What a lot of valiant heroes those rural workers are who work on what I have always considered to be a minimum award! To press the matter home, let ns deal with cheese. Although it may be hard cheddar for the Governinent it is good propaganda for us. In 1949 the production of factory cheese was 45,152 tonsa record for any calendar year. Production in 194S was 41,826 tons. Then we have had the dismal cry that we cannot get coal and so cannot put value back into the Â£ 1 . The reason is that honourable members opposite stupidly allowed themselves to be sold a propaganda lie. Now they have the responsibility of government they are wriggling and squirming iu their seats. They are tryin g to find a counter, and because it eludes them the poor old miner is maligned. If honourable members opposite study the statistics they w ill find that the miners have done a very much better job than has the present Government. The production of 15,000,000 tons of coal in the year ended the 30th June, 1949, was higher than that of any previous financial or calendar year in the history of the country, yet honourable memibers opposite dare to say that the worker must pull his weight. Why not examine the statistics of 1950? The figures that I have cited were furnished iby the Government itself. 3 received them in the post only this morning. In that bleak year of 1949 when the then Government was dismissed for its alleged misdeeds, the Australian population increased by a record number of 250,000 persons to a total of 8,000,000. How thoroughly wrong on almost every subject are the gloom-chasers opposite. We find none other than the honourable member for Mackellar ( Mr Wentworth) writing in 1944 with crepe round his head and ice on his foreheadAs things stand, the growth of Australian population is coming to a standstill and we may never reach as high as 8,000,000 before the decline sets in. During the r6gime of the honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell) as Ministerf or Immigration the population of the country exceeded 8,000,000. The statistical calculation of the honourable member for Mackellar has proved to be merely a figment of his imagination. These half-baked ""cheesy"" statistics show lack of f a it h in one's country. The trouble with the Government is that it has acquired such a grand inheritance fro m its predecessor that it is suffering from financial indigestion and does not know where to turn because the task has already been so Under a capitalist economy inflation ends well done for it. The economists on both in a depression.

211,Mr Haylen,"This appeal for inof their own creation, which will eventhink that the cunning of the Treasurer has something to do with the attitude of the Minister for Healthi n this matter. They believe that the half of the Â£30,000,000 that is available for a national health service is to be devoted by the Government to the payment of endowment for the first child and w ill be one of the little cross-entries in the Treasurer's little black book. I cannot continue the hunt-in that direction, however, not because of the lack of game, but because I have not sufficient time to direct the attention of the. House to the shortcomings of the Treasurer. I shall confine my remarks at the moment to the Ministerf or Health and his patch work, hotch-potch : voluntary scheme under which people, if they wish to be well, may pay 3s. a week or join a friendly society, or take out a policy with an insurance company. like the old panel scheme in Britain. There are many good lodge doctors but the fact remains that the lodge patient obtains only second-class medical treatment. He always feels that he is not a first-class patient as f a r as the doctor is concerned. That is a matter of psychology. The statute-book contains legislation for the provision of free medicine to the people, but instead of receiving the benefit of that legislation tbe people arc now confronted with this patch-work and ahnost fraudulent scheme under whicli they are to be asked to pay again for something for which an amount of Â£30,000,000 is already available and would enable them to have it free. The last comment that I make on tions of that body. Isi t that he dislikes that matter is this: Surely no man, no the International Refugee Organization, matter how exalted or lowly his position which is the special agency that is bringmay be, can witness unmoved the suffering immigrants to this country and so ings of the poor in the bitterness of is assisting us to develop our nation? Is winter. I refer particularly to the old it that he dislikes the Food and Agriculpeople in the community. These benefitture Organization which has fed million -! were promised to them, but have not been of starving people in Europe and Asia? given to them. The legislation that proIsi t that he dilsikes the United Nations vides for these ben fits to be given to the Children's Fund which has saved the people is already on the statute-book, but lives of at least 70,000,000 children in the Minister is looking for some other Europe and Asia? scheme while the people who require thc benefits are passed by in a most callou? of the House must get some concept manner. The Government stands indicted regarding its propaganda about putting value into the Â£1. In that respect it has played polities in a way that will result in its ultimate destruction. The Minister for Health stands indicted because of his stupidity, his lack of cohesion and bis absenteeism in relation to one of the great needs for which this country is clamouringa standard, watertight, well-based national health scheme. The final point that I desire to make is in relation to the Minister for External Affairs( Mr Spender) and the statement that he made recently regarding the United Nations. The Minister is inexperienced in his new position. I do not know whether he has ever been to Lake Success. It is his difficulty and his disability that he has succeeded as Miuister for External Affairs the former President of the General Assembly of the This scheme is something United Nations( D r . E v a t t ) , but his inexperience does not warrant the attack upon the institutions of the United Nations that he made in this House recently. Are we to jeopardize peace in this nation because of this man's spleen against the United Nations? If he disagrees with the work of the agencies of the United Nations as a means to maintain world peace w ill he give us the other formula for peace? The alternatives before us are: the United Nations or the atom bomb. That is abundantly clear, yet we have heard the United Nations and its agencies damned with faint praise by the Minister. He is inexperienced in these matters, and has not. himself visited the United Nations and had first-hand experience of the vast funcHonorable members on both side of which side we shall support in the world battle. of the Government subscribe to what the Minister for External Affairs has, in effect, said, then they are not for the United Nations. If they are not fov the TJnited Nations then they are for plans for peace that come from outside the United Nations. Those plans include Soviet Eussia's plan for peace. Remember that this whole regearing of the foreign policy of this country is dangerous. There is nothing wrong with a new government restating a policy, bu* it has been traditional in Britain, which is our model in so many of these matters, that foreign policy is continuous and does not change with changes of the government. The Minister for External Affairs has gone out of his way to gibe at the United Nations. Although Australia has subscribed generously to all the United Nations' projects, and particularly to its special agencies, it is the special agencies that were selected by the Minister for a particular attack. Those agencies are such as, in present world conditions, would have to exist even without the machinery for world peace that is provided in the Security Council and the General Assembly of the United Nations. It does this country of 8,000,000 people, with a valiant democratic record, very little honour in the eyes of the world for its Minister for External Affairs to be belittling the United Nations, which has 59 member nations. I have noticed also that administration comes largely into this matter and that the whole of the tone of the foreign affairs despatches has been altered to include sinister, insulting, references to the activities of the United Nations. Coining nearer to home we have a victim of this administration in Dr. John Burton, who is on leave at the moment simply, in my opinion, because he is being victimized for his political convictions. During the war and since I have been able to observe that Dr. Burton was a most hard working and conscientious member of the Public 'Service. Suddenly he has been sent on leave without pay. Could any one say that that was a fitting tribute to pay to a good public servant? Perhaps the Minister may know nothing about these things, as he has said in his short statement. Perhaps it is the adminllr. Haylen. If the members istration of the Public Service Board itself that is at fault. If this man's crime be that he happens to be a supporter of the Labour party-and I am sure that that is his only crime-the n why does not the Minister admit it? Has the fact that a high officer of the Commonwealth Public Service Board has a brother in South Australia who is the head of the Libera] party organization there, anything to do with the matter? The Government should remember that the time will come when the present position will be reversed. If it considers that its members can permit such things to happen because it has won the general election, it should not forget that some day we, and not tliey, will be tbe winners. It is as-eriousthing when high public servants are the victims of politics. The Government is mouthing the highest principles of democracy in connection with bills HOAV before the Parliament but is engaging in actions that are anything but democratic. I shall now summarize what I have said in relation to the three points that I rose to speak on. If I were to highlight one of those points it would be that of puiblic health and the callous and indifferent way in which it has been treated. When the Chifley Government was in oflice the Cabinet consisted of nineteen members and those nineteen were always present in the House at question time to answer any questions that were put to them, unless there were very special reasons for the absence of any of them. That is not now the case. are half a dozen Ministers in the Senate. are members of this House are absent half the time. They are away doing other jobs and an honourable member who wishes to ask a question does not know whom to ask. When we ask a question of a Minister who is representing an absent Minister we always get the statement, "" I do not know, but I shall see what can be done about it "" . That brings me to the absentee Minister for Health. I agree that he must have conferences with doctors about bringing a health scheme into operation. But we should have in this House more Ministers who are able to tell us, the representatives of the people of Australia, what is going",57,Cameron Th E Lahour Is Determined And The Great Mass Of The

213,Sarcastic Mr Haylen,"The Ministers whoon. Uut not one line have we had from the right honourable gentleman concerning his proposed national health scheme, upon which depend the health and well-being of the people of this country. His attention has been directed to our lack of information about the scheme, time and time again, but he just laughs the matter off. To-day the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward) asked six questions about him. aide member's time has expired. a debate of this kind it is only natural that some wild and irresponsible statements should be made. I should like to confine my remarks to the measures before the House. Some rather startling statements that have been made should be corrected as far as possible. One of the outstanding features of the debate has been that the most responsible persons on the other side of the House who have had experience in handling the financial affairs of this country, have admitted that the job of putting value back into the Â£1 is a tremendous task which is difficult, heart-breaking and complex. Since honourable members opposite have that realization of the immensity of the task it seems to me that instead of continually criticizing the Government their duty is to assist it in every possible way. After all, they are elected representatives of the people, and I consider that if they assume their responsibilities in the way in which I have to assume mine it behoves them in the interests of the people generally to give proper consideration, to the problems that confront this Parliament. It must be admitted that in seeking a solution of the problem of the depreciated value of our currency it is necessary to find first the reasons for its existence. There are many reasons why value has gone from the Â£1. It has been agreed on all sides of the House that the Â£1 has been greatly depreciated since 1939 and 1940. The fact that the Â£1 is worth to-day in the vicinity of only 10s. is not due to one cause alone. It is not due to the fact that we have a Liberal-Australian Country party Government, but it is due to an accumulation of circumstances over the years. 1 venture to affirm, in spite of what the honourable member for Parkes( Mr Haylen) has said about misleading the people at the general election, that no right-thinking person in Australia considers that any government could put value back into the Â£1 in the short space of six months when it had been steadily depreciating for a period of ten years. That statement cannot be contradicted by even the most astute financial experts on the Opposition side of the House. Lack of materials, decreased production, -In shorter working hours, higher w-age9, high taxation, increased cost of government administration, industrial disputes, unnecessary and unauthorized hold-ups, reckless spending and withdrawal of subsidies-al l of these are factors which have taken value out of the Â£1. It would be possible to rectify some of these matters in order to put value back into the Â£1. Let us not try to mislead the people. If honourable members of the Opposition occupied the government benches now they would not be able to put value back into the Â£1 any more quickly than this Government can do so. Let us tell the people that this House will do everything that it ciin to put value back into the Â£1, but that because of some of the circumstances I have mentioned it is impossible to restore to the Â£1 its entire previous value. Because of arbitration court decisions the people now have shorter working hours and higher wages. I have no complaint to make about that because every one in Australia is entitled to the best conditions of living and working and the greatest possible number of hours of leisure so long as the economy of the country is not seriously affected thereby. Because of tlie evidence that has been given before the arbitration courts it is natural to assume that they have considered those matters in their true perspective. Shorter working hours and higher wages must at least be given a trial, so it is impossible to put value back into the Â£1 by altering those conditions. There is no doubt bhat because of decreased working hours and increased wages it is not possible to produce goods at the cost at which they have been produced in the past and therefore their prices have risen. The cost of living also has increased because of the",59,Cameron Th E Lahour Is Determined And The Great Mass Of The
214,Mr Speaker,Order! The honor,60,Cameron Th E Lahour Is Determined And The Great Mass Of The
215,Mr Handby (Kingston) [4.42],"rise of the cost of services such as transport. considerably. expenses of the railways were Â£36,380,000. In 1948 the cost was Â£84,888,000. The working expenses of electric tramways in 1940 amounted to Â£6,000,000; in 1948 they had risen to Â£11,000,000. Thesei n creases are due to a set of circumstances over which no government has any control, but the ordinary individual has to bear the brunt of them. Therefore thc. value of the Â£1 is being constantly decreased. Although honourable members of the Opposition generally havo said that they have every sympathy with the Oovernment in its task of trying to put value back into the Â£1 because it is so difficult and complex, one of them has said that it is not the Opposition's task to co-operate with, or to support, tbe Government in matters that are of vital interest to the people of Australia. He has claimed that the task of the Opposition is to criticize. That is a most unusual way of accepting responsibility as a representative of the people of Australia. If value is to be put back into the Â£ 1 the possibilities of in creasing production must be considered with a view to keeping the cost of goods at ;i reasonable figure. It is true that the Government favours a system of incentive payments. One honourable member of the Opposition asked what the Government, had done about incentive payments. think that those honourable members opposite who have done much intelligent work in the trade union movement know that a government cannot lay clown any policy in respect of a system of profitwould make it possible to increase sharing or incentive payments. Such a system must be worked out by the employer and the. employee to their mutual benefit. A. government could not do more than say that it really supported such a plan, that the plan had its blessing and tliat it would assist in every way possible. that system to increase the rate of work and then take the incentive payments away. been said, but there has been proof time after time in some of the industrial concerns that I know of that the incentive payment system is not instituted for the purpose of making a worker do more. Transport expenses have risen I had a discussion yesterday with an in In 1940 the working dustrialist in Adelaide who recently introduced a system of incentive payments. I asked him how his incentive payment system worked. He told me that the men themselves would have nothing but an incentive system and that as a result of its use in his last year of trading Â£9,000 was to be divided among 200 employees. He assured me that his men were quite happy with the arrangements that were operating. Increased production can be obtained by giving the employee due recognition for it . Taxation has been a factor in taking value out of the Â£ 1 . No government could possibly carry on without sufficient taxation to cover the expenses of administration, but there is a point at which it is possible so to l i m it expenses that taxation may be reduced. Although the Government has not been able to make any pronouncement it has had analyses made of the various methods by which savings may be effected in government administration and some of them w ill be introduced. Of course, practical results cannot be achieved in that way at a moment's notice. It wil l take time to put value back into the Â£ ' , just as it took time to take it out. It is necessary for the Government to give some indication of how I it intends to put value back into the Â£ 1 , and I suggest that, because of the shortage of materials, Australia may have to purchase.capital equipment and machinery from England, the use of which output and lessen production costs. Australia has a large credit in England, and I believe that it should be applied to meeting the cost of purchasing equipment which can be made available to farmers and graziers for the purpose of increasing their production. There are many other ways in which value could be put back into the Â£ 1 . Eventually, the Government will assist people to meet many of the expenses that I know that that has occur in f a m i l y life. ""We have heard a lot about the hold-up of the health scheme.

I know that it is a good point for electioneering purposes to say that the Government has done nothing about the health scheme, and quite recently I notieed that history was being repeated.

No health scheme has any possibility of success u.ii]e..<j it has the whole-hearted, co-operation of every one participating in it . This Government is not able to produce at a moment's notice a health scheme that w ill satisfy the Opposition, but when a scheme is produced it w ill be of lasting benefit to the people. That is one Avayi n which value can be put back into the Â£ 1 . The honourable member for Parkes( Mr Haylen) made great play about some matters which he said had suffered from the "" sheer neglect of this House"". He suggested that the Minister for External Affairs( Mr Spender) had belittled the value of the United Nations, and said that if the democratic world desired peace with Soviet Eussiai t could get it only through that organization. Instead of accusing us of belittling the United Nations lionorable members opposite would do well to remember that it was belittled no fewer than fifteen or sixteen times by Soviet Eussia. when its representatives walked out of meetings that wore vitally important to other countries. Therefore, throughout this debate ii a total lack of sincerity has been exhibited by the Opposition. That is quite a. serious indictment of the Opposition, because all these matters are of vital interest to the people of Australia. As honourable members are here to represent all sections of the people, they must realize that all matters which affect the interests of the people and are of national importance, should be dealt with on the common basis of the protection of the people of Australia in theinternational field. expect that this Parliament will do those things which they sent honourable memhers here to do. The promises that the Liberal party made before the last general election have been mentioned many times by honourable members opposite. It has been said that we have not fulfilled those promises. In the first instance we promised to abolish petrol rationing. Petrol rationing was abolished, although the Opposition, when in power, had stated quite definitely that Similarly Seuator McKennai t was impossible to do so. If this Government had been so disposed it could have made great play of that situation, buf because it has fulfilled its promise to the people it is quite prepared to let the people judge for themselves the value of its action. Our next promise was to ban the Communist party. The people know to what lengths we have gone to f u l f i l that promise. I think they realize that we have not so far been able to ban the Communist party because of obstruction by the Opposition. The honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr Clyde Cameron) mentioned that this Government had done nothing about hospitalization. We all realize that the previous Government, although in power for eight years, did nothing in that regard. The honourable member mentioned a sad and an urgent case which needed attention at the children's hospital but was unable to get admittance because of inadequate accommodation at the institution. It may be true that hospital accommodation is inadequate, but that has been the position during the last four years. The previous Labour Government did nothing about it . In many instances the people themselves have had to set up committees to purchase and maintain community maternity hospitals because the previous Government did nothing about that matter at all. I realize that the Chifley Government was faced witli many difficulties, and I do not want to criticize it . Moreover, other governments may also have been remiss in not providing ndenuate hospitalization. But to lay the neglect of past governments'at the door of this Government, which has been in office for only six months, is unreasonable. Honourable members opposite when in power did absolutely nothing in this The people have every right to regard. I know of cases of young mothers who had to travel many miles to country hospitals for confinement, yet the Labour Government was able to set up the most scientifically equipped hospitals at landing stages for the benefit of migrants. I do not complain about that, but if the Labour Government could do that it could also have done something mothers. This Government has not put into effect a scheme of hospitalization because it has not yet had an opportunity to bring down a budget. Therefore, it is not reasonable to accuse it of having done nothing. There is nothing more untrue or more insincere than that statement hy the Opposition. While this debate proceeds, I ask the Opposition to remember that, although its criticism may appear to it to be a good form of propaganda and party publicity, it is falling upon the very deaf ears of the Australian public; because nothing that it can say can justify its claim that the Government has failed to implement its promises. The reason for that is that the Opposition had eight years in which to do the things which it accuses this Government of not having done within six months. With appropriation and supply bills we rind it necessary to proceed on very cautious lines so that we shall eventually be in a position to place before the people a proposal that will put value back into the Â£.1 and help us all on to greater prosessentials and too little on goods necessary for perity.. .Surely the people realize that this Government has done everything within its power to carry out its promises. Appropriation Bill before the House offers an opportunity to honourable members to discuss problems which are vital to the nation's interests. By general constationary. I do not indict any governsent the most vital problem confronting this nation is that of inflation. Everybody agrees upon the effects of inflation, but there are several schools of thought about the causes of it. The task of any Government is to devise corrective measures while there is yet time. The sands of time are running out iu this country, as far as the inflationary spiral is concerned. We understand from press reports that the Cabinet is in the process of making very vital decisions about the future economy of Australia. Those decisions are designed to combat inflation. Whatever decisions the Government may make, they are bound to hurt somebody. Any effective anti-inflation programme is certain to evoke fierce controversy. The Government will not be doing its duty towards the Australian people if it is not prepared to make decisions towards helping Australian quickly and effectively. Perhaps the Government is delaying the making of those necessary decisions because when they are made it will be found that they are at variance with the ideas of some of its friends. However, a continued policy of drift will lead to inevitable disaster. It will be necessary to invoke drastic measures effectively to combat inflation. Those measures might cut across the political philosophy of the Government. For example, it may be necessary to impose some economic controls, but any idea of planning is anathema to the Government. The only alternative is for the Government to let things drift on and allow private enterprise to continue untrammelled. If that happens our people will have to face most difficult days. It might be necessary for the Government to give attention to what Professor Copland has termed "" Our milk bar economy"". In an article in the Melbourne Herald,. Professor Copland wroteToo much emphasis is being placed on nonlong-term improvement in productive capacity. I believe it will be generally agreed that one of the features of Australia's production in recent years has been an increase of the output of non-essential goods while the output of certain basic commodities has remained almost ment on that account. An example of that fact, which might be thought to be frivolous, but which nevertheless indicates the general trend, is that production of ice cream has increased by 238 per cent, during the last ten years whereas the production of steel, which is essentiai to the national economy, has decreased by 10 per cent, over the same period. Industrial statistics generally indicate thaf there has been a great expansion of non-essential and luxury industries. This has had an adverse effect on the production of steel, coal, bricks and tiles, which, in turn, has been detrimental to our housing programme.",61,Cameron Th E Lahour Is Determined And The Great Mass Of The
218,Mr Bird (Batman) [5.10],"TheI realize that the Government does not relish the prospect of taking positive steps to increase the production of basic industries because of the fear that, in doing so, it w ill offend some of its wealthy supporters. .However, if it 19 inflexibly determined to harness the inflationary spiral, it w ill have to take action of some kind that will restore equilibrium to our economy. There cannot be the slightest doubt that our economy is unbalanced, and, in the process of balancing it , the Government must lose some of its political friends. However, it w ill be acting in the best interests of the people if it accepts that risk and implements an intelligent anti-inflationary plan. If it decides to proceed along the lines that I have indicated in order to develop some of our basic industries, it may be forced to expedite the mechanization of primary industries. Alsoi t may have to institute a policy of granting selective bank credit and that, I imagine, would not be looked upon w i th enthusiasm by its supporters. Certainly, some means w ill have to be devised to induce workers to transfer from non-essential work to employment in basic industries. I know from my own experience that employment in vital industries is often hard and unpleasant, but it is essential to the prosperity of the"" nation. Many employers have treated their workers f a i r l y , but others have consistently refused to improve conditions of labour, provide amenities and pay generous wages, and therefore I am not astonished that men are not prepared to seek work in basic industries. They are attracted to less strenuous occupations where more amenities and more remunerative wages are provided. Production in basic industries might be considerably increased if the Government could prevail upon some of its supporters to establish better conditions in their establishments. Our bread-and-butter industries should not be hampered by adherence to the political creed that prescribes the elimination of all forms of government control irrespective of the consequences. I shall await with considerable interest the announcement of the Government's plans for the solution of the problems that I have mentioned. All sorts of organizations are prepared at all times to make weighty pronouncements about economic inflation and the corrective measures that should be applied to check it . One of the most recent comments of this naturethat I have seen was published in Melbourne newspapers a few weeks ago. It was a statement by the retiring president of the Victoriau Chamber of Commerce, Mr Kimpton, who outlined a number of major steps which, in his opinion, ought to be taken to combat inflation. His remarks weiv very interesting, but he appeared to think that the responsibility for checking inflation rested upon the shoulders of everybody except the members of the organization that he represented. He said not a word about the responsibilities of managements. In his view, everybody else had to make sacrifices. The highlight of his retiring presidential address was a declaration that we should return to the 44-hour working week. He said that the Australian Government should be courageous enough to approach the Commonwealth Arbitration Court and submit that the 44-hour week be re-instituted because the shorter working week had been a tragic failure and had been conducive to inflation. My experience has led me to the conclusion that such statements cannot be supported by facts. The only facts that we are entitled to use in forming any judgments in matters of this kind are official statistics. The cursory opinions of individuals should be discounted. The statistics that I have obtained completely contradict the argument that Mr. Kimpton advanced. For example, the total volume of production in Australia was 3 per cent, greater at the 30th June, 1949, than it was at the 30th June, 1948. That shows that production is increasing. Furthermore, the average output of individual workers is increasing at the rate of 1.1 per cent, per annum, compared with a rate of 0.6 per cent, per annum over the ten-year period that ended on the SOth June, 1939. The Commonwealth Arbitration Court declared unmistakably when it established the 40-hour working week that it expected all sections of the community-employers , employees and consumers-to co-operate in giving it a f a ir trial. Unfortunately, in my opinion and the opinion of many trade unionists, many employers have bluntly refused to co-operate and have ceaselessly criticized the shorter working week. Those individuals, of course, are the first to criticize the trade unions if they refuse to accept the decisions of conciliation commissioners, but they campaign for the abolition of the 40-hour week in season and out of season. Their professed allegiance to the arbitration system is mere lip-service. They want the workers to make all the sacrifices while they sit back and take all that they can get. There is more behind their attitude to the 40-hour week than meets the eye. Many of them are not motivated merely by a spirit of cussedness. They have adopted their attitude for the sake of cloaking their own managerial inefficiency. Many industries are deficient in initiative, vision and methods of organization, and, by their failure to secure the most effective fusion of the several factors that affect production, they have failed to increase output. Therefore, they use the excuse that the worker is going slow on the job. Fortunately, certain sections of management are highly efficient, as Tariff Board reports have proved. The following newspaper comment on various reports of the Tariff Board are of considerable interest:A number of companies surveyed reveal that by better management, improvements in plants, economics in "" overhead "" staffs, output under the 40-hour week can be maintained, and even improved. Before criticizing the alleged go-slow tactics of the workers, Government supporters ought to look round andstudy the go-slow tactics of some of the employers who are not prepared to bring their obsolete plants up to date. They clamour for increased production, but workers cannot work more quickly than their machines will allow them to work. In my private capacity as an engineer, I have seen many industrial plants that were in a disgraceful condition. It is futile for managements to say that the condition of their mechanical equipment is due to the effeets of the war. Many of those plants were in operation before the war. I suggest that, in striving to promote increased production, we should first of all attempt to impress upon employers the nature of their responsibilities. Mr Bird. Supporters of the Government have declared almost ad na-meam that incentive payments would provide one of the most successful means of decreasing the inflationary trend. Their comments have indicated a considerable amount of confused thinking, although the honourable member for Kingston( Mr Handby) had the right slant when he asserted that incentive payment schemes were not a matter for the Government. Many honourable members on the Government side of the House have talked about tbe glories of the incentive payment system, and one honourable gentleman said that he would not rest until provision for the adoption of that system was placed upon, the statute-book of this Parliament. The truth is that the Parliament has no authority in relation to industrial matters. In any case, incentive 'payment systems would not stop inflation. If that were not so, the economic troubles of the TJnited States of America would have been solved long ago, because incentive payment schemes operate in almost every industry in that country, where prices are extraordinarily high and where there are now 5,000,000 unemployed workers. The example of the TJnited States of America is not looked upon favourably by most Australian trade unionists. In order to prevent inflation in 1946-47 we should have had to increase production by S per cent, in that year. The increase in 1947-48 would have had to be 6 per cent, and in 1948-49 it would have had to be 9 per cent. .Such increases are not within the bounds of possibility. Production has never increased in any one year by more than 3^ per cent., and it would be impossible to achieve the rate of increase of 9 per cent, or 10 per cent, which supporters of the Government envisage. The serious situation that has been caused by rising prices would not be rectified if every employee in the country worked flat out. Inflation has many causes, and it occurs inevitably after every war. That is largely due to the fact that, in time of war, large numbers of men are withdrawn from industry and large sums of money are placed in circulation for the purposes of munitions manufacture. ""With a great amount of money in circulation and a small volume of goods entering the market, high prices are inevitable. It must be obvious to every honourable member that the effect of the constant now of additional money into the country as the result of high export prices for our primary products cannot be offset by any increase of production. I do not complain about the high overseas prices that farmers are getting for their products. I say good luck to them. Our 3945-46 amounted The figure rose progressively to Â£309,000,000 in 1946-47, to Â£406.000,000 in 1947-4S, and to Â£547,000,000 in 1949. I understand that it will be even higher in the current year. Erom those figures it ought to be obvious that people who hope to cure inflation by persuading employees to work harder are merely having a pipe dream. Our problem is not so simple of solution as that. It is tragic, though somewhat humorous as well, to hear men who ought to know better saying that the only cure for inflation is hard work. The president of the Victorian Chamber of Manufactures, Mr Atkins, made the following statement in an article that was published in the Melbourne Herald a few months ago:The cure for inflation is not by way of consince the inception of self government in tentious economic measures but rather by increasing output by universal acceptance of incentive payments in Australia generally. I do not believe that Mr Atkins would be so naive and innocent as to believe that statement. However, it was repeated in other newspapers, and the ery was taken up by all sections of the employers. Studious workers who realize that many other factors influence the inflationary trend are annoyed by such irresponsible declarations. I join forces now with the honourable member for Ballarat( Mr Pittard), who said last night that the Government should provide financial assistance for municipalities throughout Australia. As a municipal councillor of over twenty years standing, I have a fairly good knowledge of the circumstances of municipal councils to-day. Nearly every municipality is finding it impossible to carry out its responsibilities efficiently without some form of governmental assistance. The Australian Council of Local Government Associations recognizes the parlous position into which every municipality has drifted, and will ask the Commonwealth to appoint a commission to make a comprehensive survey of the functions and financial responsibilities of local authorities, and to report on the measure of assistance that should be granted to them by the Commonwealth and the States. Briefly, the Australian Council of total income from exports in Local Government Associations, at its into Â£197,000,000. augural meeting in 1947, placed in the forefront of its objectives the appointment of a commission or a committee by the Commonwealt^h in conjunction with the State governments to(1.) Define the functions and responsibilities of Local Government which are local in character and in benefit and which local authorities should be allowed to exercise unfettered by government control or supervision. (2.) Define the functions and responsibilities of local authorities with respect to(a) matters of national or semi-national import, (6) matters of State import. (3.) Keport re the financial disabilities of local authorities having regard for the limitation of their revenue raising powers and the exemption of an increasing amount of property from contribution to municipal funds. Every local authority in Australia has, this country, rendered yeoman service to the functions of local government. I say in all seriousness that local government, whilst it may not receive so much limelight as the parliaments of the Commonwealth and of the States receive, plays a most important part, particularly in providing local services. Local governing bodies are certainly in touch with the people to a greater degree than are members of the Parliament, and their functions are most important in relation to the welfare, health and success of the people generally. I say emphatically that local governing bodies cannot continue to function successfully unless they have adequate financial resources. The cost of constructing and maintaining roads has increased greatly during the past 10 years. Recently, the various municipalities in the Melbourne area met in conference to consider the crumbling condition of arterial roads within their boundaries. Arterial roads should not be wholly a local responsibility, because they serve the purposes of the entire metropolitan area, and of motorists who are proceeding to and from country districts. In my opinion, the construction and maintenance of arterial roads are definitely a national responsibility. Almost the entire income of a municipality could be absorbed in maintaining the arterial roads within its area. Municipalities will find it impossible, if the present conin respect of the rates that should be paid ditions continue, to maintain arterial roads. The cost of constructing roads imposes a serious limitation upon the functions and services that are performed by local authorities, but even more important than that, new duties and responsibilities are being imposed upon them. Those new functions require money, but the amount that a State government occasionally hands out to local authorities is conditioned by the temper of the Minister for Public Works at the time when the request for assistance is made to him. The present method of financing the functions of municipalities is hopelessly outmoded and inadequate. course, to the system of levying rates on property. The revenues that are derived by local authorities from that source are insufficient to enable them to provide the new services that are demanded by the people. The revenues that may be obtained from the present system of rating are strictly limited, and that position must be remedied. I have not referred to this subject with the object of obtaining a party political advantage, because all the municipalities throughout the Commonwealth are in agreement upon this matter. They are demanding assistance from some governmental body, Commonwealtb or State, and, of course, the only government that has the resources and capacity to provide that aid is the Commonwealth. The municipalities are facing the problem of ever-increasing costs, and tbe tendency of the Commonwealth and the States to purchase additional properties for governmental purposes, on which rates are not payable, is an additional embarrassment to the local-governing bodies. It is estimated that in Melbourne alone, the municipalities as a whole incur a loss of revenue of from 10 per cent, to 15 per cent, as a result of the exemption of government properties from rating. I was gratified when the Treasurer ( Mr Fadden) answer to a question yesterday that the ifr. Bird. Government was considering the possibility of altering that system. I realize that, at the moment, it is only a possibility, but I hope that the right honourable gentleman will see his way clear adequately to recompense the local authorities to them on governmental property. should also be liable in that respect. ments made a slight concession to the local authorities. The Government of Victoria will pay to municipalities in the Melbourne area one-half of the cost of the construction of new roads and footpaths in the front of State offices and buildings. In the past, the municipalities have been obliged to meet the whole of that cost. The community as a whole is demanding an extension of local government activities, such as community centres, recreation and cultural facilities, I refer, of child welfare centres, kindergartens and libraries. The provision of those amenities is beyond the financial resources of the local authorities. They are eager to provide them for the people because they recognize that, in modern society, such amenities are inevitable and are essential to progress. Yet, because of the lack of finance, they cannot be provided for the benefit of the people. I hope that the Commonwealth will see fit to grant the request of the Australian Council of Local Government Associations for the inquiry to which I referred a few minutes ago, and that the present system under which the activities of local authorities are financed will be altered. to review the whole matter. often a convenient way of shelving a matter. However, proposals foT improving the present method of financing the activities of local-governing bodies cannot be kept in a pigeon-hole permanently and I , for one, will not be satisfied indefinitely with the Treasurer's answer. I also know that the municipalities will not be content to allow the matter to remain in abeyance for very long, and their wrath will descend upon any government which stated in in future is not prepared to grant them adequate assistance. It is definitely unfair that ratepayers should be called upon",63,Cameron Th E Lahour Is Determined And The Great Mass Of The

222,Mr Bird,"A promise of that kind is to pay for services in a municipality that are benefiting all sections of the community. That is a community responsibility. Why should the ratepayers in a particular municipality be required to shoulder the responsibility for a community service? After all, there is ample precedent for local authorities to seek aid from the Government. In the United Kingdom, large amounts are paid by the Government to the various municipal councils. In the TJnited States of America, the councils have entered the field of income tax, amusement tax and sales tax because the outmoded system under which they obtained their financial requirements by levying rates on property proved inadequate for their requirements. Local authorities in South Africa are in a similar predicament, and a. committee was appointed recently to consider the whole position with a view to assisting them. This vexed subject threatens the whole basis of municipal government, and I am not speaking as an alarmist when I say that, unless government aid is forthcoming, nearly every municipality throughout the Commonwealth will be threatened with bankruptcy. I hope that the Government will accede to the request by the Australian Council of Local Government Associations to appoint a committee to investigate the financial position of municipalities. since the introduction of uniform income tax, is the principal 'taxing authority in Australia. There is no reason why some funds from Consolidated Revenue should not be diverted to municipalities that have important responsibilities and obligations in the local government sphere. Why should not some of the income tax that is collected from the wage and salary earners who live in a municipality be returned to the local authority that is providing important services for them? gentleman mean that financial assistance should be granted to all municipalities? vernment should appoint a committee to consider the present system of financing the activities of local-governing bodies, and to formulate a policy for assisting them. A new approach should be made to this matter of granting governmental aid to municipalities. At present, an occasional hand-out is made by a State government at the whim and caprice of the Minister for Public Works at the time. I contend that municipalities should be assured of a definite income annually from the Commonwealth to enable them to carry out functions that are on a community basis and should be paid for by the community as a whole, and not by one section of it. I trust that the Government will look upon this matter sensibly, because if the present position is allowed to continue unchecked, the consequences will be serious for one of the important units in Australia's self governing system. I contend, as one who has had municipal experience for twenty years, that local-governing bodies are reaching the end of their tether, and unless they receive assistance in the near future, the standards of local government throughout the Commonwealth will seriously deteriorate. able member's time has expired. [5.40] I should like to remind the House of an address that was delivered here last night by the honourable member for Yarra( Mr Keon). Frankly, I was The Commonwealth, most disappointed with it. In his earlier speeches, the honourable gentleman gave promise of being a useful member of this chamber. He exhibited a nice choice of English and he spoke fluently. I did not agree with his subject-matter, but I considered that he had great possibilities as a member of the Parliament. Yesterday, however, he made a most extraordinary and inconsistent speech, and concluded it with a virulent attack upon the Australian Country party of which I have the honour to be a member. He began by attacking the Treasurer ( Mr Fadden), who i9 the Leader of the Austhe honourable tralian Country party, and said that the right honourable gentleman displayed a sectional view in financial matters. The honourable member for Yarra forgets his own inconsistency. Under the banking policy of the Labour party, the Treasurer is all-powerful, and controls the financial destinies of Australia. Yet the honourable member for Yarra accused",67,Cameron Th E Lahour Is Determined And The Great Mass Of The

226,Mr Charles Anderson (Hume),"the Leader of the Australian Country party of displaying a sectional view in his approach to the national finances. If he is of that opinion, why did he vote against the Government's proposal to re-establish the Commonwealth Bank Board, which would afford protection against the very fault of which he complained ? The honourable member for Yarra then attacked the primary producer. I could not ascertain his reason for doing so, but he made a most virulent attack upon the man on the land. I regard the honourable gentleman's action in that respect as being akin to biting the hand that feeds him. The honourable member for Lawson( Mr Eailes) pointed out that the primary producer not only feeds the nation, hut also bears some of the cost of doing so. I need only cite wheat as an example of that. The honourable gentleman did not appear to know that the great wealth of Australia was established by the man on the land. Even secondary industry relies on the primary producers. The wool-grower, the wheat grower, the dairy-farmer and other primary producers established Australia's national economy. Would the Chifley Government have been able to maintain its prolific spending during the last five years had not the primary producers obtained abnormal prices for their products, in consequence of which the Treasury collected large sums of money ? That position continues to exist. The honourable member also referred to the bitterness between employer and employee in the rural areas. What does he know of conditions in the country districts? I venture to say that he knows absolutely nothing about them. I come from a country district, and I know that relations are extremely happy between employer and employee in the primary industries. The two work side by side. The honourable member did not refer to their frustrations. They always produce, and they do not go on strike, yet they are denied the basic materials that are essenBathurst after the recent federal general tial to our economy. The honourable member has no knowledge of thc struggle that is waged by primary producers and their employees against flies, rabbits and floods, or of the hard work that they do from day to day without complaint, Ur. Charles Anderson. -whilst always delivering the goods. His attack was unwarranted. The honourable member for Yarra then entered the class war and stigmatized the Australian Country party as a sectional party. I cannot understand why, recently, members of the Opposition have been consistently attacking that party. I entered politics with the greatest diffidence. I had no personal liking for politics which, in the minds of manypeople, was associated with intrigue. However, I have found it to. be a great honour to he a member of the Australian Oountry party, which is a party of friendship and of democratic ideals and has as its leader one of the greatest democrats in Australia. What is the reason for Labour's attacks upon the Australian Country party? Is it that Labour is losing so miany country seats? The country people are realizing just what the Labour party stands for. The honourable member for Lawson( Mr Failes) reminded the House that in the current general election campaign in New South Wales five of the sixteen Australian country party candidates have been returned unopposed, whilst three of them are being opposed only by independent candidates. The Labour party can show nothing in its record to equal that achievement. All the people .who vote for Australian Country party candidates are not primary producers. Whilst that party has the support of the great majority of rural residents, it also represents other sections of the community. It stands for the development of the country as a whole. It advocates decentralization, a fair distribution of the national wealth and the provision of adequate defences. However, the theme of socialism runs right through the speeches of members of the Opposition. WhilstI may be simple, at the same time. I am honest, and I cannot understand the tactics that honourable member's opposite adopt so far as socialism is concerned. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Chifley), when speaking at election campaign, declared that the issue was "" socialism versus capitalism"", and added that Labour was playing for large stakes. I admire the right honourable gentleman for his honesty and sincerity. However, I have just been taking part in the general election campaign in New South Wales, and I have found that all Labour candidates for rural seats invariably deny that they are socialists. Yet their leader has declared that the issue to-day is socialism versus capitalism. Capitalism is the Australian way of life, and Labour members wish to sabotage it. No Labour candidate who is standing for a country seat in the current general election campaign in New South Wales wall admit that he is a socialist. I have in my hand a copy of the rules and constitution and the policy and platform of the Australian Labour party, which is the bible of honourable members opposite. In that booklet is reprinted the famous pledge of the Labour party and its famous objective, "" Socialization of industry, production, distribution and exchange That is Marxian socialism. What do members of the Labour party say about that brand of socialism? I shall cite no less an authority than the right honourable meniber for Melbourne Ports( Mr honest and democratic course that they Holloway). Speaking at the All-Australian Trade Union Congress that was held in Melbourne in June, 1921, the right honourable gentleman saidSocialism of industry was the culmination Labour is destroying Australia's demoof the teachings of Karl Marx. When I was speaking at a meeting during the current general election campaign in New South Wales, I said that that pledge means no more nor less than Marxian socialism, and a member of the New South Wales Government interjected, "" Provei t "" . I have just cited proof of that statement, because I am certain that the right honourable member for Melbourne Ports is regarded as an authority on the objectives of the Labour party. At least, he is honest. He says that Labour socialism is Marxian socialism. Why then do his colleagues try to evade the issue? I sought election to the Parliament simply because Labour, which was once the good party of men like John Storey and Andrew Fisher, is now seeking to bring about socialism. One of the greatest inconsistencies in the actions of Labour members is their preparedness to take an undemocratic pledge. I cannot comprehend how any man, after having taken such a pledge, can present himself to the electors and say, "" I will represent your views"", when he knows that he must be bound by that pledge and by the decisions of the Labour caucus. Further evidence of this inconsistency i's provided by the fact that before a man can stand as a Labour candidate for election to the Legislative Council of New South Wales he must take the following pledge:I herqby pledge myself on all occasions to do my utmost to ensure the carrying out of the principles embodied in the Labour platform, including the abolition of the Legislative Council. That pledge is a part of the constitution and rules of the Australian Labour party. Fancy a man seeking election to a body that he is committed to destroy! And while he is bent upon the attainment of that objective he is being paid by the taxpayers. I do not wish to see the Labour movement destroyed, but 1 urge members of the Labour party to come out into the open and declare themselves for what they are. That is the should follow. Whilst disagreeing with the political philosophy of the Leader of the Opposition, I concede that he is sufficiently honest to say that Labour members art socialists. Quietly and insidiously cratic institutions. Regardless of his the Premier of New South Wales, is the first citizen in that State. Yet, recently, we witnessed a sorry spectacle when he went cap in hand to a small body of men outside the Parliament who control the destinies of New South Wales while Labour is in office. Lahour members of Parliament are not free agents. They are controlledby an outside body. Under such conditions for how long will our democratic institutions last? However highly we may esteem honourable members opposite personally, they are not, in fact, members of the Parliament, but are merely delegates, who represent outside interests which are not related to the electorate. Those interests have a grip upon democracy. We have heard a lot about putting value back into the Â£1. That problem will be solved only by a national effort and not by action that any party may take independently. The honourable member for Yarra said that value could be",68,Cameron Th E Lahour Is Determined And The Great Mass Of The
227,Party,"political affiliations, Mr McGirr,put back into tbe Â£1 by legislation. Tbat is not correct. One reason for the decrease of the purchasing power of the Â£1 is under-production, and the joint effort of tlie Australian Government and the State governments is needed to increase production. However, New South Wales, which is the key State, has been cursed for many years with the most dreadful form of government that has been known in the history of this country. Industrial disputes have contributed largely to the decrease of the purchasing power of the Â£1. Let us examine the figures in this respect. Whilst 771 industrial disputes occurred in New South Wales in 1946 under a Labour Government, only 25 industrial disputes occurred in that year in Victoria, which has enjoyed Liberal and Country party administrations. In the following year, 921 industrial disputes occurred in New South Wales under the magnificent McGirr Government, whilst in the same year only seventeen industrial disputes occurred in Victoria. In 1948,"" there were 1,071 industrial disputes in New South Wales and only 21 in Victoria, whilst for the first three quarters of 1949 there were 576 industrial disputes, including a serious coal strike, in New South Wales, but only seventeen industrial disputes in Victoria. Who pays the penalty for industrial disputes? The taxpayers do so through higher costs of living. Another factor that contributes to rising day. All sections of the community, but costs is the 40-hour week. No one would deny that he would like to have a 40-hour working week. The National Parliament has not the power to alter the standard working week, but it was reduced to 40 hours principally as the result of action taken by the McGirr Government, that has been mainly responsible for industrial disputes in New South Wales. However, since governments of that kind are in office in several States, including the key State, of New South Wales, let us try to make the 40-hour week work. When hours of work are decreased, let us try to make up for that reduction by increasing industrial output. mechanization of coal mines has been increased by 30 per cent., the production of coal has not increased to a corresponding degree. Indeed, it has decreased. Mr Charles Anderson. In 1947, 11,000,000 tons of coal was produced in New South Wales and as the result of increased mechanization alone the production should have increased by at least 3,500,000 tons by 1949, yet in the latter year it, was less than 100,000 tons in 'l947. That decrease of production was caused by industrial disputes. If we want to have national discipline we must have a government that will enforce it. All people accept the principle that a man will work only for a. profit or because he is forced to work. The honourable member for Yarra said that the Australian worker would work better if the profit made out of his labouiwent into his pocket. A man must work in order to live.' No one wants to force any one to work. But what is the alternative? The honourable inember for Batman( Mr Bird) said that all members of the Opposition were opposed to incentive payments. No man can be made to work merely by the passing of legislation, he must either be forced to work or be given an incentive to do so. Even Russia, with its slave system, has found that it cannot force men to work. Consequently, the government of that country has introduced a system of incentive payments. Go slow methods in industry are the whole cause of the rising cost of living and of the deterioration of our economy generally. Whereas before the war a bricklayer laid, on the average, 700 bricks a day, he now lays, on the average, only 300 bricks a principally the workers themselves, must pay the penalty. This country requires a government that will put a stop to industrial disputes by providing incentive payments and by giving to the average man a fair chance to improve his condition in life. Every' other country is well on the road to economic recovery, but Australia is lagging behind because we have had Labour governments in office for many years past in this Parliament and in the key State of New South Wales. I have noticed an increasing tendency Although on the part of members of the Opposition to use the word "" fascism "". Every one knows that fascism, nazi-ism and communism stem from socialist stock. There is a bitter fight between the adherents of each, of these isms, yet it is easy for the adherents of any of those parties to switch over to one of the others. The worse thing that a Communist can call a man is a fascist. Judging by the increasing tendency of honourable members opposite to use the word "" fascism "" one can only conclude that they have been mixing with those who employ that term in n derogatory sense. Thus, I suspect the company that they have been keeping. The honourable member for In d i ( Mr Bostock), in his admirable speeeh last night, when he referred to the weakening of the nation's w ill to resist in the face of attack with atomic weapons, failed to identify the army that would enter this country should our national morale be broken. What could it be but an Asiatic Army? This is not a time for political intrigue. All elements in the community should unite in the interests of the nation as a whole. adjourned.

The Government has now received the approval of three wool organizations, the Australian Wool Growers Council, the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation and the Australian Primary Producers Union, for the imposition of a levy. As soon as the legislation has been passed by the Parliament it w ill be possible to impose a levy in respect of the. forthcoming wool clip. As I have-made clear, the approval by the wool-growers organizations of the principle of a levy does not bind them to accept any scheme that may be evolved. any government to introduce a measure such as that introduced by the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture ( Mr. tion of an export levy in anticipation of other action to be taken three, six or twelve months hence by the Government in consultation with the wool growers, is unprecedented.

232,Mr Pollard (Lalor) [8.3],"Fo rwool industry. The purpose of the plannow under discussion is not to exploit the wool buyers of the world, even if it wp.ro possible for us to do 'so, but to endeavour to iron out the variations of price that occur from time to time in the world's markets. We support this legislation as an attempt to protect the national interests. The Australian Labour party, which represents the great Labour movement of Australia, is just as concerned about the welfare of the national economy as is any other section of the community, if not more so. The principles of the plan are in line with the attieent. of the world's apparel wool productude of the Labour movement towards the marketing of all forms of primary products, particularly of export products. I direct the attention of honourable members to the fact that when we were in office we introduced schemes for the stabilization of primary industries which were designed to equalize the incomes of primary producers and to establish a home-consumption price. In conjunction witb other countries we negotiated agreements covering primary products on un international plane. In 1943 the Australian Labour Government was largely responsible for the formation of the great joint wool organization and it established a subsidiary organization in Australia and charged it with responsibility for the marketing of the carry-over wool from the Empire wool purchase scheme. Therefore it is only natural that we should support the principles of this bill. Many proposals have been made for a wool marketing plan. Fundamentally and bii.sicn.lly we must take into consideration the fact that the ultimate success of any plan must largely depend on the economic circumstances of the people of those countries that purcliase our wool. If they are suffering from a severe economic rl epr essi on the success of any plan that we may put into operation will not be so certain as it will be if they are enjoying a period of economic prosperity. I am giad to associate myself with the Government's plan which is in line with Labour's outlook on the principles of the Atlantic Charter and with the TJnited Nations objective of full employment for all the peoples of the world. I have already made it clear that it would be impossible for Australia to establish a monopoly in Mr Pollard. the world's wool market for Australia produces only approximately 34 per cent, of the world's export apparel wool. The remaining 66 per cent, will obviously be a material factor in the world's markets, therefore I believe it to be essential that the dominions of New Zealand and South Africa be brought within the ambit of the plan. New Zealand at present contributes 10 per cent, and South Africa8 per cent, of the world production of apparel wool. If those dominions were included in the plan the three participating countries combined would contribute 52 per tion. The inclusion of our sister dominions would place the plan on a very sound basis. If it be desirable to make provision for the ultimate participation of other wool-producing countries, such ns Argentina, which produces approximately 14 per cent, of the world's apparel wool, the necessary arrangements could be made at a later stage. Experience has shown, however, that it is exceedingly difficult to obtain the cooperation of Argentina in schemes of this description. The value of the Australian wool clip in 1939-40 was Â£65,000,000; this year it is estimated at Â£250,000,000. The severe price fluctuations that have taken place in the world price in the period between the two wars, and the very great difference between the estimated present value of the clip and the value of the clip in 1939-40, demonstrate that the international wool situation presents all the elements that may make for future substantial slumps. It is desirable therefore that every opportunity shall be taken to fortif y the nation against the disasters that could follow from a severe contraction of thc amount that we receive annually from overseas countries that buy our wool. If it is possible to bring into the scheme the countries that I have named it may also be possible by good management to offset the effects of some of the major fluctuations that might occur and to assure the growers and the economy of the nation generally of a desirable degree of stability. It is quite true that substantial difficulties will accompany the inauguration of a scheme of this kind. One problem that confronts the country and tlie wool-growers is tlie competition of fibres otlier than wool. A t the moment, with world prices at what might be termed almost fantastic levels, it is reasonable to believe that the time may come when our wool industry will suffer increasing competition from other fibres, particularly synthetic fibres. The figures in respect of the raw materials that are used for the manufacture of wearing apparel throughout the period between 1909 and 1913, for per cent, of the principal raw material used to make the world's wearing Apparel. In the period between 1939 and 1.943 it provided 73.6 per cent. On the other hand silk provided only .5 per cent, of the principal raw materials used for making wearing apparel between 1909 and 19.13, and was again at that figure in the period between 1939 and 1943. We find on the other hand-and this should disabuse the minds of those who have no fear of the competition with wool of rayon and artificial fibres--that whereas between 1909 and 1913 rayon and staple fibre provided only .2 per cent, of the raw materials used for wearingapparel throughout the world, they provided 14 per cent, in the 1939-43 period. It is possible that if the world continues to use an increasing quantity of artificial fibres such as rayon, inroads w ill be made on the world's wool market, that will have a very adverse effect upon the great wool-growing industry of this country. Buti f a satisfactory scheme to cushion severe price fluctuations, such as have occurred in the past, is in operation, then at least the wool industry, and the wool-growers in particular, w ill be in a position, by virtue of increased efficiency in tlie industry and also by virtue of the .stability that stems from an assured annual income under a reserve price system, to meet and resist competition of that dangerous character. It is essential that any scheme that the Government puts into operation shall have very strong financial backing. It is also essentia] that the scheme shall embrace other countries like South Africa conjointly with Australia, should be the strongest buyer and the strongest holder of wool. When I say that thej' should be the strongest buyer of wool I mean that .in the event of a reserve price being fixed, the countries conducting the scheme should be so strong when prices fell below that reserve price thai, they could buy in at the reserve figure and satisfactorily hold on u n t i l the market could absorb the wool that they had bought in . I emphasize that point, perhaps on the one hand in an endeavour to the world are revealing. In assist the Government to persuade the wool-growers to accept its plan, and on the instance, cotton provided 85.6 other hand because I know only too well that primary producers, of whom I am one, tend to shy away fro m any scheme that involves the payment by them of levies or special taxation, even though such payments are imposed chiefly in their own interests. For that reason I am glad that the Minister has provided in this measure that the Government may levy an amount up to 10 per cent, of the value of the wool clip in order to preserve a satisfactory reserve fund and give to the scheme the financial strength that is visualized. It is to be hoped, of course, that it w ill not be necessary to impose a levy of more than from 2 to 5 per cent., but an examination of certain figures in respect of reserve prices shows that vast sums may be involved in a reserve price scheme. I have discovered from some figures that I have obtained that the imposition of an 18d. per lb. reserve price on the Australian wool clip would enable the controllers of the scheme to purchase, in the event of a collapse of the market, at least one-third of the current clip. That operation would cost Â£26,500,000. It must be obvious, therefore, to both the wool growers and the Government, that such a plan as the Government proposes must have strong financial backing so as to give confidence on each side, as well as confidence so far as buyer operations are concerned. If the reserve price were fixed at 24d. per lb. a sum of Â£43,000,000 would be required. In these days of high priced economy nobody could say that a reserve price of 24d. per lb. would be extravagant. As a matter of fact approximately 24d. per lb. is the reserve price under the scheme that is now in and New Zealand, which, operation and is conducted by the Australian Wool Realization Commission as the subsidiary Australian .body operating under the Joint Organization plan. If , on the other hand, a reserve price of 30d. per lb. were fixed as the point below which growers need not sell their wool, under a plan that required the purchase of one-third of the clip the amount involved would :be Â£52,000,000 annually. I emphasize those figures in order that those who are interested in this matter will fully realize that a scheme of this kind requires strong financial backing. The sums that I have given are those that would be required under certain reserve prices. On the other hand I must point out that if we had a major recession, with a catastrophic fall in the price of wool, and had to buy in two-thirds of the wool clip at any particular period, we should have to pay double the amounts that I have cited. It is true that the authority that bought in the wool would be in a position to obtain financial accommodation from a financial institution up to a percentage valuation of the wool that had ibeen bought, pending its satisfactory unloading on to the market. I believe that a plan of this kind should be supported by the Australian wool growers. Our experiences in World War I. and World War II., as well as during the period that intervened between those wars, has shown us that it is imperative that this country should have a plan of the kind envisaged' in the measure. Those who remember the operations of the Central Wool Committee in World War I. will recollect that that committee was established to handle the sale of the Australian wool clip to the United Kingdom Government. It was a new instrumentality but it operated in an entirely satisfactory manner. After the cessation of hostilities that committee found itself with a surplus of wool on its hands that had not been used during the war, and as a result' the government of the day established an organization known as the British Australasian Wool Eealization known shortly as Bawra. That organization carried out most satisfactory work and sold onto the market in a sane and sensible manner that met the wishes of the growers and the government of the day, the whole of the surplus carry-over Mr Pollard. wool that it held at the end of World War. I . In World War II . the Menzies Government contracted to sell the wool of the Australian wool-growers, without consulting the growers themselves, to the United Kingdom Government for the whole period of the war and for twelve months thereafter. The then Labour Opposition considered that price at which the wool was to be sold was very low and was below the cost of production. The Curtin Government, which succeeded the Eadden Liberal Government, took action to have that price increased and was successful in doing so. The point I want to make is that whilst it is true that the operations of the Central Wool Oommittee in World WarI . were eminently satisfactory, and that the winding up organization, Bawra, did a good job, and whilst it is also true that the operations of the Oentral Wool Committee in World War II . were of a highly efficient character and that the Australian Wool Eealization Commission's work in World War II . was magnificent, it must be obvious to the wool-growers and to all those who Study the problem that between the cessation of hostilities in World WarI . and the outbreak of hostilities in World War II . the Australian wool-growers, like the Australian wheat-growers, were thrown to the wolves and had to depend upon the old chaotic open-market system of marketing their product, and the price of wool fell to such a shocking degree on many occasions that many wool-growers went bankrupt and other experienced nearbankruptcy. 8d. per lb. that the situation in respect of the marketing of wheat has been satisfactorily resolved, and that to-day the wheat growers know that they -wiil be protected over a period of years. The right honourable member for Bradfield '( Mr Hughes) Association, which was was the man who threw the wheat-growers of this country to the wolves in 1921 when as Prime Minister he forced them to return to the wicked old open-marketing system. The same action was taken in respect of wool. It is good to see that after the passage of time and as a result",72,Charge Bill 1950
233,Mr Hughes,Woo l was sold at under,75,Charge Bill 1950
234,Mr Pollaed,"It is good to knowof our experiences between tbe two world wars, tbe Government bas at least some consciousness of tlie necessity to put into pose a levy on the wool-growers of this operation an organized plan for woolmarketing in tbe present post-war era. We have available to us the experience of highly trained personnel as well as very valuable property that will enable us to put into operation at any time as highly organized a wool-marketing plan as could be put into operation in any country in the world. I refer to the Australian Wool Eealization Commission which is the successor to the Central Wool Committee. This committee, during the war, actually constructed in this country 407 wool stores capable of storing S,000,000 bales of wool. The Australian Wool Eealization Commission is successor to the control of this property. Fortunately, owing to shipping being available to a greater degree than was at times thought possible during the war, the whole of that storage was not used for wool purchases and much of it was made available to the American forces for air force and military requirements, and to the Allied Works Council and other war-time instrumentalities. The successors, I assume, still have at their disposal, a storage capacity at least sufficient to store up to 3,000,000 or 4,000,000 bales of wool at any time. It is true that that storage capacity is actually the property of the TJnited Kingdom Government, which paid the Central Wool Committee three farthings per lb. on all wool purchased for handling, storage and other services. But I am quite sure that in the event of a plan being put into operation satisfactory arrangements could be made with the TJnited Kingdom to take over this great storage capacity and the ancillary equipment that goes with it. It is much easier to put a plan into operation when all the equipment, technical knowledge and highly-trained staff that are essential for its successful operation are available to it. Most honourable members will recollect that when the Australian Wool Eealization Commission took over its functions of a subsidiary organization to the Joint Organization which represented the three dominions and the TJnited Kingdom Government, the legislation introduced by the Curtin Government provided that it should be entitled to imcountry for the purpose of meeting administration and other costs. A t the inception of the Australian Wool Eealization Commission's activity a levy of 5 per cent, was struck on all wool marketed by the Australian wool growers. As time went on it was discovered that that levy was more than adequate to cover the expenses of the commission and the primary producers commenced an agitation to have it substantially reduced. TJnder the pressure of fhat agitation the Government of the day with which I was associated unfortunately consented to reduce the levy from 5 per cent, to 5 per cent. It is true that to-day the commission is still operating and that the $ per cent., plus some moneys in the fund raised when the 5 per cent, levy operated, adequately covers the cost of that organization's ordinary functions. But the Governments of South Africa and New Zealand, encouraged by their growers, decided to continue their 5 per cent, levy and have set aside in a special fund the moneys collected surplus to the requirements of administration in order to form the nucleus of a scheme of finance that may be put into operation in the future. The CHAIEMAN -Order! The conversation of honourable members is becoming too audible. told the House that his Government is fixed in its intention not to deal arbitrarily with other people's property. He varied that comment at a later stage of his speech by saying that the Government would support a joint organization scheme by providing a guarantee, that it s'hould have the final voice in the determination of the level of reserve prices, and that it would be concerned with the rate of re-offering in respect of wool that, was bought in. How the Minister reconciles his two utterances I do not know. If the Governinent determines the reserve price and the rate of re-offering of any wool bought in it can either make or break the scheme. If that power were taken from the Government the scheme, from",75,Charge Bill 1950
235,Mr Pollaed,"The Minister has the point of view of the national economy, would be worthless. No Government could support a scheme that fixed a reserve price guaranteed by the Government and sold bought-in wool at any price and under whatever circumstances it wished to do so. If the Minister would be a little more frank I think that wool-growers and primary producers generally would find it refreshing. I have no doubt that he has recollections of the manner in which I was criticized when I introduced many marketing bills to this House. On those occasions he caustically criticized governmental interference and control over marketing organizations. It is interesting to see him eating his own words and taking to the Government final and complete control of any scheme that may be put into operation. I found during the course of my talks with the council of the most conservative of wool growers' organizations in this country that it was so keen to have a plan, at that particular time at least, that it was even willing to concede that the Government should be the final arbiter in any plan that might be put into operation. I am sorry to see that since then white ants have been at work. Tonight the Minister announced the result of a poll that was taken by the Australian ""Wool Growers Council but only 4,500 growers voted at that poll out of the 9,000 who were issued with voting papers and the majority in confirmation of the principle of the scheme, not its details, was only 122. The Government is insistent that it shall have the final voice in respect of a reserve price and I concur with that principle. It insists also that it shall have the final voice as to how and to what price bought-in wool shall be sold. In to-day's Sydney Morning Herald, a reference to this poll by the secretary of the Australian Wool Growers Council is reported as follows:Mr J. W. Allan said yesterday that a sniall him to mean that the scheme will not be. majority of associations affiliated with his organization had said they agreed to the principle of a levy, subject to certain conditions. These conditions were:-That the percentage and the total amount necessary for the capital fund be subject to the approval of the Australian Wool growers' Council. My interpretation of that statement is that the associated bodies do not want a Jfr. Pollard. scheme unless the council is in a position to express approval of the percentage of taxation to be levied and, in effect, unless they can approve of that percentage they will not have anything to do with the scheme. The Minister has made it clear to thc3e gentlemen that the Government must be the final arbiter. Yet, Mr Allan says that the majority of his members have made it clear that they will not allow the Government to be the final arbiter of a reserve price. In one of the wool marketing measures before the House the Minister has provided for consultation before reserve prices are fixed but these people apparently want more than consultation. They want the right of approval. It appears to me that some of the conservative elements in these organizations are endeavouring to destroy the possibility of formulating any wool disposal plan in this peace-time era. I remind wool-growers that after World WarI . , when Bawra carried out a very good job in disposing of surplus wool, a number of wool-growers considered it would be a good thing if the organization was continued in the peacetime era. so that the wool-growers might have its protection. As a small grower I was astonished to receive from my wool broker an advice to vote, so they said, in my own interests, against the Bawra plan. Naturally, I voted for the continuation of a plan similar to Bawra but the majority of other wool-growers, acting on the advice of their brokers, voted against the proposal. I am afraid that the wool-growers of this country may be led by the nose in a similar manner before long. It is unfortunate that the Minister has said that his Government will not implement the scheme unless it has the assent of the wool-growers. I understood implemented unless the Government has the concurrence of all the varied organizations, including the Australian Wool growers Council with its affiliates, the Australian Primary Producers Union, and the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Pederation. There are thousands of wool-growers in this country who are not members of those organizations or of any organization. How is the Minister going to ascertain their viewpoint an any plan that may be under consideration? Knowing what happened in the period between the two world wars and the highly efficient organization of the Central Wool Committee, and of the Joint Organization and its subsidiary, as well as the vast collection of plant and technical staff at their disposal, .1. think that the Government should be courageous enough to say, "" A t least two primary producers' organizations which represent the greatest number of wool-growers support this .scheme and we shall put it into operation providing that we obtain the approval of about two-thirds of the members of those organizations "". escn pe taxation ? so. ft is true that under the measure introduced any levy imposed will be free of income tax, but, inevitably, if the scheme operated, will be payable by' growers later when prices are prevented from falling to too low a level. Tf, on the other hand, as tbe Minister for Commeree and Agriculture has said the funds collected under this measure are not utilized because of the strength of the policy of stabilization. In saying that market, the proposal is that the money shall be returned to those who had contributed it in the form of a levy. At the point of return the levy would become taxable. people will escape some tax provided it remains at the present rate or is lowered. That is one of the exigencies for which provision cannot be made. I commend this bill to the committee. The party of which I am a member supports the principle that it embodies. We hope that the Minister will screw up his courage and tell the wool-growers assoany of the growers whose opinion of the ciations, particularly the conservative body, which, I must say, was very cooperative when I was in office, that even though they have a large membership they alone clo not represent the majority of this country's wool-growers. In the absence of complete agreement amongst wool-growers' associations-and I believe that dissension will be sown amongst themI hope that he will take the bit between his teeth and put into operation a plan, which will give stability to a great industry and security to the wool growers, and will help to preserve financial equilibrium in times of hardship. This plan, if proceeded with, and the proposed levy, if imposed, will provide a counter measure against the inflation that is so apparent at the present time. I compliment the Minister for Commerce clear explanation of this matter to the committee, but I regard the speech of the honourable member for Lalor( Mr Pollard) as being at least three jumps ahead of the matter with which the resolution deals. I hope that the pepple who support the principle of establishing a reserve price for our most important primary product will not accept the arguments that he has put forward as affording reasons for acceptance of the plan. One of the biggest stumbling-blocks to the success of schemes such as this is the natural suspicion of the wool-growers of government control. The honourable inember for Lalor said that the Government had taken a. chapter from the book of Labour's he was very, very far from the truth. This scheme is completely different from any stabilization scheme introduced by the Chifley Government. TJnder the schemes of that Government which controlled the marketing of wheat, butter, and other commodities, the whole produce of the farmer was taken under government control and was sold under a pool system. Under this scheme the provision made for purchase from a grower is to come into operation only in the event of wool not reaching the reserve price. In all other respects this scheme corresponds with the present method of selling in the open market. I say that to reassure scheme might waver after having heard the remarks of thc honourable member for Lalor. The bill takes the preliminary step towards carrying out the policy announced by the joint government parties in which they promised to",76,Charge Bill 1950

Various propositions discussed by tbe wool-growers' associations embraced pther methods of providing capital. I remember that discussions in the past were centred on the point that the profits made by the appraisement and joint scheme should be employed to provide capital for the fund. Because of various legal difficulties which are obvious upon consideration, such as the difficulties associated with deceased persons, trust estates, and companies, it was impossible to implement such a scheme. Therefore, a system has been devised whereby the industry itself will provide its own capital, assisted by a government guarantee. At the present time we are enjoying a period of great prosperity because of the high prices received for our exports, particularly wool. The time is ripe to provide the nest-egg, while the funds are still coming in. I know that honourable gentlemen like the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward) will say that the scheme is to the wool-growers' advantage, but I think that the honourable member for Lalor proved clearly to what extent the economy of Australia depends upon the stability of the wool industry. Not only the workers in our secondary industries, but also the population of our rural towns and districts, depend on the prosperity of the wool industry. people to whom consideration must be given are the new settlers who are taking up blocks under the ex-service land settlement schemes. One of the objections to a scheme of this nature voiced in the past was that many growers were prepared to carry their own insurance. If men are well established, they are confident that they can take the market risks in the ordinary course of business. That might be satisfactory to them, but it has been said very often that the huge fluctuations that have taken place in wool prices in the period Jbetween the two world wars have in many cases inflicted great hardship on people who are not so fortunately placed. believes that the industry must provide its own stability. Its stability is essentia] if our new settlers on the land are to Mr Mackinnon. succeed. The wool industry is the corner stone of our economy, and it must be made stable. A scheme of this nature will provide the necessary stability. If there is any alarm in the minds of wool growers after hearing the previous speaker I think that they should consider the safeguards provided in the bill. If the scheme is not accepted by the representatives of the growers, then the money levied organization under this bill will be refunded; that is, if the scheme is not implemented by the 30th September next year. The legislation to enforce the levy will not be proclaimed until the Government has been shown clearly that the principle of it is approved by the growers. Those two safeguards cover fully the first step in this legislation. Proceeding to the second step, we see that any conjecture about it would be out of place at present. The object of any minimum price scheme is to level out price fluctuations. Such a levelling in the wool industry will benefit, not only the wool-growers, but also all the people of Australia. Critics of the scheme say that under the previous scheme, the Joint Organization that is now being wound up was never tested by wool reaching the minimum price. In view of the buoyant demand for Australian merino wools such a criticism is particularly appropriate to that kind of wool. But it should be realized that the minimum price was tested with Other regard to wool of certain types. I refer jmrticularly to New Zealand cross-bred wool during the 1946-47 season. In that connection I quote this statement from the Pastoral Beview of November, 194SDiscussing the commissioner's schedule of prices, these brokers stated that from a fine wool point of view the schedule was well below the actual market price, but for cross-bred qualities up to 52's, the J.O reserve price was pretty well the sale-room' price, and that as those qualities take in 70 per cent, of the New Zealand clip it can be readily realized how useful J.O. protection was to the Dominions as a whole. In fact, tliey state it can be truth f u l ly said that had it not been for the floor price, medium and inferior crossnbreds might have receded to near tileir pre-war basis. That brings out the important point The Government about wool marketing which is the backbone of the confidence of the trade generally. It is obvious that buyers in Australia who have commitments to supply people in other countries must be in a position to buy with some certainty of a future price. They should not be faced with sudden falls in prices after having committed themselves. If there is any weakness in the market there is nothing more frightening to the buyer than the possibility of being faced with a lot of dear wooi which he cannot satisfactorily place. With a system of reserve prices that liability is largely eliminated. honourable member's time has expired. orable member has risen, I shall take my second period now. This system will prevent the situation arising of a buyer being faced with a calamitous fall in price and it will give to him that confidence in his own market that will enable him to go ahead without fear with normal purchasing. Another point in regard to the reserve prices that should be brought out is that the consumers should not think that they represent a scheme to. extract money from them. This is not a scheme to preserve a high price; it is designed to resist a price fall which would knock the bottom out of the normal wool market. It is not designed to keep wool prices at the fantastic levels of to-day. That should he clearly brought to the notice of the consumer. The whole point upon which this scheme will turn is its practicability. One of the most important points put forward by the honourable member for Lalor had reference to finance. A t present it would be almost impossible to anticipate the capital necessary, but it is reasonable to assume that a levy of 10 per cent, on the Australian clip would provide substantial capital to resist a price fall equal to the value of up to almost half a pre-war Australian clip. In the worse circumstances that can be visualized the whole clip would have to be bought in for one season. Definite provision for capital must be made in a scheme of this nature. Another point to be considered is the provision of storage space. Storage space is available as a legacy from the appraisement scheme. Fortunately wool is a commodity that can he stored for indefinite periods without loss of value. That means that one of the normal difficulties associated with marketing schemes will be avoided in the case of wool. That is the storage of large quantities when a fall takes place in the market price. In conclusion, I urge on the House that a number of hurdles must be jumped before this scheme can hecome law. This is the preliminary stage and if the growers approve the scheme the necessary finance can be obtained to carry it out. But the The other wool-growing countries, and probably the consuming countries, will have to be consulted. Great difficulty would be experienced in implementing a scheme of this nature unless agreement were reached at any rate between the British countries that produce a very substantial part of the world's wool clip. Probably the greatest difficulty of all will occur in promoting agreement within the industry. However, unless a start is made, the plan may be postponed indefinitely or even dropped altogether. I urge the growers to take advantage of this opportunity in view of the extremely high prices that they are now receiving for their product. the Opposition) [9.1] -The Opposition would like to have been presented with a more detailed account of the scheme of reserve prices for wool before giving approval to it. However, the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture ( Mr (McEwen) has been good enough to explain to me personally the object of the scheme and the necessity for passing the legislation promptly. It is obvious that, as the shearing season is about to commence, it would be unwise to delay the passage of the legislation until the Parliament resumes after the forthcoming recess. By that time a great portion of the wool clip would be in hand and the levy might apply inequitably. Furthermore, it is advisable to introduce the reserve prices _scheme when wool prices are high. As the honourable member for Lalor( Mr Pollard) has intimated, the Opposition agrees that now is the time to strike a levy, if one is to be struck. I assume that some wool will have been shorn before the levy can be introduced even if we pass the necessary bill at once.

The wool industry contends that, apart from subsidies that have been paid upon fertilizers, it has not had any direct appeared to me at the time that the assistance from governments when wool prices have been low. The Minister has referred to the fact that any moneys levied under the scheme will be deductable for the purposes of income tax. Some people may cavil at that arrangement because the incomes of many wool-growers are now exceedingly high. Certainly it can be argued that those growers will benefit in the long run as the result of the deduction of the levy from theii incomes. Because of their prosperity, they are now paying tax at high rates. Any refunds that may be made to them will obviously be paid in times of low prices, when their incomes will be small and therefore will not be liable to tax at the high rates that now apply. 1 consider that the Government is obliged to offer some inducement to the growers to support the plan because they have never been eager to join in stabilization schemes, except, of course, when they have been in financial difficulties. That attiof the fund, of course, will depend upon tude is not peculiar to wool-growers; most people are strongly in favour of being left alone when conditions are good, but they always ask for Government assistance when conditions are bad. All honourable members know that the wool market is likely to. fluctuate suddenly. the period after the war when we had an accumulation of about 7,000,000 bales of wool in Australia. Justice Dixon, of the High Court of Australia, who was then chairman of the Centra] Wool Committee, and Mr Justice Owen, of the New .South Wales Supreme Court, who succeeded him as chairman of the committee, were very alarmed-in the interests of the country, of course, not in their own interests-about the possible effect upon the world market of the release of those stocks. They feared that wool prices would slump heavily and they advanced forceful arguments in favour of their view. The government of the day sent the present Deputy High Commissioner in the TJnited Kingdom, Mr great deal of the mouey that has been McCarthy, and the then .Secretary to the meet representatives of South Africa. Ur. Chifley. New Zealand and Great Britain and they helped to prepare the plan for the establishment of the Joint Organization, l t arrangement was essential, although it involved a Treasury liability of between Â£40,000,000 and Â£5*0,000,000. As events proved, the Joint Organization plan was wisely drafted, but at first there appeared to be a considerable risk of a. serious loss to the Treasury. Fortunately, wool prices took a trend that had not been anticipated by tbe two learned gentlemen whom I have mentioned or, indeed, by those associated with the woo! industry. Nevertheless, I consider that it is always wise for a. government to ensure that it shall be properly protected in such matters. I assume that, if a reserve prices scheme is finally prepared, the Parliament will be given the opportunity to discuss it in detail before it is ratified. will be able to establish a very substantial fund if it makes a levy.

I well remember right honourable gentleman's time has expired. able member has risen, I shall take my second period now. The high prices that are being received for Australia's primary products to-day contribute in a marked degree to the inflationary spiral. I do not think that anybody will attempt to deny that. Some people have said that, had the primary producers been able to obtain all the goods that they wanted to buy, including farm equipment, tliose high prices would not have had such an inflationary effect as they have had. But that is only partly true; it is not even half true. A received by wool growers and other primary producers has been expended on luxury items. In fact, they do not always",80,Charge Bill 1950

I do not participate in all the social revelry that goes on, but I scan the society columns in the newspapers sometimes and I hear about people who purchase motor cars worth Â£6,000 for their prospective brides. After all, that sort of expenditure contributes substantially to the inflationary trend in our economy. Therefore, one virtue of the proposed levy will be that it McFarlane who is now the representative will drain off some of the excess purchasing power that is now in the hands of the most prosperous wool growers. Many producers are not particularly affluent. In fact, some of them have only just been able to pay off their debts and get on their feet again. Of course, if the very prosperous growers were wise enough to set aside their excess funds o oven invest them in the loans that the Treasurer ( Mr Fadden) will be floating in the not distant future no ill effects would accrue. But unfortunately, we all are subject to human weaknesses and, when the coin rolls in, most of us have a good time if there is one to be had. I do not blame people for that, because many of them have not had much fun in the past, and that is particularly true of primary producers. However, I a.m glad that the levy will drain off some of the surplus spending power of the producers and concentrate it in a fund that may be used to protect the industry on some rainy day. If such assistance should not be necessary, as the Minister ha? pointed out, the money in the fund will be refunded to the growers. I am not sure of the Government's come available.

Those gentlemen did a really magnificent job. The Minister will agree with me when I say that, in devising the Joint Organization, they set a pattern that has improved the possibility of the acceptance of this particular scheme by growers. I may say, in passing, that I was disappointed with the ballot that was held, because many graziers did not bother to record their votes. However, I suppose that we may conclude that silence gives consent. Of course, sometimes silence does not give consent, but I believe that, on this occasion, we can assume that it does. I shall not speak at length on this proposal, and I am sure that the Government will appreciate assistance from the Opposition to pass at least one bill rapidly through all stages.

I do not wish to see that break, come, and I do not say that it will come, but I do regard the international position as highly unstable. Therefore, T ask the wool-growers of Australia to believe that that fact alone renders it essential that we should not scrap the Joint Organization that has all the materialand personnel requirements to carry on the industry until such time as it may be considered desirable to revert to the conditions that operated before World War II . Another purpose of this scheme is to enable wool-growers, presumably by a maximum levy of 10 per cent, on the gross proceeds, to finance their own scheme. Protection is given to the equity of those who contribute to it. That factor is most important, because the failure to give that protection in prewool accounted for 45 per cent, of vious schemes brought them into disrepute. Let me elaborate that point. If a man who has been engaged in the wool industry dies, his widow should be able to realize on his equity in the scheme. If a wool-grower has a bona fide breakdown of health, he should be able to withdraw from the scheme. However, a wool grower who wishes to withdraw from it, but intends to continue in the industry, must be content to allow his insurance to remain in the fund. The denial of the elementary right of the widow of a wool-grower and of a wool-grower who, as a result of a bona fide breakdown of health, wishes to withdraw from the scheme, to realize on their equity, brought previous schemes into disrepute. I am sure that the Minister would not expect the Government to be a party to that injustice. Another point that I wish to make is that the scheme envisages the maintenance of a system of open and free auctioning of wool. I know that that matter has been cavilled at, but I simply reply that I do not know of any reason why the two should be inconsistent. From 1939-40 to 1941-42, the prices received for wool, which were then fixed by appraisement, averaged 13.44d. per lb. The CHAIEMAN -Order! The honourable member has risen, I shall take my second period now. From 1942-43 to 1945-46^ the prices received for wool averaged 15.45d. per lb. It is interesting to note that as soon as sales were resumed on the open market, the prices received averaged approximately 24.49d. per lb. and in 1949-50 averaged 54d. In that development the price for fine wools, which was singularly depressed under appraisement, rose substantially. The first rise indicated the confidence of buyers in the fair working of Joint Organization and the demand for wool increased as the price continued to rise. The total value of wool exports rose from Â£50,000,000 in 1941-42 to Â£69,200,000 in 1945-46, to Â£239,000,000 in 1948-49, and to approximately Â£300,000,000 in 1949-50. In 1948-49 the value of our total exports, and this percentage increased to 50 per cent, in 1949-50, whilst during the same period the value of wool exports rose from 11.7 per cent, to 13.5 per cent, of the national income. The incidence of these percentages in relation to total exports and national income renders a stabilization scheme imperative in the interests of the nation. It is appropriate, then, to indicate briefly the value of the proposed scheme to the wool-growers. First, it will provide a cushion against a sudden fall in wool prices; and secondly, it will ensure that smaller growers shall not be sacrificed. Past experience has shown that the failure of the small man to stand up to a slump has acted to the detriment of other growers by causing a tendency to bring down prices generally and to that degree it has adversely affected the national economy. Thirdly, the scheme will lower the incidence of the present rates of tax levied upon growers; and, fourthly, it will place in reserve for their benefit a sum, the greater part of which would, in any event, be drawn off in taxes.

265,Mr Fbeeth (Forrest) [9.53],"1The evils in tlie wool industry existed prior to the war. The price of wool ou the world market fluctuated unduly, and was completely out of balance with the world's general wool requirements. In other words, an undue degree of speculation and organized buying disturbed the ordinary requirements of the world for wool, and brought about great disturbances of prices. Those factors had an unsettling effect on wool-growers. It is clear that the adoption of a flexible scheme will, in the long term, adjust the world demand for wool, but, in the short term, it will give to the grower an opportured materials aud he pointed out that tunity to make stable plans for production. The average wool-grower is in control of a large amount of capital. It would not be easy for him to switch at short notice from the production of wool to the production of another primary product. his principal product were unsatisfactory he' might be able to switch his production over a term of years, but not at short notice. This plan should also have a stabilizing effect upon the price of land. such as this, because it can be withheld from the market at will, whereas primary products of a perishable nature must be marketed without delay. The fact that wool can be withheld from the market for a long time makes possible the introduction of a scheme to level out prices over a period. In other words, the necessity for government acquisition of tlie product is avoided. The honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward) has asked why so many wool growers have been opposed to the scheme. too. honourable member for Dalley( Mr can be met to a certain degree by its Rosevear). The obvious answer is that during the administration of the Labour Government, wool-growers had learnt to distrust all government schemes, because inevitably they resulted in complete government control of the industry, and government fixation of prices. When growers realize that the scheme has really been initiated by themselves, and will be financed, operated and controlled by themselves, their fears will vanish. In considering a scheme such as this, we must endeavour to foresee the dangers that may arise from it. The honourable member for Lalor( Mr Pollard) has suggested a possible danger in the competition of synthetic materials. I agiee that it is not beyond the bounds of possibility that, at some time in the future, synthetic products may offer serious competition to wool; but to date, no adequate substitute for natural wool has been discovered. The honourable gentleman has said that, for the period from 1909 to 1913, cotton represented 86 per cent, of the constituents of manufacthat percentage dropped to 73 per cent, in the period 1939-43. He has also said, in respect of rayon and artificial fibres, that the figures were Q.2 per cent, and 14 per cent, respectively. Those figures indicate that rayon and artificial fibres are merely If the price of replacing cotton, and that there has been, in effect, no substantial displacement of wool in the manufacture of materials. Nevertheless, such a possibility exists. Eesearch into wool substitutes is continually being pursued, mainly because Wool lends itself to a scheme of the tremendous world demand for wool that cannot be satisfied at the moment. The danger of competition from synthetics will, I suggest, be alleviated by the wool stabilization scheme because it will prevent panic in the world's markets. Violent panic in the international markets has largely been responsible for the disturbances that have occurred in world prices. In the second place, the scheme will tend to ease the heavy demand on wool in periods of shortages by allowing some of the accumulated stock piles that have been bought up in periods when prices were low to come on to the market. I suggest therefore that the danger from synthetics means. The second danger that we must face, and that has not been brought to the attention of the committee, is the danger of undue pressure by growers for a high reserve price to operate when the market is falling; and coupled with that would be a possible lack of capital in the reserve fund. I should like the fund to be raised to a very high level before any repayments are made to growers, because I consider it to be inevitable that the wool market must fall and the later that fait",87,Avooi He Must Produce I N Order To Qualify
266,Mr Eoseveak,"A very fair question,",88,Avooi He Must Produce I N Order To Qualify
267,Mr Fbeeth,"I agree with thecomes, on present tendencies at any rate, the higher will the wool-growers' costs of production have become and the stronger will be the pressure that they will put on the committee controlling the fund for the fixing of a very high reserve price. The honourable member for Wannon the fact that criticism of the Joint Organization had been based on the argument that it had not been tested out when prices were low-in other words, that the operation of a reserve price for wool had not been tested out under severe conditions. I regard that as a danger which the operators of this scheme must take into consideration; nevertheless I believe that, provided that the fund is carefully administered The' CHAIRMAN. Order! honourable gentleman's time has expired. able gentleman has risen I shall take my second period now. If the fund ie administered by people who are skilled in estimating the condition of world wool markets, then its operations can only be beneficial. Some criticism of the proposed fund has been based on the ground that ultimately the Government will have the final voice about what the reserve price is to be. I agree that that is a very great dimculty from the point of view of some people, because, as I have said previously, some primary producers have come to distrust such schemes, having found in the past that they have simply meant that the Government has come into the business and said, "" This shall be your reserve price. We do not care what you recommend "". We on this side of the committee have given undertakings 1.0 the wool-growers that the final approval Australia, he would know that the actual of the Government of the reserve price will be necessary only in the event of any danger of the Government being called upon to meet its guarantee of the reserve fund. In other words, if the fund is operated wisely and is expanded to reasonable proportions, there will be so much the less likelihood of any government control operating. This scheme should commend itself to therefore, not affect the cost of clothing: those individuals mentioned by the honorvery materially. The price of wool has able member for Wannon, who suggested a microscopic effect on the price of cloththat many large wool-growers prefer to ing. The great increase of the price of carry theii own insurance. For several 1 reasons they cannot carry 'insurance iu this case as effectively as it will be covered by this scheme. Despite their distrust of government schemes, and ihe fact that in the past they have found the cost to them of such schemes to have been unduly high, they cannot at the present, time establish adequate reserves for themselves because of their high rate of tax. Therefore, by putting into a government, fund such as this, tax-free, a certain portion of their incomes, they will provide for themselves a more adequate insurance than they could otherwise have. The scheme should commend itself to them for the second reason that, there is no doubt that the present high prices of wool are having an inflationary effect. As a result of that fact their costs of producThe tion are rising substantially, and if they endeavoured, in the face of those increasing costs, to establish a reserve they would find that their ability to meet the fall of wool prices when it came, as it must come, would be lessened, because their high costs of production would have prevented them from being in a position to compete with other outside producers whose costs of production had been lower. I turn now to the remarks of the honourable member for East Sydney. In spite of the fact that honourable member? opposite have generally indicated that they support this measure, that honourable member as usual can be relied upon to be difficult, to say the least. He wishes us to consider introducing a home-consumption price for wool. I suggest that if he had any knowledge of the wool industry, and if he analysed the figures relating to the cost of manufactured woollen goods in market prices of wool play a very small part in the .final cost of manufactured goods. For instance, in a. man's suit of clothing that costs anything up to 25 guineas or more, there is approximately only 25s. worth of wool at present prices. A similar ratio applies to the cost of all other woollen goods. The fixing of a home-consumption price for wool would,",88,Avooi He Must Produce I N Order To Qualify

He asserted that the home-consumption price should therefore be lower than it now is. I clo not know what his views were in the 1930's, and whether he would ha.ve been prepared to suggest then that the home-consumption price for wool should be higher because overseas prices ranged between 7cl. and l i d . per lb., but I have no doubt that his excuse then would have been that the poor workers of his electorate would be unduly penalized by a high home-consumption price for wool. I dismiss his views on the exchange rate as irrelevant to this ; debute, but I was rather interested to hear that he apparently favoured an upward revaluation of the Australian Â£1 when he supported the Chifley Government, which last year devalued the Â£1. As I have said, tlie honourable member for East Sydney can always be relied upon to be difficult in H ny circumstances.

I have no doubt that the wool industry has I was benefited from the exchange rate as, of course, have many other interests in this country, but to suggest that as a whole it has been a beneficiary at the hands of the Australian people seems to me to be entirely incorrect. The wool industry has itself been of very great benefit to the Australian economy. Over the years it has been the bulwark of the Australian economy. It certainly cannot be described as a mendicant industry or one that has received benefits from this community that have f a r outweighed the value that it has provided to the community. I am always rather"" astonished'when it is suggested that rural industries are particularly favoured when they receive subsidies, especially when the suggestion comes from people who accept as perfectly normal the view that the rural producer and the Australian consumer as a whole should be prepared to pay prices much liigher than world parity prices, for the products of Australia's secondary industries. I am not now objecting to the protection that the national policy sees fit to provide for sections of the Australian manufacturing industry, but I think it is also f a ir to recognize I was also very interested in the suggestion that we should establish a home some way, over a period of are being earned to-day by a number of",89,Avooi He Must Produce I N Order To Qualify

The majority of wool-growers are undoubtedly enjoying prosperity greater than they have known in previous years, but their position is not to be judged by the position of a small number of wool-growers who now receive very large incomes. The average wool-grower to-day is obtaining merely a just compensation for the very low prices that he has had to accept in previous years -The suggestion that is often put forward that the primary producer of this country should sell, his product to his fellow Australians have to be compulsory upon every one. at less than world parity prices has always interested me exceedingly, because it comes from the very people who in the same breath advance the argument that the rural producer and the country dweller generally should be prepared to pay not less, but more, than world parity prices for all their purchases of Australian manufactured goods. Apart altogether from the question of whether a home consumption price for wool is workable it appears to me to be an unjust proposition that the primary producer should supply the city consumer with goods at prices lower than world parity while at the same time he is expected, as a matter of course, to pay more than world parity prices for the products of the tralia that it would be wrong to revert secondary industries in the cities.

[ think it can best be described as provisional legislation because its ultimate proclamation is dependent upon at least two factors, one of which is that the growers must approve of the scheme and the other is that it must receive the blessing of the Government. Of course that is only natural because the Government will have a contingent liability through its provision of a guarantee in order that the scheme may operate. The scheme is also unusual because it provides that the growers themselves, who are the owners of the product, shall finance it. subject only to a government guarantee which is unavoidable and is necessary because of the extreme importance of the wool industry to Australia's economy. The growers themselves are asking only that they be given the opportunity to protect themselves. The history of the primary producing industries in past years is a very sorry one because of the lack of provision for the growers to protect themselves. average man is intelligent enough to cooperate. The Government proposes to provide machinery which will operate in exactly the same way as the law under which a man may protect himself from his neighbour who may attempt to do him an injury. I think that the necessity for this scheme is obvious to all honourable members. That it is necessary is indicated by the Opposition's acceptance of the bill and the expression of its intention to co-operate in dealing with it speedily in order that it may operate as soon as possible. The wool industry is of such great importance to Austo the old conditions under which the disorganized and markets were unstabilized. The producers were between conflicting interests, like a lemon in a squeezer. The wool producers in the past have beeu more fleeced than the Order! The sheep they shore. They have been tori 1 between conflicting interests who wanted -The as much as they could get from them in return for as little as possible. Legislation of this type provides the groAver Avith the means of protecting himself against exploitation from everywhere that it came from in the past because of the haphazard and disorganized system of marketing.

Under this proposal the Government has the power to make ultimate decisions but that proposal is vastly different from a system which takes the growers' product, dictates where, when and how it shall be disposed of, and calls upon the grower to bear any loss or sacrifice. If , at times, it is necessary for years time the quantity of wool that will the Australian Governinent to make reciprocal arrangements under which Australian goods are exchanged for goods from foreign countries, the whole of the nation should bear any cost incurred or sacrifice suffered. In this case, the wool growers need have no fear that they will be called upon to bear losses of that nature. It was the fear of that possibility that aroused a disinclination on the part of some growers to express their wholehearted willingness to participate in. an organized -scheme. Such a thing could not happen under this bill. The purpose of the proposed marketing scheme is to guard against the extreme fluctuations which take place during and between wool-selling seasons. In the past, those fluctuations have had a disastrous effect on the national economy and on the wool industry. Such fluctuations have not permitted the wool-grower to have security and they have restricted expansion. I know wool-growers who raised splendid flocks of sheep in anticipation of a good return from the particular type of wool that they would get from them. Then the market went haywire, and, over a period of years, they attempted to readjust their farming methods in order to meet what they thought would be a new demand, but by the time they had changed their product the market had reversed and they found themselves worse off than they had been in the beginning. That is what has given rise to the suggestion that farmers conduct their operations inefficiently. They cannot help but operate inefficiently when, from month to month, they do not know what is going to happen to their products, but they will be encouraged enormously if their position is made secure. The CHAIEMAN honourable member's time has expired. member has risen I shall take my second period now. The methods of cultivation being adopted to-day in what have hitherto been purely agricultural areas are such that those areas are contributing more largely to the wool industry. In a few come from what have been called agricultural areas will equal the quantity that will come from the grazing areas. Conditions are more reliable in those agricultural sections of the country. The adoption of a marketing scheme such as that which has been proposed will encourage their development to the benefit of the industry and of the whole nation. The honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward) referred to a home consumption price and to subsidies. It is possible that his references to the exchange rate may have deceived some people into believing that the wool-grower receives a benefit from the exchange rate for home consumed wool. There is a considerable misconception in regard to what producers of all export goods actually receive from the exchange rate. The exchange rate does not cost the consumer of homeproduced goods one penny. The price of wool retailed in Australia does not include any amount in the form of an exchange rate. The manufacturer has to pay only the ordinary market price and the manufactured article reaches the buying public with no exchange rate added. A home consumption price can be established in respect of a commodity only if its producers are given a guaranteed price. The wool-growers do not ask for that. If a government is prepared to give the protection of a guaranteed price it is entitled to something in return. Certainly the exchange rate has some effect on the price of imported woollen goods to the user. The producer benefits from the exchange rate on the wool that he exports and when it is imported in the form of a manufactured article it carries the added cost of the exchange rate. However, the wool-grower pays his portion of that added cost because he pays the same as every other member of the public for the imported manufactured article. He pays no more and no less and the buying public contriOrder! The butes no more and no less by way of the",91,Avooi He Must Produce I N Order To Qualify

It cannot be 'said that the exchange rate is of particular benefit to the primary producer only. It is of enormous benefit to every exporting industry in Australia. There is no exchange rate borne by homeconsumed home-produced goods and so in respect of most essential commodities such as the foodwe eat and the clothes we wear the exchange rate does not affect t.he oost of living in those respects. I hope that we shall hear no more about the exchange rate being of enormous benefit only to the primary producer, at the expense of the non-primary producer. If U no such thing. The wool industry has never been subsidized, and it is not seekw ill not be prepared to participate in the ing a subsidy now. All that it asks the Government to do is to provide the machinery to enable it to help itself. To my knowledge that is all that the wool-growers have asked of any government during the last 30 years. All that they want is an opportunity to help themselves. They do not want their industry to be the subject of government exploitation. [10.31] I have risen to speak on this measure only because of the statements made by the honourable member for Af.oore ( Mr Leslie) and by the Minister please himself about whether he particiwho introduced this bill. A f t e r hearing tlieir speeches honourable members on this side are wondering why the Government parties, when they were in Opposition, made sueh an outcry against the Chifley Government's so-called interference with the riehts of the individual. Honourable members who were then in Opposition said that the individual did not want government interference, but the very essence of this legislation is that the wool-growers want the Government to interfere in their affairs. This measure will compel every one of the wool growers to participate in it . request. there are 50,000 wool-growers in Ausmarketing. tralia and that 45,000 of them want this made so that if wool prices f a l l some funds scheme to be introduced. If the other will be available to cushion the effect on 5.000 do not want it, they w ill certainly our economy. It is to be left to the Gonot be relieved of their obligations under vernment to declare a minimum price. the legislation. ""When this measure is put into force all the wool-growers, even those wbo do not want to participate, will have to pay the levy. If the wool growers could operate their industry efficiently without government interference, they would not want this legislation. I think that the measure is of great value, but I also think that it is in accordance with much legislation that the previous Government thought was of great value but which was roundly condemned by the then Opposition. I believe that although this legislation may be enacted, a long time w i ll elapse before it is put into force. I am of the opinion that a sufficient number of wool-growers scheme and so it w ill be rendered useless. I hope I am wrong, because I think that it is a good scheme for assisting tinman on the bottom rung of the woolgrowing ladder. It has been suggested that the big wool-growers are of the: opinion that they can ensure the well-being of their own futures while woo! prices are high. If the big wool-grower? opoose this measure, then it is almost certain that it will never be proclaimed and put into operation. My main reason for rising is to t r y to expose as false the statements made by the honourable member for Moore that the wool-grower can pates in the scheme or not. It is quite apparent that if the majority of the wool growers want the scheme then every pound of wool sold, whether it comes fro m them or from the minority who do not want it , will be affected by the provisions of the legislation. Honourable members, when speaking to this measure, should be honest and say straight out that they believe that the Labour party was right when it advocated schemes for orderly marketing. In the past the Government parties opposed the referendum which was held to seek power over the marketing of at their own primary products, but the Labour party believed that something should that have heen done to ensure orderly Provision should now be",92,Avooi He Must Produce I N Order To Qualify

278,Mr Thompson,"Assum ei f tlio wool-grower is not satisfied with the declared price, that price will still be enforced. That provision is designed to protect the industry against future low prices, and also to ensure that although the consumers pay high prices for wool to-day the wool-growers, when prices f a l l, will not unduly suffer from the effects of the fall. IVloore said that the exchange rate benents the producer in regard to the wool exported, but not in regard to the wool sold in Australia. That seems to be very poor reasoning to my mind. The exchange rate of 25 per cent, has an effect upon the incomes of all the people. If a wool-grower buys machinery from overseas, or a. Rolls Royce motor car, he has to pay more for it because of the difference of 25 per cent, in the exchange rate. It docs not matter whether the wool is sold overseas or in Australia, the man who bids the highest price gets the wool. I think that Labour policy is now hearing f r u it . When a Government tries to link communism and socialism with the Lahour party, and then puts forward a measure such as this is, it, is showing thnt its own ideas are not so far removed from those of the Labour party. The Government intends to save some of the receipts from the present high price of wool so that that money can be used to offset low prices in the future, I quite agree with that policy, but honourable members on the Government side should not mislead the people by pretending that private, enterprise is introducing this scheme on its own initiative. If private enterprise were doing what is now proposed the need for this legislation would not exist. Therefore, it cannot be said that this measure is not a form of government interference. Tf the majority of those engaged in woolgrowing want this scheme, then the minority will have no option but to participate in it . <nys that that is wrong? it is wrong, I believe in that system; but 1 say that the honourable member for Moore has been indulging in some sort of trash to induce the people to believe that this legislation is not a scheme of government control, but is merely a. kind of pvivate enterprise. The answer to that is that, if the majority want this scheme, the minority have no option but to participate in it . This scheme is to guard against the effect of possible low prices for wool in the future. That is orderly marketing in accordance with the policy preached by the Labour party in the past. I . a m very pleased that the Ministerf o r . The honourable member for Commerce and Agriculture, and many of the wool-growers, have at last seen the light. [10.41] I support the proposal to provide a f u n d by way of a levy on all wool sold. As a wool-grower I w ill welcome the formation of a stabilization scheme. Recognition by the Labour party of the importance of the wool industry was demonstrated in 1945, when legislation dealing with this subject was first brought in . I am pleased that a majority of members of thc Opposition support this present proposal. The importance of wool to the national economy can be realized when we recall that wool account-, for no less than 25 per cent, of the national income. The Government .is aware of its importance, and is prepared to do everything possible to assist a stabilization scheme, and to underwrite it if necessary. It was most gratifying to hear that the Australian Wool Growers Council has approved of a stabilization scheme in principle. There was some misunderstanding on the subject, and it was thought for a while that the council would not agree. A considerable section of the wool-growers is still opposed to the basic principle of a scheme, as was shown by the fact that the proposal was carried in New South Wales hy only a small majority of growers*. that? growers are afraid of government control of the kind that has operated in so many, other primary industries. Members of the I do not say that Australian Country party are in favour of organized marketing; but, under the Labour Government, marketing schemes were operated in such a way that the home-consumption price of commodities was too low, and the industries became dependent upon a high export price.

283,Mr Charles Rtjssell,"Th eSuch an arrangement creates a dangerous situation, because the whole price structure becomes based on the consumption price. The Government now is in somewhat the same predicament as that of a man riding on the back of a tiger. Once he is on he dare not get off. Eurther, this method of marketing tends to give a special privilege to one section of the community. It offends my conception of economic freedom, which after all pervades all liberty, that a government should give a special privilege to any section of a community. We want the wool market to remain free, and the only way to ensure that is to retain the auction system. The honourable member for East Sydney( Mr facturer than the price at which it can Ward) suggested that there should be a home-consumption price for wool; but, if there were a home-consumption price, there could not be a free market, and that is why the growers oppose that idea. Many growers would prefer to suffer from the vagaries of a free market, with all its dependable minimum is fixed, buyers will -risks, rather than be thrown to the wolves on some socialistic plan. The scheme envisaged is a growers' scheme, as the Minister has explained, and its most important feature is that it preserves the system of free auctions. The Government will collect a levy on wool sold, and will have a say in determining the reserve price. There is no need to fear government control if free marketing is retained. Certain legislative enactments have already proved of great benefit to wool-growers, particularly the abolition of the draft concession, and the provision for the marketing of wool in the order of its arrival in store. The growers want a marketing scheme that will ensure a floor price based on the cost of production, and the American"" real"" price. America is one of the few countries with a sound currency to-day, and it is also the greatest single consumer of manufactured and raw wool. It has been suggested that the American price should be adopted as the base price, having regard to our own costs, and with this I agree. A possihle formula might be the American price less import duty, with, say, a reduction of 10 per cent. One of the objections raised by those opposed to a stabilization scheme is that we cannot dictate to the world what the price of wool should be. For my part, I Mr Charles Russell. have a liking for a free market witb its natural correctives, but the fact is that manufacturers fix the price of their commodities according to the cost of production, and wages are fixed by arbitration tribunals. Even the value of our currency is arbitrarily fixed. Therefore, those who benefit from the fixing of the prices of manufactured goods, and from the fixing of wages, cannot have it both ways by insisting on a free market for wool. TJnder this scheme, both the growers and the buyers of wool will be protected. Baw wool is worth no more to the manube purchased by his competitor. Losses incurred in the trade are duo more to the competition of cheaper wool on a falling market than to mistakes in valuing on the part of buyers, or in the competition of other fibres. It is believed that once a be able to advance their prices 20 to 30 per cent, with a confidence that they do not now feel. It is astonishing that any one should oppose a stabilization scheme after the remarkable success achieved hy the Joint Organization. It may be argued that the rising market was responsible for the success achieved, but let us see what happened when the Australian Wool Eealization Commission was operating. Then there were in effect two floor prices. There was the base .price at which wool was taken from the growers, and the price at which it was placed on the market for sale by the * British Government. Eventually, there stood to the credit of the Australian and the British Governments an amount of Â£200,000,000 representing profits earned in that way. We shared it equally. The CHAIEMAN Order! The honourable member's time has expired. other honourable member has risen, I shall take my second period now. The point is that the wool was sold for Â£20,000,000 above what was considered to be a payable price. Many growers object to the proposed scheme because they consider that the finance that will be needed for it will be beyond the capacity of the industry to bear. The Government envisages a levy",94,Avooi He Must Produce I N Order To Qualify
284,Mr Chaeles Eussell,"As no-of 10 per cent. That estimate is unnecessarily high in my opinion. In fact, thc amount of money necessary to conduct such a scheme will not be very great. Assuming a floor price of, say, 24d. per lb., and assuming we have to buy in, say, -50 per cent, of the clip, the amount required will be about Â£50,000,000. The levy contribution on that, amount would be approximately Â£5,000,000, which would leave an amount of Â£45,000,000 That wool would be worth something. We can assume a bank would advance at least 60 per cent, of its value, and that suggests worth then, and the adjustment on thai -that we could raise on it an amount of Â£30,000,000, leaving Â£15,000,000 that might be regarded as a risk. As the Minister has informed us tbere is a total of about Â£7,000,000 derived from the profits of the previous wool realization scheme that cannot be identified with any particular section of the growers. This money could be used as a nucleus for the proposed new scheme. That would reduce the amount needed for the fund in this Instance, to about Â£8,000,Q00, which is less than the excess of the budget -estimate of wool-growers' tax payments. That fact conveys some impression of the importance of wool and indicates how comparatively easy it would be to raise the funds necessary to ensure continued stability in the industry. I have stated the case on a most conservative basis. Actually we could reasonably expect that the first 50 per cent, of the wool sold would be of high quality. The remaining lower grade wool to be bought in would not represent a heavy potential liability. experiences, it is more likely that the buy-in would be 5 per cent, of the clip instead of 50 per cent. If that were the case the nucleus of Â£7,000,000 that I have mentioned would be suflicient to finance the scheme. Our experience in recent years has It is not reasonable to blame the industry shown that wool has unique storage qualifor the inflation. It may be placed in a ties. It is non-perishable. Wool that has difficult situation soon because of the rise been in store for as long as ten years has that is likely to occur in all commodity been used without any apparent bad prices. The amount of money in the effects. As the honourable member for community to-day is 500 per cent, Lalor( Mr Pollard) has pointed out, the above the level of 1939, but the quantity necessary storage facilities and the organiof goods and services available to be zation already exist. The objections of purchased with the money is only 30 per certain wool-growers are therefore difficult cent, above the 1939 level. According to understand. The present transient boom suggests that the wool industry is enjoying great prosperity, but the truth is that the situation is not so good as it appears to be. The price of wool is a "" real"" price, and it serves as a measure for the degree of inflation in our economy. The present situation is not without precedent. In 1924-25, the price of wool reached tbe level of 29-^d. sterling, which, allowing for exchange adjustment, represented about 36d. in Australia. The Â£1 to-day is worth only half as much as it was account brings the 1924-25 figure to the equivalent of 72d. to-day. The average price to-day is 80d. Taking into consideration the present high rates of tax and the problems of shortages of labouT and materials in the industry, it becomes obvious that the situation to-day is more difficult than it was in 1924-25. The exchange difference of 25 per centi between Australian currency and sterling was applied in order to help the wool industry in particular during the period of economic depression. ably not, but it needed help then. The situation reminds me of a man who takes an aspirin tablet to cure a headache. Figuratively speaking, the wool industry took an aspirin tablet when the depression caused a headache, but it continued to take more aspirins after the headache had disappeared. I do not know what Having regard to earlier we are to do if it gets another headache. After all, the present high prices for wool are not likely to be maintained. The problems of the wool industry to-day arise largely from currency inflation, which has been attributed largely to the effects of the financial policy that was pursued by the Chifley Government. to Professor Gifford, of the University",95,Avooi He Must Produce I N Order To Qualify

286,Mr Charles Russell,"Probof Queensland, this situation will cause a general price rise of about 50 per cent. Professor Gifford has made his own calculations, and I do not know whether it is an accurate prediction or not, but, if such a rise eventuates, wool prices will not appear to be high at all when costs are inflated to this extent. ""We should bear those facts in mind and remember how important the industry is to the genera""! economy of Australia. I have much pleasure in supporting the motion. -In view of the late hour and the keen desire of the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Chifley) and his colleagues to repair to their couches, I shall not delay the committee for long. Eor the first time over a long period, all parties are in agreement on this issue. We know that the proposed plan is only a provisional measure. The Government's intention is to take time by the forelock so as to enable the wool-growers to formulate amongst themselves a scheme to stabilize their industry. If tliis measure had not been introduced now and if the wool growers had decided later on that they wanted a scheme of this kind, a valuable year would have been wasted.

SU PEKPIiOS PHATE. honourable member for ""Wilmot( Mr at peak price been manifested by graziers' Duthie) asked the following question:I ask the Prime Minister whether the Government has approved of the phospate rock project on Christmas Island whicli is a joint project which the Chifley Government entered into jointly with the New Zealand Government. If the Government intends to proceed with this most important project when w i ll rhe working of tire Christmas Island sulphate rock deposits commence f I ask this question iu view of the growing demands on super sulphate by Australian primary producers? The Prime Minister then intimated that the matter raised is not one for attention by his department and that a. full answer would be prepared. I am now in a position to advise the honourable inember as follows:The Christinas' Island phosphate undertaking was jointly purchased by the Australian and New Zealand Governments as a going -concern as at the 31st December, 1948, and -since that date the production of phosphate has been continued and expanded by the British Phosphate Commissioners' as managing agents for the two Governments. The phosphate from Christmas Island, which had previously been purchased by the British Phosphate Commissioners under an ordinary commercial supply -contract, has continued to be released to fertilizer works in Australia, principally in Western Australia, thereby releasing a corresponding tonnage of phosphate from Nauru and Ocean Island for delivery in eastern Australia and New Zealand.

Have any expressions of alarm been made to the Goveriunent by representatives of tlie graziers regarding the purchase by Russia of Large ijinintities of wool at peak prices, and Jia# any unwillingness to sell their wool to Bussia organizations? honourable member's questions are as follows:1. Statistics compiled by the Commonwealtli Statistician show that 99,4113 bales of wool were shipped to Bussia during the twelve months from the 1st March, 194.9, to the 28th February, 1950. Official details are not available of the quantity purcliased by Russia.

Is it a fact that there is an almost insatiable demand for canned and frozen tuna in the United States of America and that Australia, by the development of its tuna resources, has the opportunity to earn much-needed dollars? 2. Ie it a fact that the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Eesearch Organization has established that, although tuna exists practically all around the Australian coast, the three main fields are in south-eastern Australia, South Australia and Western Australia? 3. Is it a fact that, whereas the American tuna fields are up to 3,000 miles from the centres of population, our main tuna fields are in close proximity to centres of manufacture and consumption? 4. Is it a fact that the information available regarding Australian tuna resources is much greater than that which was available to the Californian industry at the outset of the development of the resources there? 5. Isi t a fact that, in regard to the development of tuna resources, South Africa is in much the same position as Australia, aud that, recently, the South African Governinent purchased a Californian tuna vessel and engaged the crew for the purpose of instructing South African fishermen in the highly specialized techniques of tuna fishing? fi. Isi t a fact that Australian canneries are poultry feed. Queensland has the utmost prepared to take all the tuna that can be supplied to them? 7. Will he give consideration to purchasing or chartering a tuna vessel from California and engaging the crew as Soutli Africa has done, thereby taking the necessary practical steps to place tuna fishing on a sound basis? honourable member's questions are as follows:1. Over the last twelve to eighteen. months some buyers' resistance to canned tuna has developed in the United States and priees have fallen. Australian shipments of frozen tuna to the United States of America have been well received, but because of freight costs and difficulties in securing suitable refrigerated space, have not been very profitable. However, it is hoped to overcome these difficulties. will make application to the Director2. The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Eesearch Organization has demonstrated the presence of tuna all around the Australian coast. The only area where tuna has been commercially exploited ie on the south coast of New South Wales. The Fisheries Division of my department is continuing its development work in this field to extend commercial operations to other areas, particularly Tasmania, South Australia and Western Australia, where canning facilities exist. 3. Until the stocks of tuna in Australian waters have been fully exploited commercially, honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr it would be unwise to suggest that the main Bowden) asked a question concerning the stocks are in close proximity to centres of manufacture and consumption. It may befound at a later stage that the main stocks are located in distant waters and the tuna only visit our waters during a particular season. 4. It is extremely doubtful that we have more information regarding the resources than that which was available to the Californian industry. Only commercial exportation can determine the full extent of this resource. 5. Yes. 6. No. Intake is limited and depends on canning and cool storage facilities. Fishermen, on the south coast of New South Wales had to stop fishing because canneries could not handle the catch. 7. The question of securing a tuna vessel has been receiving the consideration of the Fisheries Division of my department for some time. However, Australian fishermen have demonstrated their ability to catch tuna commercially once given the necessary market. Approximately 1,000 tons of tuna were taken ou the south coast of New South Wales by a limited number of boats in the five months ending February. honourable member for Darling Downs( Mr Swartz) asked a question concerning the granting of export licences foT difficulty in obtaining adequate supplies of bran and pollard for poultry feeds while protein meals are equally difficult to obtain in sufficient quantities. As the position in regard to these commodities in olher States is also difficult, the export of these commodities, and of feeding meals containing them, is subject to control and is permitted only with the prior approval of my department. It is assumed that the question asked by the honourable member has relation to poultry foods containing ingredients which are on the restricted export list. This list has been in operation for several years.
