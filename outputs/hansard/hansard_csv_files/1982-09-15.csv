It chance to talk about statutory marketing authoriis interesting to note that many primary producers ties in general. As honourable members know, regard the statutory marketing authorities as they are coming under more and more criticism, grower financed and, therefore, entirely grower whether it be by Senator Rae's Senate Standing organisations. Recently this was drawn out in a Committee on Finance and Government Operspeech by the General Manager of the Australian ations or by the Australian Meat and Livestock Wheat Board. He said that the first question Corporation.

In practice the SMAs commercial flexibility. As they are currently are in many cases as much consumer funded as structured, membership of the boards of the grower funded organisations. SMAs is largely in the hands of industry organisations. Greater consideration needs to be given to A necessary consequence of the legislated monthe role of professionals in the marketing authoriopoly powers under which they operate is that the ties and to splitting the role of the industry links between the SMAs and the Government dominated boards from that of the professional should be just as strong, although different in staff in the authorities.
