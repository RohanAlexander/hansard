What would be the all. consequence of the High Court, with the two additional justices sitting, coming to the conclusion There are one or two other matters that I would that the minority view was right? That would like to touch upon before I sit down. First of all, I frustrate everything that we are seeking here to would like to say something about what has been do. I therefore propose that the Government 'said by the Minister for Communications ( Mr should accept an arriendment along the following Duffy). He has raised some questions which his lines. I am sorry I have not had time to type it out, Government should be answering. First of all, he but we have had rather short notice of this debate talked about the 'no further action required' file, and it is something which occurred to me as I was which he said was dated 4 January 1982. We have examining the Bill. I suggest that, at the end of heard the Attorney-General tell this House: proposed new section 7BA, the following be 'There was a lost treaty, the lost treaty turned up inserted: in a drawer somewhere and, dear me, these things happen, but it happened during your time'. Perfor from the very start, under the guise of saying haps the Attorney-General could tell us whether to the Opposition: 'You are wrong and we were the treaty had been signed. It had not, I would right. AllI have been doing is getting things in assume. order'. We find that we have before us a Bill Mr Lionel Bowen-Oh, come on! It was which is so framed as to frustrate the intent that initialled. this Government apparently seeks to achieve. Let me go over the three points again. First of all, it is intended that the material that Mr Justice tialled between the governments? Can he tell us Stewart is going to see should be available for the what was done by him when the Trimbole queslaw enforcement authorities to prosecute crimition arose to see what the state of extradition was nals. We know that the High Court may rule, and between Ireland and Australia? Will he tell why, certainly it is likely that it will be called upon to in the time between learning that Trimbole was in rule, that this material is wholly inadmissible. Yet Ireland and making the application to the Irish nothing has been done about that by this Governcourt, an extradition treaty was not concluded bement. We know, as the shadow Attorney-General tween the two countries in the briefest possible has pointed out, that the Attorney-General says time, particularly as there was a copy lying one thing in his second reading speech-that is, around in the drawer? It would have been a matthat the interceptions are to stop-and yet plainly ter of great ease, one would think. The Attorney in the Bill itself, which he has brought before the would have asked his Department: What do we House, it is contemplated that the material which know about Ireland? What treaties do we have is to go to Mr Justice Stewart and which may be with Ireland? Somebody would have said: 'Look, covered by the indemnity will include material we have something sitting in the drawer; we had that becomes available in the future because of better dig it out'. That is the first question that he future intercepts. We have the situation that those would have asked. That question was obviously who may wish to disclose material will have to not asked by him. make a judgment as to whether or not that Mr Lionel Bowen-Oh, come on; wake up! material would support a criminal conviction or what the fact is. material will not be covered by an indemnity. These are the sorts of questions this GovernMadam DEPUTY SPEAKER ( Mrs ment must look at. If it is truly concerned about Child)-Is the matter relevant to the Bill before dealing with the whole question of the Age tapes the House? and the other material, if it is deeply concerned Speaker, it is, because it has been raised by the result of Mr Justice Stewart's enlarged terms of Minister who spoke on the subject. We know in reference, the only sensible thing it can do is to this House that anything the Minister says must plug the holes which apparently exist in the Bill be relevant. That, at least, is the ruling which we now before the House. I would agree with one in opposition have experience of getting. The thing that the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs( Mr Stewart recommendations told the Government Holding) said. I hope that all of us in this House to monitor the treaties. Why has that not been are concerned to do as much as we can about done? Why was it not done in Trimbole's case? organised crime. But if the Attorney-General and How is it that this Attorney-General can come those with him are concerned to do as much as here talking about a lost treaty without telling us they can about organised crime, they will agree to what was involved, whether it was a treaty, when some amendments which can be put through very it was signed and who knew about it? How is it quickly, which will enlarge the net and overcome that he can say: 'Look, when I came to Trimbole, the kind of technical problems which otherwise as with any other matter, I acted with the kind of might entirely frustrate the intent of Mr Justice diligence that you would expect of me'.
