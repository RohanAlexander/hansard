Referred to Committee of Supply. of Defence, in reply to a question which I asked yesterday, stated that he intended to send a barge with a dredge that is to be despatched to Western Australia. Will the honourable gentleman obtain the opinions of nautical men as to the reasonableness of making a steam hopper barge the escort of a dredge for such a journey ? to cross the Bight in a barge 1 is to be sent from Melbourne to Fremantle, will be accompanied by the steam hopper barge Leander, recently purchased from the Launceston Marine Board. This barge is a newly-built vessel of about 700 tons displacement, which can travel at the rate of nine knots an hour, and has steamed out from England. To insure the safety of those who will travel on the dredger the Government intends that the barge and dredger shall be accompanied from Melbourne to Adelaide by the Protector, and from Adelaide to Fremantle by the South Australian lighthouse steamer Musyrave; and every other measure that can be devised for the safety of both vessels will be taken. chair at 3.30 and read prayers.",4,Setup

57,Dr. Maloney (Melbourne) [3.50]. Live The Greater Is Their Chance Of Pre,"almost circumnavigated Asia, and who told his large audience that the statement at that time so often made as to Eussian diplomacy being of a Machiavellian character was ridiculous in the extreme. The memory of that lecture had been long forgotten, but flashed into memory again when this terrible war broke out. I bring here for honourable members to see a map of Norway and Sweden. When the Russian army had crushed the Swedish forces, and the diplomatists were forming new boundaries between the two empires, Russia, which has always been held up as being the most sinuous in its policy and means of attaining its own ends, acted as foolishly as any nation postative government of a republic that has sibly could. Honourable members will see by consulting the maps that if the boundary had beencarried to the Tornea River, Russia would have gained ample harbors to accommodate every navy in the wide world, and harbors which are open every day in the year; but the di2)lomatists of Russia allowed themselves to be fooled, so that the boundary was fixed at the Tana River. Even then, had the boundary been carried northwards to the North Cape, Russia would havegained good harborage all the year round. But that country's diplomatists were hoodwinked to such an extent that the boundary was edged away u n t il it was brought within 20 miles of the Varanger Fjord, with the result that Russia does not possess to-day one single harbour which is open to shipping all the year round. If Australia were without an open port, is there an honourable member of this House who would not t r y his utmost to secure for his country that advantage? Let honourable members imagine a nation of 150,000,000 people, possessing an enormous territory, but without one port which is workable year in and year out. What would we of the British race do if any country of ours were in the same position? We would fight to the last man and spend the last penny we could obtain on credit in order to rectify such a position. Honourable members may sav that this is only a question of policy. I do not think it is. Members of this House and my constituents well know that kings, opinion was early founded on the book of the holy prophet Samuel, and I have never heard logical reasons for changing it . But we know that the potentate who presides over the Britisb race is so limited in power that the British monarchy is the best example of the kingly institution that is to be found in the world to-day. If I were asked what monarch in the last 100 years has shown the most advancement, I should say that he was the present Czar of Russia. Honourable members may have formed the opinion from their reading that the United States of America represents the acme of progress on the part df the Anglo-Saxon-Celtic race, for in that country 100,000,000 of English-speaking people are governed by laws which are based on Democracy-the only represenexisted for over 100 years. Yet, granted that the United States of America may have reached tlie apex of civilization, let me place before honourable members two contrasting pictures. On the one hand, the United States of America freed 4,000,000 slaves at a cost of Â£1,500,000,000 sterling, and also of 500,000 human lives in killed and wounded. But in freeing them from the old-time slavery, they l e f t them in the position of wage slaves, frequently begging from the estates on which previously they had possessed recognised masters, and had founded homes. ""On the other hand, i h the sixties of last century, one-Czar of Russia freed 21,000,000 serfs at a cost of only Â£300,000,000, which was paid to the nobles of Russia, and without the loss of one human life. Did Russia leave those former serf3 to become wage slaves ? No. Every family was settled on a piece of land of from 30 to 40 acres at a cost of 40s. per adult male, the land becoming the property of those families at the end of forty years. Families who had no male workers to operate the farms had the right of claiming 10 acres of the richest land without fee or cost. In this way, no fewer than 500,000 families were settled on some of the richestland in Russia. They were not obliged to live like ..the liberated slaves of the United States of America, for houses were buil t for them, farm implements were found, and seed was provided. That is the greatest act of manumission in the I have little regard for history of the world. In J. N . Larned's emperors, and czars. My Historyf or Ready Reference, I find this' paragraph in regard to serfdom and emancipation in RussiaIn the earliest period of Russian history the rural population was composed of three distinct classes. At the bottom of the scale stood the slaves, who were very numerous. Their numbers were continually augmented by prisoners of war, by freemen who voluntarily sold themselves as slaves, by insolvent debtors, and by certain categories of criminals. Sucli were tlie slaves freed by the ukase of the Czar, and without the loss of a single life, and at a cost of Â£300,000,000, which was paid to the nobles. fact we have the explanation Russia to-day has more families settled on the land than all the countries of the world put together, exclusive of AustriaHungary. dence of the advancement of the human race in Russia. Czar, we have but to remember that in 1906, in the archdukedom he gave his subjects a franchise as free and extended as that we enjoy in Australia. In fact, it is more advanced than our Australian franchise, for to-day there are sitting in the Finnish twenty-two women who have been elected to represent the people. Never in the history of the world had there been such an increase of voters as followed the granting of the Finnish Constitution. to that date the Duchy of Finland had only 10,000 voters, but under the 1906 ukase of the Czar that number was increased to 1,500,000-an increase equal, I think, to 15,000 per cent. I remember as a student in England in the early eighties that a great fuss was made when the voters of England were increased by about 45,000,000. But Finland, with a little over 3,500,000 people, experienced an increase in its voters from 1,500,000 by one act. That is one great act of liberation which the present Czar has had the honour of doing for his people. The next is one that is unparalleled the history of any nation. known that since this terrible war was declared Â£70,000,000 nated Â£70,000,000 country's revenue to put down the excessive use of alcohol. en this question, takes up the position that the Almighty never sent a curse on to this earth per se. No curse was ever sent as a curse in itself. -f anything that makes it a curse; but we must admire the governing body of any nation who can accept, as Russia did, the ukase of the Czar sacrificing Dr. Â£70,000,000 sterling. Imagine that as a deficit in the revenue of the British Empire! That is' the second great act of the present Czar. Thet h i r d and last of whicli I will speak is the definite promise that Poland shall have self government, and that the Jewish racewhich in Russia has increased from In that 2,000,000 to 7,000,000, while the populaof why tion of Ireland has decreased from 8,000,000 to a little over 4,000,000shall have greater justice meted out to it than it has had by the different GovernThat was the first great eviments of the past.

Their laws are founded on justice simply because the people are the dominant power, and can rule and Parliament make whatever laws they wish to obey. Therefore, in asking this House to accept this motion, I feel that I am not asking them to strain any political opinion. I am not asking them to do any injustice Prior to any theory or idea that they may hold. I am merely asking them, on the simple score of humanity-that we, being blessed with a magnificent freedom, and knowing how in our Australia self-government exists to such an extent that even the self-governing power of the States cannot be submerged into that of the CommonAvealth-to recognise the great1,400,000 in a population of ness of this act on the part of a ruling monarch-eve n of a Czar.

63,Mr Glynn (Angas) [4.34],"I hadopinion, a matter of time. We have not to go very far back, even in our own history-althoug h the trend of British policyhas always been in the direction of freedom-to find that even in ourselves there were features objectionable from the point of view of modern ideals. We cannot ignore the fact that in 1861 the Czar by a ukase, the issue of which rested entirely with himself, emancipated something like 21;000,000 people, and in doing so actually anticipated by a generation the agrarian legislation of western Europe. That step was in advance of anything that had been done in the British Empire up to that time, the agrarian legislation of the United Kingdom beginning something like twenty years later. We should not lose sight of the fact that in other respects Bussia is a great nationa fact of which, perhaps, we have not been as fully conscious as we should have been. In music,. in literature, and in many of the great humanities of life, Bussia stands in the highest plane of modern advancement. The character of her music is eminently national, and so with her literature, and whatever may be said oi' the theories of Tolstoy, I have always looked on him as one of the great forces of the century. If we have not given expression to this view of Bussiai t is because the occasion has not arisen. I regard the motion as in no way an attempt to direct the course of the policy to be adopted in regard to Poland, because such a motion would have been lacking in taste. In international relations the voice has to be one of union, and if any suggestions are to be made they means of but mendations and Ministers to the Imperial Government. Whatever is said or done should be through the central power, as voicing the sentiments of the Empire; and it would not be becoming to attempt in any way to direct the course of policy of a greatEuropean power with whom we are allied. Any opinion, necessary, for the great experience of the world shows what a blessing autonomy is, within proper limits, to any country; and by Bussia the present time is regarded as opportune for that emancipation which has been the ardent desire of the people of Poland for many generations past. There can be no offence in the motion, but I think it would have been better had the Government, in consultation with the honourable member, considered the expediency of entering into communication w it h the Imperial Government, or of having the motion so worded that its true intent should be at once manifest to the ordinary reader-as nothing more than perhaps the expression of enthusiastic felicitation upon the fact that public assurance has been given by Bussia that advantage will be taken of the end of the war to declare a still further .extension of the principles of democratic government. do not wish to say anything that would wound the honourable member who has submitted this motion. I recognise the good spirit in which the proposal has been presented, but, personally, I think it is scarcely our place, particularly at this period, to pass a motion of the sort in this Parliament. I have not the slightest doubt that the Czar of Russia will honorably redeem his promise; and we all hope that the issue of the war will be such ts to enable the Polish people once more to be united under one king-that Poland will be given that autonomy for which she has struggled through so many centuries.

ResolvedThat we, the members of the House of Bepresentatives of the Commonwealth of Australiadirect and active allies of Bussia in the present war-enjoyin g and appreciating as we do the blessings of Home Rule in Australia, convey our congratulations to His Imperial Majesty the Czar on his great promise to grant Home Rule to Poland, and we respectfully express the hope that a triumphant issue of the war will guarantee a generous measure of Home Rule to the peoples of Poland as a whole. The loyalty of the self-governing countries of the British Empire to the United Kingdom in this time of stress has proved to the world that the nations that stand are those that within themselves rule by love and trust, and this Parliament of Australia conveys its fraternal greetings to the peoples of Poland in the hope of the early realisation of their ideals of a united nation.

That, I believe, will be generally realized. I know that it is impossible to d r ill all our young men, and at the same time to make them efficient marksmen, during their early training years; but I believe that a good deal more could be done than is actually being achieved. The great body of rifle clubs in Australia could be pressed into the service, and would enormously assist and supplement our system of citizen defence as established by law. Under the law as it stands, every young man has to undergo naval or military training until he reaches the age of twenty-five years; but the facilities for shooting that should be afforded our young men during thatperiod of training are not always forthcoming. It is impossible to establish at once all over Australia open ranges on which every one of our citizen soldiers can gain suflicient rifle practice to make him efficient. But there is another means by which this may be secured.

Minister of Home Affairs) [5.30] I have no desire to say very much with reference to this matter, for the very simple reason that if honourable members w ill t u r n up the Hansard report of the previous portion of the session, they w ill find that I have already spoken on the matter at some length; -and I do not think that very much w ill be gained by repeating what I have already said. Buti t may not be out of place if I mention one or two points that I relied upon in replying to the speech of the honourable member for Angas. Many of those Avho share the opinions of that honourable gentleman do not really understand what the object of Parliament is. It is certainly a place for the representation of the people; but common sense should guide the application of the principle upon whicli that representation is based. Extraordinary views have from time to time been propounded upon this subject, and I am afraid that many of those who discuss the matter discuss it superficially, without really understanding the real innovation and change they are advocating. I admit that the honourable member for Angas has taken a deep interest in t h is question for many years past, and I W ill the honourable memshould be the last to apply the word "" s u p e r f i c i a l "" to anything he does; b u t there are, nevertheless, a A'ery great number of people who do not really understand the significance of a proposal of this kind. The party with AvhichI am associated is the most advanced, politically, at the present time, and I hope I share the opinions of those with whom I have been associated for a great number of year? Let me call attention to the fundamental and vital objection to the proposal before the House. The Government of this community is in the hands of an Executive whose members have the confidence of a majority of the representatives of the people. That form of government exists throughout the British Empirei n its self-governing portions. During long years the Britisli people have acquired a larger measure of self-government than has any European nation, although European civilization generally has made great advances of late in matters of government. Our French brothers have a system of government which resembles (Hindmarshour own, though it differs from it . I shall not speak of the Germans, but the once much-despised Russians, who are now our friends, have also a freer Constitution than they used to have. The prejudices of the British and Australians against theRussians have hitherto prevented our understanding of our present allies, and have kept us from doing them justice.",18,Trade In Perishable Products

127,Mr Archibald,"I do not say that the present proposal would be the means of creating groups in our Parliament. objecting to groups his party is enabling groups outside to move Parliament. of that character does not go yery f a r . However, I spoke on this question some time ago, and no good is to be gained by repetition. I ask honourable members to realize that the alteration proposed would revolutionize our Parliament. I support everything of a progressive charactereverything that means a better distribution of wealth and progress generallyand that great object, I contend, cannot be attained by the suggested alteration in .our electoral system. I therefore ask the House to reject the motion. have listened to a good deal of what the Minister has had to say, b u t he has not convinced me that it would not be advisable to adopt this motion, the introduction of which would, in my opinion, result in a much better system of electing senators. I do not assert that proportional representation is a perfect system, b u t for electing groups of members it is, so far as I know, the best that has yet been devised. In Tasmania, the House of As-sembly is elected on this plan, which is found to work out w i th mathematical exactitude. that the views of the people are represented in the House after the election. Nothing the Minister has said has touched the argument that Parliament should be a reflex of the opinions of the country. present time, and the best proof of that is afforded in the figures of the last two or three Senate elections. If , in 1910, the proportional system had been in operation, we should have had, instead of eighteen senators of one political party, probably ten Labour senators and eight Liberal senators. A similar observation is equally true of the subsequent election; and even after the double dissolution proportional representation would have resulted, in all probability, not in the ret u r n of thirty-one Labour senators and five Liberal senators, but, say, twenty Labour senators and sixteen Liberal senators. equally divided between Liberal and Labour supporters, it is only right that, after an election, Parliament should fairly represent the political thought of the times; and the only system from which that may be expected is, so far as I know, A general remark proportional representation. parties into being in Tasmania? troduced any system of groups. Why? Simply because the public are divided at present into two great camps. And if the public were divided into four or five groups, why should they not have representation in proportion to their numbers? That would mean a Parliament which was something like a fair reflex of the political thought of the community. The mere fact of proportional representation, or of any other system, being in operation w ill not split the count r y up into groups, which, as a matter of fact, arises from different causes. In a Parliament which professes to legislate for the people every group of political thought should have its fair share of representation. If the system for which the honourable member for Angas contends be applied, we shall have in this Parliament a better state of affairs than at present exists. I am surprised at the attitude taken up by the Minister, who seems to regard as Conservatives those W it h what result? who desire to introduce into the electoral W it h the result system a change which must tend to im prove the parliamentary machine. Listening to the honourable gentleman, one would imagine his view to be that what was good enough for his grandfather is quite good enough for him. That is not I s it not? the policy of the Liberal party. EveryI t is not at the person professing Liberal views should be prepared to advocate reforms calculated to improve the condition of the people. I do not advocate a change merely for the sake of change; what I want are changes that w ill mean improvement, and I contend that the application of the proportional system of voting to the Senate would be an improvement upon that which now obtains. Only last year we had a general election at which the number of Liberal electors recording their votes was only slightly less than the number of Labour voters, yet thirty-one Labour candidates were returned to the Senate, while only five Liberal candidates Seeing that the country is so secured election.

I have always supported the preferential or contingent votesystem for the election of members of this House, and the proportional voting system for the Senate, with group electorates. Such a system, I believe, would be the fairest to adopt, having regard only to the in No doubt the honterests of the Commonwealth. I understand that honourable members opposite, at their own meetings, adopt the preferential voting system, although they would deny it to the electors of Australia. ballot. orable members opposite, at their own meetings, adopt a far more intellectual system than that which they are preT h e Senate did pared to give the electors of the Commonwealth.

It is, as I view it , essentially a war statement, and has little to do with matters not relating to the war. I do not propose to traverse its contents, for the position, as I understand it , is not changed from what it was when this Parliament met. The Empire was then at war; it is at war to-day.

These subjects may be dealt with separately and at other times, if need be. I hope sincerely there may be no need to trouble the House with debate upon them at the present time. If I rightly judge the duty of this House and the duty of the country at the present time, it is to eschew S i m p l y beall party considerations of any kind whatever, to vote war supplies, and deal with all matters relating to the vigorous conduct of the war, and then let the House close at the earliest moment until some further war considerations make it necessary to reassemble. That being my view, therefore, I do not propose to deal with controversial matters to any extent.

204,Mr Jose Ph Cook,"I hope that myI tlo not believe there will be tlie faintest echo in the country of some of the complaints heard to-day of the necessary curtailments of the privileges of members to introduce motions und Bills. That is a dignified protest against the importation of tlie element of partisanship into the considerations of the chamber. Mr Bonar Law has spoken in the same spirit. He saidAt ordinary times the Opposition very reluctantly gives such powers into the hands of the Government; but the fact that the Government makes this claim itself implies that the Prime Minister has stated that our Government intends to act as the Government of France is acting, and as, I am pleased to see, the Government of the Dominion of Canada intends to act; and that is to treat this session as a war session, and so long as the war lasts not to introduce any controversial legislation. T intend to press this point, for it is well that The British people, had they had no misunderstanding should arise. But after what the Prime Minister has said, and after the words by Lord Crewe yesterday, and for which, I am sure, the right honourable gentleman accepts responsibility, I think it is unnecessary to say more. Those words were, "" So far as the conduct of business is concerned, we do not propose to introduce any contentious business, but to confine ourselves entirely to such measures as are concerned one way or another with the prosecution of the war."" I entirely accept that declaration. There is nothing more to be said on the subject. We have been told that in Canada, before the session opened, Sir Robert Borden assured SirW i l f r i d Laurier, in private conference, that the legislation to be brought down would be confined to war measures alone, and that it was hoped that party strife would be absent from the debates as it was during the earlier war session. I ask this Government whether it is to be the only one within the Empire which intends to proceed while a great war is in progress as if there were no war, amid party strife and contention. If we read the newspapers aright, millions of men are to-day at death grips for the sake of the empires that they represent. This is not the time ordinary social legislation. That can wait for a more favorable opportunity. Nothing w ill be lost by the postponement of its consideration to enable Parliament to devote itself exclusively to larger matters, and to leave the Government free in the exercise of its. executive functions and responsibilities to do what is needful for the vigorous prosecution of the war. Many result of the present Mr Joseph Cook. which it might be well to take timely consideration. There will be revolution in many directions. We cannot continue to live on the past. Longfellow has saidFor Time will teach the soon the truth, Thore aro no birds in last year's nest! One lesson of the war that has already been borne in upon us is the lesson of preparation. We have heard a great deal of what has been done, but an outstanding fact is that Democracy does not seem productive of good war machinery. A t any rate, we were fearfully unready when the war commenced. That is an answer to the taunt of the enemy that we had predatory designs on his possessions, and that he is fighting in self-defence. predatory designs upon Germany, would have shown themselves but sorry fools for being as unprepared as they were for war. Britain's state of unpreparedness is a complete and irrefutable answer to the charge of their opponents. Herei n Australia we have had to move almost heaven and earth to send away 40,000 men within eight and a half montlis. It is not fair to criticize our baby war machine, and I shall not do so. W it h us, defence matters are in a state of transition. Our organization is immature, and will not mature for some years to come. We may congratulate ourselves that it has responded to the wish of the people as efficiently as it has done. But it does not, afford the greatest possible satisfaction to reflect that between eight and nine months have been required for the equipping and despatch of 40,000 men. We must go on to the very end of the struggle, sending away fully-prepared and equipped men, so that we may take a w8rthy and adequate part in the defence of the Empire. In times of peace those who advocate preparation are termed alarmists, fool conin which to bring forward scriptionists, foes of liberty and peace. But on the Continent of Europe we are now reaping the harvest of our unpreparedness. Thousands of lives have been sacrificed, and scores of millions of pounds have been spent, which could have been saved by timely preparation for war. Had we been as ready as Germany, or even as some of our Allies, Germany would have crumpled up long before this. disturbance of no war.",27,Ministerial Statement Paper

I do not think that we shall get this trade or keep it hy means of any Tariff, unless we make ourselves efficient to keep it ; and that depends on our energy and initiative, which I believe are equal to those of any other country on the wide globe. However, I hope and believe that the Tariff arrangement w i ll be such, when we come to its consideration, as will make it possible that the volume of trade between the Allies shall increase in the ratio of its decrease with enemy countries. W it h the resources of an Empire like ours there ought to be no excuse for our present complete dependence on other countries for the supply of war material. The desired result, however, cannot be brought about by one section of the community only; but, as I pointed out in an address in Sydney the other day, it must be accomplished by a great co-operative effort. Manufacturers and producers alone cannot do what is required, no matter what the Tariff may be. The Tariff may, or may not, help them, but of itself the Tariff cannot accomplish the desired end. say, will require a great co-operative effort, there must be more generous banking than there has been in many parts of the Empire up to date. Merchants and shipping people must come into the effort, and there must be good patent laws, with a good legal system. The workers, too, must come in and do their share of the business. There seems to be indicated one of those problems that Macaulay had in his mind when he spoke of none being for party but all for the State. lish press the shippers at Home are taking f u l l advantage of the present positionany other course being adopted; but, I can only regret the fact.

Council the other day decided that there was required international unity in order to abolish war. That is a big contract.' International unity w ill , we hope, some day overcome the obstacles, prejudices, traditions, and causes of strife among the nations; but if international unity is needed amongst the workers of the world for the purpose of putting an end ""to this fearful warfare, what about a little in ternal unity? What about a little in ternal fraternity and co-operation for the purpose of preventing that class strife which is so rampant in the community, and enabling both sides in the struggle to join hands to promote their mutual interests, and t r y to reap some of the benefits of this great fratricidal warfare? Another matter that wil l come up for consideration is the rebuilding and repatriating, as we hope, of brave little Belgium, and also brave Poland. There will have to be a reconstitution of credit, finance, and industry. Then there is also the auestion of immigration, and its resumption so far as Australia is concerned a very difficult and none the lees necessary question, to be resolutely and patiently tackled by whoever has chargo of the Executive of Australia when the This, as I war shall cease. And we in Australia have our own local problems peculiar to ourselves that are already making their appearance on the horizon. These will need prompt and careful attention i m mediately the close of the war comes, and, indeed, before the close of the war.

I had been expecting him to make. I could not conceive of I hear it , and equally,' I have no sympathy whatever with any desire on the part of people at this end of the world, or anywhere else, to t r y to force a Conference at the present moment.

It is only defective statesmanship that has caused this trouble, heartburning, and anxiety, during these trying days. There are other problems connected with the New Hebrides, and so for t h , which it will be opportune to discuss when the war shall be at an end. Moreover, I can conceive many subjects appropriate to an Empire Conference connected with our shipping laws, and the maintenance of a White Australia. Japan, too, has made some changes in the Pacific, and there may be questions of a diplomatic character arising which can only be settled around a table at the proper time. Some prominent journalists in the Old Country are saying that the British people desire no territorial acquisitions as the result of the war. broadly and generally, but I venture to say that we in Australia expect some little additions to our territorial possessions in the Pacific. Despite those gentlemen who write thus at the other end of the world, I want to know why Germany, having entered on this war in her bid for world power, should not, in all fairness and reason, if she be beaten, be deprived of her [36]2 extra European possessions. Be that as it may, I hope that we in Australia' will have a word or two to say on this matter. This is what I take to be our attitude regarding this question. We were not consulted as to the declaration of the war, and it was not possible that we should have been consulted. The whole situation arose so suddenly I have not that we could not be consulted in reference to it . But we are told to-night that Mr Lewis Harcourt hopes that it w ill be possible to consult us about the peace terms at the end of the war. Meantime we trust the Home Government absolutely. They have proved their righ t to be trusted. Never did a body of men A Conference would be conduct the affairs of a country w i th more ability and with greater devotion and patriotism than the members of the present British Government have done. We in this part of the world little know what There is, for instance, the their work has been. For the maintenance of that Fleet, keeping its silent These are a great responsibility watch and ward at sea, away out of sight of the British Isles, blockading Germany, and making it possible for our commerce to go on as usual, we are under a permanent obligation to these men. We are under an obligation to them for seeing to it that that Fleet is efficient and for the fact bhat we may. as Sir John Fisher put it a year or two ago, ""sleep comfortably in our beds o'nights,"" knowing, as he undoubtedly did at the time, that the Fleet was in a state of preparation and efficiency. Then there is the herculean task to which Lord Kitchener has set his hand: the creation of an army of 3,000,000 in the place of one of 240,000 regulars and 250,000 Territorials. There is also the mobilization of the finances at the other end of the world, not only for themselves, but to help us out here. Then there are all the attendant difficulties of these preparations-difficultie s which crop up wherever workmen and capitalists are to be found; difficulties that are common to the""whole world; difficulties arising from That may be so, speaking the liquor trade, labour troubles, and such like matters. These men have proved themselves to be of sterling mettle in all they have done since the outbreak of war. . I shall dismiss this subject with the f u r ther remark that I think it was infinitely unfortunate for that great journal, The Times, to make the attack which it did the other day on Mr Lewis Harcourt.",30,Ministerial Statement Paper

I believe Mr Lewis Harcourt to be as good a Colonial Secretary as any we have ever had. do not know him personally, but I believe that he has done his duty f a it h f u l lv with every sympathy for the Colonies and with every desire for tlieir consolidation and prosperity. The Westminster Gazette a few days ago stated that there were three possible issues to the war. It put the matter so succinctly that I quoteThere arc three possible issues to this warOne, that Germany will win, in which case we need talk no more about militarism, for she will do all thc militarism for all the world. Tho second, that there will be no conclusive result, in which case we shall merely carry forward the conditions of war into the conditions of peace, and be compelled, irrespective of all theories, to do from month to month and from year to year, what safety from a threatening foe requires. Thc third, that thc Allies will win it. and win it in such a way that Europe will be relieved from the nightmare of an armed truce. I believe that the House is of opinion that that ought to be the only outcome of this war. Every man here, as well as every man outside, I think, believes that this war should not cease until we have made impossible a recurrence of it in our time. we must be generous to Germany. are told that we must not humiliate I , for one, express the hope here and now that she will suffer the humiliation stepping from the position of a first class military power to that of a second-rate military power. to do anything else with Germany the display of force and aggression we have seen in recent days. not humiliate the Germans, we are told! But what do we do with a mad dog 1 Do we not shoot it ? And Germany, with her running amok as she has done lately, like a mad Mollah, murdering mining and destroying, that her notions of war are in conflict with the civilization therefore be humiliated for the one reason that she is out to humiliate the dust, if she can possibly do so. No war would be worth waging which stopped short of smashing entirely war machine. how or other, the British grit has got into that war machine; that it is going Mr Joseph Cook. to get more and more into it , and so to interfere w it h its smoothness and celerity. We fight this battle-and it I is this whicli makes us all united, determined, and resolute-for Home and Empire. We fight for honour and safety. We fight for the freedom of small nations and for the maintenance of public law in the international sphere. It was WilliamP it t who said long ago, "" Where law ends tyranny begins."" There must be an international law that will make it impossible for an aggressive band to suddenly plunge the whole of Europe into f r a t r i cidal strife such as we see proceeding at the present time. We fight, therefore, in the interests of peace, and to break up the world-power which Germany has set itself to possess. Above and beyond a l l , I hope, when this war is over, to see a psychology of peace instead of a psychology of war. Trace this war to its final causes, and you find that it began in the schoolrooms and other similar institutions of Germany, where the people were taught assiduously year by year that the State should be organized for war and that we unanimously stood in her way, and had to be destroyed in order that Germany might take her r i g h t f u l place as a world-power.

T think that, taking all in all, we are, perhaps, socially the most progressive in the world. We started long ago in directions upon which the Old World, now that it is in the death-grips with a great enemy, is setting out without any opportunity of discussing the merits of its actions, and the means by which it is to accomplish that whicli it seeks. We anticipated the people of the Old Land while it was yet day, and we ought not to halt while the way remains open to us. I have nothing further to say on this subject. My views upon it are well known to the Leader of the Opposition. I am sorry that he saw fit to touch upon some early phases of the war, and the action taken by my colleague, the Attorney General, and myself, in the matter of the elections. Prior to the outbreak of war, I made the ciear and distinct statement at Colac on the 30th July-that communications from Europe were unsatisfactory, but that, after everything had been done that intelligence could suggest, and honour would permit, to avert a conflict, it would be our duty to follow the Mother Countryi n any action necessary to protect her honour, and that we would support her to our last man and our last shilling. On the same night, I think, the right honourable gentleman spoke at Horsham, where he expressed similar sentiments. I returned to Melbourne next day, and the Governor of the Bank met me there. I do not think he trespassed unduly when he conveyed to me the in formation that he had from a financial source that the situation was exceedingly critical. He motored right away, I think, to Ballarat to meet the present Leader of the Opposition, who was then PrimeM in ister. not see him. gentleman intended to go on to Adelaide that night, and the Governor of the Bank went to Ballarat to see him. up there, and returned. I made certain communications, and waited in Melbourne until 4 p.m. on the following Monday, when the right honourable gentleman communicated with me by telephone. I expressed my regret that 1 couia not go to his office to see him, as I was just leaving to catch the train for Benalla. By the 5 p.m. train a message from the righ t honourable gentleman, as Prime Minister, was forwarded to me as Leader of the Opposition. It told me of the critical situation, and of what the then Government proposed to do. As soon as I received bhat message, I wired to the right honourable member that, as Leader of the Opposition, independent of all other things, I should stand behind the Government in any acbion they thought necessary, regardless of whether or not I believed their policy was a good one. book up, and in regard to all other matters I refrained from embarrassing the Government. A question was raised at the time, on which the present Attorney General expressed an opinion as to whether the elections should take place. I had proceeded into the Riverina electorate prior to that, and before I had even read in the press the opinion of the honourable member for West Sydney a statement had been made on behalf of the then Government by the honourable member for Flinders that it was impossible to postpone the elections. If , however, the Government had said that for war purposes such a postponement was necessary I was bound by my promise. It mattered not whether the party were for it or against it ; had the Government said that such a course was necessary in the interests of the country I would have been compelled by my promise to stand behind bhe Government. I supported them in all they d i d ; I kept my promise to them, and I hope I shall hear no more about my action on that occasion. My views were before the then Prime Ministeri n writing, and they were never qualified or departed from. I did think, however, that while I was all day in Melbourne, and in possession of information which was not known bo others, I might have received the courtesy of a communication from the then Prime Minister. me. me know that you had any special information. except that to which I was entitled.",32,Ministerial Statement Paper

I have expressed to the Imperial Government as clearly as possible the views of I could not give the my Government on this matter. I represented very clearly to the Home authorities that I thought nothing would have added more to the dignity and prestige of the .British Government and the British Empire thau to show to the world that during the greatest war of history we could hold a Dominions Conference in London without any difficulty whatever. I do not agree with the statement made to the House of Commons by Mr Harcourt yesterday, that if a Dominions Conference had been No t when I had comconvened, it would have been necessary, to go into the smaller controversial matters at issue between the Mother Country and ourselves. I thought the Secretary of State for the Colonies would have recognised that small matter would have given place to that of great importance in a Conference at such a time. The Conference could have dealt with the essential questions at issue between the Dominions and the Mother Country, and the direct representatives of the Dominions would have heard from the Imperial authorities the actual facts of the position, and could have brought back to the Dominions a f u l l knowledge of what had been done, and what was expected to be done this year and next year. to prevent the Government sending a Minister to England now to get that in formation ? view there is everything to prevent that course being followed.

We have, however, a policy for this trouble whicli gets over all difficulties. When thu King'B business does not Gt in with our ideas we do not press them. That is the policy of the present Government as regards uot only the Conference, but every other matter. We shall put forward our views firmly and distinctly on all questions upon which we think we are entitled to speak, but if the Imperial Government tell us that what we have urged is not a policy which they can deal with at the present time we shall say no more. In regard to territorial acquisitions in the Pacific Ocean, I would ask honourable members not to discuss that question ab the present time. It w ill come up for consideration later on. In the meantime I am sure His Majesty's Government will be careful that our position is not in any way compromised during the war, and that afterwards we shall probably have our right place in considering any policy that is to be adopted. As to the business of the session, the Government will endeavour to meet the views of the Opposition as far as it possibly can, and I ask honourable memhers opposite to remember that, if we are unable to adopt all their views, if we have to submit a policy or proposals with which they do not agree, we are responsible for the carrying, out of our policy; if we did not believe it to be the best thing to be done in the interests of the country we should not propose it . If we carry out our policy I do not think we shall be doing anything detrimental to the interests of Australia; but, on behalf of my colleagues and the members of the party whom wo represent, I promise that we shall not embitter this session any more than is absolutely necessary in giving effect to our programme, and passing the measures which we think essential before Parliament is prorogued. On the contrary, we shall do everything possible to conduct our business smoothly pleasantly under all circumstances. Question resolved in the affirmative.
