59,Mr Holt,"If we could, set upand foodstuffs such as tea, coffee and other similar imported commodities, which are now essential to the life of the community, we might reach a stage where we could be regarded as a closed economy; but I doubt whether such a state of affairs will prevail' in the lifetime of the honourable member for Griffith( Mr Baker). Until tliat stage is reached we must face realities and recognize that, until we can be assured of control of our trade routes, we can be blockaded by a hostile power. While such a state of affairs exists, we are compelled to rely upon British sea power and the command of the sea which may be exercised by Great Britain and the other parts of the Empire. Mr BjfBNN.AN -The honourable member believes that in the event of war world trade should continue as if nothing had happened. ensure as far as possible that normal commerce is maintained between Great Britain and Australia even in time of war. Had we not been able to maintain sea communication during the last war our prospect of success would have been less. The action of the central powers in destroying by submarines so many merchant vessels severely jeopardized the successful conduct of the war by Britain aud its allies. If the defence policy of the Government was put forward as its own and was not supported by expert opinion, as it is, there might be some strength in the attitude of the Opposition; but I defy honourable members opposite to quote any authority who will not hold that our very existence depends upon the extent to which our sea communication can be kept open. With that end in view, the Government has rightly emphasized the importance of sea power, and the closest possible co-operation between Great Britain and other parts of the Empire. It has 'also announced that its policy is designed to protect this country against sporadic raids and even against the possibility of invasion. The members of the Opposition have pointed out that the risk of invasion is remote. We agree that it is remote, and Australia is extremely fortunate that it is so. The risk of a man's house being destroyed by fire is also remote, because very few houses are destroyed in that way; but he would be a thriftless householder who did not insure his house against the risk of fire. We have a great deal to protect and preserve and, however remote the risk of invasion may be, it exists, and the Government is, rightly, taking action to meet it. There is another factor to bear in mind. We say that the risk of invasion is remote but it may not always be. It is remote to-day because Great Britain has command of the seas, a command net so strong as in pre-war days, but, nevertheless strong because it does possess the strongest naval force afloat. A recent statement, however, has shown that British naval power may not be sufficiently powerful to ensure open communication by sea. We are planning a defence programme, not for this month or next month, but for many years ahead. Even the programme outlined by the Prime Minister in the speech delivered a few days ago will take the Government three years to complete. The risk of invasion may. be remote, but we must take adequate measures to meet that eventuality, and if our sea power should not be as strong as it should be, we are forced back on the air arm and the military arm. The honourable member for Wakefield ( Mr Hawker) showed very clearly in his admirable speech a few days ago the danger of relying too much upon the air arm. He pointed out that, in the concluding months of the Great War, the casualties of aeroplanes in the A i r ""Force of Great Britain were 50 per cent, a month, and that it was necessary to double the equipment every two months. It is possible that, in the intensive air warfare which we might expect to-day, the percentage of casualties may be even heavier. If that should be the case in this country, it would be impossible to defend it successfully by the air arm. Consequently, we are forced back to what has proved, in aggression or defence, to be the back bone in military operations, the military arm. We have then to consider whether' the Commonwealth military forces would be adequate to meet not only an invasion, but also those sporadic raids' which we",18,Second Reading
60,Mr Holt,"It is highly desirable tomust expect in the event of Great Britain being engaged in hostilities. Before examining that position, let us envisage what really is required if we are to have a military arm capable of meeting even occasional raids, quite apart from an actual invasion by an expeditionary force. Prior to the Great ""War, the late Lord Kitchener expressed the opinion that Australia required . a military establishment of about 80,000 men, and that was at a time when Great Britain's sea power was relatively stronger than it is to-day. At present, we have a militia of under 35,000 volunteers and, consequently, one of the first steps which the Minister for Defence should take to strengthen that arm of the service is to arrange for an immediate survey to be made of our man-power, quota by quota, and to classify those fit for service, the capacity in which they could serve, and those required in key industries. Having that information, the Government should decide on the formation of a highly trained militia force or some permanent military force which would be availahle to meet the type of aggression we might have to encounter. Unless the Government is prepared to make provision for a highly trained militia force under the voluntary system it is essential, in my judgment, to have a permanent force comprising at least a mixed mobile brigade, such, as has been suggested by other honorditions our men are only partly trained, able members, to meet raids which may be made from time to time. Otherwise some form of compulsory military service is essential. A great deal of nonsense has been talked from time to time about this question of compulsory military training. By compulsory military service we do not mean any service greater than that contemplated by the framers of the Constitution. The original Defence Act provided that every able bodied man between the ages of IS and 60 years could, in time of need, he called upon hy the Government to defend Australia. Neither the Government's defence programme nor any suggestion by Government supporters for the introduction of compulsory military service has gone further than that. would be compulsory for some, but not for all. I would not recommend the creation of a force in excess of 50,000 troops, notwithstanding that there are in Australia at the present time more than 200,000 young men between the ages of 18 and 21 years. Therefore a system of compulsory military service having for its objective a force of 500,000 men, between the ages of IS and 21, would be compulsory for only about one-fourth of the able-bodied men within that age range in. the Commonwealth. At the present time we have a book strength of 34,600 in the militia forces. The number is low, but we acknowledge the public spiritedness of the men who have come forward voluntarily to fit themselves for the defence of their country in time of danger. They are not all young men, the ages of trainees ranging from IS to 40 years. It should be noted also that for a variety of reasons our effective strength is very much lower than our book strength. In the first place, under the voluntary system the trainees attend parades whenever it suits them.

62,Mr Holt,"I agree with the honorI am aware that much of the criticism that may be levelled at the voluntary system could also be applied to compulsory training as we knew it . In 1928-29, when the total strength was 43,600 troops, compared with 34,600 at the present time, the percentage of rejects on the ground of physical unfitness was 32, whereas during the whole period since the introduction of thevoluntary system the rejects have been less than 4 per cent. This shows clearly that the authorities are now accepting recruits of a very much lower physical standard in order to get the numbers required. Any one who has had any personal experience of our militia troops must acknowledge that in physique they are definitely inferior to the units trained during the years when the compulsory system was in force. on the army was £1,465,000. For this year an amount of £3,000,000 has been provided. Thesefiguresshow that in the last year of compulsory training, our troops were 10,000 in excess of present numbers, the men were of a very much higher physical standard, and the cost was much lower than it is at the present time. In advocating a return to some .form of compulsory military training I do not 'suggest the adoption , of the system previously in force in the Commonwealth. I happen to be one of the very few members of this House who have had practical experience as trainees under the compulsory system. I would never, I hope, condemn any young fellow Australian to serve under it because it was irksome to a degree and it was loathed by 90 per cent, of the men. I agree with much of the criticism that has been levelled against it from the point of view of its lack of attraction and interest for the troops, but I do not agree that it necessarily represents the only system which could be applied to Australian manhood. by the exorcise of some imagination, the application of some intelligence, and perhaps, an elementary knowledge of the psychology of the young men who. would be required .to serve under it, we could evolve a system that would be so attractive as to induce the enlistment of a sufficient number of young men voluntarily. In the first place ilr. noil. I would suggest the elimination of the half-day parades on Saturdays. They are a great drawback to the present system. They are most objectionable to the great majority of our young men and there is no necessity for such parades. Recruits are expected to attend a number of half-day parades, which are supplemented by continuous training for six days in camp, although, as has been shown by other speakers, the time occupied in travelling to and from camp takes two days, so the actual period of camp training is only four days. In lieu of the halfday parades, provision should be made for a longer period of camp training, say a fortnight or three weeks. The trainees would then get through ten times the amount of work done under the present half-day parade system. ""WithI n 1928-29 expenditure the total strength of about 50,000 men, the military trainees would be limited to certain quotas of men and probably to certain districts because, as I have shown, there are approximately 200,000 young men of military age in the Commonwealth to draw upon. I do not, however, suggest that we should ignore the rest of our young manhood. After selecting for military service the very best physical types, we could make provision for the physical training of those who do not come up to the standard. I hope that the Government will investigate the possibility of the adoption of a Commonwealth-wide system of physical training. In Great Britain, much progress has been made in recent months in connection with the physical fitness campaign which has been inaugurated. A Physical Training and Recreation Act has been passed containine the skeleton of a scheme of physical training throughout Great Britain. This is supplementary to any system of military training that may be introduced. The Government should not neglect the young people who I am convinced that, would not be trained under a scheme of military service. Perhaps arrangements could be made for those below the age for military service to receive some form of physical training, not merely Swedish exercises, but really attractive physical training which would raise the general level of fitness in this country. people get such training in the schools?",20,Second Reading
63,Mr Mahoney,"D o not the youngit after leaving school. In 1928-1929, it was found that 32 out of every 100 members of the Citizen Forces were below the physical standard necessary to qualify them to take part in the military manoeuvres which the training system then involved. I advocate the adoption of a combined system of military and physical training, not merely because of the security which this would give, but also because it would involve' recognition by the younger citizens that they owe some duty and service to the State in retnrn for. the many benefits they derive from it. It would tend to produce that discipline of mind and the development of character which the successf ul practice of modern democracy demands. I commend the Government upon its efforts to extend its defence programme in order to secure a.dequate protection for this country, and I congratulate the Minister for Defence( Mr Thorby) upon the efficient and energetic manner in which he is handling the administration of the defence programme. been impressed during this debate by the number of military experts who support the Government, and by the smallness of the number of speakers who have confined their remarks strictly to the question before the House, namely, the authorization of a loan of £10,300,000 for defence purposes. member for Fawkner( Mr Holt), like a number of others, has accused the Labour party of advocating a policy of isolation with regard to defence. That phrase has been coined by Government supporters for political purposes only, but the time is not far distant when the people generally will realize that that expression is employed merely for the purpose of obtaining support for the Government at the expense of the Labour party. The Opposition realizes that the economic resources of Australia must be developed, and that, to a large extent, we must depend upon our own man-power and resources for our defence. The honourable member for Fawkner suggested that the Labour party had ignored the realities of the economic situation, but I cannot subscribe to that view. My party takes second place to none in accepting the situation as we find it. This country must be developed economically, and, in the event of hostilities, our safety would -be endangered because we are 13,000 miles away from our principal overseas market. We have 'been given more than a broad hint hy the Prime Minister of Great Britain that -we must make a strong effort to put our own house in order. I commend the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Curtin) for his remark that the best contribution which Australia could make to the defence of the Empire would be to provide for its own defence and to develop its economic resources. The world position has greatly changed of recent years, and the policing of our trade routes may be much more difficult in the future than it was during the 1914-1918 period. In the event of hostilities overseas, Australia's job would be to provide for its own defence. I am sure there would he grave danger of our being cut off from our overseas markets. I agree to some 'extent with what has been said by the honora.ble member for Fawkner regarding the necessity for physical training. We should give increased attention to the physical training of our young men, but whether this work should be done in military camps or elsewhere is a matter for serious consideration by those whose duty it is to deal with the problem. There was no difficulty in obtaining volunteers at the The honourable time of the last war, and our citizens are just as loyal to-day as they were in 1914. I have no doubt that volunteers would he forthcoming if their services were -required for the defence of Australia, and, therefore, the need for compulsory military training does not arise. I have discussed this matter with persons having expert knowledge, and they have expressed the view that it is unnecessary to train large bodies of men at the present time. All that is required is to train officers, and to provide them with skeleton forces which could be augmented in time of emergency. Australia should not -borrow money for defence purposes. The present generation should accept its immediate financial responsibility. The Government is prepared to place the burden of defence on posterity, but I oppose that plan. No money should be raised for expenditure",21,Second Reading

The money required for defence purposes should be raised by taxation. To show that the Laibour party has always realized low as possible-bu t if this huge expenthe necessity for Australia to prepare for its own defence, I remind the House and the country that the Labour party, during the regime of the Fisher Government, established the first Australian navy, a well-trained army and a national smallarms factory. universal military training. system of training was suspended, and I hope that it will never be adopted again in this country. The Labour party also established a national woollen mill, a national clothing factory, national munition works, a national note issue and the Commonwealth Bank. Most of the industrial undertakings inaugurated .by the Labour party have .been handed over by its opponents to private enterprise. The Government speaks of harnessing the economic resources of the country, but I venture to suggest that had those institutions which were established by Labour governments, and financed either out of revenue or by means of the note issue department of the Commonwealth Bank, been retained, the position would be much better to-day than it is. ""What was done then could be done again, were not the Government so committed to assisting private institutions at the expense of the community. We on this side are not prepared to support the Government's £10,000,000 this year and further sums in. subsequent years for defence purposes. I draw attention to what is being done in 'Great Britain in this connection. Honourable members will admit that the incomes of persons in Australia are not so heavily taxed as they are in Great Britain. report from London informed us that Sir John Simon had stated that the raising of the standard rate of income tax from 5s. to 5s. 6d. in the £1 brought that tax to within 6d. of the war-time maximum. He pointed out, further, that the unexpected additional tax of 2d. per lb. on tea would affect every householder, and that increased taxation, both direct and indirect, would be levied. I do not wish to be regarded as advocating greatly increased taxation generallyI am of the opinion that taxation should be kept as diture for the defence of Australia must be incurred, the burden should be borne by the present generation rather than by posterity. As taxation in Australia represents about £16 per head .of the population, compared with nearly £20 in the United Kingdom, I submit that the intention of the Government to borrow this money is wrong in principle and, therefore, should not be agreed to by the House. The proposal of the British Government to collect an extra £72,000,000 during this fiscal year represents an increased burden of about 30s. per head of the population. The Commonwealth Government, however, does not propose to increase taxation. On the contrary, during its term of office it has reduced its demands on persons with large incomes. The income tax has been reduced considerably. In all, it has remitted taxes amounting to about £18,000,000. member is not in order in dealing with the Government's taxation remissions in the past. them only by way of illustration, in order to show that the additional money required should be obtained from taxes. The Government is following a wrong policy, for it is possible to achieve the result desired without recourse to proposal to borrow borrowing. AlthoughI do not pose as an expert on defence matters, it is difficult to understand why most of the proposed expenditure on defence will be expended in Victoria and New South Wales. Very little of it will be expended in Tasmania, which is not, as one honourable Only last week a newspaper member, perhaps inadvertently, said last week, a foreign country, but is one of the States of the Commonwealth of Australia, and has an equal right with the other States to be considered. overlooked. the Minister's assurance.

I am aware of the exact terms of the resolution and the purpose for which it was carried. terms ? been published in various newspapersin some instances under a distorted heading-and if honourable members wish to see its terms they may look it up for themselves in the newspaper files. It may be thought that, because Tasmania is at the southern extremity of the Commonwealth, it is not of great importance from a defence point of view, 'but I point out that its wonderful harbours, with deep sheltered waters, would make admirable bases from which an enemy could attack the mainland. An article dealing with the importance of Tasmania to the defence of Australia, which I read recently, stated that it was estimated that in the northern portion oi' that State there were four machine gun units and one machine gun. AlthoughI do not, think that it is necessary to provide large forces in Tasmania, its claims should not be ignored when uhe Government is providing for the defence of Australia. I hope that the Government will also consider co-operating with the citizen air force in Tasmania, which is doing good work. I join with my colleagues on this side of the chamber n opposing the borrowing of money to provide for the defence of Australia and, therefore, I shall vote against the bill.. Defence) [4.29] I listened attentively to the speeches in connection with the defence proposals of the Government, but bers party considerations have weighed unduly, with the result that, instead of being helpful, their contributions to the debate have been detrimental. matters associated with the bill, I propose to reply to one or two points raised hy the honourable member for Bass( Mr Barnard). The honourable member directed attention to the fact that Tasmania has waters ready to provide an ideal naval base and that, therefore, that State should receive a larger share of the proposed defence expenditure. Por his information, I might mention that provision is made to spend over £27,000 upon coast defences in Tasmania and, with other sums for minor works, the total defence expenditure in that State will be between £32,000 and £33,000. include provision for new fortifications on the River Derwent? that £27,000 is to be provided for coast defences in Tasmania. I wish to emphasize that it is desirable that honourable memhers generally should try to deal with the defence question on a Commonwealth basis; it is absolutely hopeless to attempt to deal with a matter such as this State by State. We are compelled to deal with the defence question as it affects the whole Commonwealth, in conjunction with plans designed by other portions of the Empire, so that whatever defence plan we adopt may cog in with the whole defence organization of the Empire in such a manner as to ensure that we have the maximum combined strength in the event of an emergency arising.

80,Mr Thorby,"I have already saidstrengthening the navy equally affects every State within the Commonwealth; the fact that we are spending a large sum on. the air force equally protects each and every part of the Commonwealth, for the simp.e reason.that the air force is the most mobile force we have-it can be transferred from place to place at short notice. Naturally, it has to be developed where the greater number of the population resides. That is where the bulk of the recruits are trained. It is most economic to have air force base organizations established at places like Laverton, Victoria, and Richmond, New South ""Wales, where the training of recruits is carried out. I wish to emphasize that, by establishing a strong arm of the defence organization at Darwin, we can definitely protect each'and every part of the Commonwealth much more effectively than would be the case if we were to transfer the defence organization to, say, Tasmania or elsewhere. responsibility is to develop and strengthen the defence organization in the northern portions of Australia. I offer no apology for making that statement, for two reasons: first, because the northern portion of Australia has not been developed to the same extent as has the southern portion; secondly, because the northern portion of the continent is sparsely populated and is an area which must be strengthened from both a military and naval viewpoint. The manufacture of munitions is carried on in areas where they can be most economically handled, and advantage must he taken of the fact that we have already established huge munition works in New South ""Wales and Victoria. Another consideration is that, in the event of an emergency, we must take full advantage of the ability of private enterprise already established in a large way in some centres to produce large quantities of articles similar to those interjection of the honourable member for produced in our own munition factories. ber for Batman should be the last one to interject during the discussion of a question of this description. mark its own ticket. for the organization of private enterprise so that, in the event of an emergency, those industrial organizations which are capable of augmenting the supply of munitions now produced by the government factories can be brought in almost automatically to meet the whole of the defence 'organization of this country. That does not mean merely the provision of arms and munitions; it also means the provision of all the essential requirements of the people of this country in time of emergency, particularly for the defence organization, and goes far beyond the requirements merely of the army, navy or air force. attempted to get the State to co-operate with the Commonwealth in this respect ? been given opportunities to co-operate wifch the Commonwealth in many directions. They are prepared to throw their Our principal weight behind the whole defence organization, and, to that end, have passed legislation to assist the Commonwealth in co-ordinating civil aviation throughout the Commonwealth. As a matter of fact, all the States except New South Wales have passed the necessary legislation to do so, and the New South Wales Government has promised to co-operate, by passing similar legislation. Western Australia and South Australiaare as yet the only States that have proclaimed legislation dealing with this matter, but, as I have said, we have an assurance from the New South Wales Government that it will pass the necessary legislation. As soon as that is clone, all of the States will be in full co-operation with the Commonwealth Government in connection with the control of civil aviation. That is definitely a very valuable asset to the Defence Department in the event of an emergency. I may say, in reply to the Batman( Mr Brennan), that the organization being perfected to-day will not permit private concerns to charge profiteering prices for their output, or, as the honourable gentleman has said, "" to write their own ticket,"" for the simple reason that the Commonwealth Government has laid it down that there shall be no profiteering, and that if necessary, the Commonwealth Government will take",24,Second Reading

In doing this the Governoccurred in every country in the world. ment has continued the policy laid down in 1932 of extending the scope of the Navy, the Army the Air Force, and munitions activities, and of co-ordinating them so that they may be of the greatest service to the Commonwealth in an emergency. The Government's programme does not comprise, as has been suggested, a series of "" rush "" proposals. During the current year the Government has expended more than £11,500,000 upon the defence of this country, and in the last five years the expenditure in this direction has amounted to about £36,000,000. Many things that are now possible, such as the manufacture of a first-class anti-aircraft gun in an Australian factory by Australian workmen, are not the result of what has been done during the .last few months, but are the outcome of the foresight of my predecessors in office and their advisers who, about five years ago, laid down the organization to make it possible for defence equipment to be produced in Australia. The Government does not take entire In addition, I have credit for the fact that to-day there is a special .shorthand writer in existence a complete munitions organization such as we have never had before. This organization which has been developed with the advice of some of the most competent men in the British EmDespite this constant pire, will be most valuable in an emergency. There is no justification for the because they can find statement that the Government is now submitting rush proposals and is endeavouring to put something over the people. It is not correct to say that the Government's policy is suspect and that it is playing into the hands of profiteers. Statements of that nature have been made by members of the Opposition during the debate, and the chorus of approval which greeted them suggests that they are endorsed by the Labour party. These allegations are quite without foundation and have been made merely for party purposes.

We now ask what disquieting developments have occurred during the last three months to justify this tremendous expenditure? the last twelve months alone are suflicient justification for that expenditure. If the Government be justified in spending almost £12,000,000 during the current year, there is, I consider, every justificadecided upon the length of the plan, tion for providing for the expenditure next year of almost £15,000,000, which actually is only a small increase on the current year's expenditure, and is consequent on the plans agreed upon last year. It is necessary that the further expenditure proposed should be authorized in order to take advantage of much of the work which has already been carried out. If the honourable member examined the figures, he would discover that a large proportion of the £11,500,000 spent this year has been absorbed in the erection of buildings, including barracks, in various parts of the Commonwealth, and as soon as they are completed they will require to be manned and equipped. It would be ridiculous to suggest that the current year's programme is not related to the work proposed to he doneduring the coming year. Government did not forecast or anticipate this expenditure? honourable member to understand why. It may be recalled that, when last year's programme was outlined, the Imperial Conference had just concluded. The Australian delegation had not at that time returned, but later its reports were thoroughly sifted and developed into a plan of defence for Australia. The Commonwealth was then on the eve of a general election and, therefore, the Government was not justified in committing the country to a defence programme covering more than one year. The programme which it has already announced was endorsed by the people. But the general elections were concluded ment was safe! Mi-. THORBY -When the Government had received the people's endorsement of the programme extending over one year, it set to work to develop its plans. It called together representatives of the various sections of the defence organization, obtained the best advice available, both in Australia and overseas, and developed a defence plan. That plan, which was evolved largely through the Defence Committee, was then submitted to the Defence Council, which, upon the advice of ministerial members, having in mind the cost and the means by which funds could be raised to put it into operation. The recommendations of the Defence Council were then considered by the Government, which endorsed proposals covering a period of three years.

Much of it will be work of a permanent character, and a large proportion of the money will be used for tbe provision of coastal defences. This expenditure will be distributed as widely as possible over the various States, keeping in mind, however, as .1. explained at the commencement of my speech, the defence requirements of Australia as a whole, rather than the requirements or wishes of any one State. ture will be in New South Wales and V ictoria. expenditure, as I pointed out just now, cannot be credited to or debited against any particular State; it is for the protection of the whole of the. Commonwealth, and is in exactly the same position in that respect as expenditure associated with the provision of an artillery school in Sydney, where men will be trained for the protection of the country as a whole. These facilities can, therefore, be regarded as Australian assets. The same may be said of the Air Force depots at Laverton and Richmond for the training of pilots. Men are being trained there for use throughout, the Commonwealth. would point to tlie fact that on the 10th March last a squadron of the Royal Australian Air Force was established at the Pearce Aerodrome in Western Australia. Every member of the personnel of that squadron was trained in either New South Wales or Victoria. A second squadron is to be located in Western Australia, and a large and up-to-date organization will be established there. That has been made possible by the creation of the organization in other States. Similarly, trained members of the military forces will be made available for duty in other States through the establishment of a Command and Staff School at Sydney and the operations of the Dnntroon Military College. These establishments will function for the benefit of all the States. Therefore, honourable members should not discuss these questions from the parochial viewpoint, but should have regard to the interests of Australia as a whole. In view, however, of what has been said, I have extracted various items of expenditure to stow what is being done in the different States. ment done in Queensland? is to be expended in Queensland in connection with the provision of aerodromes and military requirements. cent, of the total. cost of constructing two new cruisers and other naval craft; does the honourable member suggest that Queensland is not receiving a fair share of the expenditure upon the Navy? Does he suggest that the expenditure of a large sum upon defences at Darwin does not directly contribute to the defence of Queensland? It is ridiculous for honourable members to raise such questions or to discuss tlie defence of Australia upon a State basis. It is impossible to carry out a defence programme on such lines; but in order to assist honourable members, I have prepared certain figures which will indicate the amounts to be expended upon works in the respective States. As I In that connection, I have said over and over again, expenditure upon naval and' military equipment and aircraft, cannot be allocated between tbe States, because these means of defence arc liable to be used in any part of Australia. The amount to be expended on works in each State is as follows:£ Queensland .. .. 88,000 New South Wales .. 507,150 Victoria .. .. 438,300 South.

One section of private enterprise may reasonably be expected to provide the rolled plates required by another section of industry. ask honourable members not to introduce irrelevant matters. the Minister. but give me an opportunity to explain the position. It is inaccurate to say that the Government is closing down a section of the Munition Works at Maribyrnong to comply with the wishes of private enterprise. In preparing our defence works programme we have endeavoured to co-operate so far as possible with State authorities. Eor instance the Government proposes to expend £78,000 at Newcastle, and probably a larger sum later, but we shall not be disbursing that money at the same time as the State is expending large sums on relief works. We are endeavouring to have some form of co-ordination with the States so that Australia will obtain thennaximum advantage from this expenditure, which while building up a defence organization, will also stimulate industry wherever possible. The methods the Government is adopting will go a long way towards stimulating industry in parts of Australia far removed from where the manufactured articles are used, and will provide a considerable amount of employment in the depressed areas of the Commonwealth. At Newcastle extensive works will be carried out, involving the expenditure of £78,000, the bulk of which will be for wages. Even expenditure on material represents, in part, wages paid to men employed within a few miles of where the work is being carried out. The same can be said of Lithgow. The honourable member for Macquarie ( Mr Supply Boards, the Advisory panel on John Lawson) and other honourable members will realize that the coal-mining centres which have suffered through unemployment, can be classed as depressed areas. The expenditure of £75,000 in the municipality of Lithgow will undoubtedly at Maribyrnong referred assist to a considerable extent to provide has been carrying on a employment for a large number of men previously unemployed and at the same time place in circulation a fairly large amount of money in that area. But that is not the reason for carrying out these works. The expenditure at Lithgow will give us important additional works at the small arms factory, whilst the expenditure at Newcastle is deliberately designed to protect that large and important industrial city and the important manufacturing concerns in that locality that are so closely associated with the defence programme of the Commonwealth. is being expended at that centre. The plan provides for a fair amount of non-recurring expenditure such as that connected with the establishment of officers' schools, training organizations for the artillery and warrant officers, and the training of additional officers at Duntroon. When this plan is carried out our annual commitments will be raised from approximately £6,000,000 as at present to about £10,000,000 per annum. The Leader of the Opposition and those who say that we should go faster, should keep that figure in mind when discussing the whole defence programme. Those who expect the Commonwealth to go faster are asking it to carry a much larger annual commitment than is practicable. on this side of the chamber suggested that the Government should go faster. bers have said that we are not going fast enough and others that we are going too fast. The defence plan on which the Government is working is based on the advice received from various authorities, following the Imperial Conference. Those advisers include the members of the Naval, Military, Air, and Munitions industrial organizations as well as outside experts, and the staff of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research.

We wish to disabuse the public mind of any suggestion that, in submitting its defence programme, the Government is attempting to create a war scare. We are doing our utmost to allay any such fears. Our purpose is to explain the risks, and in formulating our comprehensive defence programme, we have endeavoured to insure this country against danger in much the same manner as a man insures his house against destruction by fire or his life against premature death. When a husband insures his life, his wife does not, go into mourning, because all that the Government and it3 supporters were in husband has done has been to provide against an emergency.

There is no other parts of the British Empire in order that we may evolve the strongest possible defence organization in the interests of public security and as our contribution to world peace. I listened with interest to the attack made by the Minister for Defence( Mr Thorby) upon the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Curtin), and I gained the impression that the"" Minister has, of late, become altogether too thin-skinned. Apparently, he resents criticism. Lately dered in the song, ""Johnny Get Your Gun,"" the intention of honourable members supporting the Government being to prepare Australians for participation in some war in the near future. When, however, we examine the international situation, we arc forced to conclude that there is no need for a hurried decision by this Parliament on the Government's defence programme. Nowhere is there evidence of a state of emergency, and certainly no situation which cannot be met by reasoned diplomacy. About eighteen months ago, when Italy was at war with Abyssinia, many Government supporters in this House were in favour of applying full sanctions against Italy. Such a disastrous course would undoubtedly bave meant war, and instead of Great Britain being able to negotiate a peaceful settlement of outstanding differences, as was done recently to our mutual advantage, this House would probably be considering troubles arising from war with Italy. On that occasion the Leader of the Opposition impressed on the Government that the full application of sanctions would lead to a declaration of war. Because he took this view, the honourable gentleman .and his followers in Opposition were declared to be against the British Empire.

Nor does the position in Spain warrant heavy expenditure by Australia on an enlarged defence programme. The honourable member for Deakin also said that the position in Czechoslovakia was a menace to world peace. With that statement. I do not agree. I admit, however, that some aspects of the position in the East warrant preparation for defence by.Australia to the extent that the resources of this country, as a member of the British Commonwealth of Nations, may become readily available in an emergency. But recent happenings, even in China, hardly support the fears entertained by the honourable member for Henty( Sir Henry Gullett) that Japan may seek expansion southward -towards Australia. honourable gentleman should have displayed the white flag by suggesting that Australia would not be able to put up an effective defence against aggression. Such a statement is an insult to Australian manhood. It was, I suggest, made for the purpose of stampeding the people of Australia to endorse the Government's defence programme and so enable the war profiteers to make vast profits, as happened in the Great War, regardless of the suffering of thousands of Australian men and women. The Australian Labour party does not believe in the manhood of Australia being conscripted for service in any other part of the world. We believe Sir.

War correspondents representing newspapers of the Allies-the honourable member for Henty himself was a war correspondent-as o agreed that at Gallipoli the Australian soldiers so distinguished themselves for tenacity and heroism that on that penninsula Australia became a nation; the honourable member for Henty does not agree.

According to the honourable member for Henty they were better soldiers than the Australians; but as history records, they were not. more successful. Therefore, it ill becomes the honourable member for Henty now to cast a reflection on the men who landed at Gallipoli. I believe in upholding the spirit of the ANZACs-the men who enlisted voluntarily for service overseas and who later voted against conscription.

137,I Regret That The Mr Mahoney,"The Minister isbelieve that our best line of defence is to ensure the availability in time of war; not so much of Australian man-power as Australian resources. The Prime Minister of Great Britain has declared that tbe Mother Country recognizes its responsibility for the protection of trade routes in order to ensure the uninterrupted flow of foodstuffs and other resources from dominion countries like Australia. Why do not Government supporters tell the people what is in Mr Chamberlain's mind? AVe on this side are not prepared to hand a blank cheque to profiteers and enable them to exploit the people of this country in connection with defence expenditure. Honourable members cannot justify the cruel policy of conscription, which has been adopted by some countries that are ruled by. dictators. The people of Australia will resist that policy, as the ANZACs rejected it whilst serving in the trenches during the Great War. The Labour party is prepared to support the defence of Australia against any invader which tries to interfere with the liberty of the people of this great democracy. It is time Australians demanded a place in the sun. Tliey have no desire to be hostile to any nation, but they wish to co-operate peacefully with other countries. I do not wish to see Australia in the throes of a. military dictatorship, inaugurated under the pretence that it is necessary as a defence measure. The honourable member for Henty( Sir Henry Gullett), the honourable member for Fawkner( Mr Holt) and the honourable member for Deakin( Mr Hutchinson) have advocated compulsory military training, but I do not agree with them. I favour the establishment of a standing army for the specific purpose of defending the country, just as a police force is trained to preserve law and order. The cost of such an army should be met by taxes imposed on the wealthy section of the community. That policy would go a long way towards removing the differences of opinion between the 'Government and the Labour party regarding defence matters. The Government and its supporters have made political capital out of the defence issue. They imagine that members of the Labour party will say, "" Australia is not worth fighting for,"" but the Labour party is in favour of the adoption of plans for the adequate defence of this country. We should not try to make the people believe that a state of national emergency exists to-day, and thus facilitate the introduction of a scheme of universal military training. If Australia is in danger, there will be no difficulty in obtaining volunteer forces for its defence, but I object to mere boys being banded over to the authorities to be trained as professional soldiers. I would rather join the Army myself than allow my young son to be conscripted for military service. The Government is apparently unable to inform the House clearly how the money proposed to be raised under this bill will be expended. The Minister for Defence has urged members not to be parochial in defence matters, but for years I have stressed the strategical importance of Hobart in connection with the defence of Australia, and at last that fact is recognized. Hobart constitutes a base which would be suitable for an enemy which might wish to attack this ""country and should be fortified against such a possibility. The sum of £30,000, which is to be expended in Tasmania under tbe present proposals, was placed on the last Estimates. 1 understand that this expenditure relates to certain defence works, for which tenders are to be called at the end of May. Tasmania's hydro-electric scheme enables it to produce electrical power more economically than in any other part of the Commonwealth. In the electrolytic zinc works, Tasmania has one of the most up-to-date plants in the southern hemisphere. Were these matters given due consideration when the distribution of the proposed defence works was arranged? Of course not. When the Minister for Defence was asked to supply aeroplanes for the purpose of training young men in Tasmania who desire to qualify as pilots in the Air Force, he refused to accede to the request. Yet he' asks us to be big Australians and to accept his present policy. I remind the Minister that some of the finest soldiers in the world have come from Tasmania. That State should be allowed to take a more active part in the production of munitions and defence equipment.

161,Mr Street (Corangamite) [6.3],".and tliat suck, a state of affairs is regretof defence. The advisers of the Governtable. It is regrettable, but it is a fact; and we have to face realities. It is a reality that distrust and misunderstanding exist among the various nations; it is a reality that the map of Europe has recently changed markedly, notwithstanding all the treaties presumably set up to preserve the frontiers of Europe; it is a reality that countries and territories have been occupied and invaded notwithstanding the existence of a League of Nations founded on the principle of collective security; and therefore it is equally a reality that no nation can afford to neglect its defence. When we consider the problem of defence we must first clarify the object which we set out to achieve by our policy. In military parlance, an "" appreciation of the situation "" requires that the object shall always be kept in the forefront, so that we may formulate accordingly the plan by which the policy is to be achieved. As I see it, the abject of our defence policy is twofold; it is to preserve the territorial integrity of Australia, and to preserve our sea-borne trade, both coastal and overseas. I am afraid it is true to say that, the majority of small nations in the world to-day only exist on the sufferance of the larger nations. Australia is a small nation, but it has the tremendous advantage over other small nations that it is also a member of the British Empire, and it is in the British Empire that it has to place its real trust for external assistance, should such assistance ever .become necessiary. But the necessary corollary to any demand or request for help from others is evidence of a desire to help oneself. Therefore, it is obligatory on Australia, as it is on the other portions of the British Empire, to build up its own defence, so that the collective strength of the and link up with such a fleet, and it Empire shall be sufficiently strong to deter any would be aggressors. That Australia is prepared to build up its defence is evidenced by the speech delivered in this House last week by the Prime Minister( Mr Lyons). We should consider what is the bestway to achieve this object, and I suggest that there are two main alternatives: first the adoption of the navy as the first line of defence; and secondly, the adoption of the army and the air force"" as the first line ment-and of course it possesses the best possible advisers-hav e recommended that the navy should he the first line of defence, but it is obvious that Australia cannot afford to build, equip and maintain a fleet sufficiently large for the defence of its territories and trade; consequently, it is necessary, if the navy is to be its first line of defence, that it should act in co-operation with the Royal Navy. That is to say, there must be a strong British fleet stationed in eastern waters and based on Singapore. Without the presence of such a fleet it seems to me, at any rate-and I think, as has already been said, that we are all tempted to become amateur strategists when we consider this problem-that reliance on naval defence must be unsound. The late Earl Jellicoe recommended, after a world tour, that a strong eastern fleet should be built up and based on Singapore to protect British interests in the Indian and Pacific Oceans. But after the signing of the Washington Treaty tbe need for that apparently disappeared and the proposal was abandoned. We have to consider that it is primarily the duty of the British Navy to ensure the entry into Great Britain in time of war of all essential foodstuffs. Could the Royal Navy do that and at the same time guarantee security in the Pacific? Would public opinion in Great Britain in time of war allow the sending of a large portion of the Royal Navy to the East? I think not. Therefore, if we are to rely on naval defence as recommended by the Government's advisers, it is a prerequisite to such reliance that there shall be a strong fleet in Eastern waters based on Singapore. Our own navy would form a valuable auxiliary would be particularly valuable' for convoying coastal ships. This country has seen only recently the effect of a fall of the prices of our exportable primary products, but the catastrophic effects of an entire stoppage of the export of primary products can scarcely be imagined. And yet, if we disregard -this second but no less important part of our objective, the protection of our sea-borne trade, we are endangering this country and running the risk of placing it in. an even worse position than faced it when that great fall of the prices of primary products took place. But if defence by the navy did fail, what then would be the position? We would still have the army and the air force. The honourable member for Wakefield ( Mr Hawker) pointed out that the air force has certain definite limitations, particularly the extraordinary high rate of casualties. The honourable gentleman quoted figures showing that during the last year of the Great War casualties amounted to about 50 per cent, a month. Again, we have to remember that in its modern form the air arm is, to a large extent, untried, and both the effects of an air attack and the effectiveness of modern anti-aircaft defences are still problematical. The Air Eorce has certain definite characteristics; these characteristics, which have enabled the aeroplane to play suoh an important part in the development of Australia in time of peace, will enable it to be a very effective weapon in time of war. No defence problem of any country can afford to neglect this very valuable arm. Any invasion of this country must of necessity be sea-borne, and a convoy of enemy ships when approaching this country would be particularly the air, not only when approaching the coast but also during and immediately after the disembarkation of troops. I am glad to see that the Government proposes to push on and complete Part2 of the Salmond air defence scheme, and to bring the first line of aircraft up to 198. In considering the, expansion of the Air Force, it is, of course, a truism to say that the rate of expansion must be in direct ratio to the provision of the necessary ground organization, hangars, landing grounds, and 'so on. Consequently, however great the will, the speed at which we can increase is governed by that very important factor. The establishment of aircraft manufacture in Australia, which the Government has made possible, is a valuable contribution to the defence of this country. We have seen, and are seeing, how difficult it is to obtain supplies of aircraft in time of peace, and if we obtained them no faster in time of war, we would very soon find ourselves in trouble. Mr Street. Navy and onr Air Force, an enemy did land in Australia, then, ultimately, he would have to be defeated by our land forces. Consequently, it behoves us to take stock to see exactly what we have. At the moment, we have, of course, seven divisions organized on a peace footing. In connection with the militia forces, I should like to quote from an article in the Sydney Morning Herald of the 8 th April last. With some of the conclusions drawn I do not agree, because I think the writer has somewhat overstated his case; but in principle his criticism is sound. The article readsLet us visualize the present militi a army on mobilization. Its strength, numerically spread over the six States of the Commonwealth, is said to be 35,000. Of this number, at least 60 per cent, would be physically unfit for war service. With that I do not agreeThis reduces the force to approximately 14,000. Deduct from the number 10 per cent, to form a nucleus for training reinforcements, whicli further reduces the number to 12,(i00. This number would be still further reduced by the requirements of lines of communication, staff, and other services, by at least 10 per cent. In other words, when wo talk about our m i l it i a army for the defence' of Australia being 35.000 strong, we really mean a striking force liable to attack from of about 11,000, and then only a compact striking force when they have been gathered together from the four points of the compass throughout Australia. But this is noi the whole story.. It took seven months to train and harden tbe Australian Imperial Forces which comprised n great number of m i l it i a soldiers. Eveni f we assume that the present m i l it i a army is better trained to-day than it was then, to the most optimistic, it would take at least one month's solid hardening and finishing training, even partly to f it militi a troops for service against the trained soldiers of an invader, and this means tliat one month after the invader actually landed, we would oppose him, with at the most about 11,000 partly trained troops. Further, after our militi a troops had been committed to the defence, at least three montlis would ela]>sc before reinforcements could be trained and equipped to support them, assuming, of course, that there were still some troops left to support. Sitting suspended from 6.15 to 8 p.m. we should take stock of our land forces. The figure of 35,000 men in the militia If , despite our is misleading when one realizes actually what number of men would be available",37,Lawson Ho W Large A Fence Needs I Suggest Also That Strict

Such an army would give the mand, but, since then, none have had the opportunity to exercise command. Except of them gets any experience of regimental work. When an officer graduates from Duntroon, for a time he becomes attached artillery brigade, infantry battalion, or then but the moment he has finished his as an adjutant he Further than that, a permanent army would give militia officers an opportunity I have suggested that at a command and staff school in Sydney. ; Turning for the moment to the militia allowances. could perhaps be adopted by the Government towards the men who are efficient. Consideration should not be given to any but those who at the end of the training year are efficient. A great deal could also be done to make the training of the militia more congenial. ""When troops, at the end of a f a i r l y heavy day in camp, are finished for the night, too often there is nothing for them to do. The camps are generally situated at soma distance fro m the nearest town, and the men very often are not inclined to walk in or to get a l if t on a l o r r y ; ' and I think that if some form of amusement could be provided for them at the camps for their leisure hours it would have a beneficial result. The same thing applies to d r ill halls, and I think that, to every drill hall a gymnasium should be attached. arc a dirty lot of sheds. am afraid tliat is true. Many dril l halls need rebuilding. Sir there would be more incentive to young men to join the militia. to be able to do away with one drawback in the militia training system, and that is the Saturday afternoon training. Lots of young people are willing and keen to take part in militia training, but they are just as keen to play some form of organized game-footbal l or cricket, dependent on the season-o n Saturday afternoons, and they cannot do both. To suggest, that some other day be fixed statutorily, I should say, would cause some opposition in industry, but I do suggest that, that is something into which the Government should inquire. At the moment, the turnover in the militia forces is alarming. When one realizes that, in a period of ten years, a trainee has 120 days, or about four months, of training, one realizes how difficult it is to create trained reserves. I concede that the training period has been 'increased by one day per annum, but that is not. nearly enough. The period has been A more liberal attitude increased from twelve to thirteen days and I am certain that it is impossible in that period to turn out adequately trained militia men who, at the moment, in the absence of a standing army, w ill for m the shock troops needed to meet any landing by an invader. Unless we increase the training period and decrease the rapidity of the turnover, I am afraid that the militia forces w ill not advance very far. The young people are willin g enough to do their share. I had a letter the other day from a young man in Western Australia. He aud others are willing to pay their fares to Perth once a year in order to attend a course of instruction that will enable them to take their part when required with a short period of post mobilization training. I should like to see the number of the militia increased, but I realize that a substantial increase would be difficult to cope with because of the shortage of staff. The shortage of D r ill halls, generally, staff is a serious matter. We have a peace organization of seven divisions which, In many respects, I on mobilization, would become an army, two army corps, seven divisions and approximately 21 brigades. If one works out the number of staff officers required for what a tremendous shortage of staff officers exists in Australia to-day. That brings me to the question as to I should like whether the system is not unwieldy and as to whether a peace organization of seven divisions is a reasonably suitable form of organization of our militia. The RoyalM i l it a r y College, I am glad to see, is being extended. Notwithstanding the increased output from that college, however, the shortage w ill still be very great. _ The shortage of warrant officers, too,'is alarming. I should like to see established for warrant officers a training period of, say, twelve months at a school on the lines of the Albury school of some years ago. Let us consider for a moment the conditions within the service. Are the conditions as they exist to-day sufficiently attractive to command the best type of men? The rates of pay in the Australian Army compare unfavorably with the rates of pay in the .British Army. I point, out also that whereas in the payment of salaries in the Australian Army there is no differentiation between married",39,Lawson Ho W Large A Fence Needs I Suggest Also That Strict

That is not attractive. of holding down a job he is entitled, not only to the rank of that job, but, certainly, to the pay as well. After an officer has served his time in the forces and is superannuated, if he is so unfortunate as to retire as a major at 55 years of age, he becomes entitled to superannuation, to which he has contributed, at the rate of £178 a year. The British rates of pay that I have cited are inclusive of pension; there is no contributory system in Great Britain as there is in Australia. Then, if a man is. fortunate enough to be a colonel he may serve until he is sixty and receive £364 a year as superannuation. .1 irrespective of rank, the maximum superannuation that a man can expect is, I believe, little more than £400 a year.

The Australian Staff Corps is a highly trained loyal and efficient body of men. I speak with a good deal of personal experience. I do not think the treatment of these officers is in keeping witli the very serious responsibilities placed upon their shoulders. They are, after all, responsible for the implementing of the Government's policy, and to them would be entrusted the lives of Australians should the necessity to defend this country ever arise. A few years ago, when the Financial Emergency Act was brought into operation, the Army, in common with other branches of the fighting services, suffered a salary cut of 22-J per cent. In addition, the Public Service Act was made applicable to the salaries of army officers, who were also forced to take two weeks' leave without pay in every quarter, with the result that many who possessed no means beyond their salaries were obliged to allow insurance premiums and other provisions of that nature to lapse. Such things should not be permitted to happen. I desire now to touch upon the question of the appointment of an Inspector General of the Military Forces. I find it hard to believe that it would be possible to obtain for any long period an officer possessing the experience, qualifications and rank necessary to carry out the job. A thorough re-organization of the British Army has recently commenced, , and I cannot imagine the British Government being very willing to release a man of the type we wantand we want the best-for a long period. If, therefore, it is not possible to secure the man we desire for a long-period, let us see that we get the best possible man available for a short period. not get such a man, it might even have to put up with an Australian! accustomed to send senior officers to England to keep abreast of modern conditions. Each year a cerbain number of junior officers is sent to the staff colleges at Gamberley and Quetta, and now and again a few slightly senior officers visit England upon exchange duty, but I cannot recall any really senior officer being sent abroad to keep in touch with modern developments. the necessity for obtaining an Inspector General from overseas might not have arisen. Dealing now with the question of industrial mobilization, from the experiences of the last war it was learned that proper preparations in the industrial sphere are in every degree just as important as are military operations. I think it is almost axiomatic to say that in proportion to the degree of readiness in peace so will he the power of efficient defence in time of war. Without doubt the determining factors in time of mobilization are to be found in the obtaining of supplies and not in the enlistment of men. I , therefore, welcome the Government's proposal to set up advisory panels in order that every phase of industrial activity may be covered and every phase of the defence problem fully dealt with. There is one point, however, which I have previously brought before the Government, and which I stress again. Despite difficulties that may exist, I still think it right and proper that the Leader of the Opposition should be a permanent member of the Council of Defence. It has been said that, owing to certain difficulties, such an appointment might be embarrassing, but the problem is far too important to permit a question of embarrassment to prevent such an appointment. The secret of a successful defence fiolicy is that it shall have continuity, and 1 can think of no better way to ensure that continuity than by including the Leader of the Opposition, whoever he may be, in the Council of Defence. is anticipating a Labour government! if every turn of the political wheel meant a change of government with a different defence policy, this country would soon be in a sorry plight. I hope the Government will investigate the position further and see if it is not possible to overcome the difficulties that exist in making this appointment. I desire to congratulate the Minister for Defence( Mr Thorby) upon the manner in which he has tackled his duties. He has in front of If that had been done, him a full-sized job, and the energy, determination and enthusiasm with which he is facing it must commend itself to honourable members on both sides of the House.

I know he receives criticism of a destructive nature and I hope that the suggestions I have made will be taken into consideration and that some, perhaps, will be adopted. I commend the bill to the House. support the remarks of the honourable members on this side of the House who have already submitted their views upon the bill, and propose, in the first place, vernment and meet its defence committo deal with the method of raising the proposed loan of £10,300,000. This money can be raised in one or all of three the shoulders of those who are best ways: first, from revenue; secondly, by means of a loan; and, thirdly, by utilization of the Commonwealth Bank. Dealing with the first proposal, it is obvious to members on this side of the chamber that the Government, representing as it does what are known as vested interests, is definitely opposed to sibility for grappling with the greatest of taking from those interests something which rightly belongs to those whom they exploit-the masses of the people. As far as raising the money through the Commonwealth Bank is concerned, opposition to that course has been expressed by representatives of the Government from innumerable public platforms. The Government is opposed to the utilization in the best interests of the community of this publicly owned bank because it would involve interference with the profits of private banks, financial institutions and other bodies, and would interfere with the opportunities of these people for finding a safe investment for their funds. During the election campaign the Labour party were classed as isolationists and it was said that Australia should tune in with Britain. The term "" isolationist "" has also been applied to the Labour party in this House, but when it becomes a question of following Great Britain we find that the Government is not prepared to do what Great Britain is doing, particularly in the direction of financing a tremendous defence programme. I desire to quote from a statement made by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Sir John Simon, as reported in the Herald, on the 27th April this year. The report statesSir John said, in reference to meeting the defence costs, tliat he wonid not be doing his duty if lie followed the easier course by borrowing all. We must take some proportion of the increased expenditure on our shoulders by increasing taxation now. By so doing, we shall reduce our difficulties hereafter, and we shall show the world that the country does not wail when it faces the burden of expenditure. If the Commonwealth Government practised what it preached, it would follow the example set by the British Goments, not completely from loan funds, but by placing the burden upon able to carry it. The financing of the defence programme by means of tbe proposed loan must have the effect of curtailing money that could well be utilized by industry and by State governments, which have had foisted upon them by the Commonwealth Government the responall our present day problems-unemployment. The various State governments have been largely utilizing loan funds for the purpose of bringing about an economic recovery, for which the Commonwealth Government is seeking to take the credit. The Minister for Defence( Mr Thorby) stated that the expenditure of the £10,300,000 would be spread over all the States. That sounded very well, but it would appear that of the total expenditure of £43,000,000 for defence purposes only £88,000 will be spent in Queensland. nothing. able member is quite capable of dealing with that. If the Commonwealth Government goes on the loan market to meet its commitments for defence purposes the inevitable result will be to reduce the amount that the State governments require to carry out their present programmes for the provision of work for the unemployed.

176,Mr Riordan,"I think the honorCouncil, sought further loan accommodation to enable them to carry on public works programmes and to retain of men for whom they had provided work in the years subsequent to tbe depression, they were informed that they would have to cut down their loan requirements because the Commonwealth Government required the money for defence purposes. If the Loan Council persists in depriving State governments of money to enable them to carry out their works programmes, Australia will soon be confronted with conditions similar to those which prevailed a few years ago, and development will be so retarded that large numbers of men will again be thrown out of employment, causing poverty, misery and in many oases starvation amongst our people. The Government and its supporters have said that tliey are anxious to improve the standard of living of the workers, but according to the policy which they support they are anxious only to protect the privileges and profit of their wealthy supporters. A perusal of statistics discloses that during the last five years taxes to the amount of £20,000,000 have been remitted to the wealthy section of the community, thus depleting the revenue of the Commonwealth to that extent. member is not in order in discussing the remission of taxes to which he refers. to deal with the measure from the viewpoint of the workers, and to show the position in which they will be placed if any unnecessarily large amount is borrowed for defence purposes. Had that £20,000,000 of taxes not been remitted, that much revenue could have been utilized to finance a considerable portion of the Government's defence programme, which over a period of three years will absorb £43,000,000. The honourable member for Henty( Sir the enormous profits made by General Motors-Holdun's Limited, and suggested that some action should be taken to curtail exploitation by that company, and, in my opinion, that action should be extended to similar companies such as those controlled by the Broken Hill Proprietary Limited.

During the Great War we heard a good deal about loyalty and patriotism, but those who cried so loudly in those days concerning the responsibility of Australians in matters of defence are silent to-day. In the New South Wales Worker, of the 27th April, the following paragraph appeared:During tlie Great War, M . W. Hughes declared'that the only kind of patriotism our big business gentry recognized was that which put thousands of pounds of profits into their pockets. Tliere is uo reason for believing that the manufacturers-itching for armaments contracts will have any lofty ideals about patriotism unless it returns profits on a substantial scale. Manufacturers who amassed huge fortunes during the war should be compelled to provide a considerable portion of the money required to meet our defence requirements, because many of them are enjoying prosperity only as the result of the excessive exploitation of the general community. Should the Government get the necessary authority to raise a loan of £10,300,000 for defence purposes, posterity will be compelled to shoulder a large portion of the burden, because the cruisers, aeroplanes and other mechanical equipment the Government proposes to purchase will soon become obsolete and will have to be scrapped. I listened witb interest to the speeches of Henry Gullett) referred to honourable members on this side of the chamber on the international situation, and I do not intend to deal with the subject at length at this juncture, I propose to refer briefly to the inadequate protection' afforded to the men, women and children who are carrying on siu-h wonderful pioneering work in the",44,Charles Mark I F They Were Such An Organization As That One Realizes

The defence policy of the Labour party provides for the adequate defence of the Commonwealth, and if such a policy were in operation, those persons would receive more protection than they are likely to receive under the present Government's defence policy. The honourable member for Fawkner( Mr Holt) said that the House had been supplied with the fullest information concerning the Government's defence proposals, but the schedule to the bill gives only bare details of the manner in which this large sum of money is to be expended. used to manufacture war equipment for tbe destruction of human life, it should be utilized to provide reproductive work for the unemployed who, unfortunately, are still in our midst. Those who have travelled know that in the outback portions of Australia there are important undertakings awaiting development. In northern Queensland the State government is endeavouring to proceed with works, some of which were commenced years ago, but sufficient funds cannot be made available for the purpose. Apart from the insignificant efforts which have been made at Darwin, nothing has been done to protect tbose who are endeavouring to carry out the valuable pioneering work of our forebears. 1 notice that the proposes to visit the Northern Territory, and I trust that during his travels he also will inspect western Queensland. .Should he do so, he will find conditions totally different, from those in other parts of Aushead at Mount Isa or Dajarra in Queenstralia, and he will also see valuable assets land. which are not protected in any way. I am opposed to the proposal of the Government to permit private enterprise to engage in the manufacture of munitions, as such a policy may provide an opportunity for the armament ring operating overseas to commence in Australia. The British Government wanted to take over the complete control of the manufacture of armaments, but, unfortunately, it was not in a position to do so. .Listening to honourable members opposite, one would think that the Singapore base was constructed for the sole purpose of protecting Australia. According to a paragraph which appeared in the Melbourne Herald of the 5th December, 1934, f2«-| British trade to the value of more than £200,000,000 a year passes through the narrow straits at Singapore, between the Indian and Pacific oceans. That trade comes particularly from China, and we know that the Singapore base was constructed to protect in addition the British oil interests in Borneo and the East Indies. The opinion has been expressed that Darwin should be fortified and used in conjunction with the Singapore base. But provision is made in this bill for the expenditure of only £20,000 at Darwin, which is supposed to be a subsidiary to Instead of being Singapore. It is obvious that those making such a statement have not taken tlie trouble to ascertain the distance between Singapore and Darwin. If it is necessary to protect Darwin as a subsidiary base, it will also be necessary to fortify Koepang and Pcnang. Reference has been made to the blunder-and-muddle defence policy of the Government and particularly to certain works at Darwin. Oil tanks for defence purposes are constructed on the side of a hill overlooking the harbour at Darwin, and are painted white, so that an enemy would have no difficulty in locating them. This is an example of the Government's defence policy! It has been suggested in some quarters that in the event of war, enemy forces would land at Darwin, which has been described as our front door. Those of us who are familiar with northern Australia find it difficult to believe that an invading force would do this, because troops landed there would have to travel considerably over 1,000 miles to the railon this side made that statement. country between Darwin and the railhead in Queensland is very sparsely populated, and for nine months of the year is exceedingly dry, rendering the movement of troops almost impossible. It is therefore practically certain that enemy forces would attempt to land on the fertile north-eastern coast of Australia, where Japanese sampans were reported to have been seen on several occasions not so long ago, because food supplies and water would be available there. Although many thousands of pounds have been invested",45,Charles Mark I F They Were Such An Organization As That One Realizes

183,Mr Riordan,"The whole of theby governments and private individuals in the development of that part of Australia, there is no provision in this bill for fortifying that part of our coastline. Apparently the Government believes that enemy vessels would stand off Sydney harbour and engage in hostilities with our fortifications there. As northern Queensland is the only country in the tropics where white men do the labouring work in connection with primary production, it would seem that in any sound scheme of defence its claims for consideration .should not be overlooked. During the last five years this Government has spent £31,000,000 on defence. What have we to show for that expenditure ? Practically nothing. If one seeks information about details of the Government's defence programme, one is told that secrecy is essential. This"" hush-hush "" policy has persisted ever since this Government took office, and there is some reason to believe that in the present state of our defences, if an emergency arose, the Government would be unable to grapple with it. Reference has been made in this debate to the general belief that Japan has only a six months' oil supply. When asked whether he could give information concerning Australia's oil reserves, the Minister for Defence( Mr Thorby) said the people could rest assured that this vital matter had received the attention of the Government. With that we have to be content. But it is not too much to say that if the Government had, taken steps to provide secret oil reserves^or to install The establishment of this industry on a underground tanks, the whole world would have known about it in 24 hours. The bill contains provision for expansion of the various mechanized units of our defence forces, but no money is earmarked for oil supplies, apart from the scheme to render some assistance to a company Newnes. We have heard of secret tanks and oil reserves. I am sure that if the Government had been taking steps in this direction the news would have been splashed all over the front pages of our newspapers before now. The position of a nation lacking an adequate supply of oil in time of war is hopeless. During the Italo-Abyssinian dispute we heard much of a proposal to enforce oil sanctions against Italy, but nothing was done. If Mr Riordan. that action had been taken it is likely that the war would have come to a sudden end. party would not support the imposition of sanctions. point at issue then. The decision not to impose oil sanctions was made by Great Britain, whose policy was followed by this Government. This Government has no foreign policy of its own. According to the schedule to this bill, it is proposed to spend only £55,000 on reserves of stores, including ammunition, ordnance, torpedo stores and fuel oil. This meagre amount suggests the possibility of a bargain sale of oil somewhere, and that the Government is obtaining its supplies very cheaply. Nations in other parts of the world which have not oil supplies within their own territories are endeavouring, to make themselves independent of outside sources. Germany, well knowing that in the event of hostilities it would be in a very dangerous position if oil supplies were restricted, is taking steps to produce oil from vegetable products. This Government should do likewise. If Country party members supporting the Government were truly representative of rural interests, they would wholeheartedly support Labour's proposals for the assistance of -the power alcohol industry and thus restrain the activities of the oil combine. sound basis would not only make us independent of outside oil supplies, but also greatly assist in the development of important agricultural areas in Queensland and elsewhere.

The Government claims that these vessels are required urgently. That was the cry in 1934, and on previous occasions, when similar proposals were made for the purchase of vessels overseas. The construction of these ships should 'be carried out in Australia, thus establishing a new industry which would be of vital importance to this country so far as naval defence is concerned. be the cruiser size of our fleet if we kept of Australia in the shape of increased on 'building cruisers? to the purchase of these two cruisers overseas. In 1924, when Mr Bruce was discussing his Government's decision to add two cruisers to the Navy, he said that when he was in Great Britain he was pressed by the British Government to consent to the building of at least one cruiser there. The two cruisers now proposed to be purchased will cost approximately £2,000,000 each, but, over and above that, we must take into consideration exchange, which will amount to approximately £1,000,000, and the cost of bringing the vessels to Australia, which will be in the vicinity of £60,000. Thus, the total cost of these two new cruisers will be something like £5,060,000. They could, perhaps, be built much cheaper if the work were carried out in Australia. period of our prosperity, it was estimated that it would not cost much more to have a ship built in Australia than it would cost in England. The construction of these cruisers in Australia would probably mean the employment of 1,000 men for three years, plus the stimulus given to other businesses, leading to increased employment in many other directions. There would also be increased revenue from direct taxation, from customs and excise duties, and from transport services for the carriage of material and people. There would be a saving of approximately £500,000 in exchange, and relief to an amount of approximately £250,000 in sustenance payments to persons at present on sustenance and engaged on relief work in the States. The Premier of New South Wales, Mr Stevens, stated at the conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers held on the 12th August, 1937, that the Governments of New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland were paying to persons receiving sustenance or engaged upon relief work, the sum of £12,750,000 per annum. War and repatriation services, pensions &c, have, cost Australia £510,000,000, and interest charges on loans have amounted to £290,000,000. The proposal to finance this defence expenditure out of loan means a further imposition on the people interest payments. During the Great War, the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank, Sir Denison Miller, raised money for war purposes at one-fifth of the price charged by the private bankers. A further debt of £10,000,000, plus interest, is now to be passed on to posterity, although the money could have been provided out of revenue as is being done in Great Britain. have listened with interest to the speech of the honourable member for Kennedy( Mr Riordan), who devoted much energy to erecting Aunt Sallys, and immediately knocking them down.. I propose at the outset to devote a few minutes to' showing that his arguments are unsound. He suggested that, in regard to our defence proposals, we should have followed the example of the Chancellor of the Exchequer in Great Britain, by providing part of the additional money required for defence purposes out of revenue, and some of it possibly by way of loan. That is exactly what the Government has done already, and will probably do again. I remind the House that during the current year £11,000,000 was provided for defence purposes, £6,000,000 being taken out of general revenue, £3,000,000 out of the past surpluses, and £2,000,000 out of loan.

194,Mr Francis (Moreton) [9.3],"Ithe same as the Commonwealth did last .year. To-day, we are making preliminary arrangements for next year's budget. The raising of the funds required for next year's loan expenditure must be planned now. The Premiers of the several States come to the Loan Council at. this time of the year, so that they may know what loan funds will be available next vear. Of the proposed loan of £10,300,000'j only £4,000,000 is to be expended next year, and the rest of the money will be available for U3e as required. The Government is doing exactly as the British Chancellor of the Exchequer has done, and as the honourable member for Kennedy recommends should be done. The honourable member suggests that this Government has no interest in the workers, but is merely desirous of helping the class whom, he alleges, we on this military and aerial defence works to tht side represent. I speak for every member supporting the Government when 1 say that we stand for all sections of the comKennedy have no significance. It has been munity. which will be raised to defray the cost of receive no protection under this bill, yet the defence programme, or the interest on the money to be borrowed, will be paid directly by the workers of Australia, because all 'incomes below £250 a year are exempt from federal income tax. and the basic wage does not reach that figure. No worker ou the basic wage pays any federal income tax at all, yet the honourable member claims that the Government desires to burden 'the workers with extra taxation. On the contrary, it is trying to help the workers back into industry by reducing taxes. It has already reduced them by over £20,000,000, because ifc believes in the sound political principle that nothing hampers trade and industry, or reduces the standard of living, more than does excessive taxation. That industrial expansion has marked the present Government's term of office is shown by the fact that 525,000 more workers are engaged in secondary industries than when it assumed office.

It is laying a well-conI challenge the honourable member to tell sidered plan in whicli our great Mr Francis. the House which honourable gentleman made that suggestion. As a matter of fact, nobody has done so. A good deal of the energy of the honourable member was used up in expounding the obvious futility of an enemy attempting to march upon the densely-populated areas of Australia through Darwin. Another point he raised, wa3 that Singapore was of no significance in connection with tlie defence of Australia. But, so important, is the Singapore Naval Base with regard to the general defence of this country, New Zealand and the Pacific Islands under British control, fchat the New Zealand Government provided £1,000,000 towards fche cost of that base. Australia's contribution towards Empire defence is represented in the defence works already erected at Darwin, and the additional improvements to be made there. Proposals are in hand for expenditure on naval, extent of £600,000. The arguments advanced by the honourable member for Not one penny of the taxes said that northern Queensland will all the assistance offered by the honourable member is his opposition to the measure! It has been stated that the policy of the Government is designed to invite the armament ring to do in Australia the horrible things which are said to have been done in Great Britain and the United States of America. It is proposed by the Government to provide £1,000,000 for the organization of secondary industries, so that they may be speedily equipped for tbe manufacture of munitions and other defence requirements. The co-ordination of the metal and engineering industries plays an important part in equipment of a nation for the work of defence. The iron and steel industry has always been of the utmost importance in this regard, because it provides the material necessary for the tools of war. The great metal and engineering industries fashion and forge the » weapons of defence. The Government is He said that tries to purchase additional machinery iron and steel industries can, at a moment's notice, switch, over to the production of warlike materials, without delay or dislocation. The Government has provided for advisory panels in connection with the re-organization of secondary industries. It has been pointed out by the Government that it is not proposed to make a complete unit in any section of the engineering industry that pai-ticipates in the effort to be made to bring about national security, but that the parts manufactured will be assembled under the direction of the Defence Department. Let me remind honourable members of the basic principle!) of this bill. It is proposed to provide an extra £10,300,000 for urgent defence requirements in the immediate future, £4,000,000 to be raised at an early date, and the balance from time to time as is required. This is part of the plan for financing an expenditure, during the next three years, of approximately £43,000,000, which is to be allocated as follows:£ Navy Army Air Force .. 12,500,000 Munitions Supply Brunch 3,000,000 Plans for re-organization of industry .. 1 agree with honourable memhers on the ministerial side that, in view of the tragic international conditions obtaining to-day, it is surprising and disappointing that the Opposition has indicated that it proposes to vote against the bill. is not prepared to dip into revenue. He wishes to place the burden of this expenditure on the grandchildren of the present generation 40 years hence. stage that this year the Government has already dipped into the funds contributed by the taxpayer. In my judgment that general principle must be considered in any future budget. Tbe £4,000,000 to be raised at an early date is part of the loan money allocated to the Commonwealth by the Loan Council. surer circulate that information among national security. The honourable memmembers of the Opposition? duced into the House of Commons by the routes would be so much greater in the British Chancellor of the Exchequer provides that money for defence shall be obtained largely from taxation and general revenue, and we shall have to do the same in the future. of the Exchequer proposed to raise only £93,000,000 by way of loan, compared with about £250,000,000 from revenue in the next financial year. prised if similar action were taken here, on a pro rata basis. in this bill. which has been forced on Australia, is to be regretted, for it will mean that the development of our primary and secondary industries and the extension of social services will, to some extent, have to make way for national security. However, the expenditure of this money will not only provide for the defence of Australia; it also represents a general contribution towards Empire defence. No one can ibe .. .. 15,000,000 enthusiastic about such expenditure, but .. ] 1.500,000 ' every man worthy of the name desires to play his part in securing the safety of the nation. One feature of the Prime Minis1,000,000 ter's speech appears to have been forgotten by the Opposition. The right honorahle member made it clear that the new plan was to be flexible; expenditure would be either increased or decreased according to the trend of international affairs. He assured the public that the programme would be under constant review by both the Government and the Defence Council, and that the policy would vary as the international situation, and. the general requirements of the British Empire, demanded. I support whole-heartedly the programme submitted by the Government, although I deplore the international situation which makes it necessary. Since the last budget was prepared, the international tension has increased unmistakably.

If that policy were followed it is certain that our trade routes would not be kept open. The policy of the Opposition is contrary to the advice of experts, both in Australia and overseas. Fortunately, it was rejected by the people. Australia's progress and development depend on the sale overseas of its surplus primary products.

That would mean an immediate glut in the Australian market, with a corresponding fall of prices. Should the primary producers be ruined, Australia's secondary industries, which During the recent depend largely on funds made available by the sale of our primary products overopposite advocated a policy sea, will suffer. When the prices of primary products fail, every one suffers, industry is brought into confusion, unemployment increases, and generally a state of chaos results. The basic cause of the recent depression was the decreased national income by about £250,000,000 caused by the lower prices received for Australian primary products sold overseas. Fortunately, prices have recovered, and, consequently, there is now greater prosperity all round. The loss of our trade routes would mean not only that we should be unable to dispose of our surplus primary products, but also that we should be unable to obtain from outside Australia many of the things necessary for our national Perdevelopment, such as oils and petrol. t a k by Without oil, our air force machines could not leave the ground, whilst Kingdom. our naval vessels would be forced 55,155,630 19,671,378 to remain in our harbours.

203,Mr Brennan,"Hear, hear!",51,Exports From Australia 1936 37
204,Mr Francis,"It would be as inadequate. Battalion commanders and other ranks do not receive the encouragement from the general staff that they deserve. The period of training is altogether inadequate, and the pay is unreasonable. A period of twelve half days' training and six days in camp is hopelessly inadequate. Actually, a camp of six days gives not more than four days' training, because one day is spent in going to camp, and another in clearing up and returning home. Greater scope and more financial assistance should be given to battalion commanders. A special fund should be established to provide for week-end bivouacs, and the pay should be increased. Another difficulty is the constant flow in and out of the various companies. Much of the work is irksome and uninteresting, largely because the flow does not permit the commanders to give more than elementary training. Much more attention should be given to the building up of our militia forces. ""No military position can be captured, nor can a raid or attack be effectively repulsed without infantry, or mounted infantry. Minister must give more attention to these important arms of our defence forces. At present recruiting is somewhat spasmodic. In the circumstances that exist in the world to-day, a sustained effort should be made to obtain more recruits. To that end the training should be made more interesting. The mechanization of the weapons of defence means that long training is necessary before men become highly efficient in their use. It is imperative that an appeal be made to all employers to allow their employees to attend camps for continuous training and to encourage them to join the militia. Much can be said for and against the system of universal military training. I have come to the conclusion that such a system could not and should not be instituted in Australia in time of peace without an appeal to the pcopie by means of a referendum. I say, nevertheless, should circumstances arise in which it appears that Australia is liable to immediate attack, that that policy will have to be given effect. The Government should concentrate on creating greater numbers of our instructional staff, so that in any emergency the trained personnel would be ready immediately to instruct our young manhood in the art of attack and defence. I invite the Government to give greater attention to the needs of rifle clubs, and to encourage those clubs to maintain a closer co-operation and liaison with the militia. Many riflemen throughout ' Australia are desirous of forming clubs with assistance from the Government in the building of rifle ranges, but as far as I know that sympathetic assistance which ought to be forthcoming is not evident. The Labour party desires to break away from Great Britain, and to adopt a policy of isolation which I regard as a policy of suicidal insanity. The only effective guarantee of national security for Australia in time of international tension is co-operation with Great Britain. In the interests, not only of Australia, but' also of the rest of the Empire, it is imperative that the GovernThe ment should earnestly proceed with the policy that has been laid down. Any recent improvement of international relations in Eiirope is attributable to the substantial improvement of Great Britain's defences. Great Britain's expenditure of £1,500,000,000 on defence, and its indication that it will spend much more if the circumstances require it, has shown to the world how determined it is to defend itself, and to co-operate with the rest of the Empire in Empire defence, with, the result that European countries generally have adopted a changed attitude towards our Motherland. If we in the southern hemisphere are similarly to ensure peace in Australia; if we are not to be molested in any way we must follow Britain's example, and rapidly increase our defences. Only when Australian defences have been developed to the standard now aimed at can this country confidently look forward to a continuation of peace.

205,Mr Holloway (Melbourne Ports),"heard the speeches of several members opposite, men whom we know are experts, many being members of the military forces, and holding strong convictions which form a guide to others anxious to understand, we would consider the question of defence a very serious problem to the people of Australia. But what is the logical outcome of the carrying of this bill? Surely those of us who have listened to this debate, and to the definite statements of the honourable members for Henty( Sir Henry Gullett) and Corangamite ( Mr Street), and others who know what they are talking about, must reach the ultimate conclusion that this bill"" means the beginning of an expenditure which must be continually increased. It must result in an increase of the number of our permanent forces, and will lead, inevitably, to the adoption of a system of universal military training. That is the only logical outcome of the Government's defence proposals. night of the need for a standing army, and for an increased staff, in all branches, naval, military and air, in order to train the increased number of recruits necessary to implement this plan; also of the need to increase the pay of the forces, and to make their conditions more attractive, and that we must continually supplement the defence measures we are considering to-night, which are only a beginning. But I remind honourable members that only si.x or seven months ago the people of Australia were absolutely astounded at the large defence budget to which this chamber was asked to give its approval. The then Minister for Defence( Sir Aj-chdale Parkhill) made an elaborate verbal and printed explanation of the then proposals, so that he might satisfy the people of Australia that that immense expenditure of money on defence, which was the highest peace-time vote since federation, was warranted. Why, six or seven months later, should we be asked to pass a bill imposes upon the people of Australia an expenditure than that formerly proposed? Does the international panicky piece of legislation? Why should we place on the shoulders of the people the burden which must follow from the Mr holloway. measure now before us, unless it be that some great change has taken place in the international situation during the last six months, and has made it absolutely urgent and necessary? Let us examine, not our own puny viewpoint upon this subject, but the opinion of experts all over the world who have endeavoured to draw a picture of what the situation was six months ago, when the last defence appropriation was passed by this Parliament, and compare it with the situation as we find it to-day and see if Australia's position is not better and the fear of being involved in war much more remote. I remember at that time that we were more tightly tied to the League of Nations than we are to-day; our affiliation with the League of Nations both before and at that period carried very serious obligations. Our promise to implement sanctions during the Abyssinian crisis created ""We have heard toa very serious position in Australia that might momentarily have involved Australia in the vortex of war. At that time one of our own cruisers was in the Mediterranean Sea, right in the cockpit of war had war taken place. But now I am. sorry to say the League is dead and our responsibility to the League is also dead. Such were the difficulties that confronted us only six or seven months ago. Since then, unless Cabinet' has some secret information of which we know nothing, the Mediterranean crisis has been satisfactorily settled. The crisis which then confronted the people of Australia, as well as the rest of the world, was brought about because Great Britain had failed to reach an agreement with Italy over tlie separate interests of each country in Abyssinia. Both countries had tried, as every lionorablu rripmher knows, for months on end whilst that conflict was simmering, to come to some understanding as to how their separate interests were to which be preserved in that coveted territory, but. no agreement could be arrived at and the three times greater Abyssinian war took place with all the consequent horrors and bloodshed. And situation warrant this now we find that the agreement which both countries had endeavoured to achieve before the conflict has been signed and sealed now that the Abyssinian crisis is supposed to be over. Tbe conflicting interests of tlie two' nations have been straightened out, so we are told, and large credits, somewhat on the basis of those whicli Britain advanced to Italy in 1914-1915 are being made by Great Britain to Italy, not on this occasion to implement Italian inroads into Abyssinia, but in an attempt to improve the internal economic situation in Italy and thus prevent a rising of the Italian people. Even a casual survey of fhe international situation today by one with an open mind on this question must convince one that the possibilities of Australia being involved in war to-day are much more remote than they were six months, seven months, or twelve months ago. Apart altogether from the very delicate situation in the Mediterranean, surely there are other signs that must force us to the conclusion that our position is much better and not much worse than it was six or seven months ago. Is it not true to say that the situation between Japan and Great Britain has altogether changed ? Surely it is recognized by those who know something of internal Japan that internal conditions in that country have also changed. Ts it not known by those who write with knowledge of internal Japan that the reason for Japan's rash and ruthless haste in its present conflict with China during which it has insulted representatives of every nation in the world, is its urgent need to end this conflict as quickly as possible because of internal unrest? Those who try from its industrial and economic viewpoint know these things to be so. The internal conditions in Italy and the internal industrial unrest in Japan and Germany are the real factors which will operate to save Australia and the rest of the world from another war. I am firmly of the conviction that Australia and the rest of the world will be saved from war because of the internal discontent bottled up by dictators where they exist in Europe and because of internal discontent also bottled up in Japan. The belief in the world to-day is that the two real reasons which prevent war are, first, that no country dares take a large force outside its own borders to attack another country lest its own people will seize the opportunity to give vent to their bottled up discontent-the fear of the great masses of the people in those countries. rising against those in power is a great factor in the maintenance of world peace to-dayand secondly, the knowledge that you cannot destroy or weaken other nations without ruining your own. Because of that, I object to this extra expenditure for defence purposes. As an individual representing a large electorate to which I am responsible and Australia as a whole, .1 say that this panicky legislation is unnecessary. There is '""""> i-»i<?nn why WR should be involved in a defence policy which has in it the elements of aggression rather than self-preservation. It has in it elements which cannot be regarded as purely defensive and which will not promote good relations with our Pacific neighbours, but are rather in the nature of gestures of offence and aggression. For that reason alone I should object to that portion of the bill, even if I did not object to the whole of the increased expenditure on armaments which can be described not as armaments of defence, but only as armaments of aggression. I object to the proposed expenditure abroad, not only because it takes money out of Australia and helps to depress the economic conditions of the people of Australia, but also because it is not a logical way of developing a real defensive force to study international history in Australia. The elementary basis of any defence scheme must be a continual improvement of the technical knowledge of our people, and, if we are going to buy naval vessels abroad rather than build them in this country, how can we help to make our country self-contained and self-reliant? I object, therefore, to the expenditure of many millions of pounds on the purchase of naval vessels in Great Britain. That is an un-Australian policy which cannot strengthen the defences of this country. I am opposed also to the expenditure of £1,000,000 in Australia in helping to improve the plant and equipment of private manufacturing firms. I have never objected to the Government of the Commonwealth subsidizing the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research to investigate and help industries of a normal economic condition, but I do protest against the expenditure of £1,000,000 of the taxpayers' money in improving plant and equipment of private firms, supplying patterns, and in lending to them skilled artisans from government workshops, thus encouraging the greatest evil that exists in the world to-day-profit-makin g from the private manufacture of armaments. I remember that with relief and satisfaction I heard the Treasurer ( Mr the opportunity to engage in this work. Casey) and the Prime Minister( Mr From the beginning it was intended that Lyons) declare a few months ago when, as an appeal or a warning, I spoke against the private manufacture of armaments, that no move would be made by the Government to encourage that kind of industry in this country. The Treasurer said that he did not believe in private enterprise engaging in such work. Yet it is to be allowed. It is within the knowledge of every honorahle member of this House that for 10 years or more, every international conference, every meeting of the League of Nations and every great economic conference held to discover how world stability could be regained, have carried resolutions to the effect that there can be no peace in the world until the private manufacture of armaments is stamped out by law and made illegal. always said that the main thing necessary for the promotion of world peace is the removal of tariff barriers. those conferences discussed the dangers of economic nationalism and the tariff barriers that had been raised, always someone has moved and someone seconded a resolution, which was carried unanimously, advocating the abolition of the private armaments trade;; for no meeting of men or women, no matter what their class, would dare to vote against a motion asking the governments of the world to prohibit by law the right of private enterprise to make profits out of arms and munitions. Yet this Governamount of £300,000 by which this proment is setting aside £1,000,000 in order posed loan will exceed £10,000,000 has to help to equip and make modern the plant and layout of private firms in this country which will engage in this nefarious traffic. I declare now that only one or two firms will enjoy this rich plum. The smaller engineering workshops have been asked to tender for the manufacture of shells, shell cases and them with blue prints and other munitions of war, but they have had to refuse because they are operating on too small a scale to be able to reorganize themselves to engage in the munitions industry on a profitable basis. As a matter of fact, it was never intended that any of these small firms should have a few enterprises, associated with the BrokenH ill Proprietary Company Limited, which the honourable member for Swan( Mr Gregory) and the honourable member for Forrest( Mr Prowse) have always opposed on the floor of this House because of the. high prices that they charge for galvanized iron and the like, should have the monopoly of the manufacture of arms and munitions in Australia. Motors-Holdens Limited? doubt interlocked with the BrokenH ill Proprietary Company Limited. I am certain that the 20 or 30 persons who are associated with the organizations which will lend this £10,300,000 are also linked with the BrokenH ill Proprietary Company Limited, the big oil companies and other wealthy concerns. They will also benefit from the spending of the money. Goodness knows how many more millions of pounds will be borrowed if the suggestions of military-minded honourable members on the Government side of the House are effectuated. That effect will be given to them is certain, because this enhanced military programme would never be successful otherwise. The whole scheme is snowball-like and it will ever grow because, unless it does grow overhead expenses will be too great. I need not remind the House that the",52,Exports From Australia 1936 37

If the Government were really an Australian government and had been possessed of sufficient patriotism to obtain from the Commonwealth Bank credits in respect of the £60,000,000 borrowed during the last four years, the £33,000,000 paid in interest on those loans would have been returned to the bank and would be again available to meet the expense of the warlike activities now proposed by the Government. The only reason why such a course is not adopted even now, so far as I can see, is that the Government regards private enterprise, even banking, as sacrosanct. To meet the cost, of defending the wealth of Australia, we should utilize the Commonwealth Bank. My own opinion is that that, bank, backed by the securities Australia possesses, could supply the necessary credits to meet our defence operations without earning any interest at all That could be done without departing from any principle, as the practice is understood all over the world and has been resorted to by England and other countries on many occasions. If , adopting the advice offered in the last report of tbe Banking 'Commission, that should decide the policy of the Commonwealth Bank, this Government suggested authorities of the bank thai in future Australia would raise all loans through the bank, on such loans interest could he paid at the rates applicable to the loans floated during the last four years, to which I referred a moment ago, but the difference would be that that interest, instead of going to private institutions, would he earned by the Commonwealth Bank. There is, I suggest, nothing reA'oIutionprofits from the money necessary to carry ary in that proposal. It means only that out the defence of the country. the Government would then be a real Australian patriotic to patronize its own institution bill, and because the extra expenditure and to remember that it should servo over and above that agreed upon six or not merely the private banking instituseven months ago is unnecessary. tions, but the people as a whole. Tht. oppose it also because the Government reason why that course has not been has given no explanation of the interadopted is that such action would, to a national situation that would warrant large extent, encroach upon the preserves this additional expenditure, and because of the financial institutions. I assert this programme must inevitably lead that the individuals who are largely to further expenditure in order that interested in private banks in this the plan of defence may be logical country, and who will share profits and not top-heavy. amounting to millions of pounds earned diture must, be involved in filling the upon this and subsequent loans, are also ranks and in making the machinery interested in the manufacture of arms which has been set up function satisfacand munitions which will be sold to the torily, and to continue borrowing money Government. They will thus benefit in in the same old way from private banking two ways. They will lend money to the Government for the carrying out of defence works and with that money the Government will buy the materials which the lenders have supplied. After paying half the amount of the loan in interest during the period of the loan-eleve n or twelve years-w e shall still owe the full amount, and if the loan is renewed, we will again pay in interest half the principal aniuunt, although, of course, the full amount of the loan will still be owing, which means that in 24 years we will pay the £10,000,000'in interest and we will still owe the £10,000,000 borrowed. The Government should, I contend, be patriotic enough to adopt the suggestions made by the Banking ""Commission and say, "" In carrying out these defence operations we shall eliminate the profits private bankers have made so regularly out of governmental activities, and raise the the Government money required through our own banking institution; if necessary, the interest may go into the revenue of the bank. to the governing If the security behind the Commonwealth Bank was good enough to permit of the advance of £50,000,000 to make it possible for the State Savings Bank of New South Wales to re-open its doors and resume business, it, certainly should be strong enough to enable the bank to advance £10,000,000 to the Commonwealth Government. It is, I suggest, a political crime to endeavour to satisfy the avarice of the private banking institutions by permitting them to obtain government, sufficiently I oppose the bill because it is a loan I More expeninstitutions, so that half the capital amount is paid in interest, will impose a burden of both direct and indirect taxation upon the people that they will not be able to bear. -The honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Holloway) usually makes a very thoughtful contribution to discussions in this Hotise, and with the latter portion of his speech I am, because I dislike the idea of raising a loan for defence purposes. I should much prefer the money to be raised by taxation, possibly of surplus profits, because the employer and the property-owner usually have most to lose as a result of war and should, therefore, be called upon to contribute in no small measure to the defence of the country. AlthoughI am for that reason, but with certain qualifications, in agreement with the honourable member, that is not sufficient to cause me to dissociate myself from the Government in respect of this measure. Bearing in mind the information possessed by the department concerned, if the Government intends to carry out a defence scheme and is of the opinion that the only means by which it. can raise sufficient funds to finance that scheme is upon the lines proposed, I would not attempt to "" spike"" the scheme merely to support an objection I have to floating loans for defence purposes. hope the Government will reconsider the matter and will decide not to proceed with its loan proposal. As regards the earlier portion of the remarks of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, he did not succeed in convincing the House that his view was correct; in fact, I am perfectly satisfied that he did not even convince himself. To me it seemed that he was merely prefacing his remarks with respect to loans generally by an assumption. I suggest to him that, if he desires any reason for the proposed expansion of the defence scheme, the international situation is suffimembers opposite. ' Those who have cient to warrant that action being taken, although I , perhaps, might place upon it an interpretation different from that arrived at by him. This Government must be guided by the British Government which, of course, is in much closer touch with the international situation; consequently the Commonwealth Government feels justified in introducing the comprehensive defence policy outlined by the Prime Minister( Mr Lyons). Obviously, there must be reasons other than those known to us why the British Government has found itself obliged to expand its defence scheme. The factors which have influenced that Government to with qualifications, in accord, act as it has, have also a very important bearing upon Australia, and our defence policy must be framed to function in cooperation with British policy. Possibly the fact that the League of Nations has ceased to be an effective force in international affairs has necessitated the steps which are now being taken, not only by Great Britain, but also by Australia. Another reason for the adoption of this policy may be that Mr Anthony Eden, who stood four-square behind the League, has been dethroned, and there is now a definite leaning from the League by the British Government. Thati n itself may be sufficient to influence the Government to adopt a more effective scheme. So long as Fascism and Nazism are influencing world affairs, democracy must be definitely threatened and endangered. The absorption of Austria by Germany, and the threat to Czechoslovakia by the latter country are. sufficient to cause Great Britain to strengthen its defences I and. consolidate the whole of the Empire so far as possible by moans of an Empire defence scheme. The disinclination of the Government to supply the House with details of the £10,300,000 to be expendeda point upon which the Government has received a good deal of criticism-ma y be due to the fact that this is a matter of urgency, and that immediate co-operation between Great Britain and the Commonwealth is essential. Eveni f it were desirable, it would' take considerable time to supply the House with the details of the proposed expenditure as suggested by honourable opposed the Government's defence policy cannot be said to be disloyal, because I believe that they are just as anxious as we are to do the best for Australia. Honourable members opposite have talked a lot about an adequate defence policy,",56,Domestic Issues
218,Mr Harrison (Wentworth) [10.7].,"Loan but that means little or nothing unless they explain exactly what such a policy embraces. side have at least stated what they mean by adequate defence, and have also submitted some constructive criticism. In view of the position in China, which may have been exaggerated to some extent, the possibilities of a conflict in Europe, and the position in the Mediterranean, the Government is justified in launching a defence scheme that will provide for the proper protection of this country. If , as should also arrange for skeleton dumps of a result of complications arising out of international bitterness and jealousies, war should occur and find us unprepared, those who are opposing the Government's policy would be subject to rigorous criticism and would have to answer tp the Australian people. The fact that armed forces of European nations are greater to-day than they were at the outbreak of the Great War should compel us to give this measure our support. Europe and Asia are armed camps and, in consequence of the rapid development which has taken place in aviation, we are, in effect, closer to the possible centre of disturbance than we have ever been. In these circumstances, we should see if we cannot place Australia's defence in such a position that defence programme we should make a we shall not be open to the criticism of experts. Immediately following the Great War, we adopted a peace-time standard which may have been justified. We were then engaged in ' rehabilitating the country, and had reason to hope that the world would not be plunged into another major war for many years. But peacetime standards can no longer be regarded as adequate. At present the strength of our militia forces is under 35,000, which is quite inadequate to defend a country 25 times larger than Great Britain, and with a coastline of 12,000 miles. The Government realizes this, and, in extending its defence system, is seeking the authority of Parliament to borrow the amount mentioned in the bill to provide a system of defence commensurate with the conditions obtaining to-day. Some of the suggestions made here may be submitted to experts for consideration and others tabulated for future reference. We should realize the important part which we must take in this great scheme [3 MAY, 1938.] Bill 1938. 729 of Empire defence, and without delay make a complete survey of the whole of Honourable members on this our resourcesa survey not only of our productive capacity in foodstuffs and raw materials, but also of our secondary industries and our man power. We should have a grouping of all men of military age, and of those men who would be required in industry so that, in time of emergency, they could immediately take their places in a gigantic scheme of Empire defence. We foodstuffs and the necessary materials for warfare, in order that, if war occurred, we might have a complete organization for effective operation. I have said that the peace-time strength of our militia forces is not sufficient. We should have at least double the present number, with the necessary increase of_our permanent forces. I incline to the belief that the indication given by the Minister concerning the increase of warrant officers and instructors foreshadows the re-introduction by the. Government of some form of universal training, if it is .not intended, to persevere with the voluntary system. In any discussion of the Government's thorough examination of all arms of the service and consider the probable action to be taken by a potential enemy. Australia being an island continent, the Navy must be our first line of defence. But Empire considerations require that a defence policy to be adequate must fit into the great mosaic of Empire defence. Australia cannot expect to formulate its defence programme without regard to other parts of the Empire. The scheme advocated by honourable members opposite is purely isolationist in character. It pays no regard to the ramifications of the Empire and Australia's responsibility as part of it. A balanced Empire defence scheme, ensuring the co-operation of all the dominions must be the greatest deterrent to a potential enemy. The defence policy of the Opposition is, I repeat, isolationist in character, and is militarily unsound. Napoleon's policy in dealing with his enemies was expressed in the motto"" Divide and conquer."" We now realize that if in defence matters. 30 the various units of the British Empire were divided, each endeavouring to secure its own security without regard to the safety of others tliey would become easy prey for an aggressor nation. As I see it, Australia's defence policy must be a composite one. In every detail,' it must fit in with the greater scheme of Empire defence. Therefore, our aim should be to adopt a plan which will give the greatest degree of protection to Australia itself, and at the same time, furnish effective and mobile forces to play their part in the greater scheme of Empire defence."" Some honourable members have questioned the value of Singapore as a naval base. I cannot conceive of any Australian naval defence scheme being successful unless it is based on Singapore, which I regard as Australia's eastern frontier. envisage Singapore as a base to be used by the Australian Navy in time of stressas a jumping off place for possible raids by British cruisers, and I consider that Darwin as a supplementary base will have great strategic value. Singapore is a 'necessary adjunct to our naval defence scheme, and I congratulate the Government on the expansion of its programme to ensure greater protection for our seaborne trade. When we realize that during the period when our national income was in the vicinity of £650,000,000, our seaborne trade amounted to £290,000,000, and when we recall the suffering caused during the depression when the national income dropped to £435,000,000 and our overseas trade to £130,000,000, we get a clear picture of what a complete dislocation of our seaborne trade would mean. Therefore, the Government's programme for the expansion of our naval forces has definite value as part, of the wider scheme of Empire defence, as well as affording more adequate protection for Australia's seaborne trade. I agree to a certain extent witb some of the criticism of honourable members opposite concerning the effectiveness of a oruiser squadron, but I do not agree that cruisers are not necessary. Experience has shown that their speed and striking power provide the necessary protection for our commerce lanes. A battleship or battle cruiser would hardly Sir. Harrison. Loan [REPRESENTATIVES.] Bill 1938. be used for this purpose, the function of such vessels being to determine raajor naval engagements. I believe that the establishment of the naval base at Singapore foreshadows the establishment of a British Pacific fleet comprising capital ships and cruisers to ensure the safety of Australia and other British possessions in the Far East. The best way to overcome the danger of attack would be to develop the speed and striking power of the forces opposed to the potential enemy. The combination of the Singapore base and our own cruisers is of great importance in Australia's defence plan. This country has definite obligations with regard to Singapore, which certainly stands between us and any threat of invasion from eastern waters. Australia has not directly contributed to tbe cost of the Singapore base as New Zealand has, and as Australia will, II believe, ultimately become the centre for the manufacture of munitions in the Pacific, and, possibly, the centre for the distribution of armaments throughout the British possessions in the Pacific, I think that we have a definite obligation with regard to the Singapore base, and may have to garrison it. If war occurred, Australia would probably be called upon to supply and maintain a garrison there, and, possibly, to divert most of its forces there to protect this base which I believe is necessary to our very existence. Therefore, I suggest that we should take full advantage of what Singapore has to offer as a training ground by sending detachments there for general experience. I direct the attention of the Minister for Defence to the marked difference in the conditions operating between the officers of the Royal Australian Naval Reserve and the Royal Australian Navy Volunteer Reserve. The volunteer reserve contains officers formerly in the merchant service who hold a ticket, and can take a ship to sea, whilst the Royal Naval Reserve is composed of men who, in the main, have no knowledge of navigation, and cannot handle ships at sea. There are ready means whereby we could weave into tbe naval reserve the type of men who have come out of the merchant service and are prepared to maintain their contact with the deep sea. opened in Sydney yesterday, and in Melbourne to-day, for tbe training of exmom bers of tbe merchant service to meet any emergency. The volunteer reserve is not entirely composed of men with experience of the mercantile marine. Bay 99 per cent, of the officers of the volunteer reserve hold tickets. but it does not apply generally throughout the reserve. Bay we have an excellent depot, but the members of the regular reserve find their training possibly a little irksome, because they cannot get the first hand experience that would be imparted aboai'd a. sloop or destroyer. I the placing at tlieir disposal of one of the sloops that may be out of commission, to enable the rank and file to receive the best form of training available. In the past, naval vessels have beeu left to rust in Sydney Harbour while these men have been required to carry out routine training ashore. If a destroyer had been made available to them, they would have received encouragement, and would have been enabled to obtain more useful training. Now consider the army. Whilsti t is generally acknowledged that untrained and poorly armed men are a menace to the safety of any country, and that modern equipment and armament are necessary, .in the final analysis the security of a country depends almost entirely on the man-power that it can command. As the present world conditions demand a. departure from peace time standards, and as our main danger will be from raids on seaport towns, and raids associated with the landing of armed forces to destroy big industrial centres, some increase of onr militia forces is essential. If we cannot get the necessary recruits under the voluntary system, compulsory training should be introduced. Even though we might increase our militia forces to afford protection against possible -raids, that would not be a sufficient deterrent if any nation decided to invade this country, or to raid it on a large scale. Therefore, it is necessary to provide for a defence force sufficiently large to act as a deterrent to invasion. Adequate local defence is tlie best deterrent we can have. The present system of recruiting does not give us the type or the number of men required. The honourable member for Fawkner( Mr Holt), and other honourable members, have pointed out during this debate that considerably fewer volunteers are rejected now than was the case some years ago. The medical examination of recruits is less rigorous than formerly. to learn that. member for Fawkner showed that the number of recruits rejected at the present time is 28 per cent, lower than formerly. the physical standard has deteriorated. It urge the Minister to consider may mean that the quality of the applicants has, on tbe whole, improved. orable gentleman suggest that, when it is well known that about 35 per cent, of the total population are being treated in public hospitals? I suggest that the honourable member is putting forward something which he knows is not correct. If he will study the type of trainee now undergoing training, he will soon be convinced that the authorities have lowered the standard considerably, possibly because they have found difficulty in attracting suitable men. with that statement? pulsory examination, all the unfit have to be examined, only to be rejected, whereas, under the voluntary system, those who believe that they are really unfit do not offer. That is one of the reasons for the figures which have been quoted. figures quoted by the honourable membeT for Fawkner apply, not to the compulsory system, but to the voluntary system which was in operation previously. The figures supplied to the honourable member for Corangamite ( Mr Street) should convince any honourable member that the standard of physical fitness required of members of the volunteer forces is not so high as it was previously.

229,Mr Harrison,"I suggest that the man, conditions must be improved. It has been suggested that voluntary enlistment should be made sufficiently remunerative to cause men to take an active interest in the defence of their country. With that suggestion I agree. No man should be asked to defend the property of others unless he is paid reasonable remuneration for his services. In my opinion smarter uniforms should also be provided, not necessarily for field service, but as parade dress. I suggest something similar to the uniforms worn by guards' regiments overseas. have attracted youths elsewhere, and the effect in Australia might be the same. I am certain that something of the kind will have to be done in the near future. I also advocate more outdoor training. Drill within halls should be avoided as much as possible. If the Government wants to make training attractive, it must provide for week-end bivouacs, where men can receive training under active service conditions, and be permitted to fire live ammunition instead of dummies. It is incumbent on the 'Government to see that any man who is sufficiently patriotic to join the volunteer forces shall associated with it that the mere training be given security of employment :by his employer. An employer who wishes his possessions to be protected should be willAs the honourable member for Henty said, ing to give security of employment to those who are prepared to protect them. I know of some employers who penalize those of their employees who desire to attend military training camps, and therefore I suggest that the Minister should cause a survey to be made of the conditions obtaining in industry in this connection. If the volunteer system does not prove satisfactory, I strongly advocate the adopSalisbury Plains, Heytesbury and Lark tion of universal military training. I do so for many reasons. In the first place, it would tend to improve the physique of the young men of this country. Even if we do not definitely link them up with arms and armaments imme'diately, I suggest that youths be trained in discipline and physique, somewhat along the lines of the labour battalions in Germany, whose members, it was said, have merely to substitute rifles for shovels to be well-trained soldiers. Such a scheme of training would Sir. Harrison. help to develop strong, healthy men, who should exist in greater numbers in a country that offers the facilities that Australia offers. Moreover, the training should be training in a true sense of the word. In that respect the previous compulsory effort that Australia made was a farce. There was no proper discipline or training, and much of the time of the trainees was wasted. If there is to be a compulsory system, the training should be 100 per cent, efficient, and suflicient remuneration They should be paid to the men who come under it . I make a strong plea for more interest by the Defence Department in the physical training of the youth of Australia in our schools. The figures quoted by the honourable member for Fawkner are sufficiently staggering to warrant that interest being taken. In the past, defence officers took an active part in the training of teachers who, in turn, instructed the boys in the schools. Partly as a result of thattraining, members of the Australian Im perial Force achieved a world-wide reputation for their fine physique. The last war brought home clearly to all those who were of troops in the use of arms is not all that is required to make efficient soldiers. the glorious failure at Gallipoli was sufficient to convince hiin of that. On the western front, American troops when sent into action on their own, suffered such heavy casualties because of lack of experience that later they were attached to Australian divisions in order to gain experience. As a gunner who served in the last war, I know that men, after receiving some training in Australia and, later, further training in England at Hill, were, on being drafted to France, placed with men who had had battle experience. The presence of men trained in battle tactics had a wonderfully steadying effect on the reinforcements, who, too, became proficient within a short time. My point is that the training of men in Australia in arms and armaments is not sufficient. We should insist on having detachments participate in training under active service conditions in India or Arabia, or elsewhere, where they can gain experience of the right kind. have had battle practice would have a steadying effect, and provide the volunteers with comrades on whom they could rely in time of need. Havingi n mind that the A i r Force cannot be entirely independent, but must co-operate with mobile land forces as weii as the Navy, efforts should be made to encourage airmindedness youths of Australia. should be taken in organizations such as the Australia A i r league, which are doing much for the youth of Australia. I have no doubt that the A i r Force is trained to co-operate with tlie other arms of our defence force, but I suggest that if it is not already part of their training, pilots be trained to discover and identify vessels approaching the Australian coast. I suggest also that bases be established at Lord Howe Island and Norfolk Island. All of these measures, to my mind, are essential defence they are only a layman, I have no doubt that many of them have been taken into consideration, but moment being considered, I request that they be placed before those competent to give them the necessary consideration. While commending it for its excellent proposals for the expansion of our defence scheme, I feel, with the honourable member for Henty( Sir Henry Gullett), that the Government has not gone either far or fast enough. I should like to see a measure brought down to extract sufficient taxes from the people, not only to satisfy our requirements of arms and armaments and the expense of the mechanization of the various units, but also to permit the Government to take into consideration the organization of greater man power than we have at the moment. Although this bill provides for arms and armaments and for the mechanization of units, in the final analysis man power w ill be the deciding factor. provided for an increase of the regular forces from 6,000 to 8.000. member has exhausted his time. Debate (on motion by Mr PO.LT.ABD) adjourned. A leavening of men who ADJOURNMENT. That the House do now adjourn. [10.53] -Recently the Arbitration Court in Melbourne dealt with the working conditions of members of the Operative among the Stonemasons Society. In the course of Greater interest the hearing, evidence was brought forward concerning the ill effects of their work. Of fourteen members of the society who had been examined by a medical man, nine were found to be suffering very badly from silicosis. Although the Arbitration Court judge was impressed by this evidence, he feared that the fourteen men might have been specially selected for the test, and said that he would ask the Government to instruct the Commonwealth Health Department to conduct a wider investigation. I shall be glad if the Minister w ill look into this for the effective aerial matter, to see if such a request has been of Australia.

In reply to an inquiry as to the conditions under which any survey arranged accepted as authentic, the Premier was informed on the 15th March, 1938, that the naval authorities considered that a survey by the Marine Board would be acceptable if carried out by a qualified surveyor.
