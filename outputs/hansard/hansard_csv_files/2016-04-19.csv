We have been called back, with no agenda and no legislation, and we are offering to provide some-to provide some legislation which will actually say that this parliament can lead where the government has failed! And the government has failed every financial consumer in this country! The government has failed every person with a bank account in this country! The government has failed every victim of a financial scandalGovernment members interjectingstep in now. We are offering for the parliament to call a royal commission, which this Prime Minister and this Treasurer have abjectly failed to do-this Treasurer, whose great achievement is to defend $120 million worth of cuts to ASIC; this Treasurer, whose great achievement is to deny 41 warnings from ASIC that they needed more resources and more powers. This is a government which completely ignores the wishes and completely ignores the needs of Australia's consumers. This is a government which completely ignores the evidenceMr Chester interjectingwhich is refusing to accept that the member for Gippsland's constituents and all the constituents of the members opposite absolutely want a royal commission into the banks. They absolutely want to see a government standing up for them. They actually want to see a government which is prepared to take a decision-not a decision to hold an advertising campaign, not a decision for spin but a decision for substance! We are prepared to provide plenty of speakers for this motion. We are prepared to provide plenty of agenda, because we have a Leader of the House who is having a rostered week offa rostered week off! We were called back for urgent business. We were called down to the other place yesterday and asked by His Excellency to deal with the registered organisations bill, which the Leader of the House has not even managed to bring in for debate! Well, thank goodness the opposition is prepared to lead the debate. Thank goodness the opposition is prepared to come in and say, 'Well, if the government doesn't have any business, we have some.'

This is a governmentand more powers than ASIC; a royal commission which would hear from victims; a royal commission which would recommend changes to whistleblowing laws; and a royal commission which could recommend changes to compensation. That is what the Australian people want their government to be doing. The government refuses, but the parliament is prepared to. Or, at least, this side of the parliament is prepared to. We are prepared to have our names recorded in a few moments time as voting for a royal commissionMr Chester: Help him out! Mr Joyce: Give us another turn! There we go-like that one! recorded as voting against a royal commission. Well, at least they are being told that is what they are going to do, even if they do not want to. I wonder how the debate went in the party room this morning about a royal commission? All those people who were lions in the party room a couple of hours ago: where are they in the parliament? Lions in the party room and mice in the parliament, not prepared to vote for a royal commission! Prepared behind closed doors to tell the Prime Minister that he is out of touch, but not prepared to stand up here for their constituents today. We are prepared to stand up for them. We are prepared to stand up for a royal commission. Where is the National Party on the issue of a royal commission? Struck dumb in the House of Representatives! Not prepared to vote for it. Well, they are welcome to vote with us to send a message to His Excellency to call the royal commission now. The royal commission could get on with it. It does not have to wait for an incoming Shorten Labor government, it can be done today. But if you fail, we will act. We will lead; we will have a royal commission because Australia needs one. Australia's banks need one and Australia's financial system needs one. Australia's financial system is not working in the best interests of every Australian consumer. It is not. This Treasurer might think it is and this Prime Minister might think it is-well, they are abjectly out of touch. They are abjectly out of touch with the views of Australia's financial consumers. This opposition knows that as we provide an alternative we will lead. We will lead with the power of our ideas and policies, and we will set the agenda in this parliament-as they have singularly failed to do. What a joke for this parliament to be called back as a matter of great urgency-for the Prime Minister to stand outside and say it was so urgent for the parliament to come back and for us to end on Tuesday with a whimper, not only in this House but in the other house as well! Going home-Qantas and Virgin must be delighted! That is the only economic activity that is coming through-flights in and out of Canberra for a phantom sitting! Well, how about a real royal commission? Not a phantom sitting of the House; a royal commission which would deal with Australia's financial system.

14,Mr Pyne (Sturt,"Leader of the House, Minister for Industry and Innovation and Science)Treasurer the opportunity to speak to the House at least one last time. I thought he was going to pop a muscle-pull a muscle or pop a hernia! He always starts too high, Mr Speaker! He always starts too high and he does not know how to come off that crescendo! He has to build to the crescendo-you cannot start with the crescendo, because then how do you build to the crescendo? The poor old shadow Treasurer had to keep that up for five minutes-bellowing at the chamber, shouting at the viewer-and not one shred of substance in the entire five minutes. Not one shred of substanceMr Joyce: At least he's a snappy dresser! Zoolander would be much calmer. And he certainly would not be wearing that tie-suit combination, I can tell you! He is a very snappy dresser, but he is not going to be a very good Treasurer because he will never get there. He makes a better shadow Treasurer. Of course, the government has a very considered agenda and a very considered plan. In December, we announced the National Innovation and Science Agenda-24 measures costing $1.1 billion, which of course the member for Isaacs regards as a joke. But I can tell you that, in the start-up industry, in the business community, amongst the millions of people in Australia who work in the innovative industries, it was regarded as a very substantial breakthrough by the government, and the government is setting about implementing the 24 measures of the National Innovation and Science Agenda. In fact, the tax breaks for angel investors in start-ups have already been introduced into the House, as has the capital gains tax discount. On the other side of the House, Labor want to increase the capital gains tax by 50 per cent. That is their policy. Now, we all know what you do when you want to discourage something: you increase the tax on it. For example, we have high taxes on tobacco because we want to discourage people from smoking. So the only possible construction you can place on the Labor Party's proposal to increase capital gains tax is that they want less investment, not more investment, in Australia. By contrast, the government, through the National Innovation and Science Agenda, want to encourage more capital investment in Australia, and that is why we are exempting certain investments in start-up businesses from any capital gains tax at all for assets held for between three and 10 years. We want to encourage investment. Labor want to close down investment through increasing taxes. But it has not been just the National Innovation and Science Agenda. Since the election of Prime Minister Turnbull, we have had an incredibly busy program of change in the country. We have democratised the Senate. We have put the power over individuals' votes back in their own hands by reforming the Senate voting system-a very significant reform to our democracy. We have introduced changes to media ownership laws in this country, an issue that was kicked into the long grass for decades, in spite of those laws being hopelessly out of date and not in the least bit prepared for a modern economy. We have reformed competition law in Australia through the effects test and the changes to section 46-a vitally important reform that supports small businesses against big businesses when they misuse their market power.",25,Motions
15,Mr Pyne,"I can tell you, Derek Zoolander would not behave like that here! DerekWe have the competition law reform, we have the media ownership law reform, we have reformed the Senate and we have the National Innovation and Science Agenda. We have had the incredible announcements around the defence industry policy statement and the defence white paper. We have committed $30 billion to new defence spending, which was reduced by the Labor Party to its lowest level since 1939 as a percentage of GDP. Mr Conroy interjectingand creating growth: these are real decisions, real announcements that are changing our economy. In a state like mine, South Australia, the defence industry is vitally important, and yesterday we announced the winner of the Pacific patrol vessel bids, which is Austal in Henderson. We have also announced that the 12 offshore patrol vessels will be built in Adelaide and then moved to Perth when the future frigates begin in 2020. Then of course there are the future frigates; we tightened up the process for that as well, by choosing the three designs from which the final frigates will be chosen. We have the submarines decision to come, but at least we have promised a commitment to 12 submarines. In all the time that Labor were in government, six years, they never awarded one contract in Australia to build any ships at all, not one. Not one ship was built for the Navy in Australia under the Labor Party. They awarded contracts-the lowest funding since 1938-for shipbuilding but none of them for here in Australia. By the time the government are finished the continuous naval shipbuilding, we will have built 21 Pacific patrol boats, 12 offshore patrol vessels and nine future frigates, and we have a commitment to provide 12 submarines to the Navy. We are making a real difference in creating jobs. In Adelaide, in Cairns, through maintenance, in Perth and right around Australia, we are fulfilling the requirements of the Rand report on future naval shipbuilding in Australia and we are defending our country as a consequence. So this government has an agenda, and it has a budget coming up on 3 May. On3 May, the Treasurer will hand down his first but by no means his last budget. It will be his first but by no means his last budget. In this budget, the government will outline its agenda for the election campaign that will come at some stage this year. The government will outline to the people how we will, through our policies, repair the budget mess that was left to us by the Labor Party.

Many people have forgotten. The Higher Education Endowment Fund, the health fund, the communications fund: Labor gave all of those things away while they were in government, in their profligate spending spree. In this budget we will see how a considered and calm government goes about doing the job that we are elected to do. We will repair the budget mess left to us by the Labor Party. We will announce reforms in areas of the tax system where it is important to have reform. We will make sure that we deliver the spending measures that are vital to a growing economy, whether it is in infrastructure, whether it is in northern Australia, whether it is in the defence industry, whether it is in health or education investments.

Mr Frydenberg: I'm going to leave you. opportunity to talk about the high farce in talking about the address-in-reply to the Governor General. As we have seen in the last 24 hours, the outcome of yesterday was, I think, to treat the Australian community with absolute contempt. We saw an absolute abuse of process by the government. They asked the Governor General firstly to prorogue the parliament and then to come to the Senate yesterday, explaining why he prorogued the parliament and the importance of that prorogation and then why he recalled the parliament. Significantly, of course, he recalled the parliament based on the same reasons that were used post the 2013 election, when the then Governor General spoke for and on behalf of the then government, led by Prime Minister Abbott. As we saw yesterday, as the Governor General repeated yesterday, he recalled the parliament to enable us to discuss two pieces of legislation: the Australian Building and Construction Commission legislation and the bill to improve the governance and transparency of registered organisations. He quoted the speech by Dame Quentin Bryce, the former Governor General, in which she said, in part: The law will be changed so that registered organisations and their officials are held to the same rules and standards as companies and their directors. So we were called back to the parliament at great cost to the Australian taxpayer for the purpose of debating two pieces of legislation-not the legislation which we did debate yesterday, to do with the trucking industry, or indeed the legislation we have just passed through the parliament, to do with the Northern Australia infrastructure fund. We were invited here yesterday, requested to be here yesterday, told we had to be here yesterday, for the reconvening of parliament to talk about those two pieces of legislation I spoke about earlier. Not only did we in this chamber not address those pieces of legislation but the piece of legislation dealing with registered organisations was not even debated in the Senate. Yet we are told now that the business of the government is over, that we can all go home. Never mind the fact that we have flown from all over the country representing our constituents, doing the bidding of this government. Fancy proroguing the parliament on Friday and bringing us back here on Monday, talking about two pieces of legislation which we will not even discuss! It makes a mockery of the process. It is an absolute abuse of the process, and the Prime Minister should be ashamed of himself. He is a person who came into this place, into this job, as someone who purported to represent the greater interests of the Australian community. He was not going to be following the course of his predecessor, Mr Abbott. But in fact he used as the basis of his prorogation of the parliament and bringing us back here two pieces of legislation from the Abbott government. And we know that this is the case across a whole range of policy areas. The government is just readopting the policies of the former Abbott government.",37,Governor General S Speech

But it does give me anThe Prime Minister, who came into this place with the hope of the world on his shoulders, has diminished himself substantially by his actions over the last week and, as a result, has diminished the parliament. We should not be here as political playthings of the governmentany government-yet that is precisely what we have seen here in the last 36 hours. What will the Prime Minister say to the Australian community now, having brought us here for the purpose that the Governor General said in his speech yesterday, when they say to him: 'Why didn't you even debate that legislation? What was so important about getting rid of the tribunal yesterday?' Of course, the Prime Minister only found out about the tribunal a fortnight ago. Before that the word 'truckie' had never passed his lips. Yet yesterday we had a piece of legislation abolishing the Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal, along with other legislation to defer its orders. Having done that, he has put nothing in its stead-another thought bubble without thinking about the consequences of his actions. This exercise in bringing the parliament back for dodgy reasons will be seen as dodgy by the Australian population, and the community will mark the Prime Minister and his government down-as they should, because this is an absolute abuse of process. Then he tells us, of course, that we now have a 74-day election campaign. I am looking forward to the opportunity post the next election, when we come to debate the address-in reply to the Governor General's speech, to talk about the things that happened during the campaign. We will be able to talk about the government policies that have been put up for us to debate today and what they mean for the Australian community. We will be able to tell people what we said to the Australian community about education, for example. We will be able to say-and I will be saying this, most assuredly-that we have a government here in Canberra, under Mr Turnbull, that has taken the decision, and believes it is okay, for the Commonwealth government not to fund government schools. We know that in many parts of Australia schools are already in crisis. That the federal government would walk away from funding public education demonstrates to the Australian community how aloof, detached and out of contact the Prime Minister really is. He cannot comprehend the fact that the Australian community would see it as treacherous by any government not to fund government schools. We know that the policies that exist currently have already meant a great loss in support for government schools. I refer to an article in the NT News on Saturday, 18 April 2016, which says: The Northern Territory public education system will lose the equivalent of 200 teachers and $309 million under a new federal funding arrangement to come into effect in 2017/18. The poorest constituency in terms of educational outcomes in this country is mine. There is one private school and there are a number of Catholic schools, but there is no private education system to speak of. The community relies on public education and public funding of education. We have heard the Prime Minister, in the policies they have already announced, tell the people of the Northern Territory that the government are going to take $300 million out of the public education system for the people of the Northern Territory, which will mean the loss of up to 200 teachers. Mr Deputy Speaker Goodenough, think about the context in which we are having this discussion. Around 40 per cent of the population of my electorate are Aboriginal people living in remote communities. They have the poorest educational outcomes in the country. They require a massive investment if we are ever to allow them to reach the standards that we want them to meet. We need additional teacher resources-specialist resources. We need to address issues like fetal alcohol syndrome and what it means in the classroom, as well as the broad range of other issues that confront young people, many of whom suffer from trauma. This federal government says: 'We are prepared to walk away from that. We do not want to fund public education. That is your job, states and territories. What is more, we are saying to you that we would like you to raise your own taxes to pay for those services.' Let me make this very clear: about 80 per cent of revenue for the Northern Territory's budget comes from the Commonwealth. Can you imagine what would happen if the Northern Territory government were required to raise enough revenue from personal income tax in the Northern Territory to pay for services such as education, whether or not it was in remote communities, or health, whether it was in remote communities or in the towns and cities? There is not the population base, let alone the income base, to raise sufficient taxes for those purposes. We would be massively disadvantaged. This is another idea that the Prime Minister is taking to this election; yet 48 hours after he made the initial announcement, this great change in the Federation, at the Penrith leagues club it was dismissed, as you would expect, by the state premiers-apart from the Western Australian Premier; God knows what he was eating that morning! Let's be very clear: the people I represent understand what this would mean to them. It would mean a massive erosion of services. It would mean that people who currently get access to educational facilities would not. It would mean clinics potentially closing because they would not have the revenue base to pay for their services. Yet this is seriously what this government thinks. I spoke at the beginning about the Prime Minister being out of touch. What better evidence is there of how out of touch he is with what real Australia thinks and needs than those two absurd proposals: that the Commonwealth should walk away from public education and that states should raise their own income tax? Not only will the states raise their own income tax but it will also be a massive example of double taxation. It might be all right in the leafy suburbs surrounding Sydney Harbour to make these sorts of silly statements, but it is absolutely absurd to believe that that sort of proposition is going to have any legs or any support anywhere in the real Australia. It certainly won't in the bush. We say to Prime Minister: you think carefully about what you say. What we know now is that what is on the public record will haunt you throughout this 74-day election campaign, and I will make sure that I prosecute this argument across the length and breadth of my electorate, letting every person know the intentions of this government in relation to education and health. We will talk about other matters as well as education and health. We know, you know, Mr Deputy Speaker Goodenough, and the whole community knows that if we want to improve the life outcomes of all Australians, we have to guarantee them access to a worldclass healthcare system and a great education system. A child born today needs to be given an absolute assurance that the state will provide for them in education and health. But this is not what this government are saying; quite the opposite in fact. They are saying they are prepared to walk away. We are not prepared to walk away, and, as the Leader of the Opposition has said many times, as has our relevant shadow spokesman, our policies are out there. It is very clear where we are heading. We have good education policies, great health policies, and they are things that we know most of the Australian population will support. There are other particular issues that I will prosecute in this election. One of them is the Indigenous Advancement Strategy. As a result of a stupid decision by the former Abbott government to place Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs policy and the administration of services within the Prime Minister's department, they put out this Indigenous Advancement Strategy, which was a bid based process for funding. Not surprisingly, a large number of the people who made applications for funding, who hitherto were funded by the Commonwealth government, lost their funding. Organisations closed; organisations delivering vital services to Aboriginal communities throughout my electorate were forced to think, 'How the hell are we going to pay for our services?' People are not silly. They understand what has gone on here, and they understand that the decisions taken by the government came largely at the hands of the minister, Senator Scullion. The decisions taken to fund or not fund organisations, he admits, almost were his alone. That is something that we cannot accept, and we should not accept, and I know the community of the Northern Territory do not accept. I say to the Commonwealth government: if you are really deadly serious about effecting change in this community, you will not head down this course. Instead, you will do something reasonable and push the policy areas back into their relevant agencies: the health matters that are now administered from the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet should be pushed back immediately to the Department of Health, and education issues should go back to the education department. That is what needs to happen. The other area I am going to be very concerned about during this 74-day election campaign is talking about jobs and development. We just had pass through here in a matter of some minutes-although, as we have said, there were some moments of high farce involved-a piece of legislation to do with northern Australia. Let me make it very clear: there are job issues in the north of Australia, and there is a need for massive investment in roads and other infrastructure. There is a need for massive investment in housing. What we need to do is assure the Australian community, but particularly those people who live in northern Australia-people actually invest in what works. We will not create these pie-in-the-sky ideas about dams all over the north of Australia, because they will not happen. What we should do is accept the reality that people are doing damn good work at the moment and producing solid outcomes, and we should build on that work. I will give you one example. The Ord River currently produces around $50 million or $60 million worth of agricultural product each year. It is not commonly understood that around the Northern Territory we have producers-mostly in the Top End, from Katherine heading up north, but also there are some products produced around Alice Springs, Ti Tree and AliCurung-currently producing $200 million worth of agricultural product. What we should be doing is building on those successes, learning from what has been happening with those particular investors-people who have taken a risk with minimal government support and who are doing a great deal of good work for the Australian community in providing product and providing education. But we have to be rational about what we do. We have a current issue to do with temporary workers coming into the horticulture industry in particular. The rules that currently apply just do not make sense; they are not logical. We need to do a great deal more about effecting change in that area. I want to support the views being expressed by the horticulture industry in the Northern Territory, particularly those people in the mango-growing industry. They only require labour for about six months of the year but if they cannot get a reliable labour source then their product will rot and they will lose massive amounts of money. So it is very important, when we are talking about developing northern Australia, that we understand the implication of decisions taken on areas such as that. I could also talk about a range of other areas, like the pastoral industry and the massive amount of work they are currently doing, the live cattle exporting trade, the tourism industry, and the growing aquaculture industry in the north of Australia that we need to continue to support. But we will not be able to do this with a government that acts so irrationally. As I said at the outset, there have been moments of high farce here in the past 36 hours, and responding, as I am, to the Governor General's speech, it makes you wonder what he is thinking, sitting over there in Yarralumla. He came into the parliament yesterday and gave a speech, partly repeating a speech given by his predecessor, that talked about two items that needed to be addressed in this parliament. One of them was passed through the Senate yesterday, the other was not. It did not even make a debate in this chamber. It just dropped off the Notice Paper. And we are back here today with nothing to do, so we have this masquerade of a debate in the Governor General's address-in-reply. Australians are not fools and they understand when a stunt is being pulled. They will understand absolutely what this Prime Minister is up to. He will be marked down, and I am looking forward very much to this 74day election campaign so that on every street corner I can tell every person I see about the way they have been treated with such contempt by this Prime Minister and this government. Dr GILLESPIE (Lyne) (13:22): I would like to thank the Governor General in recalling us for the second session of the 44th Parliament, because it has been very worthwhile. We had the RSRT-the Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal-legislation to repeal, and that has now been achieved. That in itself has been worth the trip back to Canberra. As the member for Lingiari alleged, I would like to refute that it was not anything dodgy; it was diabolical. What tribunal has the right to incarcerate someone for six months if they do not turn up to a hearing? What tribunal has the right to fine someone who does an uncommercial enforced haulage rate that sends him out of business, or has the right to charge them $58,000 in fines? It has now been abolished, and that is such a good outcome. Two hundred-plus trucks came to Canberra with the mum-and-dad operators for a reason. There were many more that came through Canberra over the last couple of days-they honked their horns several times as I was walking to work this morning. But it was diabolical. It was sending mum-and-dad small business people to the wall. Contracts from their prime contractors had been drying up in the preceding months, and bank credit was drying up as well. Fake hearings were being held by the tribunal where people were given 18 hours notice to turn up and threatened with six months jail if they did not come and give a deposition, only to be harangued in the gallery by a bunch of aggressive union members. So that is a good outcome but, now that the ABCC legislation has been rejected yet again, it demonstrates how much the other side is dependent upon and does the bidding of their union masters. In one of my last opportunities before the budget, which is what we are really focusing on now, I would like to point out that we are back to getting a budget together to direct the economic fortunes of Australia. That is what this government is focusing on and that is what the Treasurer, the finance minister and the Assistant Treasurer, along with PM&C and all of the ministry, are focusing on. Before we go on to question time, I would like to highlight how the Australian government achieves value for money in their procurement processes. The Australian government regularly procures about $40 billion worth of goods and services in any one financial year, but with the biggest infrastructure budget that has ever been rolled out being rolled out in this term of government it is even more important. With our Defence contracts just being let for shipbuilding for the next five to 10 years for a continuous ship build and beyond and with the upcoming submarine contracts, the concept of getting value for money, as well as quality products, for the Australian taxpayer is paramount. Any time there is a $40 billion spend happening those contracts have massive effects on whatever market they are applying in, but every year the federal government spends about $40 billion-and that is not counting state and local government procurement contracts. I want to point out a critical thing: when the government is doing business with business it is quite a different situation from when a business is doing business with another business, because the government gets a refund when they purchase services from Australian companies. It is like the Coke bottle with no refund and the Pepsi bottle with a $10 refund-if the one with the refund costs you three or four cents more but you get a 10c refund, what are you going to call the better deal? The one with the refund. Long-term government contracts put a floor under a lot of industries. We cannot let them get a contract by any means just because they are Australian but, when one purchases a product from an Australian manufacturer and you are the Australian government purchasing it, there is a knock-on benefit downstream. Too many of the decisions are made in a silo by departments that are not connected to the Treasury or not connected to Finance or to Social Services, which has to supply unemployment benefits, or to Industry to do retraining programs. What is entirely sensible in business when your business does not run the Treasury or does not have the responsibility for unemployment or for retraining schemes or incentives to build up new industries, is that it is a different mathematical equation. When a federal, state or local government purchases goods from a genuine domestic based producer, treasuries in state and federal departments will receive a rebate down the track of up to 40c in the dollar. First up they get PAYE tax, then they get Medicare levies, they get company tax and they get GST payments. As well, all the local suppliers do that all over again on a different level-that is, the so-called local economic multiplier. Local governments benefit from Australian producers running their businesses in their local government areas, and there are many knock-on employers. As I mentioned, the Department of Social Services misses out on having to pay unemployment benefits when the government contracts with an Australian producer. order 43. The debate may be resumed at a later hour. Northern Australia Ms MacTIERNAN (Perth) (13:30): We recently passed through this House, unexpectedly, the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility Bill 2016. It is an important piece of legislation that many of us would have liked to have had the opportunity to talk about. It is very important that we have this $5 billion concessional loan for infrastructure projects in the",38,Governor General S Speech
56,The Deputy Speaker,"Order! The debate is interrupted in accordance with standingnorth if we are to drive northern development forward, but I need to alert the House to the unfairness inherent in this bill to Western Australia. The definition of 'northern Australia' is given generally as above the Tropic of Capricorn, but it includes in Queensland Gladstone and in the Northern Territory all of the area between the Tropic of Capricorn and the 26th parallel. No deviations are provided for in Western Australia, the most remote part. Oddly, reference is made in the definition to Newman and Exmouth, but both of these are in fact above the Tropic of Capricorn. In my view this is just a device to make it look like some exceptions have been made for Western Australia when the opposite is the case. I really urge this House, this parliament and the government to consider amending this so we also have the 26th parallel, which has historically been the boundary for the north in Western Australia. This way it would allow Carnarvon and Shark Bay(Time expired) ANZAC Day commemorate the Centenary of the Western Front. Between March 1916 and November 1918 more than 295,000 Australians served in World War I, 132,000 of our service men and women were wounded or fell ill and 46,000 lost their lives. This year my local remembrance of ANZAC Day is focused on Tasmania's Alfred Gaby, who was born near Ringarooma and educated at Scottsdale. Alfred enlisted as a private soldier in January 1916 and joined the 26th Battalion on the Western Front in August 1916. Within a year he had been promoted to lieutenant. In August 1918 Lieutenant Gaby was involved in the Battle of Amiens, winning a Victoria Cross, the highest military decoration for valour in the face of the enemy. Three days after that heroic deed Lieutenant Gaby was killed by an enemy sniper. He was one of the 15,485 Tasmanians who served in the Great War. As the husband of a career nurse I also wanted our remembrance of ANZAC Day to focus on the contribution of our nurses on the Western Front. Tasmanian nurses worked in casualty clearing stations, makeshift hospitals and on ships and trains, seeing first hand the horrors of war and providing expert nursing care. On ANZAC Day 2016 I will honour the bravery of Lieutenant Alfred Gaby VC and our Australian nurses for their sacrifice on the Western Front. Turnbull Government Ms RYAN (Lalor-Opposition Whip) (13:33): I rise on this bright sunny Tuesday to ask questions of the House about where we have found ourselves. Three weeks ago the Prime Minister told us that he was calling us back for three weeks and yet the planes will be leaving this afternoon filled with members of this House heading home. We have been here for two days at great expense to the taxpayer-two days to do absolutely the minimum. People in this House are not afraid of hard work, but we were dragged up here for two days to do very little work. What we have had is absolute chaos from this government from start to finish. We are still waiting for good government to start. The member for Warringah is here. I do not think we have had any governance since he was deposed as Prime Minister. All we have had is chaos.

They are trying to divide our communities between public and private education. It will fail because the community knows that needs based education is sector blind and will apply to all schools. I say to those opposite: let us bring on this election. Let us get out there. There are 74 days. Nine times the PM has said 2 July. Will he say it in this House today? Rocher, Mr Allan Charles for Western Australia and then member for Curtin from 1978 until 1998. He was the first friend that I made in this parliament. He was a friend to many from those days in this place. I especially remember two pieces of wisdom from Allan: first, his advice that it would take at least five years to become a competent parliamentarian, and with hindsight I think that was an underestimate; and, second, his observation of a colleague that he often told lies when it was not strictly necessary to tell lies. That was a shrewd encapsulation of some of the conflicts which members of parliament face. There are three other things about Allan Rocher. First, you could not have a more loyal friend, as John Winston Howard knew well. Second, you could not meet a more genial man, as those who dropped by his nightly office drinks would well remember. Third, he hated factions because he thought that people and issues should be judged on their merits and not on the numbers. Allan Rocher was never ambitious for himself. He was always ambitious for our party and for our country. He was an adornment to this parliament and that is why we should cherish his memory and remember him on this day.

We heard eight coalition members of parliament, including the members for Dawson and Leichhardt, speaking in support of the Labor opposition-soon to be government-proposal to have a royal commission into the banking sector. You can only imagine the Prime Minister's infamous impatience with his colleagues growing by the moment as he muttered slowly to himself, 'Serenity now! Serenity now!'

Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal Mr O'DOWD (Flynn) (13:38): I must have been in a different party room! After yesterday's successful passing of the Road Safety Remuneration Repeal Bill 2016 I have been inundated with support and thanks. The response is heartening and just goes to show how passionate the truckies of Flynn are about their ability to provide for their families and to the nation's call. Heath Nowland of Gracemere wrote to me and said: I would just like to take the time to thank you for the support and effort you and your colleagues afforded the transport industry in getting rid of the RSRT. It does not go unnoticed and it is widely appreciated amongst us small transport operators. I was fortunate enough to have a woman from my electorate, Julie Just, here in Canberra yesterday. I saw her late last night after she left the House after a marathon day walking between the Senate and this House. She was understandably very emotional and thanked me very much for the job we had all done for her and her industry. This emotion just shows how much was on the line for these people. That was evident from the people down at the rally on the grass outside the front of Parliament House. These hard working people, representing 35,000 owner-drivers, can now go back to their place of work and do the very best they can for themselves and for the country. Steel Industry government will have a plan for the steel industry. It is the only party in this place that will have one. It is a tough plan-a plan that has faith in the future of this industry. We will crack down on dumping with anti-dumping legislation to ensure the countries around the world who are producing subsidised steel in excess of needs are not dumping it into our markets and destroying our local jobs and industries. We will be putting in place tough standards to ensure that government projects are complying with Australian standards. We will be ensuring that there are industry participation plans so that when we have large jobs-whether they are government funded, defence contracts or other jobs-we will ensure that local contractors get a crack at winning that business. We will also ensure that there is a steel industry advocate which will be out there advocating for the interests of the industry. I was very pleased to be there when the Leader of the Opposition announced this new steel industry policy at BlueScope's Port Kembla plant. It was a signal that Labor has faith in the future of the company and in the future of the industry. It did not pass anybody's attention that the Minister for Industry, Innovation and Science and the Prime Minister have not yet visited Illawarra and the Port Kembla BlueScope plant, despite all the troubles and all of the issues that are going on within the industry.

The initial funding has so far seen initial planning work take place including traffic studies, geotechnical studies and bridge inspections. They all have to be done to keep the project moving forward. The RMS has determined that the new bridge should be built immediately west of the existing bridges. NowI am calling upon the people of Gilmore for a groundswell of public support to see this major piece of vital infrastructure funded in the near future. Last week I launched a petition to give Gilmore residents the chance to show their support for the new Nowra Bridge. It is encouraging to see the number of people who have already signed the petition and expressed just how critical the new bridge will be to the development, expansion and vitality of our region. When the Prime Minister visited the electorate last month I showed him the existing bridge so he could see the necessity of this infrastructure. For more than two years I have continued to lobby and advocate for our new bridge. I will knock on doors in the electorate and lobby ministers while in Canberra. Together we can show how important this new bridge will be for our local region and the South Coast economy overall. The bridge is an essential piece of infrastructure to improve business productivity, unlock tourism potential and increase residential amenity. Defence Procurement and the Minister for Defence decide that it would be an exciting time to announce one of Australia's strategically vital shipbuilding contracts. Amongst the many marvels of yesterday is the fact that we were here as a prorogued parliament, brought back so that we could sit here at centre stage in the spotlight to debate the ABCC legislation-legislation the Prime Minister told us was worthy of a double dissolution election and legislation the Prime Minister told us should fix the attention of our nation. Here we were, in the middle of day 1 of this, and the government and the Prime Minister himself changed the topic. They changed the topic, and so suddenly we found ourselves talking about shipbuilding. This bizarre timing by the Prime Minister and his defence minister to make such an announcement was nothing more than panic driven and cynical politics in an attempt to shore up South Australian Liberal seats for the upcoming election. Sadly, we have seen Liberal Party politics poison our shipbuilding contracts again and again. It was of course the politics of a captain's call that originally sent the Liberal Party promise to build the submarines in Adelaide to the depths. Instead, we had a captain's call to go to Japan. Then, in the midst of the collapsing leadership of Prime Minister Abbott, we saw that turned into a competitive evaluation process.

I look forward to catching up at a game very soon. Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal Christina, who came from Canberra to Adelaide to tell their story about the road death of their brother, John. In 2010, 42-year-old John Posnakidis, a dad to three children, was killed by a semitrailer whilst he was waiting at a bus shelter. John was himself a truck driver; his truck had broken down and he was waiting for assistance. The driver of the truck that killed John was hauling 37 tonnes of steel from Ballarat to Adelaide, and reportedly had had only five hours of sleep in the previous 27 hours of work. The coroner described the driver's work schedule as 'tiring if not gruelling' with the insufficient rest being attributed to the need to meet a delivery deadline. John Posnakidis died because of a serious problem within the trucking industry, including the number of road deaths, suicides and bankruptcies that have been known about for years and which cannot continue to be ignored. Yet the Turnbull government, rather than considering the evidence and the facts relating to this very serious road safety matter, rather than sitting down with all the affected parties to seek a way forward and rather than addressing the central issue of road safety for all road users, instead moved to abolish the Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal. This was a knee-jerk response to an issue of national importance by a chaotic government led by a desperate Prime Minister who has no plan, no idea and no commitment to anything but his own future. South Australia: Steel Industry the government is very interested in their plight and that I believe the steel industry has a good future. The appointment of KordaMentha in the place of Grant Thornton as administrator is a good move from the point of view that they have already expressed confidence in the future-that they will run that plant as normal for the next six months and that the suppliers' bills will be met. Let me say that the government has been busy in this space. There has been an enormous amount of work done on anti-dumping and, despite the member for Throsby's comments of a few minutes ago, the Prime Minister has been to Whyalla, and he brought the best thing of all: more work for the Whyalla steelworks. After all, these steelworks have a very high overhead component. It is very much like running a motel at half-throttle-you lose money in that case.",47,Statements By Members

We are making a difference and I have great confidence that this industry will survive long into the future, because it is too important to Whyalla, to South Australia and to the nation to allow us to let it fall over. Turnbull Government Dr LEIGH (Fraser) (13:48): When the member for Wentworth toppled the member for Warringah we were told that it would be just like John Lennon's Starting Over, but since then we have had more repetitions than a Status Quo song! We started this parliamentary term with this government giving a billion-dollar tax break to multinationals and we are ending the term with them opposing Labor's sensible multinational tax measures: closing debt deduction loopholes, ramping up penalties on multinationals and giving the tax office the resources it needs to get tough on tax avoiders. We started the term with this government trying to scrap Labor's future of financial advice protections and we have ended this term with the government colluding with the big banks to stop a royal commission into the banks to protect people like Jenny, who Bill Shorten and I met with last week. She told us about the impact on her of nearly losing her home, thanks to shonky dealing. We started the term with this government doubling the deficit and we are ending the term with the deficit for this year being more than sextupled, more than six times larger than predicted when the government came to office, and with the credit agencies warning us that our AAA credit rating-three AAA ratings attained under Labor-might now be at risk. We started the term with the government lying about the pre-election fiscal and economic outlook and we ended up with them lying over tax which, as a share of GDP, is increasing. We were promised a government of 'Control+Alt+Delete'; we got a government of 'Control+C'.

The Red Cross is a tremendous organisation that helps tens of millions of people around the world. With millions of volunteers worldwide, their support helps reach people and places no-one else can.

Turnbull Government of this government are already being written. Will they be called Dysfunctional? Will they be called Chaotic? Because the one thing this government cannot decide is its agenda from one day to the next. I was all ready to debate the registered orgs bill again. I have to say I am getting pretty good at that bill because it has been before the House a few times. In fact, yesterday, when we walked over to the other place for the joint sitting, it was even in the Governor General's address-the registered orgs regulations. Yet today we see that legislation is gone. Yesterday it was on the agenda; today it is gone. What is with this government? They cannot even make up their mind from one day to the next. As was said on Lateline the other week, between lunchtime and Lateline this government changes its agenda, whether it be on workplace relations, the economy, tax policy or education-name an issue. All this government cares about is the theatre of politics. They are not interested in governing. They are not interested in standing up for working people. They are not interested in supporting Australian families. They are interested in the theatre of government, the theatre of politics, and that is all today is: 90-second statements, question time and a matter of public importance. This government is only interested in the theatre of politics, not government. Autism Ms SCOTT (Lindsay) (13:53): Nearly two weeks ago, I did a walk of nearly 100 kilometres right around the electorate of Lindsay to raise awareness of, and funds for, autism. Many children are born every year with autism, and it is a developmental condition that will stay with them their entire lives. I am very proud that the Nepean Blue Mountains region has been part of the early rollout of the NDIS. This will bring much hope to so many local families. During my walk, I visited many local schools and I would like to thank the schools and the principals of McCarthy Catholic College, Nepean high, Emu Plains Public School, Adventure Preschool, Glenmore Park High School, Caroline Chisholm College, Surveyors Creek Public School, Penrith Christian School, Our Lady of the Rosary Primary School at St Marys, Wollemi College, and Kurrambee School, of course, as well as St Marys leagues club. We followed that up with the walk for autism around Jamison Park, where many hundreds of local people came to support autism. All the funds raised from the walk for autism, as well as my walk, will go towards the Luke Priddis Foundation, a wonderful local organisation that supports so many families of children with autism. Their dream, which is becoming a reality, is to build a centre for autism in High Street, Penrith. It will have two sensory spaces, offices, a consultation room, a parents retreat, a lounge area and a kitchenette. We have already committed $20,000 to this facility as well.",49,Statements By Members

Workplace Relations bit harsh on the government, about it being seen as chaotic! Sure, there is chaos; sure, there is division and dysfunction. It is the parliamentary equivalent of Game of Thrones. But, when it comes to cutting penalty rates for low-paid workers, this government shows a unity of purpose. When the member for Reid was asked about cutting penalty rates, he said: … I'm not averse to that at all … When the member for Herbert was asked about this, he asked why someone who works on Sunday is worth twice as much as someone who does exactly the same job Monday to Friday. The member for Leichhardt simply said: From a personal view, I certainly support change in weekend penalty rates … The novice Liberal candidate for Brisbane, Trevor Evans, when asked whether he supported the Productivity Commission's recommendations to cut Sunday penalty rates, said, 'Broadly speaking, we do agree.' But the Liberal candidate who takes the cake, who wins the prize, is the Liberal candidate for Dunkley, the blow-in from Mildura, who basically said he supports any cut to penalty rates and there should be no penalty rates for any worker unless they work more than five days a week. That candidate wants to cut penalty rates for any worker in any industry. He wants to put his hand in the pockets of low-paid workers and steal their income because he does not believe in penalty rates-and neither does this government. Cowan Electorate: Kiara College parliament to speak about the great work of Kiara College and its leader, Principal Anne Robinson. As the local member I am delighted that Kiara College is now in the electorate of Cowan, and this is the first time that Kiara College has been spoken of in the House. I have on several occasions been able to appreciate what the college is doing, and it was good to have the opportunity to take Minister Scott Ryan to Kiara College so that he too could see the work they are doing in VET but also have a look at the Kiara College Farm. The farm is a great asset, and I support their efforts to maintain and expand the opportunities it provides. Beyond the curriculum and the great opportunities the school provides local students, I also would like to thank Anne Robinson and her staff for providing me with basketball umpires for my 9th annual schools basketball challenge.

Over the last four months, the Liberals have been chainsawing down centuries-old fig trees that line Alison Road in Randwick and ANZAC Parade at Moore Park, adjacent to the SCG, to build a light rail line. This is needless environmental destruction. We can have light rail and preserve these historic trees that are part of Sydney's heritage and character. In 1914, when troops marched from Kensington Racecourse to Circular Quay, they walked past these trees, and in 1917 Randwick Road was renamed ANZAC Parade in their honour. The people of Sydney are justifiably outraged by the destruction of these trees in parkland bequeathed to the people two centuries ago by Lachlan Macquarie. One thousand six hundred people in our community have signed an open letter to you, Prime Minister, calling on you to intervene and stop the destruction of Sydney's historic trees. In 2010, you described these trees and this parkland as the 'great green lungs of our city'. It is time for you to put your money where your mouth is. On behalf of the people of Sydney, I ask: will you call on Mike Baird to halt this destruction? We can have the light rail project and preserve Sydney's historic trees, and I call on you to do something about it. Defence Procurement Dr SOUTHCOTT (Boothby) (13:58): Yesterday the Prime Minister and the Minister for Defence announced the build location for the offshore patrol vessels and the up to 21 Pacific patrol boats, in addition to the nine future frigates already announced. This announcement has been very well received in South Australia-by the Premier, Jay Weatherill; by Chris Burns at Defence Teaming Centre; and by the Adelaide Advertiser. The three projects represent a $40 billion investment in our naval shipbuilding industry and secure 2½ thousand jobs into the future. In the defence white paper, the government made a commitment to a continuous build of naval surface ships which were central to the government's naval shipbuilding plan. The announcement yesterday provides two shipyards to implement our commitment. The major warships will be built in Osborne, in Adelaide, and the minor vessels in Western Australia. What the government has had to deal with is the sad fact that Labor, in six years of government, never signed one contract for one naval vessel-not one. They talked a big game, they talked a very big game, but never delivered, like a lot of other things Labor talk about doing. The Turnbull government are delivering. We are now delivering on offshore patrol vessels and future frigates, and I look forward to further announcements to come. has concluded. Aldred, Mr Kenneth James Aldred died last weekend.

Why is it that, after weeks of telling the Australian people the exact date of the election, now that it is time for a decision the Prime Minister is completely paralysed? pathetic attempt today to misrepresent what I have said just underlines his lack of any character or commitment to jobs in Australia. Last night the Senate abolished the Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal. What that did was restore tens of thousands of Australians to their employment. It put owner-drivers back on the road. It put people back into their jobs. The Labor Party talk about jobs, but every policy of theirs is calculated to destroy jobs. And it is not just prospective. We saw thousands of owner-drivers out of work. We saw grown men weeping. We saw them with their wives and their children and their idle trucks, put out of work at the behest of the Labor Party, at the behest of the Leader of the Opposition, all for the benefit of the Transport Workers Union.

It is the enterprise, the determination and the courage of those small business men and women, who are having a go every day. We stand up for them. Every policy the Labor Party propose in this coming election will be a job-destroying policy. They are going to discourage investment by putting up capital gains tax by 50 per cent. If you want less of something, increase the tax on it. Labour clearly wants less investment. They do not want people to borrow moneyMr Champion interjectingmoney and buy a rig, or buy some property. No, they are going to ban negative gearing.

109,Mr Morrison (Cook,"Treasurer) (14:20): I thank the Prime Minister for thethe economic statement released in 2013 before the last election the Labor government announced an increase in the efficiency dividend for ASIC from 1.25 per cent to 2.5 per cent. That was a $38.2 million reduction in funding over the four years that was announced by the member opposite. I also remember that it was those opposite who opposed the implementation of a financial system inquiry. When we were in opposition the shadow Treasurer at the time tabled terms of reference for that inquiry which I tabled in this place yesterday. Those opposite were saying yesterday that you cannot work up terms of reference in opposition; you have to wait until you get into government. When we put forward a financial systems inquiry proposal, we tabled terms of reference-something those opposite refuse to do in their proposal for a commission on this area which has no definition. They just keep saying, 'We need a royal commission into banks.' It is always the same phrase. They think that is a policy. It is crass populism, as the member for Lilley reminded us all yesterday. I note the member for Lilley is not here today, but he referred to that type of politics as 'crass populism'. The Leader of the Opposition should reflect on that. It was the financial systems inquiry that we put in place that made the following recommendations that have been adopted by the government: product intervention powers to enable ASIC to modify or ban harmful financial products; the power to ban individuals from managing a financial service business; the power to approve changes of licensee control; the power to consider a broader range of factors in determining whether an applicant satisfies the fit-and-proper-purpose test to be granted a licence; the power to place conditions on firms to address concerns about internal systems relating to serious system misconduct; and powers to increase penalties for those who offend in all of these areas and more. We have a proposal from those opposite that does not address the concerns of Australians. It is a proposal to delay any consideration of their concerns for years. The only interest that their proposal is seeking to protect is that of the Leader of the Opposition. That is the only interest it is seeking to preserve. They are saying that they would rather invest $50 million in a process that would make them wait years and years and years. I note what the former governor of the Reserve Bank and former Treasury secretary Bernie Fraser said. He said, 'I think there are real problems, but I wouldn't myself be rushing into a royal commission at this stage, mainly because I think the basic problems are pretty clear, but more importantly, because it would take so long for a royal commission to get the point of recommending.' What they have is hot air. the gallery this afternoon the former member for Capricornia, Kirsten Livermore. On behalf of the House, I extend a warm welcome to you as well.

I know the Deputy Prime Minister was there recently himself. The honourable member will obviously know very well that the Northern Australia Infrastructure Fund legislation passed through all stages of this House today. That legislation is on its way to the Senate, where we expect it to receive the same level of support and become law, so that it will be operative by 1 July. The honourable member is inspired by the prospects in Northern Australia, particularly in water, and so are we. I would ask the minister for water resources to elaborate on the great opportunities to tap into that huge water resource in Northern Australia. Water Resources) (14:25): I also thank the honourable member for his question. It gives me great pleasure to talk about how we are currently already under investigation with Nullinga DamStage3 underway, making sure that we get Darwin water supplies underway. Those are not the only dams that we will be looking at; there are so many dams that are coming in. I know Urannah Dam is vitally important. We have Rookwood, we have Eden Bann and we have Nathan Dam. They are all incredibly important in Central Queensland. It is not just in Central Queensland; we are looking at other dams like Mole River, the Dungowan extension, right over to Wellington in Western AustraliaMr Nikolic: And Tassie! going on there. In the next couple of weeks, we will finish Chaffey Dam at Tamworth. We will finish Chaffey Dam. We started it in our term of government and we will finish it in our term of government. That is what happens when you have a coalition government that goes from merely dreaming about things to actually delivering on things. We are proud of the $5 billion that we are going to be spending to make sure that we drive that agenda forward for North Queensland, drive it forward for the Northern Territory and drive it forward for the north of Western Australia. These are the things that we do on our side of the fence, because we never heard of Northern Australia under the Labor Party, the Greens and the Independents. It was virtually invisible under them. It took a coalition government to actually stand up and deliver for the north of Australia. That is why we put $100 million on the table-to start sealing your beef roads. As you know, member for Kennedy, we are doing that. In Roads to Recovery, we have further extensions there. These are the sorts of things that give Australia a sense of vision. These are the sorts of things that make the Australian people know that if they want to have a government that knows what it is doing, has a vision for the future and has a vision for Northern Australia, then it resides with the National Party and the Liberal Party.",59,Questions Without Notice

Will the Treasurer advise the House of the importance of a stronger budget at this delicate time for our transitioning economy? Is the Treasurer aware of any alternative approaches that would discourage innovation, investment and growth? question. She is right-this is a very critical time for our economy as we continue on this successful transition from the mining construction boom to a more diversified economy where all of our sectors can move forward. We say that at the same time as recognising that in many parts of the country that transition is being felt with more difficulty than in othersparticularly with the member for Herbert, most recently, and the members for Dawson and other places in North Queensland, we understand that transition is hard felt. But as we look across the economy, we are making way in what is a very tough economy. Our economy is growing overall-some three per cent last year. Jobs are growing-some 440,000 since the last election and, most importantly, more than 50,000 jobs for young people in the last 18 months, seeing that youth unemployment rate fall down below the rate it was at the last election. This budget that will come down on 3 May this year will be that economic plan that sets us up, that meets the challenges that we face as we continue to manage this very successful transition. We will do that by clearing the way for jobs and growth in a stronger and new economy. We will do that by supporting investment, by supporting innovation, by supporting the infrastructure and the procurement practices that drive jobs and growth, particularly in our shipbuilding industry where those important announcements have been made already this week. We will do it through better targeting of our tax system to make sure that it is sustainable to meet the challenges ahead, to ensure that it is fairer and to ensure that it is doing its job and that we do not put the $100 billion tax burden-which those opposite would propose to do-on our economy over the next 10 years. We will ensure that the government continues to live within its means because we know householders are doing it, we know businesses are doing it, and we know the government has to do it. But there are alternative approaches. The Leader of the Opposition today gave what you would call-what he thought was-his election starting address. I am happy to table it for the House. In his election address, not once is there a reference to the economy or budget-not once, not one reference to the economy or budget. That is not surprising, because they would have to then explain why they want to put a $100 billion tax burden on the Australian economy over the next 10 years and why they want to put a tax on investment in this country, a 50 per cent increase in capital gains tax, and abolish negative gearing, which would mean a hit to mum-and-dad investors, to police officers, to nurses. I note that the Leader of the Opposition has not been saying much about negative gearing for a while. Maybe he knows, maybe he has worked out, that the shadow Treasurer has led him down a very, very bad path. (Time expired) Banking Prime Minister.

119,Mr Shorten (Maribyrnong,"Leader of the Opposition) (14:30): My question is to theWith the Prime Minister reportedly considering coming up with something less than a royal commission, Prime Minister, have the banks ticked off on your plan yet? Treasurer to respond to this, but I just remind the Leader of the Opposition of this: the Leader of the Opposition claims to be responding to the concerns of Australians who have lost money when they have been given bad adviceMr Mitchell interjectingWhat does a royal commission do to help them? Years and years, hundreds of millions of dollars in legal expenses, and at the end of that is written a report-not one dollar of compensation, not one measure of redress. The honourable member's call for a royal commission into the banks is nothing more than a political exercise which will do nothing to resolve the needs, the concerns, of people who have been treated unfairly. I invite the Treasurer to add to my remarks. the point of just how crass the populism and opportunistic politics are from those opposite, it was only in March of this year that the Senate Economics References Committee released a report on agribusiness managed investment schemes that ignored a dissenting Greens recommendation for a financial system royal commission. There was a dissenting report by the Greens calling for a royal commission into the financial system. When the Labor Party responded to that-and the member for Rankin will know; when he responded to that-there was no mention in their response of supporting the Greens on a royal commission into the banking and financial industry, and that was only last month. It was in March. I table the member for Rankin's statement because you cannot find it on his website-he has apparently pulled it down. Why would he pull it down? The truth is that they voted against a royal commission in June of last year, and at every opportunity to say they wanted one they would not open their mouths. The Prime Minister goes down and speaks at a Westpac function and tells them what they need to do about banking culture, and-what do you know?-the Leader of the Opposition pops up a few days later with a royal commission which has the terms of reference of a blank sheet of paper. This royal commission proposal is about one person and one person only: the Leader of the Opposition. This is all about pursuing his crass populism and undermining an institution that is critical to our economy, and he has no proposals. He would rather spend $51 million going through an exercise for several years, when he could spend that and announce that he wanted to spend that on ASIC. But, no, he wanted the stunt. He is the stunt master. Small Business Transport Industry question is to the Minister for Small Business and Assistant Treasurer.

We are making sure that we not only fight for small business but create the right framework for small business-an economic framework that gives them a cut to the company tax rate of 1.5 per cent, a discount for those that are unincorporated entities.

Mr Dutton interjectinginterjecting. Building and Construction Industry Innovation and Science, representing the Minister for Employment. Will the minister update the House on why restoring the Australian Building and Construction Commission is essential to the creation of more jobs for Australians? What action is the government taking to restore the rule of law to the building and construction sector? (14:41): Last night we saw the Labor Party again standing up for the CFMEU against small business-against mums and dads and individuals in Australia. The Senate last night rejected the Australian Building and Construction Commission bills put up to it by the House of Representatives-not for the first time. In doing so, it set up industrial relations, support for business, support for freedom and support for the rule of law on construction sites as major and central election issues. We are looking forward to fighting an election around the Labor Party's support for the CFMEU, the TWU and the rogues in the union movement. We are looking forward to fighting an election where we are on the side of the rule of law and on the side of the royal commission headed by Dyson Heydon, which found that the CFMEU was a malignancy in the building and construction industry. The building and construction industry, productivity in it, jobs and growth will be central issues at the coming election, whenever that might be held. Excellency's approval. The Independent Economics report in 2013 found that when the ABCC existed productivity in the building and construction industry improved by nine per cent. It found that consumers were better off to the tune of $7½ billion a year when the ABCC existed and that industrial disputes in building and construction fell under the ABCC, when the ABCC was a tough cop on the beat. All that changed when the Leader of the Opposition bowed to the demands of the CFMEU, did the bidding of the CFMEU, in abolishing the ABCC. It was not just the Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal for the TWU; he went through the whole gamut. He gave the CFMEU what they wanted. He did it because he needed their support to win the leadership of the Labor Party. Let's be clear: the Labor Party has received $12 million in donations from the On this side of the House we are in favour of jobs and growth in the building and construction industry. One way to bring that about is to bring back the ABCC, for which we had a mandate at the last election. We took that to the people. They voted for it. The Senate obstructed that yesterday.

It does not have one single health policy. I thought health was important to the Labor Party, but it does not have one single health policy. The Leader of the Opposition is skipping around the country visiting the laboratories of a listed multinational company, whose profit has increased 500 per cent since 2000, while also claiming to protect the vulnerable. My question back to the Leader of the Opposition, and back to the shadow minister for health, is: can they reassure the patients of Australia that the Medicare rebate for every single pathology item remains unchanged, and, indeed, under review with the MBS task force? Mr Dreyfus: Are you going to cut pathology tests or not? will leave under 94(a). The member for Isaacs then left the chamber.

This is a Labor Party with not one single health policy, but I remind members opposite that the sensible save that the government made in MYEFO last year allowed us to make the biggest ever listing on the PBS, which was $1 billion worth of medicines to treat hepatitis C-$1 billion worth of medicines to cure hep C within a generation. We are the only jurisdiction in the world to do that. We are a government that is running budget deficits, not budget surpluses, thanks to the mess that was left us by the Labor Party. So in taking a rational, sensible, serious approach, it made sense to remove a small bulk-billing incentive, not the Medicare rebate, and to invest in the future health of the nation. Building and Construction Industry the Treasurer advise the House of the importance of investment and enterprise to our transitioning economy? How important is investment confidence and lower costs in our building and construction industry to drive economic growth and create more jobs? question. Like the other Tasmanians here, he is incredibly energised by the strong growth we are seeing coming out of Tasmania-particularly the growth that has been supported by the trade agreements that have been put in place, which are providing real growth and real opportunities. Mr Turnbull: And that Labor opposed. the Labor Party for so long. What we have now are Tasmanian members who are seeing what is happening with jobs and growth in their own state. Our economy is successfully transitioning because of the hard work of those Australians and those Australian businesses that are out there making it happen every single day. That is being reflected again and again in what we are seeing in the confidence and other surveys that are coming forward. The NAB business confidence survey showed that last month it was up three points, conditions were up four points. That is the highest level since 2008. We are seeing that confidence-it was represented again today in the ANZ consumer confidence survey, which showed that consumer confidence was up 10 per cent since last September, and up 23 per cent when they were asked about economic conditions over the next 12 months. So despite the many challenges that we have, people are looking forward and they can see the opportunities. But they know there needs to be a clear plan that ensures we do not take this transition for granted and we back them in with what they are doing in the economy to make this transition a success. One of the most important things we have to do, and why this parliament was recalled for these votes, is to deal with the issue of the Australian Building and Construction Commission. This issue is about economic productivity. It is about growth and jobs. It is about supporting investment in the construction industry that employs more than one million Australians in around 100,000 businesses.",66,Cfmeu Since The Year 2000

Around two out of every three working days is lost to industrial disputes in the construction industry. With an ABCC building code, infrastructure could be built up to 30 per cent more cheaply than without it. Prior to the creation of the ABCC, the average number of working days lost to industrial disputes in the construction industry was a huge five times the rate of other industries. Once the ABCC was established, that rate fell to just twice the rate of other industries. After the abolition of the ABCC, the rate unfortunately rose again and now sits at four times the rate of other industries. The ABCC was started to bring down costs, and would have achieved a reduction of at least 25 per cent.

They did not want to raise tax. That is great, because we do not want to raise income tax and neither do they.

This continuous shipbuilding program will now secure about 2½ thousand jobs that were at risk under Labor because, as the House now knows, Labor did not commission one new ship-not one new vessel from one Australian shipyard, zero-in its entire six years in office. Indeed, 10 per cent of the workforce in Australia's shipyards lost their jobs because of Labor's inability and incompetence in managing shipbuilding or, indeed, Defence contracts.

Now, under this government, we have a local continuous shipbuilding program for Australian industry. Premier Barnett welcomed the 130 jobs that will be secured at Henderson under the government's announcement, but the benefits will flow beyond Western Australia. We know that Austal plans to sustain and support those ships at facilities in Cairns over the life of the project and, indeed, the up to 12 offshore patrol vessels we announced yesterday that will be built in Adelaide and Western Australia will also be housed and maintained in Cairns. This means an additional $800 million investment in Cairns in shipbuilding facilities in northern Queensland. What we saw yesterday was an example where the Australian public can compare and contrast our approach to defence and local industry, and Labor's. While our defence minister, Senator Marise Payne, was announcing the $40 billion investment continuous shipbuilding program, support for local jobs and support for defence capability, the Leader of the Opposition's pick for defence minister, Senator Stephen Conroy, was personally attacking one of the most decorated and distinguished soldiers in Australia's history.

How can Australians trust anything this Prime Minister says from one day to the next? member has asked me about trust, because that is what this election will be all about. Who do you trust to ensure Australia continues successfully to transition from an economy fired up by a mining-construction boom to one that is more diverse, more innovative, more productive, more open to the world to an economy that will drive jobs and growth to ensure that our children and grandchildren have the great jobs they deserve? Australians know that they can trust the coalition because we have a track record to prove it. We are seeing strong jobs growth-300,000 last year and 26,000 last month-strong GDP growth, and business confidence is up. When you look at the Labor Party you do not have to judge them solely on their policies; look at what they actually did! Look at the RSRT: that was in the course of destroying tens of thousands of jobs-tens of thousands of owner-drivers put out of work, their trucks idle, their mortgages unpaid, their homes at risk because they could not meet their mortgage payments, and that was done deliberately by the Labor Party. It was yet another job-destroying policy from the Labor Party. Then you go through the rest of their list. We are promoting investment; we are providing incentives for people to invest in new businesses, in start-up companies; we are providing incentives for innovation. What is the Labor Party doing? It is jacking up the tax on investments by 50 per cent and capital gains tax",68,Cfmeu Since The Year 2000
153,Mr Shorten (Maribyrnong,Leader of the Opposition) (14:56): My question is to the,69,Cfmeu Since The Year 2000
154,Mr Turnbull (Wentworth,"Prime Minister) (14:57): I am glad the honourableup by 50 per cent. We all know that if you want to have less of something, then you increase the tax on it. So what does Labor want less of? It wants less investment, and if you have less investment you will have less jobs. What about the road to entrepreneurship? How does it start? Not everybody can get a cushy job with a trade union. Some people have to go out and work and borrow some money, and they might buy a truck or they might buy some property; they might buy a farm. The way they are able to finance that is being able to offset the losses against their personal income. That is what negative gearing is. That is the road to entrepreneurship for people who start off in life with their human capital. And what does Labor want to do to that? Put a huge barrier in front of it. Labor wants to stand in the way of investment and entrepreneurship. It wants to crush small business, and its track record is clear. If you doubted it, look at all those ownerdrivers who have been protesting here in Canberra at Mr Shorten's bad work. (Time expired) Ms Owens interjectingthe Leader of the Opposition.

Ms L. M. Chesters: to move: That this House: (1) notes the Government’s multiple attacks on the pay, rights and conditions of workers, including but not limited to: (a) advocating for a reduction in penalty rates; (b) issuing temporary licences, which resulted in Australian seafarers being sacked; (c) abolishing the Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal; (d) pursuing legislation that would ensure workers on construction sites have less rights than ‘ice’ dealers; (e) the attempted reintroduction of unfair individual contracts; (f) the failure to address widespread and system exploitation of workers; and (g) the unfair, ideological bargaining policy which forces agencies to strip rights and conditions from enterprise agreements and offer cuts to pay in real terms; (2) condemns the Government for its employment and workplace relations agenda; and (3) calls on the Government to abandon its attacks on the pay, rights and conditions of workers in Australia. Mr Champion: to move: That this House: (1) notes with concern that one of Australia’s major steel manufacturers, Arrium, has recently been placed into administration, highlighting the risk to Whyalla’s economy and our national steelmaking capabilities; (2) recognises the multiple pressures currently being experienced by the Australian steel industry, including the impact of a global over supply of steel; (3) further notes the worrying evidence presented to the Senate Economics References Committee’s inquiry into the future of Australia's steel industry, on the widespread importation and use of structural steel that does not meet Australian standards and presents a threat to public safety; (4) notes the plan announced by Labor to support Australia’s strategically significant metals manufacturing industries, particularly the steel industry, by: (a) ensuring Australian standards are upheld in Government funded projects and supporting local steel producers in meeting certification standards; (b) seeking to maximise the use of locally produced steel in Australian Government funded projects and put in place regular reporting of usage levels; (c) halving the thresholds for projects required to have an Australian Industry Participation Plan from $500 million down to $250 million for private projects, and from $20 million to $10 million for public projects; (d) doubling funding for the Australian Industry Participation (AIP) Authority and appointing an AIP Board; (e) ensuring Australia’s anti-dumping system has the right powers and penalties in place; (f) creating a national Steel Supplier Advocate; and (g) establishing a tripartite Metals Manufacturing Investment Council to work closely with the Government to deliver these measures; (5) condemns the Government’s failure to take a comprehensive approach to securing the future of Australia’s steel industry; and (6) calls on the Government to take serious action to support Australia’s strategically significant metals manufacturing industries, particularly the steel industry. Mr Champion: to move: That this House acknowledges that penalty rates are relied upon by Australian workers and their families to cover everyday costs of living, no matter if they are full time, part time or casual, including workers such as: (1) nurses; (2) police, firefighters and ambulance officers; (3) retail and hospitality workers; (4) manufacturing industry employees; (5) services sector employees; and (6) tourism and transport industry employees. Ms MacTiernan: to move: That this House: (1) notes the findings of Regional Development Australia (RDA) Perth’s Driving Change in our Cities: Economic Development Strategy and Infrastructure Priorities Plan for Perth and Peel, including, that: (a) the development of the Outer Harbour at Kwinana is the number one infrastructure priority for government in Perth; (b) ‘the initiative is essential to the Western Australian economy. Without it, growth will be held back through inefficiencies and lost opportunities (directly related to transport and logistics as well as local production and export)’; (c) ‘there is a need to ensure the primary freight gateway of the State can continue to support economic growth. Further extension of the Inner Harbour is not viable. Road access to it is heavily constrained, and the rail connection requires further investment’; (d) ‘development of the Outer Harbour presents significant jobs growth opportunities with regard to industry, transport and logistics, as well as additional trade opportunities.
