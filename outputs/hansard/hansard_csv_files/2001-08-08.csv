The information can then be The National Literacy and Numeracy Plan is used to improve education. something we should all be supportive of. When I look at this kind of positive outcome All ministers for education agreed to it, and and I see the kinds of comments that are being made by the Queensland Teachers Union, with their mobile billboards and paid Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2001, and to make radio announcements criticising the federal some comments about primary and secongovernment quite fallaciously, I get pretty dary education in this country.

It is way that it is very difficult to differentiate quite inappropriate, and I would urge all between successful policy and political members to have something to say pretty rhetoric. directly to the teachers union. One of the problems of course has been In my discussions with the Queensland the Australian Constitution and the fact that Teachers Union-while I was having a toe to education issues and education resourcing toe with Julie-Ann McCullough from the are divided between the responsibilities of union-Julie-Ann McCullough denied that the states and the responsibility of the federal the Australian Education Union was camgovernment.

Both were born in Broken Hill and both, through different circumstances, found themselves to be important people in the history of Port Adelaide. Perce Hocking, a long-term resident of Seaton, died recently at the grand old age of 104. He was very proud of the fact that he lived in three different centuries. He was born in Broken Hill and his first job was in the mines. However, he came to Adelaide and spent most of his working life in the South Australian Railways-30 years at Monarto South and the remainder at Osborne in the Port Adelaide electorate-until retiring at the age of 65 years in 1962. He once said he owed his longevity to the million units of penicillin he received in 1949 after contracting tetanus. After his retirement he became a weekly volunteer at Port Adelaide Meals on Wheels and, in 1987, was awarded a Senior Citizen of the Year award for community service. He was a life member of the ALP and, with 79 years membership, had possibly the longest ever membership of the ALP in South Australia. George Whitten was also born in Broken Hill. He spent some teenage years on Mildura fruit blocks before coming to Adelaide. He served his apprenticeship as a boilermaker at the Islington railway workshops and became shop steward, vice-president and federal conference delegate of his union-the Boilermakers and Blacksmiths Society, now the AMWU. He was fiercely loyal to his friends, to his family and to his fellow workers. He joined the ALP in 1949 and maintained continuous membership until his death. He was appointed as a full-time temporary organiser of the ALP state office in 1971 and then, in 1973, he was overwhelmingly elected to the permanent position of organiser, working with the then state secretary, the late Mick Young. In 1974, when Mick Young entered federal parliament as the member for Port Adelaide, George Whitten replaced Mick as state secretary. A year later, in 1975, he became the state member for Price and remained the member for Price for 10½ years until his retirement in 1985. He was proud to be a trade unionist, he was proud to be a member of the Labor Party and he was proud to be a member of the Don Dunstan government. Loyalty and honesty were George’s strongest traits and I was proud to be his friend. The death of his lovely wife, Rhoda, only 18 days before his own death hurt him greatly. They were a wonderful couple and they both will sorely be missed in Port Adelaide. George Whitten was 79. He was very proud of and dearly loved his children-his daughter, Myrle, and his sons Stephen, Graeme and John-his son-in-law and daughters-in-law, his 14 grandchildren and his great-grandson, Jack.

The Cairns Youth Mentoring Program matches volunteer mentors with young people who are experiencing problems in school or at home.

The program has been absolutely outstanding. It is now giving young people direct access to role models who will be there to support them, offer advice as they look towards their future goals and assist them in achieving their goals. A great example of this is a young lad who was having problems both at home and at school. He came from a single-parent family. Through the mentor program, his life was totally turned around. When this young fellow met his mentor once a week, they chose an activity that they would do together. The young man has attributed the change in his behaviour at school, his improvement in his school work and his general outlook on life to the skills he learned working with his mentor and the friendship that he now has with this gentleman. Feedback on the program to the program director, Jeanette Harvey, has indicated that parents, teachers and, importantly, the young people of Cairns are finding the program extremely positive. Without the focus of people like the Cairns Youth Mentoring Program Director, Jeanette Harvey; Lifeline’s Youth Support Coordinator, Margaret Vale; Cairns Centacare Director, Helen Biro, and others, this program certainly would not have got past first base. I was pleased that Senator Vanstone and Minister Anthony recently-after I approached them-refunded the program for another 12 months. I see this as a very positive working model that will, I am sure, be able to be adopted into many other communities. Due to the success rate they are having with these young people, I think the program should be commended. (Time expired) Heidelberg Football Club Ms MACKLIN (Jagajaga) (9.57 a.m.)-I want to congratulate the Heidelberg Football Club this morning. The club has just celebrated its 125th season. That is a pretty extraordinary achievement, given that we have only just celebrated our 100th year as a nation. Our local football club is otherwise known as the Tigers. Mr Deputy Speaker Nehl, although you are not a Victorian, you would know that there is another very famous football club called the Tigers with the same colours: yellow and black. But Heidelberg became the Tigers way back in 1885. It is wonderful that we have seen this extraordinary club achieve remarkable success. They have had 22 senior grade premierships and countless appearances during the finals. I was very pleased to be able to join them recently down at the club to celebrate their enormous success. I imagine many Australians now know about the Heidelberg Football Club because we have a very famous Tiger from that club: Blair McDonough. He was, of course, the runner-up in the Big Brother program. Many of you may have met Blair through the Big Brother program. I have to say he certainly was the most popular person down at the celebrations a few weeks ago. He wore his Heidelberg uniform every Saturday that he was in the house on the Big Brother program. I want to congratulate those who are currently giving so much to the club: Dave Batchelor, the president, and Matt Sheahan, the club historian. That is the case with all clubs around Australia, but for those of us in Heidelberg most of all we congratulate those who do so much work for local sport. We know what it means to be able to have these outstanding people who support our children, whether it is through training, through the mothers running the stalls and kiosks or through the dads around the field looking after the kids on Saturdays and during training times. To all of those people who do so much for local sport and particularly to everybody at the Heidelberg Football Club, congratulations for 125 years. I am sure that they will be going on to many more successful seasons as the years go by. Wednesday, 8 August 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 29507 Petrie Electorate: Community Groups Ms GAMBARO (Petrie) (9.59 a.m.)-In the very short time that I have available to me, I would like to support the federal government’s initiative that has assisted many community groups in my electorate of Petrie. the time for members statements has concluded. Cognate bill: Second Reading Debate resumed from 5 April, on motion by Mr Hockey: That the bill be now read a second time. Bill 2001 transfers the administration of the Financial Corporations Act 1974 from the Reserve Bank to the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority. Various other acts, including the Banking Act 1959, the Insurance Act 1973, the Life Insurance Act 1995 and the Superannuation Supervision Act 1993 are amended to harmonise the collection of financial sector data. Essentially, what this bill is about is harmonising the collection of financial sector data. Currently, the Reserve Bank, the Australian Bureau of Statistics and the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority all have powers to collect data from financial institutions. That information is used by APRA for its prudential responsibilities, it is used by the Reserve Bank of Australia in setting monetary policy and it is used by the Australian Bureau of Statistics for a variety of other functions. This bill seeks to make APRA the primary collector of information from the financial sector. It seeks to harmonise and increase the flexibility of the data collection and publishing regimes, and provides that APRA will be the central repository for the collection of financial data. The intention of this harmonisation of data collection, as you might imagine, is to eliminate duplication of data collection by those three different bodies. According to the explanatory memorandum, the existing data collection framework is fragmented, cumbersome and in some areas outdated. In some cases the data collected is inadequate or no longer relevant to the performance of APRA’s functions. The bill provides for the registration of corporations that are not approved deposit institutions but which provide financial services. Corporations whose principal business is the borrowing and provision of finance, where the provision of finance is over 50 per cent of the business or where the provision of finance amounts to over $25 million, will be registerable corporations which will be required to supply APRA with data. This clause effectively removes a hole in APRA’s existing powers in that, while they could approve an application for a banking licence from a conglomerate, they could not seek information from the institution to prudentially monitor its activities. The bill requires that APRA keep a register of such entities and that it make that register publicly available. The bill will give APRA the power to determine reporting standards for, and require provision of, certain documents from financial sector institutions. The determination of reporting standards will be a disallowable instrument. The bill proposes additional powers for APRA: it may, in writing, exempt a financial sector entity or a class or kind of financial sector entity from the requirement to comply with reporting standards. While the bill proposes that the reporting standards that APRA determines are disallowable instruments, the power to exempt is not a disallowable instrument. This would mean that APRA could exempt entities from reporting standards without any reference to the parliament. That seems inconsistent to us, and Labor is proposing to amend the bill to make this kind of exemption a disallowable instrument. It is my understanding that the government is prepared to support such an amendment.",135,Statements By Members

226,Mr Kelvin Thomson (Wills) (10.00 A.m.),"The Financial Sector (Collection of Data)29508 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 8 August 2001 The bill requires that APRA must try to minimise, as far as practicable, the burden that would be imposed on financial sector entities in complying with the requirements of the standards. I make the observation here that APRA’s role is to ensure, as far as it possibly can, that the financial system is safe and secure. In the wake of the collapse of HIH, that is a point that scarcely should need reinforcing. In doing this, it should use whatever resources it needs and should be demanding from financial institutions whatever data it needs. The proposal therefore to minimise the burden of the data collection activities may be seen to be in conflict with the prime role of ensuring that our financial system is safe and secure and that our savings are safe and secure. Given that, Labor believes that section 13(5)(b) is unnecessary, and will therefore be moving an amendment to delete it. The recent collapse of HIH has raised questions about the competency of APRA and, in particular, the appropriateness of APRA’s light touch regulatory regime. We have a situation here where the government is endorsing that light touch regulatory system by requiring that APRA must try to minimise, as far as practicable, the burden that would be imposed on financial sector entities in complying with the requirements of the standards. You have to ask the question: where would the line be drawn on this matter of reducing and minimising the compliance burden in providing information? Labor suggests that it is not appropriate for the government to be continuing what it describes as the ‘light touch regulatory model’. That light touch regulatory model is already costing taxpayers, over the next 10 years, some $640 million as we bail out the victims of the collapse of HIH. The estimated cost of that HIH assistance package is $640 million. We do not need more of this light touch regulation. We need to ensure that our financial institutions are safe and that our savings are safe-whether they be in banks, superannuation funds or insurance policies. As many of my colleagues will be aware from the case studies involving victims of the HIH collapse, many people believed they had insurance coverage and it turned out that that insurance coverage was not available because of the collapse of HIH. That effectively was enough to destroy their life savings or to send their business broke. It had calamitous impacts on those families and on those businesses. Given that, we do have a concern about the appropriateness of the light touch regulatory regime and propose to move amendments in committee which would, on the one hand make the exemption from the requirement to comply with those reporting standards a disallowable instrument and, on the other hand, make sure that it is clear that APRA’s prime role is to ensure that our financial system is safe. In relation to that matter, I observe that the chief executive of APRA said last week to the Investment and Financial Services Association conference in Brisbane that APRA had done everything that it possibly could in relation to the issue of HIH and that its role would be vindicated by the royal commission when the royal commission ultimately comes to do its work. I am sure that you are aware that it is Labor’s view that the royal commission ought to have been going already and we are disappointed that it will not start until September. It does seem to me that APRA has changed its position from its acknowledgment earlier in the year that it could have done more and that it does bear some responsibility for the HIH collapse. I was surprised to read Mr Thompson’s remarks suggesting now that APRA is apparently no longer responsible for the HIH collapse. It is certainly a matter that the royal commission will be investigating, and the sooner that royal commission is brought on and does its very important work in restoring public confidence in general insurance, the better. The other matter I would note in conclusion is that recently the Minister for Financial Services and Regulation, Mr Hockey, addressed a conference in Cairns. Those who were promoting that conference said that the minister is endeavouring to establish a situation where financial sector regulation and things of that nature would be freed up from Senate scrutiny. It struck me as an extraordinary position for the Minister for Financial Services and Regulation to be taking. I do not know whether it was part of his prospective bid to be deputy leader of the Liberal Party but the Senate plays an important role in the Australian political firmament. Wednesday, 8 August 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 29509 As far as I can understand, there is no likelihood of the Constitution being changed in a way that would enable House of Representatives ministers to avoid Senate scrutiny. It is my own view that Senate scrutiny is an important matter in ensuring that not only the financial services minister but also other ministers are held properly accountable for the administration of their portfolios. It has been doing some important and valuable work. Indeed, the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation and Financial Services has been conducting hearings into the collapse of HIH and the collapse of Commercial Nominees and doing other important work to ensure that prudential supervision-the monitoring and the regulation-is in place to try to assure Australians that their savings and investments are as safe as they can reasonably be. That is enough for now but, if the government wishes to discuss any of these matters further in the committee stage, I would be happy to pursue these matters further. amendment. It would suit the convenience of the committee if he could move it. Amendment (by Mr Kelvin Thomson) proposed: That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: “whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House condemns the Government for: (1) APRA’s failure to establish adequate reporting standards for bodies in the financial sector; and (2) its overall regulatory failure and its mishandling of a response to the collapse of the HIH Insurance Group”. stand part of the question. 2001 is a bill that seeks to draw together the framework for the collection of data necessary for the regulation of a number of industries. The industries covered by this legislation are banks, credit unions and building societies-that is, the deposit-taking institutions, insurance companies, superannuation funds and friendly societies. APRA, which is the prudential regulator, supervises 11,000 institutions including 300 deposit takers, 40 life insurers, 160 general insurers, approximately 50 friendly societies and directly or indirectly about 10,000 superannuation funds. This process is necessary to prevent duplication of collection of data. The other two main sources that government requires data from are the Reserve Bank and the Australian Bureau of Statistics. Therefore, we have three organisations collecting similar data. This provision allows for the streamlining and the cutting of red tape and for a reduction in paperwork, but it also allows for there to be adequate collection of data. The review on methods for collection of APRA data was conducted in 1999-some three years ago. We seem to be moving quite slowly in this area. This legislation notes the presence of disparate collection systems from predecessor agencies, mainly the Insurance Superannuation Commission and other agencies, and that the data is in various stages of disrepair. That is probably too slick a response to explain shortcomings in the organisation-it is easier to blame the data than to blame the people. I am not aware that the Insurance Superannuation Commission has ever had any trouble with failures of the HIH type. So part of the problem is the change in organisations and the restructuring and additional responsibilities that APRA has been asked to take on. The structure of the legislation which launched APRA is also inclined towards a corporations base rather than an insurance base. Therefore, APRA is not generally as well equipped to deal with insurance matters as was its predecessor. Part of that inadequacy, I believe, has resulted in the failure of HIH. APRA needs to come clean and acknowledge its shortcomings-not blaming data, not blaming antiquated systems-and look fairly and squarely at whether their own management processes were adequate to deal with these industries or whether they were coasting a bit.",137,Financial Sector Collection Of Data Consequential And Transitional Provisions Bill 2001

231,Mr Cadman (Mitchell) (10.13 A.m.),"The Financial Sector (Collection of Data) Bill29510 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 8 August 2001 APRA has made a statement that it will work closely with the Reserve Bank and the Australian Bureau of Statistics to improve and, where possible, rationalise the content of authorised deposit-taking institution returns. I do not know whether APRA, as the newest body in the field, is the one best equipped to make those assessments, but I understand that it is APRA who will harmonise and to whom the information will be channelled. I would like to see APRA publicly demonstrate its competence by laying out its management plan in the collection of data, acknowledging that it is not going for an overkill. A lot of this will relate to the affairs of individuals as well as to the management processes being adopted by the bodies that it is supervising. Therefore, some care is needed on privacy factors that there is not just a wish to overkill-to seek to gather too much information-to demonstrate that APRA is assiduously on the job. Results are the things that count, not how much data you collect or whether you can blame that data as being out of date. I have some concern about APRA’s skill in being able to bring together the data. I would like to see management systems and the processes-both for the retention of privacy and also in the expedient setting up of efficient data management systems-publicly stated. Management of data is a skilled process and the public of Australia will need to be assured, during the royal commission and other things that are afoot, that APRA is a competent body to manage the data that it will be collecting. I note that the Chief Executive Officer of APRA, Mr Graeme Thompson-I do not think he is related to the spokesman for the opposition-said before the Senate Economics Legislation Committee: I have said publicly that, with the benefit of hindsight, APRA could have been more aggressive with HIH and dug more into its financial condition once we had identified concerns with its operations in the middle of 2000. Again, the excuse is used of flawed and out-of-date material. That might be an easy excuse. I look forward to the way in which APRA is going to pull itself into gear and give the Australian people confidence that it is adequate to perform the task it has ahead of it. The main provisions of the bill deal with the bodies which may be registered for the collection of data. These are companies which fall within the Commonwealth’s corporations power. Their sole or principal business activity in Australia is to borrow money and provide finance. Debts due to the corporation from the provision of finance exceed 50 per cent, or such percentage as prescribed, of the value of all the assets of the corporation, or the corporation provides finance in association with the retail sale of goods and the value of debts due to the corporation from that provision of finance exceeds $25 million or the amount prescribed. The bill outlines the standards that will be adopted by APRA. APRA must consult with the entities concerned and try to minimise the impact on the entities concerned. The opposition has proposed an amendment which would change that provision. I think that would be somewhat foolish. This is a new organisation which is gung-ho to prove that it can handle the responsibilities it has been given. It intends to collect as much data as it possibly can. If this is done without consulting the entities concerned, if data matching techniques are used and great banks of data are shifted from one organisation to the government’s purview, this offers the prospect of some overenthusiasm by an inexperienced organisation, compared to experienced agencies such as the Reserve Bank and the Bureau of Statistics, and the prospect of some abuse by government agencies. I have no problem with the provision. It is a sensible one. The collection of data should be done properly, in consultation with the bodies concerned-and, I would hope, in a way that matches the requirements of the Reserve Bank and the Australian Bureau of Statistics. Clause 13 indicates that differing standards may be determined for different classes of financial sector entities. That is also a very sensible provision because the difference between banks and insurance companies is substantial, and that needs to be acknowledged in the way in which the data is collected. Wednesday, 8 August 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 29511 There is no statistical data on how much time this consolidation of information will take. I suggest that APRA needs to focus on the service it is providing. In financial services, Australia’s competitive edge can be just as easily affected by regulatory requirements and legislative provisions which are too onerous, just as it can be affected by other factors. I say to APRA and to those who supervise financial services that we must retain, and maintain, the absolute control and certainty that Australia has been able to demonstrate over many years. At the same time we must be able to do so in an efficient and competitive manner. If our processes here are sure ones, but slow and inefficient, that will not allow us to develop as a world-class provider of financial services. We should be not only sure and safe but also efficient. A concentration on excellence is something that I would like to see APRA publicly expressing. (Collection of Data) Bill 2001. The purpose of this legislation is to provide APRA with the power to determine the information which must be provided by certain corporations and to place an obligation on those corporations to provide that information. APRA was created in 1999 as an amalgam of the Insurance and Superannuation Commission, the banking supervision unit of the Reserve Bank, and the Australian financial institutions commissions of the states and territories, which supervise building societies, credit unions and financial institutions then incorporated in state and territory legislation. The finance sector has been both the subject and the source of much change in the last two decades. It is perhaps the most internationalised of our industry sectors and has been undergoing huge structural adjustment, which has attracted much community, media and political scrutiny. The closure of bank branches, not just in rural areas and provincial towns but in the suburbs of metropolitan cities, has caused much angst amongst banking customers and communities. I am very pleased that, in my own electorate of Lowe, where some 13 branches have closed in the period I have been the member, there is a very active group led by Marlene Doran, the President of the Homebush Main Street Committee, to get the first community bank up and running in Homebush in Sydney and another over in the Haberfield area. Councillor Emma Brooks-Maher from Ashfield Council is leading a very spirited campaign to get community banks up and running. Quite plainly, the community are outraged at the campaign by the banks to make profits at all costs, with no interest in the very customers who have provided the huge profits over the years. The banks are only interested in rewarding their shareholders. I look forward to the day when my electorate has a number of community banks to take on the big bastards. From an initial reaction of arrogance and disdain, banks have had to acknowledge customer and community concerns and interests. The Australian Labor Party and the Finance Sector Union have also led the way in championing the charter of community service for the banking sector-a position ignored by the coalition. After making submissions in 1996 to the Wallis inquiry, in which the banks stridently refuted any notion that they had a community service obligation, it is heartening to see that all the hard work done by the community, the union and the ALP in campaigning and lobbying has recently seen not only a reversal of that position by the banks through their group, the Australian Bankers Association, but also a positive adoption of a community service obligation. member for Lowe, but he is aware, of course, that the bills which we are debating cognately are the Financial Sector (Collection of Data) Bill 2001 and the Financial Sector (Collection of Data-Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2001, and there is an obligation understanding orders for members speaking to speak to the content of the bills. As yet I have not heard you say one word about the content of the bills, and I would commend you to observe the standing orders and to speak about the bills. the damage done by the ruthlessness of bank restructuring in the 1990s, it can at least be said",139,Financial Sector Collection Of Data Consequential And Transitional Provisions Bill 2001

233,Mr Deputy Speaker ( Mr Nehl),Order! I am loath to interrupt the honourable,141,Financial Sector Collection Of Data Consequential And Transitional Provisions Bill 2001
234,Mr Murphy,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. While there is some way to go to repair29512 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 8 August 2001 that the community and customers have the banks’ attention. Hopefully, banks will adopt a more balanced approach in the future, with a swing back to reincluding the interests of the community and customers, together with those of the shareholders. Like banking, insurance has been regarded by Australians as one of the essential features of the landscape, but here, too, great changes have been wrought during the 1990s-changes that have seen insurance companies seem to become more the instruments of their executive officers and leading investors than of their policyholders. Insurance companies are now huge multinationals and seem to have left their policyholders behind-except for their premiums, of course. Insurance companies have also graduated since the mid-1980s into superannuation providers and master fund managers. No longer can we speak of the old-fashioned insurance agent with the personal touch with the policyholder. These huge combined companies are now engaged in the receipt and investment of the retirement funds and dreams of millions of Australians. Yet all these great and significant changes in the finance sector over the last two decades seem to have passed the regulators by in the night. That is the only conclusion this parliament and the people of Australia are left with. Banks and insurance companies no longer represent the Victorian era gentlemen’s club with the interests of old. They are now huge investment corporations which have the retirement futures of millions of Australians in their hands. These institutions can no longer be allowed to regulate themselves. The public and national interest now demands and dictates that the public be able to exercise scrutiny and accountability of their activities and decisions. And yet again, the regulator charged with exercising that scrutiny and demanding that accountability seems not only unwilling but unable to do so. Worse, if the conduct of APRA during the unfolding nightmare of the HIH failure is anything to go by, APRA, according to the public statements of its CEO, Mr Graeme Thompson, actually withholds its hand in such situations because to take up its charge actually risks aggravating the situation. This is an impossible attitude to hold because it means that when the regulator is needed most-that is, when it is needed to intervene with preventative and remedial measures to assist the financial corporation to remain in business and to discharge its responsibilities to its customers, policyholders and investors-the regulator, APRA, disarms itself and retreats to the bleachers to simply observe the calamity unfold to its conclusion, in collapse and disaster. A regulator with such a morbid sense of observation, rather than being proactive, cannot deserve the confidence of the community. Mr Graeme Thompson, in comments reported in the Australian Financial Review on Friday, 3 August 2001, castigates the wiseacre experts who have criticised APRA over the HIH collapse and blames the flawed regulatory regime he inherited. Mr Thompson was part of that flawed regulatory regime for many years whilst he was at the Reserve Bank prior to his assuming the position of CEO of APRA in 1999, and never a word has been publicly reported of his concerns and doubts about this flawed regime of regulation. APRA has a responsibility to the Australian people to ensure that the financial institutions in its charge are accountable for their conduct, both good and bad, and to see to any remedial and preventative intervention required to assist financial institutions in the ways and means by which they conduct their businesses. At the forefront of APRA’s daily work should be-must be-the face of Australian people whose financial welfare is now in the hands of unelected fund managers. The HIH collapse demonstrates clearly and presently that these fund managers need a wake-up call with regard to their responsibilities to the people of Australia and not just to the board of directors, and the instrument which should provide that wake-up call, that reality check, should be APRA. Its very passivity and its attempts to justify that passivity condemn APRA in the public mind. This legislation is intended to bring some rationality to the centralWednesday, 8 August 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 29513 ising of information and financial sector reportage. The destination at first instance for that data will now be APRA. That there will now be a single destination for that data is a good thing. The wisdom of APRA being that single destination remains to be seen. APRA is very much a regulator whose usefulness will sorely be tested in the forthcoming inquiries. I hope for the sake of the Australian people that APRA, and particularly its uncontrite CEO, see some light on the road to Damascus of these public inquiries. Finally, I commend the remarks of my colleague the member for Wills and support the amendment to delete section 13(5)(b) as I believe it should be no burden to establish and operate on a reportage regime which has as its first and last test the public interest of the Australian people and their financial welfare. Ms GAMBARO (Petrie) (10.33 a.m.)-I am very pleased that the honourable member for Lowe did choose to speak about the Financial Sector (Collection of Data) Bill 2001 and the Financial Sector (Collection of Data-Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2001 in the very last few seconds of his speech because I would like to draw the House’s attention back to the reason we are here today. We are here to speak about two bills which give effect to the harmonisation and streamlining of the collection of statistical information across the financial sector in Australia. The Financial Sector (Collection of Data) Bill is the main bill which transfers the administration of the Financial Corporations Act 1974 from the Reserve Bank of Australia to the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority. Overall, the proposed regulatory measures are designed to streamline and simplify the current data collection methods and systems. The bill aims to modernise and increase the relevance of data collections, therefore ensuring that APRA collects the data it requires for the purposes of its prudential functions, and the data that APRA collects must also continue to facilitate the formulation by the RBA of monetary policy. The bill covers the following broad areas: it has powers for APRA to determine reporting standards, it requires the provision of certain documents and it also requires the application of the Commonwealth Criminal Code to certain offences. The Financial Sector (Collection of Data-Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2001 gives effect to the main bill. The provisions contain no new policy and simply ensure that the government’s policy, as outlined in the main bill, is implemented in Commonwealth legislation. I want to touch on the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority and some of its powers and particularly its responsibilities, which include licensing of financial institutions and making sure that the standards on prudential matters in relation to Australian deposit-taking institutions, superannuation funds and insurance companies are adhered to. It should also be noted-and previous speakers have covered a number of areas that APRA is and is not responsible for-that APRA is not responsible for pricing competition in financial markets, for standards of disclosure about products and services, for how banks and others handle customer complaints and disputes or for fees, charges and interest margins. APRA is funded by levies paid by the regulated financial institutions and it is accountable through an independent board. To ensure that there is a close relationship between the Reserve Bank of Australia, the Australian Securities Investment Commission and APRA, the RBA has two representatives and the Australian Securities Investment Commission has one representative on the APRA board. APRA has had a supervisory role, particularly with regard to banks, insurance companies and superannuation funds, for just over two years, and with regard to credit unions and building societies for just over 12 months. It is a single prudential supervisor of financial institutions in Australia, and it has brought together the prudential supervision regulations and responsibilities of some 11 different agencies. That was a flow-on from the Wallis committee 29514 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 8 August 2001 recommendations, which recommended the establishment of regulatory entities to ensure the prudential regulation of the financial system. A number of recommendations were made to ensure that there was a reduction in supervisory costs for regulated industries through administrative economies. It was also established to develop a harmonised approach. These bills deal with the harmonisation of the collection of data, but there has been a harmonisation approach already with the reduction of similar risks and activities where they occur in the financial system. APRA was also set up to provide a flexible approach to dealing with structural change in the financial system and to ensure that there was a more effective supervision of financial conglomerates. APRA does have a very large role that it is responsible for and in its administration of its economies it has an operating cost. It has dropped somewhat from $56 million in the 1997 budget to $51 million in the 2000-01 financial year. This has really been occurring at a time when financial institutions have grown in complexity and have increased in size by roughly 35 per cent. So some great advances have been made in the harmonisation of prudential regulation and there has been an increase in the harmonisation of rules and guidelines. I see this bill as a continuation in APRA’s role, particularly to harmonise a single look and to provide standard guidelines. There are different approaches with those standards. Also it is reconciling flexibility and harmonisation. There is further work to do, and I am sure that this particular bill that we are speaking to today will ensure that that harmonisation will occur. The harmonisation will occur particularly with existing data collection. It is important to note that a previous speaker, the member for Wills, spoke about the framework being fragmented and out of date and also that this simplified approach should occur. Also, changes have been made to such legislation and regulation of APRA’s data collection and publishing powers. Finally, the current situation also means that the overlap that used to occur-particularly with APRA, the Reserve Bank of Australia and the Bureau of Statistics collecting their own data-will occur no longer. That data collection process will be simplified by almost two-thirds. APRA itself is funded through financial sector levies, its main source of operating revenue. The legislation has many advantages, and I feel that it will provide financial institutions with the ability not to spend so much time collecting data similar to that used by the previous agencies. APRA will be that central collection point now. The legislation will also harmonise public disclosure and the requirements of provider institutions, and will make it simpler for the financial institutions to comply with the financial data collection of ABS and the RBA. Industry will also be able to examine much better industry data collected by APRA and selectively use that as a basis for comparison with other institutions and sectors. The transitional costs will be very modest, and I believe the overall effects will be much enhanced and the process will be greatly simplified. For example, in the changes, the authorised deposit-taking institutions are expected to have a reduction of some 30 per cent in the reporting burdens of the past. That will be very welcome. Australian deposit taking institutions are entities which include banks, building societies, credit unions and friendly societies. During the year we have heard ADI terms mentioned quite a lot. In the banking sector, profits have grown incredibly high and there continues to be an asset growth of about 11 per cent. Banks are much more active in managing their capital, and building societies and credit unions have also experienced average growth rates of about five per cent over the past year or so. Consolidation means a significant increase in these sectors, and also the number of institutions continuing to grow is something that we should look at. Credit unions in Australia hold some $21.5 billion in assets, as compared with $759 billion for all other ADIs. This may be contrasted with other countries: for example, in the United States in 1999, the credit union share of total assets is some 5.8 per cent. This bill will ensure that ADIs will have a reduction in their reporting burdens. It will also increase the ability of APRA to perform its supervisory roles. The previous speaker spoke about the supervisory roles, particularly in relation to HIH and what has occurred in the leadWednesday, 8 August 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 29515 up to the royal commission. A lot of what he said today, though, I feel should not be a topic of discussion on today’s bill but is really a matter for the royal commission which the Howard government has, appropriately, set up. Those issues would be more appropriately raised in that forum, rather than today in speaking about the simplification of the collection of data. Finally, I wish to speak about some of the amendments that have been advocated. When the Minister for Finance and Administration, during the autumn sittings, spoke about these bills in his second reading speech, he stated that the government should listen to a lot of the issues that were raised by the industry. I too advocate that. The approach that has been taken with these amendments is essential to ensure that we have a new collection procedure that takes effect pretty soon, and I advocate that as well. The start date that the minister spoke about was 1 July, and a lot of consultation has occurred. The government has made some minor amendments, and has been very consistent in ensuring that there has been a lot of harmonisation and streamlining across the sector. The amendments to clause 14 remove the application of the obligation on the principal executive officer from superannuation entities. It is important to note that the provision requires the principal executive officer to be responsible for lodging key documents with APRA, and industry has noted that there are types of superannuation structures which would potentially make it confusing and difficult to identify the principal executive officer in those entities. So it would be pretty impractical to impose this particular type of obligation on the superannuation sector. There have been some other amendments to the Financial Sector (Collection of DataConsequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2001, focusing largely on amendments to the Superannuation Industry Act. These will apply to all superannuation entities, other than selfmanaged superannuation funds. The self-managed superannuation funds will remain under the supervision of the Australian Taxation Office. The previous speaker spoke about the amendments. I believe that the government and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration will continue to support an appropriate balance in ensuring that adequate information is available to the regulator. But there also has to be a really good balance so that it does not become too burdensome to competitively work in the industry, and to ensure that competitive process occurs and that the main focus is what is being concentrated on and not the reporting procedures that are overly burdensome. The passage of the bipartisan reforms will, I believe, improve the efficiency of the sector. It will take away the situation of having three different agencies collecting data. I believe that is a very good thing and I have no hesitation in lending my support to the bill today. islation. I was looking through the amendments that are being moved by the opposition and it struck me as rather curious that they should be doing this. The first point to make about them is that they do not actually relate to the bill per se. They are just a straight little political joust, a bit of a stunt, trying to bring something in which is not related to the bill. Secondly, I do not think that they stand up to much scrutiny. Let us look at the first one-APRA’s failure to establish adequate reporting standards for bodies in the financial sector. I would have thought that APRA has demonstrated so far that it is working hard not only to do that but in fact to improve them. Notwithstanding that, though, the Audit Office has had a look at APRA andas has already been mentioned-the House economics committee is doing an in-depth study on that Audit Office report. We will be looking closely at a number of factors that have been raised. So again it shows that the opposition are not really interested in looking at how to improve these things. They are really only trying to make cheap political points and I do not think that they improve their credibility when they start to do these little stunts.",141,Financial Sector Collection Of Data Consequential And Transitional Provisions Bill 2001
235,Mr Hawker (Wannon) (10.45 A.m.),"I want to speak briefly on the financial sector leg29516 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 8 August 2001 On the second part of the amendments-as has been pointed out already-there is a royal commission under way and I think it is quite premature for them to make statements or to imply in these amendments that there is some government failure. I do not think there would be a royal commission under way unless there was a lot still to be established. The opposition ought to be condemned for putting up these rather puny little amendments, which are merely political point scoring and therefore deserve the condemnation that they will get, no doubt, when the parliamentary secretary sums up. stration) (10.47 a.m.)-I would like to thank the honourable members for Mitchell, Petrie, Wannon, Wills and Lowe for contributing to this very important debate in relation to a very important matter of concern to the Australian people. These two bills do give effect to the harmonisation and streamlining of the collection of statistical information across the financial sector in Australia. The Financial Sector (Collection of Data) Bill 2001 transfers the administration of the Financial Corporations Act 1974 from the Reserve Bank of Australia to the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority. Overall, the proposed regulatory measures are designed to streamline and simplify the current data collection methods and systems. The bill aims to modernise and increase the relevance of data collections, thereby ensuring that APRA collects the data it requires for the purposes of its prudential functions and that the data APRA collects will also continue to facilitate the formulation of monetary policy by the Reserve Bank of Australia. The bill covers a number of broad areas, including powers for APRA to determine reporting standards and require the provision of certain documents and the application of the Criminal Code of the Commonwealth to certain offences. The Financial Sector (Collection of Data-Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2001 gives effect to the main bill. The provisions contain no new policy and simply ensure that the policy of the government as outlined in the main bill is implemented in Commonwealth legislation. The member for Wannon, in referring to the second reading amendment and how shallow it is, talked about the attitude of the Australian Labor Party. I respond by saying this is not a matter with which people ought to play politics. This is not a matter with which the ALP ought to score political points because quite frankly the government, during the period we have been in office, have been outstanding managers in this area. We are always prepared to finetune, we are always prepared to look at situations. Honourable members on both sides will be well aware of the fact that we have set up a royal commission into these matters. This was mentioned by the honourable member for Wannon. It would be better just to leave these matters to the royal commission. We want a full investigation. We believe people ought to be protected. The obvious way to check to see whether procedures are adequate, to check the way forward, is to have this royal commission and to let people who have complaints, recommendations or ideas come forward and talk to that royal commission. There will be ample opportunity for evidence to be given. The government will consider the report of that royal commission when it ultimately is handed down. The honourable member for Wills will not be disappointed to know that we reject the second reading amendment moved by him in this place. The government seeks support of the bill from the chamber. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Consideration in Detail Bill-by leave-taken as a whole. (1) Clause 13, page 13 (lines 25 to 27), omit paragraph (5)(b).

237,Mr Kelvin Thomson (Wills) (10.52 A.m.),"by leave-I move:Wednesday, 8 August 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 29517 An instrument under subsection (1) is a disallowable instrument for the purposes of section 46A of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901. I could not help but notice that in the contributions of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration and the members for Petrie and Wannon they suggested we should not play politics with the issue of the HIH collapse. What an extraordinary view of politics and the role of politicians. You can imagine if a Labor government were in office and we had the largest corporate collapse in Australian history$4 billion and a $640 million taxpayer funded bailout over the course of the next 10 years-the nature of parliamentary debate surrounding that. We would not get any of this ‘don’t mention the war’ stuff that we just had. As for the idea that all these matters ought to be left to the royal commission, the royal commission is a device to enhance accountability; it is not a device to avoid accountability. Those members ought to understand that fact. They ought to understand that that is exactly what the parliament is here for: to raise these issues and to make sure that there is public debate around matters of public concern. There are few matters of greater public concern this year than the collapse of HIH. The fact that a royal commission needs to be set up-the fact that you had to be dragged kicking and screaming to set up a royal commission-shows a lack of public confidence in the existing accountability arrangements concerning these matters. We have quite an audience here. I welcome them. They are in fact minders. The number of minders indicates the need to make sure that the parliamentary secretary does not slip up. This is the largest number of minders I have seen in my time here in the Main Committee, and that is a comment on the parliamentary secretary’s capacity. The member for Mitchell had some interesting things to say about my proposed amendments when I discussed them in general debate. I thought that a number of the comments made by the member for Mitchell concerning APRA were comments that I would agree with, and I thought he had some interesting things to say in that regard. However, I am pleased to say that, given that he expressed some reservations about my amendments, the government has, in fact, found my arguments more convincing than those of the member for Mitchell and, as I understand it, proposes to support the amendments that I have put forward. Given that and given that I outlined the case for my amendments in the general debate, I do not want to say anything further about that or to delay the committee any further in relation to these matters, but simply indicate that it is our position that these amendments should be supported. really think that it is very easy to say that it is a question of politics and to have a bit of 20/20 hindsight. I would suggest that if you want to go down that path then we could find a little bit more 20/20 hindsight. One of the problems that APRA has found, and I have no doubt that the royal commission will have something to say about this as well, is that when it comes to regulating insurance-and we want to talk about the HIH problem-APRA has been operating under some very old legislation. I am sure the member for Wills would be aware of this, but he might not like to admit it. The fact is that the legislation probably is more than 25 years old and we have seen the situation where both the Hawke and Keating governments had many opportunities to amend that legislation, to modernise it and to assist the regulators, both the ISC and now APRA, to have the opportunity to better regulate insurance. Had it been amended, it is possible that the HIH problem could have been dealt with much earlier and maybe with less pain not only to the shareholders and maybe the policyholders but to taxpayers as well. So when we talk about accountability maybe we had better just chuck in something about the accountability of the Australian Labor Party on this too, because they had all those years of the Hawke and Keating governments and they did nothing.

He ought to come clean and be honest and say he has bulked out the numbers with a staff member from Senator Conroy’s office as well. I do not know whether it indicates that that staff member is regretting that he is standing as part of the opposition team and very much supports the principle that the government is espousing in this particular matter as in so many others. If that is the case, we certainly welcome your latter day road to Damascus experience and the enlightenment which we now belatedly see. The government does support an appropriate balance between providing adequate information to the regulator and imposing unsustainable burdens on the private sector. There have been discussions with the opposition and, for the sake of passage of these essentially bipartisan reforms which will improve the efficiency of the financial sector by removing repetition of reporting to up to three different regulators, the government is prepared to accept the amendments moved by the opposition. I present the revised supplementary explanatory memorandum.

In the second reading speech on these bills during the last autumn sittings, the Minister for Financial Services and Regulation stated that the government would listen carefully to issues raised by industry on the content of the legislation and would move any appropriate amendments that it agreed were necessary. This approach was essential to ensure the earliest possible commencement of this new collection procedure. Start date will be amended from 1 July 2001 to a date set by proclamation. That consultation process has occurred and the government now moves minor amendments to the Financial Sector (Collection of Data) Bill 2001 consistent with the objective of the government of harmonising and streamlining the collection of statistical information across the financial sector. Specifically, the amendments to clause 14 remove the application of the principal executive officer obligation to superannuation entities. This provision required a principal executive officer to be responsible for lodging key documents with APRA. Industry noted that particular types of superannuation fund structures could make it potentially confusing and difficult to identify the principal executive officer in these entities. Therefore, it would be impractical to impose this obligation on the superannuation sector.

246,Mr Tanner (Melbourne) (11.04 A.m.),"The opposition support this legislation. It is partWednesday, 8 August 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 29521 tion with regard to these matters. I compliment the opposition for having such an enlightened attitude. It is a pity that they did not boil down all of their support for the government to speeches of such brevity. I will just run through some of the provisions of this briefly. The Finance and Administration Legislation Amendment (Application of Criminal Code) Bill (No. 1) 2001 deals with the schedules and details of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918, the changes that are required to the Referendum (Machinery Provisions) Act 1984 and the Public Accounts and Audit Committee Act 1951 to bring into a cohesive form the application of the criminal code to a range of government acts. This is an ongoing process. Gradually, across the board in Commonwealth acts, the provisions for penalties and the application of the criminal code are being harmonised, and a more comprehensive and understandable approach to misdemeanours and legal burdens of proof against people who offend under Commonwealth law is being taken. For instance, regarding the application of the criminal code under the Commonwealth Electoral Act, the only thing that is done is to insert a note stating that the defendant bears the legal burden of proof in relation to the defence of these provisions. This means that basically nothing changes, but there is a note indicating uniformity. The evidential burden of proof on the defendant, compulsory enrolment, the transfer of enrolment and the transfer of publication of matter regarding candidates are all covered by the legislation before the House. The defence of just excuse is included in a separate subsection. There is a penalty for an officer neglecting to enrol claimants. The state of an offence is one of strict liability. The opening of postal ballot papers and the opening of pre-poll voting envelopes are the sorts of matters dealt with under the legislation. The badges or emblems in polling booths, the failure to transmit claims, the restructuring of the offence of failure to vote at an election and compulsory voting provisions are all covered by this legislation. Having dealt with the criminal code in one of our parliamentary committees, I am delighted that this measure is so widely supported. It does unify the process. It retains integrity and puts pressure in the right place so that defendants must produce proof. The clarity which the changes in the Criminal Code provide across the board of government administration needs the support of the House. stration) (11.08 a.m.)-in reply-I have been asked by the Parliamentary Liaison Officer to make a more substantial contribution than I had planned to on the Finance and Administration Legislation Amendment (Application of Criminal Code) Bill (No. 1) 2001, owing to the business of the Main Committee. The speech which I had made was my usual brief contribution. the matters contained in the bill. The ALP ought to be ashamed of the rorts which we have seen in that state. It is regrettable, because it is important we have integrity in the electoral system and the federalsure we have integrity. This bill, as the member for Maribyrnong would be well aware, relates to amendments to offence provisions in the various legislation under the Finance and Administration portfolio to ensure compliance and consistency with the Criminal Code. This type of legislation is being enacted across a wide range of portfolios as the Criminal Code becomes part of the law of Australia. It is very important that portfolios comply with the Criminal Code, which evolved following a very long consultative process. The bill that is before the chamber amends the existing offence provisions under the various acts to ensure that they operate in the same manner when the Criminal Code applies from 15 December this year.",150,Finance And Administration Legislation Amendment Application

252,Mr Slipper,"No. I am just saying that the federal government are very keen to make29522 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 8 August 2001 This is particularly important in relation to offences that currently operate as offences of strict liability. Honourable members would be well aware that the bill also amends Commonwealth superannuation acts to impose the lighter evidential burden of proof on a defendant in relation to a particular offence and expressly states time limits to satisfy requirements under offence provisions in the act. A lot of people say, ‘We’ve got this legislation going through the parliament across a range of portfolios.’ Then they ask the question, ‘Do these amendments impose any new criminal offences under any of the clauses contained in the bills?’ I want to assure the Australian community that the proposed amendments will not impose any new criminal offences under any of the clauses contained in the bill. The bill will also update maximum penalties in the superannuation acts to be appropriate and consistent with the Crimes Act 1914. In relation to the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 and the Referendum (Machinery Provisions) Act 1984, the bill will repeal specific offences that are now covered by the general offence provisions of the Criminal Code, replace words and phrases in certain offences which are inconsistent with the language employed by the Criminal Code, and restructure certain offence provisions to ensure that their operation remains unchanged after the application of the Criminal Code on 15 December this year. The amendments will result in a consequential change to the penalty level of four offences currently contained in the referendum act. These changes are explained in the supplementary explanatory memorandum to the bill, which I intend to table. The government is very keen that there ought to be integrity of the electoral system. Over the period that we have been in office we have made a very substantial number of changes towards achieving a position, as far as the federal electoral roll is concerned, so that, when the people of Australia cast their vote on polling day, the result, as declared, represents the collective will of the Australian people. There has been much discussion in the community about a sense of alienation from the political process-how some people feel disempowered. When we have a situation where electoral rorts in some parts of the country have been highlighted, that tends to magnify concerns in the community about integrity of the electoral system. We have on a number of occasions sought to bring about increased integrity measures, which have been opposed, regrettably, by members of the Australian Labor Party. I find it difficult to understand why the Australian Labor Party does not always support the integrity measures because, in a liberal democracy-and we are very privileged to live in Australia, which is the sixth oldest democracy in the world, with freedom, stability and a way of life that are the envy of people throughout the globe-every player in the political system, every major political entity, indeed every independent, has a vested interest in ensuring that we preserve and enhance our democratic system. We, of course, are prepared to stand up and be counted. I would like to call on the Australian Labor Party to do likewise. I believe very strongly that, before people are put on the electoral roll, they should prove that they exist. You need 100 credit points to open a Commonwealth Bank account. Surely being put on the Commonwealth electoral roll is at least as important as opening a bank account. Unfortunately, today people are able to fill in any number of enrolment cards, post them to the Australian Electoral Commission in the envelopes provided and, subject to a few checks and balances, usually those people-or nom de plumes in some cases-are automatically put on the electoral roll. Therefore, as far as our electoral roll is concerned, that means that we currently have an honour system. I urge the community, the parliament, the government and the opposition to move to a situation where people are required to prove that they exist, that they are real people, before they are put on the electoral roll. Once they have been put on the electoral roll, I would like to see people provide identification before they are given a ballot paper. It all comes back to the key element in which all of us have a vested interest-that is, ensuring the integrity of the electoral system. We only have to turn on our television sets at night Wednesday, 8 August 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 29523 to appreciate that people in many other parts of the world do not have the democratic freedoms and traditions that we have in Australia. All of us have to be constantly alert to ensure that whenever we can improve the integrity of the electoral roll we move decisively in that direction. With respect to the Criminal Code, there has been a debate as to whether we ought to have a model criminal code and why on earth do we not continue as we have in the 100 years of federation through to the year 2001, the centenary of Australia’s Federation. Certainly, the criminal law has served the interests of the Commonwealth and the Australian people, but it is always important to look to see how, when and where we are able to make improvements. Even if a system of criminal law has worked relatively well for a period of 100 years, as members of parliament elected to represent the Australian people it is important for us to look forward to see whether we can improve on a system which has operated very successfully in Australia. That is one of the reasons why this government-I suspect it was a bipartisan move-has moved towards supporting the principle of this Criminal Code. Much of the legislation we have seen in recent times in the chamber has related to harmonising matters to ensure compliance and consistency with the Criminal Code. As I said at the commencement of my contribution, the Finance and Administration Legislation Amendment (Application of Criminal Code) Bill (No. 1) 2001 makes certain amendments to offence provisions in the various legislation under the Finance and Administration portfolio to ensure compliance and consistency with the Criminal Code. I am pleased that in this matter we have received the support of the honourable members opposite-and indeed that the opposition will be putting aside the negativity which we see so often with respect to so many bills-for this very important reform which is being proposed by the government. The codification of criminal offences will represent a very significant improvement to the existing Commonwealth criminal law. It will provide greater consistency and clarity of legislative provisions relating to criminal offences in Australia. The parliamentary liaison officer has asked me to extend this debate for a period of 10 minutes. I have now done so. I thank those who have contributed to this debate. I urge the chamber to support the passage of this very important legislation. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time.

Note: A defendant bears a legal burden in relation to the matter in subsection (2) (see section 13.4 of the Criminal Code). I understand that these amendments are supported by members of the Australian Labor Party. The government amendments to the bill include changes to the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 and the Referendum (Machinery Provisions) Act 1984 and a minor amendment to the Public Accounts and Audit Committee Act 1951 to reflect the application of chapter 2 of the Criminal Code to offence provisions. These amendments will repeal from the Referendum Act two offences of knowingly providing false or misleading information in relation to voting at a referendum. The two mirror offences contained in the Electoral Act were repealed last year by the Criminal Code (Theft, Fraud, Bribery and Related Offences) Act 2000. Therefore, the repeal of these two offences from the referendum act is necessary to ensure that the offences contained in the Referendum Act remain consistent with the same offences contained in the Electoral Act. The government amendments to the bill will also restructure several offence provisions in both the Electoral Act and the Referendum Act to ensure that the structure of these offences is consistent with the Criminal Code; enact amendments to the Electoral Act and the referendum act to ensure that the language of these acts is consistent with the language used in the Criminal Code; amend the Electoral Act and the Referendum Act to ensure that provisions that impose a legal burden of proof or an evidential burden of proof on a defendant state that specifically; and amend the Electoral Act to replace a reference to section 7 of the Crimes Act 1914, with a reference to the appropriate section in the Criminal Code. The government amendments will also contain an amendment to section 17 of the Public Accounts and Audit Committee Act 1951. This provision currently contains both an offence and a defence against that offence. The amendment will separate the defence from the offence so as to avoid the mistaken interpretation that the defence is part of the offence. Further, the legal burden of proof on the defendant is retained, notwithstanding that the preferred policy of the criminal code is for an evidential burden of proof because of the seriousness of the offence. The amendment will place the section on the same footing as section 15 of the PAAC Act and sections 28 and 30 of the Public Works Committee Act 1969. These three sections contain broadly similar offences to section 17 of the PAAC Act but contain a different defence. 29530 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 8 August 2001 Amendments to these three sections were included in the original bill. I commend the amendments to the chamber. Amendments agreed to. Bill, as amended, agreed to. Ordered that the bill be reported to the House with amendments. BILL 2001 Second Reading That the bill be now read a second time. Maritime Conventions Legislation Amendment Bill 2001 and in doing so foreshadow that I will move a second reading amendment. As those who have taken an interest in the bill will understand, it seeks to amend six acts of parliament related to Australia’s compliance with international conventions. I clearly indicate that the opposition will support the bill. I understand that the government has circulated amendments to the bill, and I can advise that the opposition supports these amendments. With that background I will now seek briefly to address the details of the bill and then go to some of the broader matters encompassed in my second reading amendment which go to the importance of shipping to Australia’s future. As one who has studied the bill understands, the various pieces of legislation are largely facilitative and technical in nature. I will deal firstly with the amendments to the limitation of liability under the Maritime Claims Act 1989. The 1976 liability convention, which deals with the liability for maritime claims, allows a shipowner or salvor to set limits for the amount of damages they can be required to pay for damage caused by the ship, the shipowner or the salvor or their employee or agent. The limits are set out in the convention. These limits were amended by the protocol of 1976, which goes to the convention on limitation of liabilities, which was about increasing liability limits and seeking to provide a simpler method for future increases of liability limits. So it is all about facilitating easy government action on these fronts. Schedule1 of the bill will amend this act to implement the 1976 liability protocol. Clearly, the opposition supports the intent of the government on this front. I turn to the amendments to the Protection of the Sea (Powers of Intervention) Act 1978referred to, I suppose, in a shorthand way, as the intervention act. This act gives the Australian Maritime Safety Authority important powers to take measures to protect the sea from pollution by oil and other substances discharged from ships. I think it is fair to say that, in terms of the development of our community in more recent times, there is an expectation by the Australian community and the international community that we actually do more on this front. This is reflected in the intent of the government’s legislation today. Section9 of that act relates to the taking of measures under the 1973 protocol, which goes to the issue of intervention on the high seas in cases of pollution by substances other than oil. An annex to this protocol lists the polluting substances other than oil that pollution prevention measures can be taken in relation to. Schedule2 of the bill amends the intervention act to implement the list of these substances as approved by the Marine Environment Protection Committee of the International Maritime Organisation in July 1996. Again, I think we all understand the need to continue to update our legislative intent in order to cover all possible spills and difficulties with respect to the operation of shipping in Australia’s waters. I turn to the amendments to the Protection of the Sea (Prevention of Pollution from Ships) Act 1983, described in shorthand as the pollution prevention act. Schedule3 of the bill amends the pollution prevention act, which implements the International Convention for the",153,Finance And Administration Legislation Amendment Application
254,"Debate Resumed From 4 April, On Motion By Mr Mcgauran:",,160,International Maritime Conventions Legislation Amendment
255,Mr Martin Ferguson (Batman) (11.24 A.m.),"I rise to speak on the InternationalWednesday, 8 August 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 29531 Prevention of Pollution by Ships, better known as MARPOL. These amendments include a range of changes. For example, firstly, they remove the requirement to include the text of conventions in schedules to the act, which can be laborious and difficult in a legislative sense as things change internationally. Secondly, they implement amendments to 73/78 of bage. Thirdly, they introduce changes to incident reporting arrangements. Fourthly-and importantly, I might say-they provide for Australian Federal Police officers to be inspectors under the act to avoid the need for separate paperwork and approval at the time of incidents, which is all about enabling Australia to do a better job with respect to trying to prevent these incidents rather than just acting after the event. This will ensure that we can put people in place at short notice to undertake the requirements with respect to inspectorial powers. Fifthly, and finally, the changes will enable Australian Maritime Safety Authority officers to require the discharge of waste from a ship to a reception facility. The bill also makes a range of amendments in relation to penalties and offences under the Pollution Prevention Act. These include, firstly, providing that any person, other than the shipowner or master, who is responsible for unlawful discharge is guilty of an offence; secondly, requiring the owner of a ship to report an oil pollution where a master has not done so; thirdly, ensuring the owner or master of the ship is guilty of an offence if the pollution damage resulted from their negligence; and, fourthly and finally, providing that the same penalty applies to discharge of harmful substances in all parts of the act. Obviously, the whole intent of the bill is action to ensure that we tighten up with respect to whoever is responsible for the discharge of the substances into our seas. It is also to make sure that, where they are clearly negligent, we have sufficient power and penalties in place to try and guarantee that people are more than ever responsible for their own negligence and acts, in some instances, of wilful environmental damage. I note that the government has moved amendments to the bill that go to this section. These amendments, interestingly, are in response to a decision in the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal. That decision opens an interpretation that allows a shipowner or master to escape responsibility for damage from discharges into the sea. Without going into the technicality, the act currently allows relief if this discharge was a consequence of damage to the ship. The New South Wales case, importantly, extended the interpretation of a similar term to say damage could cover ‘wear and tear’ on a ship. It is therefore possible that a shipowner or master could avoid responsibility for discharges from their ill-kept or ill-maintained vessel. That is very much an international problem with respect to some of the foreign flag vessels that move around the international community. That is why, from an opposition’s point of view, we have always had a problem about the wilful negligence of the current government with respect to opening up more and more Australian shipping lines to the use of continuous and single voyage permits to some of these ships that could do damage to the Australian environment, yet alone continue to take away jobs from Australians. As a result of this New South Wales decision, they have to face up to their requirement to engage in good management practices with respect to the vessels that they are responsible for. This is clearly counter to the intent of the act. Therefore, the opposition supports these amendments to head off that type of interpretation. I continue with the amendments to the Submarine Cables and Pipelines Protection Act 1963. Schedule4 of this bill amends the cables and pipelines act to reflect the terminology of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea rather than the superseded 1958 Convention on the High Seas. The amendments provide that the act applies in the exclusive economic zone and the high seas as defined in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea rather than the high seas as defined in the previous convention. In some cases the protocols being facilitated by this bill have not taken effect because they require sufficient international signatories. The commencement date of the bill will provide for this. It is also about 29532 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 8 August 2001 making sure that other countries in addition to Australia face up to their responsibility to sign onto the intent of this international law. It is against that background that the opposition stands in support of the bill and the amendments as proposed by the government. While the opposition does not see the changes embodied in the amendments in the bill as contentious, we do see as very serious the direction the Australian government has taken us on the coastal shipping front since its election in 1996. We agree that the changes in the bill are necessary to implement international conventions that are important to maritime and shipping safety regulation, and I must say that at least on this occasion the government is prepared to face up to its international responsibilities. Time and time again, on most international issues, the Australian community has been confronted with a government that has contempt and disregard for international developments with respect to many aspects which affect the direction of the Australian community and its international responsibilities. Examples are the government’s attitude to the ILO and United Nations processes in general and, in more recent times, the difficulties we have in relation to the complex issue of Kyoto and our responsibilities on the greenhouse front. On this occasion the government has accepted its international responsibilities, but it is time that this government accepted that we are part of an international community. We should face up to our responsibilities, not only on the question of shipping but also on a range of complex issues. That is what is expected of a decent country that is prepared to shoulder its responsibilities to actually lead in very complex and difficult international matters. I am pleased to say again in this chamber that the opposition is totally committed to the safety and efficiency of the shipping industry. Other speakers on our side of the chamber will also make comment on these matters. We regard the shipping industry as vital to the future of Australia, which has been and always will be a trading nation. For Australia, globalisation is a fact of life. For Australia to be an active participant in the international community, we must make sure that we have adequate Australian shipping in place to guarantee that we compete on an equal footing, and also to guarantee that in circumstances such as those of East Timor we have in place not only a decent defence force but also a shipping service which enables us to support our defence forces in case of need. That is what the debate today is about-not just our international responsibilities in shipping but also our responsibilities, as a nation, to both the Australian people and the international community, including people in our region. We believe that Australia has a key role to play on the international scene, firstly to ensure that world shipping is safe. That is our responsibility as a trading nation and a nation that expects to be respected in the international community. It is our responsibility as a nation that has always wanted to box above its weight. We should not be content with boxing above our weight, so to speak, in the swimming pool, on the netball court or on the cricket or rugby field. We should also do so when it comes to our responsibilities to guarantee that world shipping is safe, because protection of our environment is just as important to Australia, in an international sense, as winning the Ashes on the cricket field in England. Our problem is that we have a responsibility that is currently being neglected by the Prime Minister, who in essence believes that our international responsibilities start and finish at Lord’s or at the Sydney football stadium, when it comes to cricket and rugby. When it comes to our responsibilities as a decent nation on issues such as leading in respect of defence or shipping, we are, frankly, a second-class nation. At the moment, that is how we are seen beyond Australian shores by many international organisations. I would argue therefore that the bill before the House today is not only about ensuring that our shipping is safe, it is also about Australia making a contribution in an international sense to our local environment, the international environment and the interests of Australia and all nation states. Wednesday, 8 August 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 29533 Australia has an intrinsic vested interest in this objective, because of our geographic isolation and the fact that we are an island nation, totally reliant on shipping and aviation services to access other markets. The sustainability of that access is dependent on how we develop and grow the quality of transport links like shipping. It is not a second order issue; it is a first order issue that requires further attention by the Commonwealth parliament. I would remind the House that the opposition is the sole party with a commitment to sustainable safe and efficient shipping in terms of Australia’s exporters and importers. I say that because, in spite of all the lip service from the Minister for Transport and Regional Services about his policies for exporters, he is committed only to the lowest cost denominator, not to a sustainable industry. As we have witnessed in many sectors, the lowest cost service is not usually the best. Too often we see safety standards eroded or undermined merely to get costs down. The House should understand that reducing standards actually increases costs in the medium to long term. Time and time again this has been proven with respect to this current government’s policies. This is clearly the case with the actions of the current minister and his policies for the Australian shipping industry. Rather than making frequent calls trying to intimidate journalists in his own electorate or in rural Australia-as occurred, for example, in Dubbo in the last week with respect to the Dubbo Liberal and his attempt to intimidate and interfere with the media-the minister should face up to his responsibilities to actually spend a little bit of time worrying about his responsibilities on the transport front and shipping industry policy in Australia. The shipping policy of the Howard government has clearly been one of taking risks with the quality of shipping, Australia’s environment, Australia’s defence and Australian industry in the narrow pursuit of the bottom line, without regard to Australia’s national interests. It is important to remember that the coastal shipping trade is part of the domestic transport task, in the same manner as trucking, rail and domestic and international aviation services. The government have said that they have no interest in Australian companies being suppliers of shipping services. I am pleased to say that the opposition does have an interest in Australian companies being suppliers of shipping services. Unlike the current government, we do not merely see Australia purely as a buyer of shipping services. We should play in the international scene as a supplier, not just a buyer, of shipping services. The House should consider that policy in the context of any other Australian domestic transport mode. The Navigation Act of 1912 regulates the ships and conditions for operating on the coast, to ensure quality and equality with other workers and operators in the interstate transport industry. Single and continuous voyage permits were intended to be used as a temporary licensing mechanism. They were designed correctly to help shippers move product when a licensed ship was unavailable, by providing a temporary permit to a foreign ship. When operating under such a permit, a foreign ship-and the House should not forget thisdoes not have to meet the normal licensing requirements that we expect as a nation; for example, the operators are not required to meet the same crew requirements or apply Australian conditions. The truth is and the facts show-and it is reflected in the Hansard of this week with respect to a question that I placed on notice and the government’s response to it-that more than ever the current government is using these provisions to bypass the usual labour market tests for visas with respect to work in this industry. The evidence of the government’s misuse of these permits goes to provisions clearly aimed at increasing the use of foreign ships and cheaper guest crews at the expense of jobs for Australians. In answer to my question on notice No. 2556, the minister has confirmed the increasing use of temporary licensing on foreign ships to move our coastal cargo. In 1995-96 the then Labor government issued 421 single voyage permits to carry a total of 3.2 million tonnes of coastal cargo. In the financial year 1999-2000, the minister approved 629 single voyage permits to carry 7.3 million tonnes of coastal cargo. In the same year, he issued 73 continuous voyage permits, carrying about 0.7 million tonnes. The Labor government did not issue one continu29534 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 8 August 2001 ous voyage permit. We actually care about Australian coastal shipping and, more importantly, we actually care about jobs for Australians. And that is what it is about-it is about jobs for Australians, not the support of foreign shipping companies, as is the current policy of the Howard-Anderson regime. In the year 1999-2000, the minister also shifted a total of eight million tonnes of domestic freight tasked from Australian industry to foreign ships and guest labour-cheaper guest labour at the expense of Australian jobs. But, more importantly, the years I have referred to are not an aberration. In this year up to the end of the March quarter, the minister had already issued more continuous voyage permits than last year-74 compared to a total of 73 for all of 1999-2000. Single voyage permits issued up to the end of March quarter already number 476, with the same tonnage rounded at 7.3 million in both years. Therefore, it is important to understand that there is a major industry grievance, and it is about this misuse of interstate coastal transport to the detriment of Australia as a trading nation. But it is also interesting to now discover, following consultation with others in the freight industry in Australia, that the damage to Australian jobs and the damage to the private sector in Australia is not just limited to maritime and shipping industries. It is now extending beyond the maritime and shipping industry because this government has no regard for our freight objectives and the issue of logistics when it comes to transport of freight in Australia. I refer, for example, to the company Specialised Container Transport, a major transport company in Australia employing substantial numbers of Australians and investing in the training of Australians for the future. In a recent briefing, that company provided me with analysis that shows that millions of tonnes of freight have now been taken out of the rail industry and given to foreign shipping operators-not given to companies operated by Australian workers in coastal shipping, but taken out of the freight industry in Australia and given to crews of foreign shipping companies. That shows absolute contempt for the Australian freight industry and absolute contempt for Australian companies in the private sector prepared to invest in the future of this country and employ Australians. It is a government that deserves condemnation; it is a government consumed with destroying the Australian shipping industry; it is a government that has now got in place a policy which is taking freight off Australian companies and putting it on foreign vessels which pay no profit to Australia and which have no regard for our environment or for Australia as a nation, especially Australia’s regions, which depend on a decent transport industry. The minister has also never, ever released the industry-government working party report into the competitiveness of the Australian shipping industry. He sits there in his oval office, moving paper from one side of the desk to the other to avoid any responsibility, whilst getting on the phone trying to threaten and intimidate journalists in regional Australia who actually tell the truth about his performance and the performance of the Howard government. That report ought to be released now because it needs to be debated in the lead-up to the election. The reason it has not been released is that it did not say, and the government knows this, that cabotage should be abolished. The Australian Financial Review reported in 1999 that analysis by Access Economics in the hidden report shows that government policy eliminating cabotage without genuine reform would carry significant economic costs to the Australian economy. That is what is happening. The Australian Shipowners Association submission to the current Senate hearing on a different bill also provides an interesting statistic. In 1998-99 vessels operating under single and continuous voyage permits carried 15.1 per cent of the total Australian interstate and intrastate transport industry freight task. In simple terms, that means that the operators moving 15.1 per cent of Australia’s domestic freight do not have to pay Australian award conditions. In the majority of cases these operators are also receiving direct subsidies from the nation of origin-so much for international competition and a level playing field-to undermine jobs, wages and conditions in Australia. The Howard-Anderson government is responsible for deWednesday, 8 August 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 29535 stroying jobs and destroying decent working conditions in Australia. How can Australia be expected to compete with that? It is rubbish. Everyone knows about it and we know who is responsible for it: the people on the other side of the House, who hate Australian workers and want to destroy their wages, conditions and jobs. The time has come for the Australian community to actually have the report I have referred to about cabotage out there for discussion in the lead-up to the election. It is a key issue in relation to jobs in Australia-that is what it is about-and to fair wages and conditions of employment. If we do not, the impact will be as has been foreshadowed to the minister in the report that is buried on his desk. He is removing cabotage by stealth without appropriate reform or policy direction and the expected economic damage is now being inflicted on the Australian community. The Australian public and shipping industry are paying the cost. I have actually raised some very serious issues today. They go to detail of the evidence and impact of the risks taken by this government with their policy of hanging the Australian shipping industry out to dry. My colleagues will continue to raise these matters in important debates because they are entitled to make a contribution to the debate, which is not just about whether or not we should be able to move freight in and beyond Australia but is also about our responsibility to the Australian community. It is about our responsibility to protect the Australian coastal environment. It is about our responsibility to make sure that we have a coastal shipping service in place that enables us to face up to our responsibilities as they arise from time to time on the defence front, such as our involvement in East Timor. It was the head of the military, Major General Cosgrove, who actually complimented the Australian coastal shipping service on their contribution to East Timor. I would also say in conclusion that it is about whether or not you want a trained, highly qualified shipping work force in Australia receiving fair and reasonable wages and conditions of employment. I suppose in essence it is about your national and international responsibilities. On that note, Mr Deputy Speaker, I move: That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: “whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House condemns the Government for its neglect of the Australian shipping industry, leaving the Australian economy, environment and community exposed to the risk of marine accidents, port pollution and infiltration via ports and the sea of deadly diseases like foot and mouth disease.” It is clearly about telling the Australian community about the neglect of Australian shipping, the risk it poses to marine accidents, port pollution and infiltration by ports, and the sea of deadly diseases like foot-and-mouth disease. (Time expired) Ms GAMBARO (Petrie) (11.54 a.m.)-While I agree with most of what the member for Batman earlier spoke about, particularly on pollution with regard to the International Maritime Conventions Legislation Amendment Bill 2001, which we are here to speak about today, I found the second half of his speech more of a tirade than anything else. I found it quite extraordinary. Our export sector is booming. To say that jobs are being lost is absolute nonsense. I want to quote some figures from the Port of Brisbane Authority. Roughly between 2,300 and 2,400 ships visit the Brisbane port on a yearly basis. Last financial year, the cargo volume reached 23.1 billion tonnes.

259,Mr Deputy Speaker ( Mr Mossfield),"Order! The member for Petrie will be heard29536 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 8 August 2001 per cent. The government have done more to help the exporters of this country than any other government. Our exports are surging ahead. As result of the new tax reform system, we have shaved some $3 billion off the cost to exporters. Clearly, that was not making us competitive in the world. I do agree with the previous speaker on a number of factors: he said that trade was very important, that globalisation was really important, that we have to be world standard and that we have to compete in the marketplace. But I totally disagree with some of things he spoke about. We have provided an environment that has been more competitive for Australian exporters. Today we are here to talk about shipping, but from my own experience in the exporting area it is something that the Australian government has supported totally and wholeheartedly to make sure that things are much more competitive. The previous speaker is very short on rhetoric. In fact, if the previous government was so concerned about pollution, why are we here today talking about some of these acts, including the Protection of the Sea (Prevention of Pollution from Ships) Act 1983, the Limitation of Liability for Maritime Claims Act 1989 and the Protection of the Sea (Powers of Intervention) Act 1981? The government have done much more than any previous government when it comes to this whole area of pollution. That is what we are here to talk about. We are here to talk about the International Maritime Conventions Legislation Amendment Bill 2001. It will be amended in four unrelated areas: the Limitation of Liability for Maritime Claims Act 1989, the Protection of the Sea (Powers of Intervention) Act 1981, the Protection of the Sea (Prevention of Pollution from Ships) Act 1983 and the Submarine Cables and Pipeline Protection Act 1963. The government amendments to the bill propose some further amendments to the pollution prevention act. In a number of sections of that act, the master or shipowner is strictly liable if there is a discharge from a ship into the sea-for example, oil, sewage or garbage-but a defence is available if the discharge was as a consequence of damage to the ship. The previous member spoke about this not going far enough, but there are cases where there are accidents that are by no means the fault of the particular captain of the ship. One has to look at them case by case. It is the intention of the international maritime community that this defence should be available only where the damage is as a result of an accident and at no other time. The previous member also spoke about the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal, particularly in Morrison v. Peacock and Roslyndale Shipping Co. Pty Ltd. That held the interpretation of damage in a New South Wales act similar to the pollution prevention act, which includes fair wear and tear. The government amendments to the bill also intend to limit the interpretation of damage to the original intent-as I have mentioned, as a result of an accident-and make it clear that damage does not include deterioration from a failure to maintain the ship or equipment. It is the shipping company’s and the captain’s responsibility to ensure that ships are maintained adequately and that the defects that develop from the normal operation of the ship or equipment are managed. I want to add that the amendments to the act will implement a 1996 protocol which amends the 1976 Convention on Limitation of Liability for Maritime Claims to increase liability limits to take into account inflation. Also, where a shipowner or salvor can limit the total amount of damages they are required to pay for damage caused by a ship, the shipowner must act in accordance with the limit set out in the 1976 convention. This refers to liability, and it reduces with the increase in the size of the ship. The amendments to the Limitation of Liability Maritime Claims Act will not take effect until Australia becomes party to the 1996 protocol. The protocol has to be ratified internationally. As of 28 February, only four countries were party to this protocol. Amendments to the intervention act will revise the list of chemicals on which the Australian Maritime Safety Authority may take intervention action. The revision to the list of chemicals is in accordance with the resolution of the Maritime and Marine Environment Protection Committee of the",165,Marpol On Categorisation Of Liquids Pollution By Packaged Substances And Disposal Of Gar
260,Ms Gambaro,"Thank you very much, Mr Deputy Speaker. That is a growth rate of 4.8Wednesday, 8 August 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 29537 International Maritime Organisation. Intervention can occur if there is a grave danger of pollution occurring from a chemical that has or is likely to escape from a ship. Intervention action may range from part of a cargo being moved to another part of the ship to, in very extreme cases, sinking of the ship. It is also important to note that marine pests are often introduced into Australian waters by ships discharging ballast water. To minimise the potential risks from uncontrolled or unmanaged ballast water discharges, the government and other stakeholders have developed the Australian Ballast Water Management Strategy. While the strategy nominates the Australian Quarantine Inspection Service as the lead government agency, the Cross-Modal and Maritime Transport Division participates in the strategy with Australia’s Ballast Water Management Advisory Council. The council has been established to advise all relevant agencies on the development of safe, practical, cost-effective and environmentally acceptable water management measures. The Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry will also implement rules to manage ballast water to prevent the introduction of exotic pests into Australian marine environments. The new rules will be effective from mid-2001 and will keep Australia at the forefront of marine biosecurity. It is very important that we protect our waters. These measures form part of the International Convention for the Protection of Pollution from Ships. The convention includes measures which require Australian ships of 400 gross tonnes and over and which are certified to carry 15 or more persons to have a shipboard waste management plan and to carry and maintain a garbage record book. The convention requires all ships of 12 tonnes or more to display placards to inform passengers and crew about restrictions that apply to the disposal of garbage from ships, and it gives marine surveyors the power to require a ship to discharge waste into a reception facility. There are also a number of amendments which require offence and penalty provisions relating to the discharge of waste from a ship. There are amendments to the Cables and Pipeline Act which include a reference to the exclusive economic zone. They reflect the wording of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea rather than the superseded 1958 Convention on the High Seas. I also want to talk very generally about the amendments to the Protection of the Sea (Prevention of Pollution from Ships) Act 1983. The member for Batman covered many of these. I reiterate that a number of amendments will be made. They will remove the requirement to include the text of convention schedules in the pollution prevention act. They will lead to the categorisation of liquid substances and the prevention of pollution by packaged substances. A number of amendments have been put forward relating to the disposal of garbage. There will be changes to incident reporting requirements. The Australian Federal Police will have a larger role to play as inspectors under the act. There will also be a power to require the discharge of waste from a ship into a reception facility. There will be scope for penalties of imprisonment to be prescribed in the regulations and there will be adjustment in terms of penalties that will be imposed in regulations. This government has taken tougher measures than has any other government to ensure that owners of ships report oil pollution incidences. They provide that the owner or the master of a ship is guilty of an offence if pollution damage resulted from their negligent act. There is also a provision that provides the same penalty in the case of the discharge of harmful substances. I have no hesitation today in supporting the International Maritime Conventions Legislation Amendment Bill 2001. This legislation will result in a much better environment for shipping in this country. I am very concerned about pollution of the seas. Representing an electorate that has some 35 kilometres of coastline, I am very conscious of the need for us to sustain our environmental liability, to ensure that Australian shipping lines and international shipping companies which come to our country act with integrity, and to ensure that our seas, marine life and all the wonderful things we have in this country, particularly our pristine waters, are maintained to the highest possible standards. I commend the bill to the House. 29538 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 8 August 2001 tion dealing with shipping. I know that you, Mr Deputy Speaker Mossfield, will be very interested in what I have to say. As was noted in the minister’s second reading speech, the International Maritime Conventions Legislation Amendment Bill 2001 will amend four acts and consequential amendments to two other acts. Taken by themselves, each of the amendments contained in this bill is relatively minor, but taken as a package they represent an important updating of the four acts. The member for Petrie, who unfortunately has left, misunderstood what the member for Batman said about workers-that is, that there are very few Australian jobs in Australian shipping. I do not want to get into an argument about who has done what and who has done the most about shipping, but it was under a Labor government that the record breaking Ships of shame report was produced. That report put pollution and shipping on the international agenda. Also, the member for Petrie said that it was this government that was introducing a lot of these amendments. A lot of these amendments or issues are consequential to the international movement, such as schedule 1-which deals with the increase in ratesand also schedule 3. So do not get too carried away about who has done what. As the shadow minister has outlined, we on this side are not opposing this legislation. We see it as a continuation of improvements of the maritime conventions, bringing them into line with modernday practices. The shadow minister has moved an amendment to the bill which I fully support. The government does have a case to answer, because for six years it has neglected the shipping industry, preferring instead to attack the Maritime Union of Australia and leaving our coasts, ports and environment exposed to pollution and deadly imported diseases. As an island nation, shipping is of vital importance to us. We should be leading the world in ensuring better standards for shipping, both nationally and internationally. Schedule1 will provide a simple method for future increases in liability limits. It is all very well putting huge liability costs on shipowners but they must always be able to obtain insurance coverage. I recall when we were doing the first Ships of shame report that we were very concerned about the possibility of lack of insurance. No-one wants accidents, but they do happen and there must be a reasonable level of compensation available. Hopefully, with Australia being a party to the 1996 protocol, it will add another country to the list so that after 90 days at least the required 10 countries can become party to it. TodayI think only four have signed up. We often hear about oil pollution at sea, but many would argue that damage from a chemical spill would be even more dangerous. Just think of some of the dangerous chemicals being conveyed around our coastline, like sulphuric acid, petrol and caustic soda. At least when you see birds covered with oil-and dreadful as that isor the coastline polluted in black, you know an oil spill has occurred and remedial action can be taken. Chemicals are often the invisible pollutants. Their long-term effects can be more damaging than an oil spill. In many respects schedule 3 is the most important. It updates MARPOL. For too long, ships-both large and small-have used the seas as dumping grounds for garbage. In fact, the passage of a luxury liner was too often marked by a string of garbage trailing the ship. This is no longer acceptable. This is especially important in more remote parts of the world, as in the case of the increasing number of ships in the waters around Antarctica. That is why the protocol on environment protection to the Antarctic Treaty is so important. But it is not always the large ships that in the past have been responsible for dumping garbage. I welcome the requirement that Australian ships of 400 tonnes or more and certified to carry 15 people or more will be required to have a ship board waste management plan and to carry and maintain a garbage record book. These provisions are designed to complement existing provisions restricting the disposal of garbage from a ship and are intended to ensure that our seas are not polluted by ship garbage. In addition, every ship of 12 metres or more in length will be required to display notices to inform passengers and crew of restrictions that apply to the disposal of garbage from the ship.",166,Marpol On Categorisation Of Liquids Pollution By Packaged Substances And Disposal Of Gar
261,Mr Hollis (Throsby) (12.06 P.m.),"I am pleased to be speaking once more on legislaWednesday, 8 August 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 29539 Just as today it is totally unacceptable for rubbish to be thrown from the window of a carsomething not so uncommon a couple of years ago-so must the community understand that it is unequally unacceptable behaviour to drop garbage, however defined, from a ship large or small. I am pleased that the bill will give maritime surveyors from AMSA the power, indeed the duty, to direct a ship to a suitable discharge facility. If, when conducting shipping inspections, they believe that the amount of waste on board at the time of the inspection, such as oily waste or garbage, means a ship would have to discharge some of that waste at sea, they can now require the waste to be discharged from the ship at a suitable discharge facility. Such a facility exists at my own port, the port of Kembla. Indeed, it is pumped into tankers and then disposed of at a Wollongong treatment centre. Wollongong is one of the 50 ports with such facilities around Australia. The prevention of the discharge of pollution, especially oily waste, has been long championed by the MUA which, for many years, has run a campaign-showing our beautiful beaches and the beautiful people who often use the beaches covered in black oil-called ‘Safer ships, cleaner seas’. To highlight this aspect, a surf carnival near Geraldton in Western Australia was sponsored by the MUA when there was a conference there recently. This campaign, ‘Safer ships, cleaner seas’, started after an incident involving the Greek registered tanker Kirki, which broke up in moderate seas off the coast of Western Australia-indeed, the whole front of the bow fell away-in 1991, spilling all of its 50,000 tonnes of light crude oil on crayfish waters and Western Australia’s northern beaches. Luckily, in many respects, it was light crude, not heavy. As with so many aspects of the maritime industry, it has been the MUA that has been at the forefront of new standards-new standards for seafarers, who must work on rust buckets and ships of shame, and new standards for shipping and the environment. I have said many times that in Australia we must be extra vigilant as so many of these ships carrying dangerous chemicals or other substances pass through our most important tourist attraction, the Great Barrier Reef. The reef covered with sludge oil would not be the renowned tourist attraction it is today. It has been the campaign by the MUA that has ensured the survival of the reef in its pristine state for the benefit of all Australians and international visitors. Of course, all the requirements of this legislation depend on the quality of shipping using Australian shipping lanes. It is true that many of the real ships of shame no longer use our coastline but they are still there using international lanes. We will not tolerate ships of shame in Australian waters. AMSA has been vigilant on ship conditions in recent years. But our former colleague Peter Morris, the chairman of the International Commission on Shipping’s inquiry into ship safety, Ships, Slaves and Competition, said recently when he released the findings of his report that, although the condition of ships has improved, in many cases the conditions of seafarers have got worse. As a member of the board of missions to the seamen of Port Kembla, I know this from personal experience. It not only occurs in ports like Port Kembla; recently there was the case of a cruise liner in Britain, where the conditions were so bad that the crew went on strike. Although everything might have been fine for the passengers, who were paying large amounts of money to enjoy all the facilities, the facilities for the crew and the conditions in which they had to exist were absolutely deplorable. Too often, on the ships that I see, the conditions and food are deplorable. The practice of multi-crewing is used to control the crews. Do the crew members dare to make any complaints? Occasionally they contact the International Transport Federation. Sometimes they will contact the local chaplain at the mission or even the MUA. Too often, crew members are too scared, too frightened and too intimidated to complain. It is a method of control to have mixed crews comprising different nationalities, often speaking different languages. To top it off, on the bridge the remainder of the crew comprise another nationality. The waters off the Australian coast or some other remote ocean of the world often become the grave of crew members who have the courage to complain about their treatment and con29540 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 8 August 2001 ditions, and that of others. If a seafarer in Port Kembla or Sydney makes a complaint and the next port of call is Brisbane, Mackay or some other remote port, often that seafarer will not arrive at the destination. No-one questions the disappearance or records it. It happens far more often than we would like to believe. That is why I believe this government was wrong not to accept the recommendation of the then Standing Committee on Communications, Transport and Microeconomic Reform, now known as the Standing Committee on Communications, Transport and the Arts. The committee, with a majority of government members, recommended that-and I quote: The Commonwealth provide interim financial assistance on an annual basis for approved seafarers’ welfare organisations; and Investigate the establishment and annual funding of a National Seafarers’ Welfare Network and report the findings to Parliament by June 1999. Of course, this government would not accept that recommendation. They do not accept that seafarers’ welfare organisations should operate or receive assistance in a way that is different from other welfare organisations. But these organisations are different and they have to operate differently because of their values. The government said: The Commonwealth does not believe it would be appropriate to investigate the establishment and funding of a National Seafarers Welfare Network. There you have it: a government that squanders millions on advertising to promote its own policies and spends thousands on cheap political witch-hunts of former Labor figures and a government that will give its mates contracts worth millions but will not spend a few thousand to make life more bearable, even livable, for seafarers. I have already given the shadow minister notice that, when Labor gains power at the next election, even if I am not a member of parliament, I will vigorously pursue this issue with him, or with whoever the new minister might be. This is not an expensive proposal but it is one that does have immense benefits for Australia. It will make life bearable for the often lonely, forgotten seafarers from Third World countries. It is no exaggeration to say that it could perhaps be the difference between life and death. I have seen over the years much legislation introduced concerning shipping-more covering shipping than the welfare of seafarers. Shipping in our waters in the main has improved. This legislation will help to protect the environment. It is time that we looked at more legislation to improve the lives of those who go down to the sea in ships. As the shadow minister said, it is important for Australia, as an island nation, to have a good, adequate shipping industry. It has been one of my great regrets during my time in this parliament that, under both sides of politics, we have witnessed the decline in Australian flag shipping. That is a matter of great regret and it is a matter that Australia will eventually pay a price for. I am pleased that we have seen many of the rust buckets if not totally removed from the world’s shipping lanes then at least removed from the shipping lanes around Australia. WhatI would hope to see though is the conditions for those who work on ships improved. I want to see the welfare of seafarers at such centres as the mission at Port Kembla and missions throughout Australia improved. I think there is a responsibility for governments to make a contribution to this and it would not be at a great cost. Our coastline is too precious to us to allow some of these rust buckets that trundle around the coast to continue to do so. I hope that this legislation will go some small way towards improving that and, with the amendment moved by the shadow minister, I welcome these bills before the House. to the International Maritime Conventions Legislation Amendment Bill 2001. I reiterate the member for Petrie’s surprise and express a little bit of sadness at the member for Batman’s rather erratic second half of the speech. I think we can all agree around the environmental issues and that sort of thing, but I have to reject the attack on the government.",168,Marpol On Categorisation Of Liquids Pollution By Packaged Substances And Disposal Of Gar
262,Mr Wakelin (Grey) (12.21 P.m.),"I will speak briefly on the government amendmentsWednesday, 8 August 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 29541 To come back to the purpose of the amendments to the Limitation of Liability for Maritime Claims Act 1989, the Protection of the Sea (Powers of Intervention) Act 1981 and the Protection of the Sea (Prevention of Pollution from Ships) Act 1983-the pollution prevention actit is worth noting that, in the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal, between two parties the interpretation of damage in the New South Wales act was similar to the pollution prevention act and included fair wear and tear. These government amendments intend to limit the interpretation of damage to the original intent-that is, damage as a result of an accidentmaking it clear that damage does not include deterioration, failure to maintain the ship or equipment, or defects that develop during normal operation of the ship or equipment. That seems pretty common sense and everyone I am sure would welcome that. To address the issues as discussed by the member for Batman and the member for Throsby, the Australian economy is very strong. It is said to be I think in as strong a growth mode as anywhere in the Western world and it is based on exports. We all agree about the importance of exports to our economic well-being, and exports travel mainly-certainly our bulk commodities-within our shipping fleet. back to the history. I have been around long enough now, member for Throsby, to remember the ANL debacle. There is nothing stopping investors investing in an Australian shipping industry, other than the fact that they do not believe they can make it work-and there are a whole range of reasons for that. So we are reliant on a competitive international industry. There is no impediment that I know of to people putting up their money and investing in a shipping industry other than that they do not think they can be viable and they have certain responsibilities under the Companies Act not to raise money and then go broke. Australia is left relying on an internationally competitive shipping fleet. We are well served throughout the world by a number of these companies, and that is what our Australian economy and our Australian exports very much rely on. As far as the cabotage regime goes, I understand it is exactly the same cabotage regime that was in place under the previous Labor government. So let us put that on the table as well. Australia’s performance on the waterfront has improved significantly, and that is very much welcomed by every Australian. We now have a more competitive waterfront which allows the international shipping industry to think much better of us than they did in the past. The member for Batman talked about Australia being the laughing-stock or being not well regarded. I have been around long enough to remember when Australia was the laughingstock in terms of some of its industrial practices-ships were kept tied up or they were not able to be tied up. We were the laughing-stock of the world. of history there, member for Throsby, but I would not want to indulge in that unduly because it takes two to tango. I will not be unduly distracted by that. I welcome the comment from the member for Batman that globalisation is a fact of life. If a country like Australia is to be in the business of globalisation, it will rely on exports and it will have to have efficient shipping. That is what this is all about, as well as the obvious improvements in environmental standards that are very much needed in this modern world. Going back to international respect for Australia, the member for Batman regularly mentioned East Timor in his contribution. Going into East Timor in the way that we did has probably added to Australia’s reputation more than any other act in modern history. It was high risk; we were committed to righting a wrong. That is very important. I could indulge myself and remind others of the history of this debate over the last 20 years. Australia is respected partly because of its role in East Timor-the member for Throsby has left.

266,Mr Wakelin,"I could say a bit about violence on the waterfront. There has been a bit29542 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 8 August 2001 of shame report has been much quoted. I have a high personal regard for the former minister Peter Morris and for the work that he did and his continuing commitment in this area. To rebut the issue of disease coming into this country, I remind the Main Committee that the last budget committed something like $600 million over four years to AQIS. That is an unprecedented effort by the federal government to make sure that we are better protected from disease coming into this country and threatening the export industry and any other issue of that nature in this country. To conclude, I welcome the legislation. It tidies up certain things that needed to be done as history moved on. I mentioned earlier the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal, where it was quite clear that the interpretation of damage, which could be from fair wear and tear, was totally unacceptable. I did not mention the Submarine Cables and Pipelines Protection Act 1963. There are some issues there that are dealt with in the amendment. In terms of the future for Australia, its exports and its work force-and I would like to think that includes all of us and does not depend on some narrow definition of whether you are in a union or not; I would like to think of the Australian work force as including everybody who is usefully employed, whether they be self-employed, an employer or an employee-we will continue to rely on an efficient international shipping industry. I welcome the further development of an Australian shipping fleet, if that is at all possible. I am not optimistic about that, but if there is any way it can be done viably, economically and in the best interests of Australia. I would be delighted to see it happen. I simply welcome these amendments to the bill and wish them a speedy passage. Ms O’BYRNE (Bass) (12.31 p.m.)-I am very pleased to be able to speak about the International Maritime Conventions Legislation Amendment Bill 2001. The bill before us seeks to allow the implementation of the 1996 protocol to amend the Convention on Limitation of Liability for Maritime Claims, amending the Admiralty Act 1988 and the Navigation Act 1912. This bill amends the Protection of the Sea (Powers of Intervention) Act 1981, which looks at defining the substances other than oil listing, and amends the Protection of the Sea (Prevention of Pollution from Ships) Act 1983 to implement amendments to MARPOL, change certain administrative provisions and revise offences and penalty provisions. The changes are largely facilitative and technical in nature. As the Main Committee is aware, we are supporting this bill as it is necessary to implement international conventions, and we will be supporting the amendments moved by the government in relation to the New South Wales decision regarding responsibility of shipowners and masters. To this I commend the amendment by the honourable member for Batman, who seeks to substitute the following words: ... whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House condemns the Government for its neglect of the Australian shipping industry, leaving the Australian economy, environment and community exposed to the risk of marine accidents, port pollution and infiltration via ports and the sea of deadly diseases like foot and mouth disease. The government’s lack of commitment to this industry is well documented. A failure to respond to reviews it has commissioned, a failure to recognise the real concerns regarding Australian owned ships, crew safety and employment, export dollars or environmental protection is there for all to see. The responses to both the 1997 and 1999 reports commissioned by the former minister, Mr Sharp, and the current minister, Mr Anderson, are yet to appear. Mr Anderson will not even release the most recent report for public consideration. The reason is quite obvious: that report highlights the importance of the Australian shipping industry to this country and to the economy. I note the previous speaker believes that he is committed to this. I only wish that the minister shared his position. The report also provides the government with a plan that would allow for investment in shipping to grow. That would lead to a safer fleet, more Australian based investment and, most importantly, more Australian jobs. Wednesday, 8 August 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 29543 The impact of Mr Anderson’s failure as the minister for maritime transport is becoming increasingly obvious. The Australian Shipowners Association has identified: The Australian shipping industry has contracted as a result of a lack of policy direction necessary to encourage investment in high-value capital equipment and to encourage the recruitment and training of young Australians to pursue careers in the seagoing sector of the Australian shipping industry. Since 1989 the number of Australian owned ships has almost halved. It is down to about 49 in the year 2000. Where that leaves our merchant support for Defence Force capabilities is frankly anybody’s guess. Since 1995-96, the average net annual disinvestment in Australian shipping has been $4 million compared with a net annual average investment of $292.8 million between 1989-90 and 1994-95. As I said, the responsibility for the reduction in investment in this important industry can be laid squarely at Mr Anderson’s feet. It is the Leader of the National Party, the Deputy Prime Minister, the minister for transport who I assume-with the support of the rest of his cabinet colleagues-has created a climate of uncertainty for potential investors in shipping. We are now all paying the price. There is growing community concern regarding the protection of our coastline. Coming from Tasmania, I have a specific interest in the damage that can be caused on our coastline for many reasons. We need to protect the incredible pristine coastline that we have because we have seen first-hand the damage of an oil spill in the Tamar River with the Iron Baron. Some time ago I spoke to some people in the shipping industry about their real concerns that the government does not understand how much danger our coast is in from the real threat caused by substandard ships working our coast. In that conversation we tried to highlight and identify a way to make the government understand these concerns. The suggestion was made, ‘Why not draw a picture of a dodgy, second-registered ship sitting on the Barrier Reef? Maybe then people will understand.’ That would be a nice graphic depiction-one that we hope never happens. But not two weeks later the Bunga Teratai Satu ran aground on the Great Barrier Reef and we were faced with a very real risk of a chemical spill in a world heritage listed area. Sections of the reef had to be blasted away to free the vessel and the ship’s antifouling paint-which contained tributyl-tin-had, due to the grounding, damaged coral that it is believed may take five years to return. That situation should not have occurred. It is even more distressing to think that we had been chatting about it as a possible illustration. Roger Timms, General Manager Maritime Safety and Environment Strategy at AMSA, gave an excellent synopsis of the loss of the oil tanker Erica in his address to the National Shipping Industry Conference in March this year. I will summarise his synopsis for the House: The 19,666 gross tonnage motor tanker Erica was built in Japan in 1975. Erica was registered under the Maltese flag and classed with Registro Navale Italiano. The ship completed loading some 30,800 tonnes of fuel oil at Dunkirk in France on Wednesday 8 December and sailed for Livorno in Italy that same evening. The weather conditions deteriorated and by Saturday Erica was experiencing rough seas. Earlier that afternoon the Master observed progressive listing to starboard and in an attempt to correct this ordered the deballasting of number 4 starboard segregated ballast tank. Cracks and buckling in the deck plating were also noticed. The Master decided not to continue the voyage and set course for a possible port of refuge. At around midnight Erica again developed a starboard list. By a quarter to four on Sunday morning oil in large quantities was observed escaping into the sea. Around five o’clock the side shell plating was seen to have torn away. The general alarm was sounded and evacuation began. The ship broke in two approximately 45 nautical miles off the French coast, spilling a substantial part of her cargo into the sea and causing extensive pollution. 29544 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 8 August 2001 The resulting pollution necessitated clean up on 400 kilometres of coastline, closed beaches, halted salt production, and resulted in fishing bans. Mr Timms went on to point out that the Erica had been renamed 10 times, had been classed with four different classification societies, had had a variety of owners and managers during her working life and had changed flag four times. Let me give you another example. Earlier this year a ship owned by Fourth Nordcap Shipping, under a Liberian flag and called the Direct Falcon was in Australia. Concern arose when it was suggested that this was the same Direct Falcon which, four weeks earlier, had been detained by AMSA due to communication problems and defective dampers in the engine room. On its earlier visit the ship was owned by Maritime Falcon Incorporated, was managed by Australia New Zealand Direct Line and was sailing under a Bahamas flag. In preparing for this speech I cast my eye over the AMSA web site and looked at the detention list. It made for interesting but certainly frightening reading when I looked at the serious deficiencies: defective fire pumps; defective fire dampers; inability to transmit or demonstrate MF, HF, RT or DSC; inoperable fuel oil quick closing valves; leaking fuel tanks; problems with lifeboats; defective oily water separators; deck plating wasted; cargo holds wasted; and masters incapacitated and unable to assume command. Mr Deputy Speaker Nehl, you know, because I have mentioned it many times, that I live in Launceston. That means that I live in the community that houses the Australian Maritime College, one of the world’s premier seafaring training institutions. Many people who work on our coast either train or live in my electorate. I rang a friend who has been working on the coast for many years and said, ‘Just how serious is it that a deck officer was unable to successfully conduct an online MF/HD DSC test?’ He said, ‘Not that serious at all if you don’t think the ability to push a button for three seconds is important; a button that will result in certain safety aspects.’ I cannot believe we let these people navigate our coast. We train incredibly talented and committed seafarers in Australia, and yet we allow people who cannot even operate basic equipment on a deck to work around our coasts. There is no denying that there has been a huge increase in foreign vessels on our coast. According to the Australian Shipowners Association, cargo carried in vessels issued with single voyage permits and continuing voyage permits increased by 0.7 million tonnes or 10.1 per cent to eight million tonnes in 1999-2000, a growth of 507.5 per cent compared with the standard in 1991-92. On7 March this year, in a speech to the industry, the Deputy Prime Minister said, ‘The issue of safe shipping must remain a priority,’ and, ‘Australia is an island dependent upon shipping, but this simple fact explains why this country puts such a premium on safe shipping.’ They are nice words, but unfortunately they are not backed up by a commitment to a higher quality Australian shipping industry. We have to start paying attention to what is happening around our coasts and the risks that these ‘ships of shame’ create. We are detaining and inspecting ships, but is that actually enough? The Sydney Morning Herald claimed that almost 300 ships were detained in Australian ports over an 18-month period. In that article, Mr Paddy Crumlin of the Maritime Union of Australia said that, with the authority’s limited resources, they can get aboard only a small number of ships and that the ships that they are managing to detain are only a fraction of those coming in and out of the country. It is clear that far more than an inspection regime is needed. The operation of substandard ships on the Australian coast is putting at risk not only our environment but also the very lives of seafarers. Members are all aware of the damning evidence found in the Ships of shame report in 1992, but what is more disturbing is that things have really not improved that much since then. In his speech to the APEC symposium earlier this year, Peter Morris reported that the International Commission on Shipping inquiry found that the conditions of seafarers had worsened. The commission report was called Ships, slaves and competition. The inquiry found that tens of thousands of seafarers from developing nations are exploited, abused and ill-treated. In his speech, Peter Morris said that, for many Wednesday, 8 August 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 29545 thousands of today’s international seafarers, life at sea is modern slavery and their workplace is a slave ship. The last point that I wish to make in this debate is in relation to the very real danger posed to our nation by the risk of infiltration of disease. We have seen the devastating effect of footand-mouth disease in the United Kingdom. Without an effective border control regime, this country will be exposed to such risks. Part of that regime must be the control of foreign shipping on the Australian coast. This bill is very important, but it also highlights the government’s inaction in securing a viable Australian shipping industry. It highlights the lack of concern for the welfare of both our seafarers and those who increasingly work our coast on foreign vessels, and it walks away from providing real protection for our coastlines. member for Batman, I want to focus on some aspects of shipping, the government’s undermining of the cost of Australian shippers and their ability to operate successfully against some of the people that the member for Bass quite rightly identified, and particularly on this very short-sighted single voyage permit process, which has increased, as the member for Bass said, by 507 per cent since 1992. One of the things that has surprised me about this debate is the role of the Deputy Prime Minister-the Minister for Transport and Regional Services and the Leader of the National Party-who I would have thought had the interests of agricultural exporters and the strategic interests of this country at heart. When I talk about the strategic interests, my mind goes back to one particular aspect of this that has only recently been brought to my attention in reading the history of Australian merchant shipping. I urge other members of parliament to do this too-to look at the number of merchant ships sunk by the Japanese, and indeed by German submarines, during the Second World War on the Australian coast. The record of Australian merchant shipping is a long and honourable one and, as the member for Bass said, we have some of the most highly trained seamen in the world. It is a tradition, a profession, a vocation and an industry that we should be doing everything to preserve. In fact, this government is doing the exact opposite. The increase in single voyage permits allows, as I have outlined previously in other speeches, these foreign flag-of-convenience ships-many of which are ‘ships of shame’, as the member for Bass described them-to come into Australia. It particularly arises from the failure of the minister for transport and Deputy Prime Minister, and indeed this government, to address the effect on Australian importers and exporters of the costs of stevedoring. That is an issue that goes back-and this is the principal focus of my remarks-to the very large maritime dispute that this government orchestrated. BeforeI turn to that issue, I do want to draw to your attention some overall figures on the cost of shipping, particularly our reliance on overseas owned shipping. Our reliance on overseas owned shipping lines to shift almost all of our imports and exports produced a yearly net freight bill of $A4.9 billion, overwhelmingly reflecting our shipping costs. This is well in advance of wool exports for the year of $3.9 billion. I think this country-and I am surprised members of the National Party are not more agitated about it-deludes itself by thinking it is simply a good thing that the country has a low value dollar because this helps agricultural exports. It actually costs the country an enormous amount of money for high value imports, capital goods and foreign shipping services that we are increasingly relying on with these single voyage permitted overseas shippers. The genesis of the maritime dispute a year and a half ago was the government’s view that the previous government had inadequately pursued micro-economic reform, that the docks were a major economic problem, that Australia had to force major changes in those areas and that the benefits would then be passed on to importers, exporters and shippers. Any rational analysis of what has happened since the waterfront dispute shows that this is very far from the case. Unfortunately, the government’s ‘amen corner’ in the media, the so-called ‘dry’ eco-",171,Marpol On Categorisation Of Liquids Pollution By Packaged Substances And Disposal Of Gar
267,Mr Danby (Melbourne Ports) (12.42 P.m.),"In supporting the amendment moved by the29546 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 8 August 2001 nomic analysts-the Paddy McGuinnesses, the Quadrant magazines and the Alan Woodses of this world-have failed to evaluate what has happened since. But this is the basic picture. When the decision was made to cause the maritime dispute, Lang Corporation’s share price stood at $1.60. The benefit of waterfront reform was to be passed on by Lang and P&O to Australian shippers to importers and exporters. Indeed, I asked the Deputy Prime Minister, prior to his visit to London where he was going to meet Lord Stirling of P&O, that he pass on to Lord Stirling the government’s concern that these shipping costs had, in fact, not been lowered, and that stevedoring charges remained as high as ever. It seems to me, and to any person who has evaluated what has happened since, that the only people to have benefited from so called waterfront reform are the Lang Corporation, whose share price has now increased to about $11. The last time. I looked I think it was about $10.85. It has been up as high as $13.50. No-one is concerned about the fact that an individual company is prospering, but the Australian taxpayers, through this parliament, have paid for a massive number of redundancies as a result of this dispute on the Australian wharves. In Melbourne, I know, the number of people who operate the docks in my electorate has been halved. There were probably more than 1,200 full-time people; there are something over 600 now. The crane rate lift-about which the Deputy Prime Minister in one of his performances just before the winter break was exultant, saying that this increase in productivity was a wonderful government achievement-is now about 25 container boxes per hour, which is about the international benchmark that Australia wanted to get to. We have half the work force, we have the box rate at the level that it is and we have Patrick’s and P&O’s redundancies paid for by the Australian taxpayer-hundreds of millions of dollars. What is the benefit for the Australian people? None. There have been no decreases in stevedoring charges. This is something that should particularly concern the National Party, particularly concern agricultural exporters and particularly concern people in business. I get approached all the time by people in business who are importers or exporters and who complain about the fact that this government has been totally inadequate in representing their interests and in seeing that the so-called benefits of micro-economic reform trickle down to them. The government gets up and makes a great deal, as the Deputy Prime Minister did, about productivity benefits to Australia. It is true that there have been massive productivity gains on the Australian waterfront. This is largely due to some of the very fine people who work there, who are as skilled as some of our shippers in their industry. But, unfortunately, the benefit has gone to Patrick’s and P&O’s bottom line. Again, no-one is against the success of individual companies, but when we paid for all of these redundancies, when this government caused this massive industrial disruption, we expected that these benefits would be passed to the Australian people. They simply have not been. Lang Corporation, in its last six-monthly profit report, showed that its operating profit after tax increased 25 per cent to $29 million, earnings per share increased 19 per cent to 18.5c and the company had over $300 million cash on hand. It is the responsibility of this government, of the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, the Deputy Prime Minister, to say to Mr Corrigan and to P&O that the benefits of waterfront reform should be passed on to the Australian people. It is a completely inadequate performance by the member for Gwydir to say that productivity has increased on Australian waterfronts, and that we have faster, more regular turnarounds. There are the bigger ships that are turning around faster. The shipping lines tell us that because the terminals turning around the ships faster have to pay more to the stevedores they therefore pass these costs on to the exporters. Mr Donges, the President of the National Farmers Federation, is one of those in the federation who were foolish enough to be right behind the massive dispute two years ago but who now are having second thoughts. The federation engineered that dispute with the help of the government’s hatred of the union movement-under the then minister, the member for Flinders, who is retiring-but Mr Donges now Wednesday, 8 August 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 29547 says of the waterfront reform which the National Farmers Federation had totally backed and had hoped would benefit farmers: We believe the level of productivity (on the waterfront) will enable more farmers to compete on an even keel for lucrative international markets. Butand these words are very significantwe have to ensure that the savings from increased productivity flow on to farmers and other port users as soon as possible. In other words, they are not flowing on to farmers or exporters at all at the moment. The government needs to send the Deputy Prime Minister and transport minister back to do a remedial economics course. There is no point in having a productivity benefit, paid for partially by the Australian taxpayer through redundancies, if we do not have it passed on to the Australian people via exporters, importers and shippers. Members of this government can ring any exporter or importer, anyone from the peak shippers association, from shipping lines, and they will tell you that this minister’s claims about commercial-in-confidence-that they cannot reveal these dread secrets to the Deputy Prime Minister, the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, about how much it costs to ship a container from here to Seoul or Tokyo or any other port and back-are absolute nonsense. We know that these costs have not decreased but, in fact, have increased in some states and in some cases. For the benefit of the Australian shipping industry, we need this government to say, as I am sure the next Beazley government will say to the stevedoring firms, ‘You’ve had the benefit of redundancies. You’ve had the benefit of higher productivity. Now lower your rates and pass on the benefits of micro-economic reform to the Australian people and let the Australian shipping industry prosper.’ Main Committee adjourned at 12.55 p.m.
