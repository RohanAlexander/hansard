I applaud that. I think that is exactly what the honourable member for Murray and also, we are talking about on this side. In the debate generally, to the Opposition's aviation policy on privatisation versus public ownership, we are which, as he has indicated, did fall into the hands of the Minister for Aviation( Mr Peter trying to ensure that Australian ownership remains.

Let us strip away some of the myths about this and get down to facts. I think it important that What greatly concerns me in this debate is we do that.

The Government has essentially been we are experiencing at present'. So much theresaying three things. It has been saying, first of fore for the great canard of the Treasurer· that all, that all of our problems, or the great bulk the situation is all due to this unprecedented, of them, are due to externally imposed conexternally imposed problem. straints via a reduction in our terms of trade The second great weakness of the Governthat this country has never before had to grapple ment's argument of the last six months lies in its with. The Treasurer repeated that argument in saying: 'We have had a bit of a problem, but all Question Time today. The great pity is that he of the adjustments have been made. Nothing really does believe-and some of his followers more has to be done. It is all starting to work. also believe-some of the nonsense he peddles Sit back and relax and everything will start to about the terms of trade. turn around in the first six months of next year'. It is simply not true for the Treasurer to run We say on this side of the House that not only around arguing that we have had a decline in were the adjustments made too late, but they our terms of trade the like of which has never were too little. The adjustments have not been before been experienced. Today he repeated it. adequate, and the reason why we talk about He said that the falls in the 1970s were nowhere interest rates is that we in this country are being near what they have been over the last 18 burdened by an intolerably high level of interest months. I remind the Treasurer that in the June rates. The farming sector is being destroyed by quarter of 1971 there was a 14.5 per cent decline debt at present. The Minister for Housing and in the terms of trade. I remind him that the Construction ( Mr West) has talked about home terms of trade fell by 11 per cent in the March loans. Does he have any idea of the interest rate quarter of 1975. I remind him that they fell by burden of single income families in this country 13.6 per cent to the December quarter of 1977, trying to raise two or three children on $18,000 right in the middle of the seven-year term of the a year? Does he have any idea of what interest Fraser Government. In fact, that fall exceeded rates are doing to families in seats such as Barthe fall in the terms of trade of 13.3 per cent to ton, Dunkley, Chisholm and all of those other the June quarter of 1986. So for the Treasurer marginal Labor seats? I can tell him that the to run around saying that poor little Paul has honourable members for those seats have some had to put up with a fall in the terms of trade idea of what is happening. But the reason we that no other Treasurer in this country has had to grapple with is simply not true. are suffering these high interest rates is that the Government's action was too little and it was The second part of the disinformation he too late. spreads about the terms of trade is that all of a sudden this situation was sprung upon us; that All of the adjustments have not been made. everything was going marvellously until about The Government faces an horrendous Budget May of this year, then, all of a sudden, out of problem next year. It did not exercise real rethe night came these disastrous unprecedented straint. The Treasurer runs around talking about terms of trade. He knows better than anybody leather and whips. I saw him on television this else in the Parliament that his own Department morning talking about all the discipline he has warned him and the nation in the Budget Papers exercised. He is the biggest spending Treasurer accompanying the 1985 Budget. He also knows that this country has seen; yet he talks about that his Government, his Department and the discipline. The reality is that he faces an horrenMinister for Employment and Industrial Reladous Budget problem next year, and there are tions ( Mr Willis) wilfully misled the Australian four reasons for this.

Yet traps changes.
