Whilst The Present Reciprocal Tariff Treaty With South Africa Continues In Force, The Alterations Proposed In The Tariff Schedule Now Under Consideration By The House Will Have No More Effect Than Did Those Which Were Proposed In The Tariff Schedule Passed In 1922, Can The Minister For Trade And Customs Inform The House Whether The South African Reciprocal Tariff Treaty Will Be Can","celled ? member's promises are correct; but the Government has decided to cancel the treaty with South Africa he has referred to, which, I think, is dated so long ago as 1906. A bill for this purpose has been prepared, and if the state of public business permits, it may be passed this week.

It is certainly the desire and object of the Government to obtain further assistance of that character. While the House is sitting as at present, it is very difficult indeed, as the honourable inember will understand, to do very much work on the subject. But when the House rises it is intended to obtain the assistance of all sections of the community. (Hon.

I am informed that the industry only requires to be established on a firm footing, and then w i ll be able tc compete successfully with importations, and prices will f a l l. If I am not permitted to move an amendment to increase the duty, I request the Minister to favourably consider the request that I have made on behalf of tbe growers. I support the request made by the honourable member for Corio( Mr Lister). This industry should certainly receive assistance from the Government. If the honourable member for Corio has evidence that 10-oz. tins of asparagus "" t i p s "" are being dumped at the present time, he shouid bring the facts under the notice of the Minister, so that the anti-dumping legislation may be brought into operation against such imports. Honourable members miist recognize, however, that no matter how high the duty on asparagus, unless the Australian canner produces an equally good article the imported commodity will bold the market. Much of tbe asparagus that we see for sale in the shops and streets of Melbourne is not up to the Californian standard. member tried A.,T.C. asparagus? of the canned article. The asparagus grown on the Macquarie flats is equal to the best that is imported. It is marketed in a way that is a credit to the grower, and always brings the highest prices in the Sydney market. The Australian grower is producing, under conditions which involve heavier costs than are borne by his foreign competitors, and, therefore, he is entitled to assistance from the tariff.' The growing of asparagus entails a great deal of labour, and this committee would be well advised to grant additional assistance to the canners. If they produce an article of the same quality as the imported asparagus, they will find a profitable market; if the quality is not what it should be, the public; will still pay more for the foreign commodity. I heartily endorse the request of the honourable member for Corio. There is a big opportunity for Australian producers of asparagus. It is unfortunate that at big public banquets, even in this building, we have to place before our guests Californian asparagus. Considerable areas of this country are. capable of producing asparagus of the very best quality, and it is a pity that the local market is not supplied by the Australian growers and canners. As the honourable member for Corio pointed out, the encouragement of asparagus canning will give increased employment in t in factories and printing and lithographic establishments. Most honourable members have a bed of asparagus in the kitchen garden, and know what a delectable article it is. Already considerable sums of money have been invested in the asparagusgrowing industry, and with the splendid soil available in Australia, there is no reason why its production should not extend very rapidly. As stated by the honourable member for Corio( Mr Lister), the Californian product which comes in to competition with the Australian article, is handled by black labour. In California, many Asiatics have obtained large areas of land which they have planted with asparagus, and, in view of the unfair competition with which the Australian producers have to contend, there is no reason why a fairly heavy the honourable duty should not be imposed in order to keep this trade in the hands of our I am not speaking people. Asi t is not competent for a member to move for an increase in duty, I trust that, in view of the general support accorded to the honourable member for Corio, the Minister w ill amend the schedule in the direction suggested. I believe that what the honourable member, for Maribyrnong ( Mr Fenton) bas said is quite right, and, if the statements of the honourable member for Corio( Mr Lister), and those who have supported him, are correct, there can be no reason why this industry should not be further protected. The sample tins produced by the honourable member for Corio, particularly the two smaller, make it obvious that the Californian producers are attempting to evade duty by reducing the length of the asparagus stalks. Asparagus has to be eaten much like maccaronij but how it can be so eaten when only the tips are served, I do not know. One reason that disposes me to favour the local product is that asparagus has to be picked by hand, and, as the imported product is handled in",19,Tariff Customs And Exci Se Duties

Consequently, I prefer asparagus picked by white men. In the electorate of the honourable member for Corio, and in other parts of Australia, asparagus can be grown which will compare favourably with that produced in any other part of the world. By increasing the duty we shall be giving encouragement to an Australian industry, ancl an emphatic and most complete reply to the efforts of the Californian producers. propose to support the very modest request of the honourable member for Corio. I have gone carefully into this matter, particularly in regard to the suggestion that the duty on the smaller tins of asparagus should be raised. I believe that a deliberate attempt is being made by the Californian producers to evade the payment of duty. This can be confirmed by an examination of the specimen tins submitted this morning by the honourable member for Corio. I support the suggestion of the honourable member for the reasons for which I have always supported an embargo on sugar and bananas grown by coloured labour. It is unreasonable to allow the Californian product, fully 90 per cent, of which is cultivated by Chinese, Japanese, and Hindus, to compete with the Australian article. During the last Parliament I asked the Minister for Agriculture in New South Wales if asparagus was being canned at the Government cannery at Leeton. Six months later the Minister informed me that the work had been undertaken and a trial pack produced, but that they were handicapped in having to compete with the Californian' asparagus, which was shipped to Australia in small tins, and at a price with which the Australian canners could not compete."" I understand that the wages costs in cultivating asparagus amount to approximately £85 per acre. As Australians can produce almost anything from the land, there does not appear to be any valid reason why we should be importing a vegetable of this type when it has been clearly shown that it can be successfully grown in this country. I trust that the Minister will agree to an increased duty, to the extent indicated, as I understand that if a higher rate is imposed the AustraUan producers will not attempt in any' way to increase the present prices. trust the Minister( Mr Pratten) will give favorable consideration to the suggestion of the honourable member for Corio( Mr Lister). If he is favorable to the proposed increase, he should inform the committee and thus save time, because I am quite satisfied that an overwhelming majority is in favour of higher duties. I strongly support the request of the honourable member for Corio, as I consider the present duty altogether inadequate. It is a disgrace to Australia that we have to obtain supplies of asparagus from California. I remember the day when our warehouses were fully stocked with Californian fruits, and when consumers, in what might be termed the best homes, refused to eat Australian canned fruit. We' have, however, fortunately passed that stage, and the Australian canned frui t is now very largely used in preference to the imported article. Any honourable member who has sampled the A.J.C. brand of asparagus must admit that it is equal, if not superior, to the imported product. In these circumstances it is ridiculous to suggest that we should depend on California for our supplies. I trust that the Government will further support this primary industry, and enable Australian growers to place larger supplies on the market than they have been able to do in the past owing to the inadequate duty imposed. Trade and Customs) [11.57] -In view of the practically unanimous desire of the committee that a more effective duty should be imposed, I ask the committee to postpone consideration of this item to enable the suggested amendment of the honourable member for Corio to be examined, with a view to meeting the wish of the committee in a practical way.

45,Mr Pratten (Martin,"Minister for: -Honorabl e members will notice that an increased duty is proposed on maize. In the 1921 tariff the British preferential duty on this commodity was Is. 6d. per central, and when this was imposed it was the belief of those engaged in the growing of maize that they would be protected to the extent of 3s. per central, but owing, to a reciprocal trade agreement with South .Africa, it was found that South African maize could be imported under a duty of Is. per central. The Minister( Mr Pratten) has not told us what the Government proposes to do in regard to' the agreement with South Africa. Isi t proposed to denounce the treaty? MrJ .

If it is denounced the duty on maize will be 3s. 6d. arrangement is made by which SouthA f r i ca w ill get the benefit of the British preference. suggest, and what the conference of the Chamber of Manufactures asks, is that if and when the Trade Treaty with.

To my knowledge two shipments came in last season. two came in . ments threatened to destroy the maize industry in Australia. .According to the sworn evidence of maize-growers, it costs 4s. lOd. per bushel to produce maize. The maize-growers at Atherton say that they cannot grow it at that price, and that applies to the growers in the greater part of Queensland. Althoughi t may be possible for maize-growers in Victoria to grow it profitably at less than 4s. lOd. per bushel, room should be allowed for a reasonable profit to be made. Buti f maize rises above 6s/ 6d. per bushel it does not pay the local manufacturers to use it to make maize products, and the American manufacturers, who use maize grown by cheap foreign labour, are able to compete successfully against them in the local market. I presume that negotiations have taken place, or are taking place, for the denouncing of the South African Trade Treaty. If no satisfactory reciprocal treaty is made which will in itself overcome the difficulty that I have outlined, w ill the Minister give us an assurance that the whole matter will be referred to the Tariff Board immediately, so that our secondary industries will be certain of adequate protection to ensure their stability and permanence? It is necessary to protect, not only tbe maizegrower against importations from South Africa, but. also the local manufacturers, who use maize to produce glucose, starch, cornflour, and other maize products, against manufacturers abroad who use That maize grown by black labour. Thousands of people are employed in the maize-using secondary industries in Australia, and tens of thousands of pounds of capital have been invested in them. I am sure that tbe Minister will see that, should circumstances arise which force the price of maize up in Australia, and so make it impossible for the local manufacturers to use it profitably, it is only logical and just that there should be a readjustment of the duty which would enable them to carry on their businesses as usual. pleased to hear the Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Pratten) say that steps were being taken to denounce the Trade Treaty with South Africa, but I was somewhat alarmed to hear the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr. Hughes) suggest that it was possible that a reciprocal agreement might be made with South Africa which would give a preference to South African maize grown by black labour. We should make it i m possible for maize grown by black labour in South Africa to compete with maize grown by white labour in Australia. As the right honourable member for North Sydney pointed out, the natural sequence to protecting our maize-grower3 is protecting the manufacturers who use locallygrown maize in our secondary industries. I should like the Ministerf or Trade and Customs to give us an assurance that he will .earnestly consider the whole matter. If large quantities of maize are imported to Australia from South Africa, there is no doubt whatever that the local maize growers will be ruined.

I agree with the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) that the natural corollary to protecting the local maize-grower against importations from cheap labour countries abroad, is protecting the local manufacturers of maize products against manufacturers from abroad who use maize grown by cheap labour. There is a very large factory making maize products in my constituency, and it would do honourable members good to pay it a visit to see the first class products that it manufactures. developing secondary industries if the primary industries must be destroyed to do so? that our primary and secondary industries must work hand in hand; and that the development of primary industries in Australia is of little use without tbe development of secondary industries, and vice versa. I do not trouble the M in i ster for Trade and Customs very often, but I have had necessity to bring under his notice the fact that a good deal of foreign glucose manufactured by black labour, and made from maize grown by black labour, is being imported. ' I am sure that neither Parliament nor the Minister himseTf stands for that kind of thing. I agree, also with the honourable member for Herbert (Dr. Nott) that no provision should be made in any new trade treaty that may be arranged w it h SouthA f r i c a for a preference for South African maize grown by black labour. There should be an embargo on its i m portation. with the embargo policy. South Africa takes a lot of our wheat and flour. enough to protect our secondary industries against black labour products.

Surely honourable members who represent maize-growers desire to protect their constituents. I hope that the Minister will make a statement to the effect that adequate protection will be afforded both our primary and secondary maize industries. I agree that our maize-growers should be protected against importations from countries with cheap labour conditions; but at the same time it must be remembered that in drought periods in Australia maize is one of our best standbys. Withouti t we should lose thousands more head of stock. In such periods I and other honourable members have known maize to be 10s. 6d. a bushel; and even at that price the supplies were inadequate. If the wonderfully beneficial rains we have just had throughout Australia had held off for another six weeks, I venture to say that maize would have been 10s. a bushel. We should be careful that the duty on foreign-grown maize is not so heavy that in 'drought times it will be impossible, on the score of expense, for our pastoralists and farmers to import it . Consideration for a few moments of what would happen if we were not able to obtain maize in a serious drought period, would compel even the most ardent protectionist to agree to the abandonment of the duty on it during such a period. member suggest that a sliding scale to suit circumstances could be administered ? ing information.

Why not apply the same policy to other products? attention to a difficulty that will surely arise in the futurea difficulty which had not been mentioned before I roseand, in directing attention to ""it, I am surely doing no more than my duty. If it is within the power of the right honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr in principle. Surely, in our collective Watt), or the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes), to provide a solution, the committee is no doubt ready to listen to them. I support the views of the honourable member for Macquarie ( Mr Manning), who has raised a very important point. 1 admit that the interjections of the Otherwise many local right honourable member for Balaclava, and the right honourable member for North Sydney, are pertinent, but the point raised by the honourable member for Macquarie, notwithstanding the difficulties surrounding it, must be considered. Two figures were mentioned in relation to the cost of growing maize. 4s. lOd. was stated as the cost of growI t is essential to the coning maize, and the right honourable member for North Sydney mentioned 6s. 6d. facturers contended that when the price of maize rose above 6s. 6d., they could not compete with foreign manufacturers cf maize products. maize, by drought or other conditions, increases to 6s. 6d., the maize-growers receive well above the cost of production. Is it not anomalous, in those circumstances, to impose a heavy duty ? The value of maize as a stock fodder in times of drought should be taken into consideration. member admit that the stock-raiser's extremity is the fodder-grower's opportunity ? honourable member for Balaclava see that he is shifting his ground when he talks like that? The primary object of imposing a duty on maize is to protect maize-growers against maize grown by black labour in South Africa. Nowi t is suggested that the duty is to be used, not as a protection against the blackgrown maize of South Africa, but to enable the maize-growers of Australia to exploit their fellow primary producers in this country. In 1914, the duty upon wheat was suspended in the interests of the people of this country. I hesitate to give to any Minister the power to suspend duties imposed by the Parliament I strongly protested the other evening against the imposition of a duty, under the Industries Preservation Act, on wire netting. Such a duty is wrong wisdom, we can find a way of solving this difficulty. When the price of maize rises to 6s. 6d. or 7s. a bushel, provision ought to be made for suspending the whole or part of the duty. If the price of maize goes up to 10s., and we have millions of stock dying for want of fodder, and maize that would save them",23,Tariff Customs And Exci Se Duties

The right honourable member's remedy when the price rises above 6s. 6d. is not to remove the duty, but to impose additional duties to protect the secondary industries. Mt. HUGHES -The honourable member is looking at it from a different standpoint from that which I adopted. I was considering the necessity for doing justice to both the industries The honourable member is suggesting that maize should be singled out, but why should not the principle be applied generally? clear in other industries as it is, to my mind, in this one, I shall be prepared to consider the general adoption of the principle. If we had a duty upon, say, oats from New Zealand, and there was a serious drought in this country, and valuable stock were dying, when the price of oats rose above 5s. it would be obviously wrong to continue the duty. I speak as an oat-grower. I hope the Minister will give careful consideration to this matter. It is difficult for me, or the honourable member for Macquarie, to propose a remedy. Some honourable members appear to overlook one serious fact. Unless maize growers have a definite guarantee of adequate protection, they must go out of business in the tropical and sub-tropical parts of Queensland, where wages are bigh, and other disabilities have to be overcome. When inquiries were made some time ago it was found . that freight from Durban. South Africa, to Melbourne was 22 s. 6d. a ton, while from Queensland to Melbourne it was 40s. a ton. found that maize was carried by rail to Durban from other parts of South Africa at a lower rate when it was destined for export than when it was to be sold for local consumption. Those facts place the Australian grower at a serious disadvantage, and there is also the very low black-labour wage to be considered. Maize will not continue to be grown here unless the growers know that they can sell it at a profit. That profit Some provision can only be assured to them by adequate protection, which has not been provided in the past. I know of a large number The sugof growers who have gone out of this business, and of others who are considering going out of it. If a definite protective duty is imposed, so as to ensure the grower a profitable price, the production of maize will increase; but, failing such aguarantee, the industry in Queensland will, to a large extent, collapse. I have ' been informed that in Victoria maize lands cost from £80 to £100 per acre, and that many of the maize-growers are returned soldiers. It is impossible, with land at such a price, to compete against the black-grown maize of other parts of the world. I , therefore, appeal to honourable members to support the higher duties on maize, and I appeal to the Minister not to give, under any circumstances, a preference to South African maize over maize from other countries. As the representative of adistrict where a great quantity of maize is grown, I am aware of the difficulties under which maize-growers have been labouring for years. To my knowledge, many farmers have gone out of the industry because they have been unable to make it pay. They found that they could not compete with the cheaply-grown maize imported from South Africa. The protection provided in the past has not been effective. I strongly urge the Minister to insist upon the duties set out in tbe schedule. The maize-growing industry is of great importance to Australia. In 1923-4 it was worth £641,219 in Queensland, £1,078,460 a year in New South Wales, £329,564 a year in Victoria, £443 a year in South Australia, and £320 in Western Australia, making a total of £2,050,006 a year for the whole of Australia.

South Africa provides the bulk of our requirements. The net imports for the year 1923-4 amounted to 2,534,000 bushels, of a value of £505,000. It should be our aim to make it possible for those who are engaged in maize-growing to supply the whole of Australia's requirements. The granting of adequate protection would have that effect. I strongly oppose preferential treatment to South Africa. I represent a number of maize-growers, hut I take a broad view of these matters. I cannot understand the inconsistency of some honourable members of the Country party, who desire to raise the protection on potatoes from £1 to £4 a ton, but, because the farmers in their electorates do not grow maize, wish to import that commodity from South Africa, where it is grown by black labour. That has been a characteristic of the Country party for years. Its narrow outlook prevented it from making any progress at the recent elections.

I was able to prove that in the only year in which the duty would'have benefited Australia-1914^-it was removed. Every bushel of wheat that I grew in that year cost me £3 10s., but, in tbe interests of the consumers, it was commandeered at 8s. 6d. a bushel, whilst wheat from the Argentine was brought to Australia at a cost of 12s. 6d. a bushel.

As a matter of fact, when stock are dying there is a dearth in the supply of maize and other fodders. member consider human foods as well as stock foods? human foods could be dealt with in"" the same manner.

It was made many years ago in 1906--and its effect became so pronounced that in 1921 it was found necessary to introduce a considerably in creased tariff. The effect of the"" 1921 tariff, however, was nullified by the treaty w i th South Africa. The present M in ister is a man of foresight and sagacity, but his outstanding virtue is that of courage.

When negotiations are resumed for a treaty with South AfricaI hope that the Minister w ill keep prominently before him the fact that in Australia maize is grown by white men, whilst in South Africai t is grown by black labour. A result of the agreement that the M in ister has announced is to be annulled was the importation of a large quantity of black-grown maize. I hope that the AusThe position is tralian producers w ill be given this measure of protection.

The Gippsland maize-growers were very modest when they put their case before the Tariff Board. They suggested a British preferential tariff of 2s. 6d. per central. Honourable members may wonder why there should be any British preferential tariff at all, because maize is not commercially grown in Great Britain. The Gippsland maize-growers desired to be fair to other primary industries, and wished the Commonwealth Government to be in a position to bargain with South Africai f necessary, by giving South African exporters favorable treatment under the preferential column if they, in t u r n , would treat Australian exporters of primary products similarly.

Eventually the regulations were tightened up, and the Australian industry relieved. In seasons of drought the Government has f u l l authority to come to the assistance of secondary industries that depend on an adequate supply of primary products. The Government has intervened on several occasions when our secondary industries have been in serious difficulties owing to the extraordinary high prices demanded for the local supplies of the raw product.

Under the protection afforded by this item it should be possible to build up another important industry in Australia. have been endeavouring to ascertain what the debate is about. I understood that the item was actually passed when the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes), with the consent of the committee, was permitted to refer to it again, and that be mentioned that cornflour and similar products constituted the raw material of certain secondary industries. Ho fears evidently that the duty .may'lead to an increase in the price of those raw products. I remind him that the Government has power to deal with any situation that may arise. Prior to federation New South Wales had a duty on wheat. When there was a shortage, and the entire production was required for home consumption, the farmers became socialists, and requested the Government to permit the importation of seed wheat and rebate the duty. The same course could be taken by the Government in respect of the duty Under a imposed on maize under this item if the need arose, and I am sure that the responsible Minister would have the approval of Parliament. The right honourable member for North Sydney, as Attorney General of the best Federal Ministry that Australia has had, on one occasion in our party room declared that no law which threatened the interests of the people should be tolerated. When there was a threatened shortage of butter in Australia, the government of the day placed an embargo upon its exportation until the requirements of the people were satisfied. Similarly, if the prices of the raw products mentioned by the right honourable member for North Sydney soared to such heights as to jeopardize certain secondary industries, the Minister would have power to suspend the we duty and allow maize to be imported.

If we are going to impose a duty of 3s. 6d. per central on maize imported from South Africa, the increase on the existing duty will be enormous.

If there is much of that kind of talk we shall have reprisals. We may find that our wheat, flour, and other products will not be accepted by South Africa. We need to extend our markets.

I should very much like to see the maize-growing industry assisted, but not as the Government has assisted the sugar industry, by placing an embargo upon its import. If the placing of embargoes upon imports is to be the next demand of our primary and secondary producers, I do not know where -we shall end. I know of nothing that has been more detrimental to Australia than the embargo on the importation of sugar. I do not agree with such a policy at all.

I stand for the encouragement of secondary as well as of primary industries. I recognize that those engaged in the secondary industries possess the advantage of being able to pass on extra costs of production. That does not apply to the primary industries. Because of the passing on of extra costs those engaged in the primary industries are called upon to pay higher prices for clothing, foodstuffs, and agricultural implements and machinery. It is clear from this that the secondary industries are receiving considerable assistance and backing from the primary industries. The primary industries are carried on in the more sparsely settled parts of the country.

Very difthe problem of the manufacturer who grower produces from maize such commodities as glucose, cornflour, starch, and maizena.

Were it not for the Francis. maize-growers, what would be the position of our pastoralists? They would be compelled to import all the maize that they need for feeding starving stock. The price of all commodities is regulated by the law of supply and demand, and the maize-grower of Australia is quite willing to bear with present conditions so long as he is not compelled to compete with imported maize. We owe a good deal to those who take up holdings in virgin scrub, because an immense amount of work is necessary before they are able to obtain a profitable return for their labours. I would welcome the repeal of the reciprocal treaty with South Africa made in 1906, and I hope that this will soon be an accomplished fact.

This will not be an unfriendly act, because the South African Government has already received notice from this Government that it proposes to abrogate the present treaty, which has caused complications in many directions, and to negotiate for a new reciprocal treaty.

Therefore, the position to-day is not as it was in 1906. The point raised by the right honourable member for North Sydney( M t . Hughes) is obvious. Any complaints or applications by manufacturers can be investigated and reported upon by the Tariff Board. The duty on glucose is already under review, but no further applications in regard to maize products have yet reached me. If such applications are made, they w ill receive that prompt and business-like attention that the department endeavours to give As the in all cases. application has been made, but I assure the Minister that the Association of Manufacturers, while content with the present rate of duty, point out that, if it results in increasing the price of maize to 7s. a bushel, they w ill not be able to carry on. w ill be met when it arises.

But even after tlie honourable members who are opposed to these duties are obliged by hard facts to admit that we can make cotton tweed here, they argue that we cannot make it in sufficient quantities to. supply all our requirements, and that the British importers desire that we shall suspend the duties unti l we are able to do so. I say,' unhesitatingly, [76] that we can make all the cotton tweed we need. Seeing that the Government proposes, under the very first paragraph of the first sub-item before us, to give a clear The second 15 per cent, preference to British manufacturers, I repudiate, w it h some indignation, the suggestion that the tariff is antagonistic to British manufacturers. This one preference, as a matter of fact, will The cotton industry is the greatest in the world. We are beginning to grow cotton in Australia, and although great developvided these duties are passed. I am prepared to to the House the report of the, Tariff Board on this point? laid on the table of the House, and distributed to honourable members, and they may inform their minds as to its contents if they desire to do so.

But I am backed up by the experience gained in 27 years' participation in the' soft goods trade. In case any honourable member with that suspicious mind .which seems to be the peculiar characteristic of the politician, thinks that I have an axe to grind, let me say that I am not in any way connected with the trade at present. I recently disposed of the whole' of my business interests, and as it was a cash transaction I am not interested in the matter even to the extent' that I might be if tbere were money owing to me on it .

144,Mr Parsons (Angas) [3.34],"I emMinister for Trade and Customs( MrP r a t this during our general debate on the ten) on this item, and I wish to gay, in the most cordial spirit, that I believe that he is absolutely sincere in the views that he has expressed; and I ask him to credit me with equal sincerity. I am actuated, in offering my criticism of the item, by the single desire to do the very best in the interests as a whole. . It is not sufficient that the Ministers' intentions should be good, for, as we are frequently reminded, the road to hell is paved with good intentions. Good intentions do not necessarily make good arguments. I warn honourable members that disaster is likely to overtake Australia if she persists in imposing these it would lead to development in that extremely high duties on imported goods. Earlyi n the nineties of the last century the United States of America went tariff mad, and, as the result, the manufacturing industries of the country were almost ruined. There followed such a tremendous reversal of public opinion on fiscal issues that the extreme tariffists were routed. practice of imposing unnecessary and almost unbearable duties on the things that our primary producers and people generally must have, there w ill be a simiprohibitive tariff, and set to work lar revulsion of feeling in this country. of talk 40 years ago. to sanction the imposition of such an extraordinarily heavy duty on cotton tweed? The altogether wrong idea seems to be prevalent in some quarters that cotton tweeds are being used generally instead of cheap woollen tweeds. Any one with experience in the wholesale or retail soft goods business will know that nothing could be further from the truth . Cotton tweeds, as a matter of fact, fill a distinct and very useful need. Not so long ago I asked the general manager of one of our most important and flourishing woollen mills, which does not require any-increased duty to enable it to compete with foreign importations, how his business would be affected by these, heavy duties on cotton tweeds. He said that it would not be affected at all, and added that one might just as reasonably compare cotton tweeds with woollen tweeds, as galvanized iron with barbed wire. That gentleman has spent his lifetime in the woollen industry. The proposed duty is not protective, but absolutely prohibitive. The Minister was not prepared to admit schedule, but I am glad to say that be has learnt at least so much from tbe speeches that have been made. I venture to say, with the greatest respect, that if he had had the long experience that I have had in the soft goods business, he would realize how unnecessary and useof Australia less this duty must be. It cannot achieve his object; it can only force our people to pay more than they need pay for the cotton tweeds that they require. A good deal has been said about the desirableness of ratifyin g this duty in order that our Australian textile industry may be developed. If I thought for a moment that direction for the good of the whole community, I should heartily support it ; but in my opinion its sole effect will be to put a good deal more money into the pockets of a few already wealthy companies, at the expense of the general community. If we persist in our present goods in Australia, and we are doing so. thing here-a t a price. A little country town might surround itself' with a to make its motor cars, clothing, machinery, and everything else that it required. I have no doubt that it would succeed, but at what a price! I do not deny that we can make everything, and grow everything, in Australia, but the question is whether we can afford to do so. ing to place a tariff round a little town, but round the whole of Australia. in principle, exactly. In spite of everything that has been said, and that can be said to the contrary, I deny that we can economically produce cotton tweeds in Australia. We have been told that the mill-owners who are prepared to take up this industry are great patriots. Some of us had an illustration of their patriotism a few years ago, when it was almost impossible to import textiles. They supplied us with their manufactures, and if any trader complained of their poor appearance, unsatisfactory wearing qualities, bagginess, or anything else, he was told "" You may take them or leave them.

151,Mr Mathews,"The importers saidbetween the cotton and woollen industry in Australia, as the honourable member for out in speaking on the matter some little time ago, is that one is a key industry and the other is quite undeveloped. No one would be more delighted than I if we could grow in Australia all the raw cotton that we need; but I doubt whether we shall be able to do so for many years to .come. In fact, I think it w ill be impossible until, in the process of evolution, the natives in Egypt, and other countries, who work for a few pence a day, and live on the. smell of an oil rag, so to speak, come to adopt more nearly our standards of living. If we are to be compelled to buy Australian-made cotton tweed made preference, to the imported article-and by that I mean the British cloth--it beggars my power to estimate the price that we shall be obliged to pay for it . A good deal has been said about the working man and his cotton tweed trousers. May I point out that the farmer, as well as the man.in the city, is a working man. Having had two years' experience on the land, and being still interested, to ""a small extent, in primary production, I know hew useful cotton tweed is. I often have to get into a pair of cotton tweed trousers myself, and do a bit of hard work, and I know how useful it is for boys' wear. I have only one boy, but he has .demonstrated again, ""how rapidly the seat of. a pair of trousers may be worn out. The',increase in the cost of living will have most effect on those with large families of boys. The employees in secondary industries can view this proposal without alarm, because they can recoup themselves, by demanding increased wages. They are able to pass the impost on, but the primary producers, the dairymenparticularly, cannot do that. Their. position will be precarious indeed. They will have to cometo the Government and ask for more bounties to enable them. to carry on their industries Those who support this policy are like the cat, pourtrayed in many cartoons, which chases its tail at such a high velocity that, by centrifugal force, its brains fly out. tories'ih this country, even in 'the city of Melbourne, are closing down or working only short time because of the duties in this schedule. In proof of that statement. I submit the following letters: 1 and 3 Langridge-street, Collingwood, Melbourne, 23rd March, 1926.

156,Mr Yates,"If the dates, are all alikeber who does not seek information, but shuts his eyes to facts, is not fit to be a member of this Parliament. Had time permitted I could have obtained many more such letters. AlthoughI am energetic, I could not gather facts from all parts' of Melbourne at once; but I assure honourable members that there are many other instances like those I have cited. In conversation with a friend in Adelaide last week, I was told that Harry Rye Limited and other firms were seriously affected. I have listened with interest to the arguments advanced. What we need to do in this country is to produce goods equal in quality and price to the goods of other countries, and we need to create a true Australian sentiment. We cannot do that by being "" one eyed."" In my business experience of 27 years, during twenty years of which I was in business for myself, I always placed Australian goods first, British goods second, goods, from other white-labour countries third, and goods from coloured-labour countries last. I purchased goods from colouredlabour countries only when I could not get them from elsewhere. During the war it was sometimes impossible to avoid purchasing them. Within the last twelve months I have refused to buy American elastic, although it was cheaper by 10 per cent, than British elastic. I did so because I believed in supporting the British industry, and if Australian elastic had been obtainable I would have bought that. Here is an interesting article on high protectionRetailers, prefer to buy their goods in the local market, and will push the sale of Australian-made goods that are of the right quality and price. Many large firms insist that Australian goods sold them be distinctively marked ' Made in Australia.' But retailers do not admit that increased duties are necessary for the protection of Australian manufacturers, where manufacturers are efficient. In evidence recently given my association was able to show the Tariff Board that one factory in this' State, engaged in the manufacture of clothing, itself employed 1,000 hands. That factory increased duties on the goods it was manufacturing. When certain manufacturers of fur and felt hats made application for increased duties, three other manufacturers of those articles stated that they did not require any increased duty. If some local manufacturers are thus able to carry on satisfactorily without requiring any increase in duty, it would appear that those desiring an increase are either not properly organised or are simply using the Tariff Boardi n hope of increasing their profits at the expense of the public. It seems to me about time the public had greater knowledge of protection and its consequences. Very high protection has been granted most manufacturers. Any increase in tariff duties will increase prices paid by the public. All classes outside the manufacturer and his employees are for ever being indirectly taxed by means of Customs duties from whioh they reap no personal benefit. Peoplei n other States are awakening to the load placed on them by a policy of protection unrestricted. To any one who is prepared to view the question with an open mind those arguments are sound. Apart from the large decrease in the price of wool, the woollen industry has suffered most from the fact that many woollen businesses are carried on in a slip-shod, inefficient way. It is not the duty of this or any other government to subsidize inefficiency. If a business is not carried on efficiently it must go to the wall. member know that most of the textile factories in Australia are as efficient as the textile factories in any other country ? but some of them are not. If they were all efficient, they would not require any further protection. A circular I received the other day shows the inconsistency of those who ask for more protection. A firm, which was asking me to support higher duties for the benefit of Australian industries, insulted me by sending me a circular printed on paper made in Norway. Protection ought to begin at home. member use linen paper made in Australia ? made in Norway. I think that most of the paper I use is made in Adelaide.

Honourable members who had not ""applied for believe all they are told about the effect of this tariff must be in their second childhood, when fairy tales once more become real. I hope that honourable members will take action to prevent a serious state of unemployment being caused in this country.

167,Mr Parsons,"Those figures are 5s.the big fat capitalists making fortunes out of working men and women, but it appears to mc that tbey are now hand in glove with them in taking down their fellow Australians. Let us consider comparative prices. The retail price for a pair of trousers made from this rubbishy cloth, which one can tear to pieces, is 12s. 9d. I also have a garment made from British cloth which, prior to the tariff, was sold at 10s. 6d. The Australian article has cheap lining and cheap pocketing to keep down the cost. English garment has good pocketing and superior canvas and silesia. The price of the English trousers to-day is 16s. l i d . , an addition of 6s. 5d., due to the operation of the tariff. That is a considerable tax, and it enriches only a few manufacturers in our cities. I have noticed that the honourable member for Werriwa( Mr Lazzarini) has been testing some of my samples.

I shall now show it, whilst a dungaree is a fine cotton cloth some of the absurdities of the tariff in resembling somewhat an English serge. I another direction. A sample which I do not wish to be unfair, and therefore hold in my hand is called a cotton tweed. I cannot say definitely whether it was It is not. Evidently the officials of the the Minister( Mr Pratten) or Major Customs Department do not know what, Oakley who informed me that one reason is cotton tweed. It is a brown moleskin, for the inclusion of blue denim in the dutiable as cotton tweed, because it is supposed to resemble cotton tweed. My free list, tariff item (a), was that overeyesight is not quite so good as it was ' alls from it were used only in factories. a few years ago, but if I saw a man wearIn case honourable members inspect these ing a pair of trousers made from this samples later in the debate, and suggest material I would know from a distance that I have been misleading the comof 25 yards that he was not wearing mittee, 1 should like to explain that cotton tweed.

By some able is, so I understand, to protect the extraordinary process of reasoning, brown woollen trade. Grey moleskin, a sample of denim, a sample of which I now show to which I now produce, is supposed to interfere with the woollen trade. This material, which is very largely used in country districts, is invoiced at 2s. 8d., 27 inches wide, and the landed cost is 4s. 7d. Another sample, an English cord moleskin, is invoiced at Is. 7d., 27 inches wide, and the landed cost is 3s. OJd. Still another, article that is dutiable under this tariff item is an ordinary crash suiting, which is made up into children's washing suits.. Because it goes over 6 The ounces and resembles a cotton tweed, it is included in that classification, notwithstanding that it can never come into competition with woollen goods. Another surprising decision of the Customs Department relates to denim, which is often termed dungaree. I have been told that blue denim overalls made from the sample which I now exhibit to honorable members, are used only in factories. As a matter of fact, they are used in all our country districts, especially during harvest time.

This view is evidently supported by the experience of the South Australian Woollen Company. company did not want this duty on cotton tweeds. goods, and has extensive business connexions in Victoria and New South Wales. blankets, manufactured by that company, are second to none in the world. Eighteen years ago my eldest brother went as an honorary commissioner for the South Australian Government to the Paris Exhibition, and took an Onkaparinga rug with him. French and British merchants who attended the exhibition congratulated him upon its excellence, and declared that the company should have no difficulty in marketing Onkaparinga rugs on the other side of the world. That is what we should strive for. We should not go in for the production of rubbishy cotton tweeds, but should concentrate on the production of high grade woollen goods from the raw material in Australia, because we should then have some' hope of selling them in other countries. I wish to be perfectly fair to all sections of the community. I object very strongly to misleading information sent to me concerning these tariff items by representatives of both the importers and manufacturers of woollen tweeds. I am not surprised -that other honourable members, who have no personal knowledge of the trade, have been misled. These interested people are . concerned principally with the effect of the tariff upon their pockets. to emphasize that the duty on cotton tweedswas. intended to protect the woollen industry. from a circular sent to me concerning It is made in the flannels and blankets : Prior to the introduction of the new tariff the woollen industry had passed through a severe period of stagnationThat was due to some extent to slackness in deliverydue to the absence of orders, brought about to a large extent by the excessive importations, principally from the United Kingdom during the year 1922-23, and which continued, though not quite so severe, up to last year. We have been told by the Minister that importations are on the increase, but I shall show that they are not. Even the flannel and blanket trade, whicli tlie Australian mills haw practicality caplured, was severely attacked, the importation of flannels increasing from 1922 to 1923 by That 466 per cent., and blankets by 141 per cent. It produces excellent woollen My complaint is that the authors of this circular did not give me the figures in pounds, shillings and pence. A percenThe Onkaparinga rugs and tage increase is not necessarily conclusive. The volume of trade is all-important. I say deliberately that the yardage and prices of the articles were intentionally left out, because it would spoil their case. We should have the fullest information from both sides. U p to the present that has not been given to us. The small increase in the importation of flannels and blankets in the year mentioned was due to the fact that the market for wool was falling at the time, and the position was becoming very acute. The manufacturers in Australia were not up to time with their deliveries. Stuff which I ordered for the 1st of March, for the winter trade, was not delivered unti l the 1st of May. A cold snap came along, and we had no blankets, and very few flannels to sell. The result was that next year a number of people were approached and asked to import a small quantity of blankets and flannels to tide us over tbe first month or two of the season, and prevent such a breakdown as bad occurred during the previous year. That explains why there was an increase in the percentage of imports of blankets and flannels at that particular time, although, .as I have said, it represented but a very small increase in the value of the.goods. The fall I -should like in woollen prices was another reason why the factories were up against it .

The South Australian Woollen was placed in the same position as others, but it has always refused to make "" muck,"" which is a very good description of some of the stuff that is made. It makes only first-class stuff, and stands or falls by it. It was paying good dividends and increased its capital, but when it was faced with the extra price of wool it did not, as some other did, carry on, trying to get the last penny, but it cut its losses; it paid only a small dividend, That is the proper way in which to carry on business, and manufacturers who carry on business in that way will always receive from me the fullest measure of support through the"" tariff. firms attempt to carry on by unbusinesslike methods, with ramshackle and altogether in a slip-shod way, without knowing or bothering to learn their business, expecting the people to pay for their inefficiency, they will get no support from me. times different samples have been handed to the department for its decision as to whether they are cotton tweeds, or something else. One bunch of samples I have here consists entirely of cotton upou which the duty must be paid. have another bunch of samples which the importers were told by the were not cotton tweeds, did not come under that item, and might be imported without duty.

If it is contended that there is something dishonest about it , let me point out that what is sauce for the goose should be sauce for the gander. Company When the tariff schedule was tabled last September, 6£ oz. was fixed as the weight of what are known as shoddy tweedscheap tweeds which should carry duty. Large numbers of orders were placed overseas for tweeds coming under that weight-betwee n 6 oz. and 6^ oz. That was perfectly legitimate. There. was nothing dishonest about it . But as soon organizations as the department found this out, what did it do ? It reduced the weight carrying duty to 6 oz., and is now going to collect and extended its operations. duty on these goods. Is that honest? I do not think it is. If it is contended that the ordering of material under the weight' fixed to carry duty was a trick by the importers, who, it should not be forBut when gotten, are also manufacturers of clothing who employ people at Australian machinery, wages, was it not also a trick on the part of the Customs Department to reduce the weight of material bearing duty after orders had been placed ? The importers of these goods, who are someLet me say that at different times sneeringly called foreign traders, imported them in good faith, and, if it was a trick for them to order tweeds something under the weight fixed for the duty, was it not the duty ""of the Governtweeds, ment to stand superior to such trickery, I and say, "" We are going to reduce to 6 oz. the weight of material carrying department duty; but we shall not impose it ou the goods that are coming along, though we think you should not have done what you did. In future, similar goods of a khaki drills, plain khaki weight of 6 oz. will carry duty, and you will know where you are.""

Some of the stuff that is now that with the exception of coming to Australia is not worth picking the samples in the up. In view of its value the duty is so excessive that it would be better to put I do not wish to be unfair it into a boat and sink it , than to land it . because the duty alone payable on it could not be recovered by the importers. I make the statement that, so far as the duty on cotton tweed is concernedj no evidence was taken in Melbourne and evidence was taken only in Sydney. It seems to have been the result of an afterthought or a spasm after a nightmare that evidence on the. subject was taken from several firms. One would think on reading the list of those who were called to give evidence ,on the subject, that there are only two Statesi n Australia. I complain, as a South Australian, and as a member representing one of the smaller States, that in framing tariffs the interests of the two big States of the Commonwealth are alone considered and the smaller States are not considered. In this case no evidence was taken in South Australia, .in Queensland, in Tasmania, or in Western Australia. the Australian stand-point. have the all-Australia standpoint and not the one-third or the one-sixth watereddown Australian standpoint. Last week, when the subject of pianos was brought up and reference was made to pianos manufactured in two only of the States, I made an interjection on the lines of the protest I am now making. I have no wish to be considered alittle Australian: but, just as I say "" ^Australia first, Britain next, and the white races next,"" so I say "" South Australia first, Australia next, Britain next,"" and I carry the thing back to my own family, because the tariff, like charity, should begin at home. angle from matters. I guarantee that some representatives of South Australia in this State have travelled Australia to a greater extent than have representatives of the larger States. We are sometimes asked, ""Where is South Australia,?"" and "" Where is Adelaide ?"" Some people seem to be under the impression that South Australia is a suburb of one of tbe bigger States. I dare say that some of my honourable friends from Queensland have had the same experience, and have been asked, ""Where is Brisbane?"" We think that we are and we expect that, in the consideration of important matters like the tariff, before decisions are made, in formation should be obtained not from one State, but from all. The Tariff Board should secure the fullest information possible on all the subjects with which it has to deal. The Minister made some remark about ""the ever-increasing importations of woollen goods."" Let me quote the figures from the Tariff Board's recommendation. For 1922-3 the value of the woollen piece goods imported into the Commonwealth was £4,7lS,194. In the next year the value was about £3,300,000. That shows a falling-off of nearly £1,400,000. Not an "" ever-increasing,"" but a decreasing importation. This answers the statement that the local industries require the extra duty because of "" ever-increasing importations."" Surely to goodness Ave should be given the facts. I know that the Minister was only reading the stuff put into his hands. HeI t is sufficient to have would agree with me that he does not know anything about tbe soft goods trade. He would be man enough to admit that. I am prepared to say that I know nothing whatever about the iron and steel trade, and I -shall be prepared to listen to the advice of those who do know something about it . Last night I heard a good deal about whisky. I do not know anything about it . I do not drink it . The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN ( Mr Watkins) -The honourable member must regard the debate on whisky as having been closed. matter only as an illustration to make my point that the Minister is not an authority on textiles, cotton tweeds, and so on. That is the rightVarious descriptions are given of i m which to view tarilf ported goods, and it is often very difficult to say what are cotton tweeds. I have bere samples of cotton worsteds and cotton tweeds. They are all called, by the department, "" cotton tweeds,"" and include moles and brown denims. The department does not know what a cotton tweed is. I do not wish to belittle the Minister. He is probably a master of some trades, but evidently not of the cot-ton textile trade. Wei n Australia should concentrate on certain lines. We should make one thing, and perfect it .

176,Mr Parsons,"I referred to thebounty ou woollen tweeds to establish markets overseas. We have a chance here to make woollen tweeds and worsteds on an extensive scale. there is a tariff of 80 per cent, against British worsteds, yet they are sold there because of their excellent quality. If we waste our time making cotton tweeds and expert manufacturers. This country will .be jack of all trades and master of none. Some of the duties under the tariff are even higher than were asked for by the manufacturers concerned. I do not know the reason for this. I know that the manufacturers, and the importers also, make their applications to the department on the same basis' as a man sells a horse. He asks not for what it is worth or what he thinks it is worth, but for a price which will permit of bargaining. imposed because it was easier to calculate. The following is taken from the Tariff Board's report on cotton tweeds: The imposition of a prohibitive duty would needlessly contribute to an increase in the cost of living, by forcing the use of the more expensive woollen material upon a class whose occupations subject their clothes to rough usage. The use of such material as cotton tweeds is a necessity to workers in. Queensland' and other tropical parts of Australia, the advantage being that garments made from this material are easily washed and are much cooler. That statement shows that the Tariff Board has a very hazy idea of the use of cotton tweeds and knows nothing at all of the cotton tweed trade. It does not even know the difference between shoddy tweed and cotton tweed. Minister this afternoon referred to cotton tweed as shoddy cotton tweed. Shoddy tweed is made up almost entirely of short staple stuff and of waste material, including the fluff off the floor. The Tariff Board has no idea where cotton tweeds are used, because it says that they are necessary to workers in Queensland and other tropigal parts of Australia. Cotton tweeds are used practically throughout my electorate, and I think that I am safe in saying that 90 per cent, of the working trousers used there are made of cotton tweed or denim. I tried for years to persuade my customers not trousers, because they are not suitable for their purpose. Imagine a man working in the heat on a sheep station, farm Althoughi n America or orangery clothed in woollen tweeds! Grass seeds adhere readily to woollen tweeds, but not to cotton tweeds, which constitute a necessary of life for the man on the land. Most remarkable staterubbish, we shall never become ments have been made on the subject of cotton tweeds. The Minister made use of one this afternoon when he referred to the millions of yards of this material that could be made by Australian firms. If those cotton tweeds are like the sample that I have here, they are virtually useless. The Minister also stated that a certain Collingwood firm could supply tbe whole of the retail trade with sufficient cotton tweed. The explanation of that statement is that that firm was referring to its own retail trade, and to its ability to supply the reI n one case a duty was quirements of its own factory. The Minister also said that cotton tweeds could be satisfactorily produced in Australia at 20 per cent, above the present landed cost. The honourable member for Yarra( Mr Scullin) tried to inform me some time ago that cotton tweed trousers made in Australia could be retailed at the same price as the imported article under tbe old tariff. Mt. SCULLIN And so they can. duty ranging from 74 per cent, to 133 per cent. ? Why not impose a duty of 25 per cent.? The honourable member's argument does not apply at all, because when the cotton tweeds are put on the market they w ill be branded not as is whisky-Scotch or Australian, or whatever it may be-bu t simply as cotton Even the tweeds. There w ill be, therefore, no room for prejudice. If honourable members who should be well informed on this subject do not know the difference between the grades of cotton tweed, how on earth can we expect the ordinary citizen to discriminate between them ? The Minister also said thai, a Sydney woollen mill had produced cotton tweeds which could be sold as men's trousers at l is . 6d. a pair as against a well-known standard cloth made up as trousers and selling at l is . a pair.

179,Mr Paesons,"-Then why impose ative prices of these materials utterly confounds the Minister's statement. referring to the importation of cotton tweeds from overseas, he had apparently not as much information as he could have obtained. His particular friends, Associated Chambers of Manufactures, could have given him certain figures on that subject. His information, and that contained in a pamphlet issued by the Associated Chambers of Manufactures, do not seem to correspond, and I do not know which to believe. One remarkably silly statement in that pamphlet is that the quality of Australian cotton tweeds is quite equal to that of .the British. I ask in what way ? It is quite possible for an Australian manufacturer with experience to make -a cotton tweed equal in quality to any other, but at what price? The important factor of price has been omitted. What man would be foolish enough to buy an article at one shop for, say 13s., when at another shop a similar article could be purchased for, say 6s. 6d. ? Another absurd statement in the pamphlet issued by the Associated Chambers of Manufactures is that the quality of Australian cotton tweeds is naturally far superior to the quality of those made in Japan. Why should our tweeds be naturally superior to those of Japan? Japan can make . just as good cotton tweeds as those made in Australia or Great Britain. of price. I am in favour of imposing prohibitive duties on all articles that can be manufactured in Australia and within the Empire so as to shut out competition from other countries. According to the pamphlet of the Associated Chambers of Manufactures tbe approximate figures for 1924-25 respecting cotton tweeds imported into Australia are as follow: Japan, £139,000; £63 000: United States of America, £2o',000; £ 9 , 0 0 0 ; and other countries £ 5 0 0 ; totalling, in round figures, £253,000. Minister, however, stated imports of cotton tweeds during that year The Ministeri n valuing the imports from the United Kingdom at £63,000, would lead the committee to suppose that the imports from Japan are larger than they are. I am inclined to accept the figures prepared by the Associated Chambers of Manufactures, which show that Japan has been getting more than its share of this trade. Japan's proper share at exactly I d . When less than I d . The Minister cannot be aware that a lot of material which will be included in this item is imported under other items. It may be invoiced as nap, the engineers' twist, or cotton worsted. The £8,000,000 worth of cotton goods im ported each year includes a large number of lines which would certainly come within the departmental definition 'of cotton tweed. That fact, I think, explains the apparent smallness of the imports from Great Britain. Two or three facts I would impress upon honourable members. First, Australia should manufacture as much as possible of its own needs, and to that end should concentrate upon the development of manufactures from our own primary products, such as wool and maize. We should also raise the quality of those products to the highest possible standard, so that their excellence, like that of our dried fruits, will be recognized throughout the world. There are people in different parts of the world wealthy enough to pay for the best, and for such people we should cater. If that principle be adopted we can not only supply the local market with blankets and woollen tweeds, but we can export our surplus. If our manufacturers are confined to the Australian market, we shall have the evil of over-production, followed by stagnation, and a request to Parliament for a bounty or some other artiI t is again a question ficial prop. In a recent letter my sister, who is a wool-grower on the M u r r u m bidgee Eiver, informed me that the prices she received for her wool this year was very much less than she had expected, and in consequence she had difficulty in carrying on. Yeti n that industry, above all others, Australia is supposed to hold its own against the world. United Kingdom, The TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN ( Mr Watkins) A discussion of the Belgium, £20,000;Italy, woollen industry is hardly relevant to an item relating to cotton goods. that tbe pointed out that as the duties on cotton tweeds were imposed originally for the were valued at £360.000. purpose of protecting the manufacture of woollen tweeds, the discussion must in evitably cover both.

This duty will hit heavily the parents of those children, and the greater the number of boys in the family the bigger the burden. Cotton-tweed trousers are almost generally worn by the manual workers, and these duties will further enrich a few already wealthy manufacturers at the expense of the more poorlypaid workers in all avocations. I estimate the increased burden on the community at £500,000 per annum. The whole of that money w ill not be spent in Australia, because cotton yarn and other requirements of manufacture will be purchased from abroad. I predict that the first quarterly returns issued by the statistician after the imposition of these duties will show that the cost of living has increased. Inevitably wages will advance correspondingly. [Quorum cient to indicate to the committee what will be the disastrous effect of the im position of these duties. The unemployment amongst factory operatives will be serious, particularly in Melbourne. We should avoid at all costs throwing people out of employment. What will be the net gain in giving employment to two or three hundred men in the cotton-tweed industry if by the same action a few thousands of people in other industries are thrown out of employment? If the Government is wedded to these duties it should at least make temporary provision against unemployment unti l such time as the local factories are producing in quantity these high-priced but inferior cotton goods.

I object to the honourable member for Maribyrnong deliberately misrepresenting my attitude on this question. I hope that when a division is taken honourable members will not vote blindly, but w ill regard the subject from a true Australian stand-point, instead of endeavouring to conserve the interests of three or four wealthy manufacturers to the detriment of practically the whole of the people of Australia. -Six months ago I spoke on the duty imposed upon cotton tweeds, and at that time It r u t h f u l l y stated that very little of this material was being manufactured in Australia. I was then inclined to oppose the imposition of a duty upon cotton tweeds as I had not call for a quorum. been assured that the material was being formed.'] manufactured in Australia in sufficient quantities to meet the local demand. As I am convinced that cotton tweed of a satisfactory quality is now being manufactured in the Commonwealth, the proposed duty is one which I can conscientiously support. I rose more particularly to refute some of the statements made by the honourable member for Angas( Mr Parsons), who quoted a lot of piffle, doubtless supplied to him by representatives of overseas manufacturers and im-' porters. By a stupid trick the honourable member endeavoured to mislead honourable members. In comparing Australian cotton-tweed trousers with those of similar material manufactured in Great Britain, the honourable member endeavoured to show the unsatisfactory quality of the former by readily tearing the material. I have before'me a pair of English cotton-tweed trousers of similar quality to those which the honourable member for Angas displayed, and as honourable members will see, the cottontweed cloth of which they are made can be easily torn across the weft. That does not prove that the material is inferior. The honourable member, who professes to have had considerable experience in the trade, should know that almost all cotton goods sold over the counter are not cut with scissors, but after a nick has been made on the edge, are torn. should tell me something I do not know.",46,Poulton Clothing Cor Pty Ltd

The material in the sample pair of trousers which I produce would, I think, wear fairly well. of? tweed. I challenge the honourable member for Angas to give me an opportunity to tear, across the weft, the best sample in his possession. I should be able to do so as readily as I have torn the sample before me. The honourable member for Angas referred to the use of shoddy cloth < which be said is manufactured largely from material of short staple and floor sweepings. likelihood of imported cloth being made from short staple material and shoddy stuff than cloth being so made. ings from the. factories of Australian manufacturers would produce only a few hundred yards of shoddy, whereas that from the large mills in Britain, Germany, or Japan, where they manufacture on a very large scale, would be sufficient to produce perhaps hundreds of thousands of yards. In all material there is likely to be some short stapled stuff. As honourable members will see it is difficult to tear the Australian material against the warp. of the honourable member to influence members by an obvious trick, and to endeavour to depreciate the quality of the material we produce. Even the best worsted material could be torn in the same way as Australian cotton tweed. The demonstration of the honourable member for Angas does not prove that the quality of the material is inferior, because most cotton goods, including those of good quality, can readily be torn. The honourable member also stated that the majority of workmen in the city and in the country, as well as the school children, are clothed in cotton tweeds, and that if this duty is imposed, higher prices will have to be paid for this material which he says is essential to the Australian people. For the information of the honourable member I may state that the cotton tweeds imported into Australia in 1924-25 were valued at only £252,000. Does the honourable member suggest that our workmen and school children could be clothed for that amount? Woollen clothing is very extensively used honourable iu Australia, and in consequence of the demand for such garments, our woollen trade has developed considerably. A l though I have not been in the trade for seven or eight years I am able to say that the sale of woollen material as against cotton is about 3 to 1. In 1924-5. the importations of cotton tweed from E n g l is h cotton Japan were valued at £ 1 3 9 , 3 3 6; from United Kingdom,, at £ 6 3 , 0 0 0; United States of America, £ 2 0 , 0 1 4 ; Belgium,. £20,320; Italy, £91,702; and other, countries. £568. I doubt very mucb whether the whole of the material i m ported from Great Britain was manufactured in British mills. Possibly a fair proportion of it was German stuff sent across to Great Britain and shipped to There is much more Australia by "" tricky "" importers. It will be seen that cotton tweeds valued at £139,336 have been imported there is of Australian from Japan, which is more than half of Tbe sweepthe total value of the importations from other countries. What are the conditions in the manufacturing industries in Japan? A merchant once told me that when he decided to purchase a large consignment of attache cases he sent his representative to Japan to buy at the factories. His representative was instructed to be in attendance the whole time the cases were being packed, placed on the lorries, and shipped by an overseas steamer. He had, in effect, to sit It was not fair on the cases in order to prevent inferior articles from being shipped. An other gentleman purchased towels from a Japanese agent in accordance with a sample of superior quality measuring about 6 feet by 4 feet. He took orders for 100,000 dozen in Sydney, but wben his order was executed the towels measured about 3 feet by 2 feet, and were of most inferior quality. Apparently there is no such thing as commercial morality in Japan. Japanese flannelette when unrolled is frequently found to be of an unsatisfactory quality ' and most irregular in width and texture. That is what Australian importers doing business with Japan have to contend with . Our experience during the war period was such that we determined that if possible we would develop the cotton trade, and manufacturers of such cotton goods as hosiery have already made good. As the result of their enterprise, experiments were conducted in growing cotton. If such a n ' effort had not been made, we should not be justified, in my opinion, in protecting manufacturers of cotton",47,Poulton Clothing Cor Pty Ltd

We hope that we shall never . be called upon to suffer .such a great calamity as the recent war was. but in the interests of our producers, business men, and consumers, we should prepare against it by developing the cotton growing and manufacturing industries. We shall then never again be at the mercy of such soulless importers as exploited us during the war. I sold calico over my counter before the war at 5^d. a yard, and five years afterwards I was obliged to sell an exactly similar article at 2s. 9d. a yard. I have sold hundreds of pairs of cotton tweed trousers like those I exhibited this afternoon at 4s. l i d . a pair, but since the war similar articles have been sold at 12s. 6d. and 14s. 6d., which was then the price of a superior quality woollens. tablish the cotton-growing industry in Australia, I am sure that tbe Australian consumer would not be exploited by the Australian manufacturers as he was exploited by importers during the war. Like the honourable member for Werriwa, I bad no intention of participating in the debate unti l the honourable member for Angas( Mr Parsons) made his speech. Since these duties were imposed last September, the manufacturing of cotton tweeds has been established in New South Wales on a sound basis. I venture to say that the goods made there are superior to the imported article. They are made from long staple cotton, and no shoddy is used. More than one firm is engaged in the business. In addition : to VicarsL t d . , Messrs. G. A . Bond and Co. are very active. They have already spent £60,000 in establishing their cotton tweeds mills. The local article is produced from 100 per cent. Australian cotton yarn, which contains about 80 per cent, of Australian cotton, and it is sold at prices varying from 2s. 6d. to 4s. 6d. a yard. So far from being unable to cope with the requirements of tbe trade, the local manufacturers have supplied every order they have received, and have 16,000 yards of cotton tweed in stock to meet future orders. In view of these facts it is useless for the honourable member for Angas, or any other honourable members to say that the industry cannot be established here, that the trade cannot be supplied, or that we cannot produce a good material. I am told that garments made of Australian cotton tweed last two, three, and sometimes four times as long as those made of the imported material. They are being retailed at a reasonable rate, and tbe public is satisfied with them. In those circumstances I submit that we should r a t if y the duty. For tbe defence of Australia, it is highly desirable that we should establish cotton production and manufacture here .on a large scale. The mills already in operation are efficiently operated, and they are at least as up to-date and progressive as those in any other part of the world, and are producing a superior article. I urge honourable members to pass the item without delay. this debate has centred on one article specified in the item. I do not think If we esthat honourable members realize all that is involved in these duties: The Minister for Trade and Customsi n introducing this new schedule a few days ago told us that it was practically the same as the schedule introduced last September. He said that only verbal alterations had beer, made to make the meaning clearer. schedule was based on the same principles. no new duties were involved. I assert that that statement was not quite correct, and that the Minister was not frank with honourable members. Tbe history of the events surrounding the introduction of this schedule is interesting. In September last cotton tweeds were specifically set out w i th woollen piece goods, and duty was imposed on them under item 105F. But there was considerable public outcry against the schedule as soon as it was introduced, and the Minister found himself in a rather difficult position in regard to it . He discovered that, in bis eager attempt to protect particular industries, he had caused grave inconsistencies in. the tariff, which were giving his department considerable trouble. The high duty that was fixed on cotton goods affected extensive stocks, delivery of which had been delayed by the British seamen's strike, and other causes, and the apparel manufacturers were in a serious position. The Minister thereupon gave a ruling that certain cotton tweeds should be admitted free. Why he did so nobody has",48,Poulton Clothing Cor Pty Ltd

198,Mr Mann,"The Minister added thatbeen quite able to understand. He differentiated between brown and grey cotton tweeds in favour of the brown, so that materials identical in quality were taxed differently because they were of a different colour. For some reason there is tralia for grey cotton tweed than for brown: but the manufacturers adjusted themselves to the new conditions, produced more brown cotton tweed garments than formerly, and in order to maintain supplies, ordered considerable stocks of the same colour. A t that time there was an election imminent, and in order to get out of the difficulties that his inconsistencies had created for him, the Minister gave a departmental ruling that all cotton tweed that arrived in Australia before the 31st December should be admitted free under item 404 of the general tariff. Honourable members twitted me this afternoon for saying that the Minister, in issuing this order, committed an illegal action. WhatI said was that, in my view, his action was illegal. I am not a lawyer, and only expressed my view as a layman. The facts on which I based it were these: The Minister introduced a schedule, and requested Parliament to validate it. It set out that definite duties should be imposed on specified articles. Item 404 of the general tariff was intended to cover articles not elsewhere-included, and to give the Minister a discretion regarding articles not definitely specified and tabulated in the schedule, but cotton tweed was specifically set out under item 105. In the circumstances I say that the Minister acted wrongly. He not only acted without the authority of Parliament, but in direct opposition to the declared intention of Parliament. Nor is that the end of the story. ber, a departmental order was issued, and firms interested in the cotton-tweed trade were informed that certain cloths other than those specifically mentioned were to be treated as coming within the provisions of item 105r. . It was only on cotton tweeds that this Parliament validated a rate. partment issued a ruling that the rate was to be extended to other cotton goods which had hitherto been classed as cotton piece goods under item 105A (1). In other words, by a departmental ruling the department altered the whole incidence of the duty. It had previously waived the decision of the Parliament with regard to cotton tweeds, and it then gave a ruling that articles which the Parliament had specifically included under item 105A should be subject to the new rate on a greater demand in Auscotton piece goods. I have a list of the articles affected. I am not an expert in the soft goods business, but the difference between them and cotton tweeds . is obvious. The list has been suppliedto me as copied from the departmental ruling. It embracesCotton tweeds, suitings, trouserings, naps, engineers' twists, cottonades, cassimeres, Bedford cords,. whip cords, diagonal cords, vertical cords, coverts, gabardines, Canton mole, denims (except blue). The second portion of this list', comprising Bedford cords, whip cords, diagonal cords, vertical cords, coverts, gabardines, Canton mole, and denims; except hlue denims, were previously classified as piece goods. Thus, all cotton piece goods which, under the original tariff, and also under the schedule of September last, were classed under item 105A, are now classed under item 105F, which subjects them to the same rate as woollen piece goods and cotton tweeds. I h other words, the department has brushed aside the decision of Parliament. The departmental memorandum proceeds as follows:Any other cotton piece goods suitable for the above mentioned purposes which, in pattern or design, represent woollen tweeds or worsteds, and which exceed &i ounces per square yard.. 1 By this ruling there is imposed on cotton piece goods a restriction' in weight which did not exist previously. I protest against that action. The Minister must have known when he authorized that ruling that he was doing something which, Later, in Novemto say the least, was irregular. Tariff Board and all the leading departmental officials concurred in the decision, and, after considering precedents, I approved of it. 1 Tariff Board, the department, and the Subsequently the deMinister may do what they like without first obtaining the authority of the Parliament. ways been in the hands of the department until it was placed in the hands of the Tariff Board.",49,Poulton Clothing Cor Pty Ltd

If that information is accurate, the Minister's ruling was irregular, and by his subsequent action he has admitted that it was irregular. He has come down with a proposal in this schedule to confirm what he did without authority. The item we are now .discussing covers the action taken by the department without the approval of the Parliament. Tbe Parliament may approve of what has been done, but that is not the question. The Minister had no right to do such things before asking the Parliament to approve of them. To legislate by departmental regulation amounts to a usurpation of the functions and powers of the Parliament. His present action is an admission that what he did was irregular. is making a serious charge. serious charge, and I am making it seriously. After the schedule had been tabled, the Parliament was asked to pass a validating bill in special circumstances, so that the Government could collect the duties until we could discuss them. .We passed that validating bill with confidence in the Minister, but in the interval which has elapsed he has introduced important and far-reaching changes without authority. He now asks the committee to . pass this new schedule, and says that there is no real alteration in the duties. As a matter of fact, in this schedule he has lifted the rate of duty on an important class of goods, some of which, if they came from Great Britain, were formerly free. The schedule also contains new items relating, particularly, to woollen piece goods. The Minister might, at least, have explained these alterations to the House when he introduced the schedule. Having made that protest; I wish also to say that the Minister has altered the incidence of the duties. I do not object very much to his altering the lineal yard to the square yard, provided it is admitted that to fix a rate per yard is the right method. His action was justified to protect the revenue, but he has altered the rate of duty in another important respect. He has changed the weight from 6£ oz. to 6 oz. That again is not fair. This House validated a bill in which the maximum weight was 6-J oz., and it was known that the 'tariff was to be in force until Parliament met again. Traders were justified in entering into contracts on the assumption that the conditions fixed in September last would not be disturbed in the intervening period. They gave orders on the basis of 6£ oz., but when the goods arrived here the new ruling of 6 oz. was applied. Merchants with shipments of thousands of yards of cloth, ordered under tbe apparent security of an act passed by this Parliament last September, are threatened with ruin by the alteration of the basis of weight. The Government is not treating the trading community with even decent consideration. Those persons are citizens of this country, and I am informed that some of them in Sydney have already gone insolvent as a result of this alteration. That is not a fair way to treat men who are enI know that it is a gaged in an honourable trade. Certainly those who ordered goods under the schedule of September last should have been allowed' to import them in accordance with that schedule. If the House approves of the present schedule, any alterations which have been made should apply in the future only. Surely there should be some reasonable policy of give and take for men who have been legitimately carrying on their business under an act of Parliament passed last September. The goods which are being lifted by this schedule include not only cotton tweeds, but also goods which are nothing like cotton tweeds, such as alpacas, Sicilians, and gabardines. The whole range of cotton materials is embraced. I shall place specimens of them on the table, and I hope that honourable members will inspect them. We are supposed to be considering a duty fbr the protection of the cotton tweed making industry, but no attempt has been made in this country to manufacture most of these goods. Eveni f we grant, which I do not, that the ""manufacture of cotton tweeds has been placed on a commercial basis, the fact remains that most of tbese goods are not cotton tweeds.",50,Poulton Clothing Cor Pty Ltd

It does not claim that cotton tweeds are being manufactured in Australia, or that the manufacturers require increased protection. brought to light that the application to the board was made, not by cotton tweed manufacturers, but by woollen manufacturers. It took me some time to locate the evidence and the recommendation of the board. It is to be found in the report of the board relating to woollen piece goods. turers of cotton piece goods. The application was made, not by an established industry, but by manufacturers of woollen goods, who said that cotton tweeds were interfering with the sale of their woollen goods. That is an extraordinary method of bringing in a new duty. tweeds were imitating woollen tweeds. The only way in which they can imitate them is in regard to the pattern on their surface. not for their pattern, but for the use which their quality makes possible. It was not claimed that they replaced woollen goods'. That is proved by the paragraph in the report of the board which statesThe use of such material as cotton tweed is a necessity to workers in Queensland and they have. ordered £15,000 worth of other tropical parts of Australia, the admachinery. vantage being that garments made from .this material are easily washed and much cooler. Upon the flimsy pretext of imitation we are asked to consent to the imposition of the staggering duty proposed. Hitherto the guiding principle in imposing protective* duties has been that the goods in question were being made on a commercial scale in the Commonwealth. It is only since the application for a duty raised severe criticism that some of _ the mills which hitherto were devoted chiefly to the making of woollen goods have made a frantic attempt to produce cotton tweeds. No other ground for the duty remained; it had been cut from under their feet. Even the report of the Tariff Board is inconsistent, and has not been based on sound principles. There has been a frantic attempt by the Minister, the department, and the mills, to show that the industry is established. A certain quantity of cotton tweeds has been produced. I shall not discuss their quality. It is said that the best quality cannot compare with the imported article. That may or may not be the case. Possibly the quality can be rapidly improved. Buti t is not correct to say that the mills The astounding fact was are producing these goods in quantities sufficient to meet the requirements of Australia. The manufacturers have apparently resorted to the temporary expedient of swinging over to the manufac ture of cotton piece goods, machinery that is intended for the manufacture of woollen piece goods. sion machines that had been lying idle for a long time.

223,Mr Mann,"Probably for the reasonmean that they were willing to do that eventually, or that they are ready to do it now? to do it now. The Minister knows-perfectly well that there are firms which are vainly endeavouring to obtain supplies of these tweeds. I think that when he introduced the schedule the Minister said that one m i ll in Sydney had given an undertaking to supply over 200,000 yards of good cotton tweed material. If , however, the Minister denies having said that, I accept his assurance, but a statement to that effect was made in the press, and some of those who were interested endeavoured to ascertain which Sydney mill had made the statement. out that no m ill was in a position to f ill an order of that magnitude. The Minister said that the duty was necessary because of the difference between English and Australian rates of wages. On this point let me quote from evidence given before the Tariff Board by the representative of the Australian Association of British ManufacturersOne reason advanced for ttie granting of this protective duty is the higher money wages paid in Australia as compared with some other countries. Thus the representatives of the applicant company say that as regards spinning and weaving, the wages in Australia are from 25 per cent, to 50 per cent, higher than in Great Britain. Taking a similar textile industry, namely, the woollen industry, we find that in 1921-2 the industry paid in wages £845,685 on a total output of £4,096,808. If wages had been paid at the English rates, as stated, they would be respectively from £561,789 to £674,147, according to the Australian rate being 50 per cent, or 25 per cent. * above. On the output of £4,096,808, the Australian wages equal 20.8 per cent; if these were 50 per cent, higher than the English rates, then the wages at the English rate would be equal to 13.7 .per cent., and if Australian rates were 25 per cent, higher than.the English the English rates would be equal to 16.4 per cent, of the output. Therefore, if the Australian wages are 50 per cent, more than English, the extra labour cost is only 7.1 per cent., and in the case of 25 per cent., the extra cost is 4.4 per cent. Therefore* the extra labour cost does not justify a duty, of 25 per cent. We quote tbese figures based on previous evidence to show that the 25 per cent, or 50 per cent, higher wages do not mean a 25 per cent, to 50 per cent, increase in the total cost of an article. Wages on the average are only 25 per cent, of the value of the article produced. Nevertheless it is argued that because wages are 50 per cent, higher in Australia, the duty should be in creased by 50 per cent. These figures are confirmed by the Commonwealth Statistician, whose statistics show that on The y are not prepared cotton tweeds the selling price of which does not exceed 5s. per lineal yard, the duties go up to 120 per cent. British and 200 per cent, general. The ratio of labour cost to the output value in woollen mills is 21.4 per cent., and in cotton mills it is only 9.7 per cent. I agree with the honourable member for Angas( Mr Parsons) concerning the uses and applicability of this class of goods. It is desirable that I should bring out one or two important points that have a direct bearing on employment of labour necessary for the manuThey found facture of cotton tweeds, on the most efficient and up-to-date basis. The establishment of this proposed new industry must be considered with a clear view as to the high protective duty asked for, and its relative cost to the people as a whole. Cotton tweeds are now produced upon automatic looms with the assistance of an exceedingly small amount of skilled labour. F if t y automatic looms capable of producing 5,000 yards of cotton tweed material a week require the attention of six girls. looms working in Melbourne. cotton tweeds? Mr 0. BILEY -Yes. industry from the point of view of its capacity to provide an additional avenue for employment. It is estimated that Australian requirements in cotton tweed amount to 4,500,000 yards per annum, so that on the basis I have mentioned employment will be given to 108 girls, involving wages expenditure of approximately £14,000, whilst the cost to the Australian public of establishing the industry under the 1925 schedule of duties w ill be approximately £774,000. By the time the goods reach the consumer, the public will pay £760,000 ner annum in excess of the wages of 108 girls in employment. dence quoted. by the honourable member a short time ago given before tbe Tariff Board? nately it was not included in the report.",53,Sydney And Melbourne

I have read the reports of the Tariff Board, and as much of the evidence as I could obtain. Unfortunately, I could not afford to buy the whole of it . There are serious technical difficulties in the way of establishing the cotton weaving industry in Australia, though I do not say that the difficulties are insuperable. There is, for example, the difficulty of obtaining adequate supplies of the raw material. It may be said that we are going to establish cotton growing in Australia. I am not so sure that we are, but if it is attempted it will mean more subsidies, and consequently higher prices for the raw materials for the cotton weaving industry. But apart altogether from the difficulty of securing supplies of the raw material, the successful development of the cotton weaving industry depends to a considerable extent on the profitable utilization of the secondary or by-products.' There are also difficulties in connection with obtaining dyeing materials and, in the initial stages at all events, of securng the necessary expert operatives. But the chief obstacle to successful expansion will be in connection with mass production to ensure low overhead expenditure. Sitting suspended from 6.29 to 8 p.m. state of the committee. [Quorum formed.] of the difficulty of establishing the cotton industry in Australia. I do not quote at length the communication submitted to me because I do not wish to weary the committee, but it is a particularly interesting one from an American, firm that was asked for a report on the possibility of establishing its industry in Australia. It sets out in detail the I difficulties which would. be experienced. I am willing to put the communication at the disposal of the Minister or of any honourable member who desires to see it. I want to refer to the item, and certain objections I have to it. I refer first of all to the provision introduced with regard to the weight of these fabrics that are to be dutiable. The item provides that the fabrics must weigh more than 6 oz. to the square yard. It has been contended by the Minister that the purpose of this duty is to keep out cheap rubbish"" shoddy,"" the honourable gentleman calls it ; but that term is, of course, wrongly applied to cotton goods. I presume that what the honourable gentleman means by using the word "" shoddy"" is cheap rubbishy goods, and it would be better to so describe them. The effect > of this item must be the reverse of what is intended. It should be obvious to honourable members, that the lower the limit of weight fixed for goods dutiable under this item, the greater the quantity of the lighter, cheaper, and more poorly manufactured goods that will be imported. So far, therefore, from excluding those inferior goods, the greater will be the quantity of material weighing less than 6 oz. to the square yard that will be imported. I recently had a sample of this class of material made up to weigh less than 6 oz., and compared it with material weighing 6£ oz. to the square yard.

We have been told that the cotton weaving industry is to be established and requires this duty. I propose to read one or two extracts from a recent prospectus issued by George A. Bond Cotton Mills Limited, one of the firms applying for this duty. It was issued in March of this year in connection with an issue of 100,000 8 per cent, preference shares of £1 eachThe cotton mills have been running day and night for the greater part of the past two products. years, and are at present employing about 500 hands. The whole operations are devoted to manufacturing yarns and piece goods (towels, canvas, calico, and cotton tweed) for the parent company. The earnings of the business transferred to the new company have been such as to (apart from the parent company's guarantee) amply assure the payments of the preference dividend. Facts concerning parent company which guarantee dividend : The surplus assets of parent company (Geo. A.. Bond and Company Limited) are over £560,000. Its profits for the year to 30th June, 1925, were over £66,000, subject to land and income tax deductions, whilst those for the present year show a very considerable increase. When this company requires further capital it has a different story from that which it tells when asking for further protective duties. If its profits have considerably increased without this tariff schedule, what right has it to ask for further protection ? The imposition of these duties, and the blow thereby aimed at British manufacturers, are being seriously felt and gravely commented upon in Great Britain. Some honourable members will say that that does not matter, and that we have not to consider the British merchants. I have in my possession a series of private letters received by Australian firms from their correspondents in England, written in very strong terms. A l though I am at liberty to read them to the committee I do not care to do so. I promise to show these letters to the Minister, or to any honourable member so long as he gives me his undertaking that the names of the writers will not be divulged, because if they were'they would be placed at a disadvantage in regard to their competitors. The comments made by English traders and business men are rather startling, especially in view of the fact"" that a campaign has been started in Great Britain for advertising Empire goods, under a grant from the British Government. The proposal is to spend £2,000 a day in advertising, to push the sale of our own and other Empire goods in Great Britain. Considerable comment has been made on the fact that we are thus asking our own customers to advertise our goods, which is a rather unusual proceeding in business circles, and that, concurrently with the commencement of that advertising campaign has come the imposition of these high duties, which will inflict a severe blow indeed upon British trade, and which are directly against the interests of those whom we are asking to interest themselves in the purchase of our Statements setting out the",56,Sydney And Melbourne

Great sympathy has been expressed by the free traders in this Parliament for the working man respecting the high prices that he pays for his requirements, but they are not so sympathetic with him when he appeals to the Arbitration Courtf o r a livin g wage. They profess sympathy for the working class only when they wish to allow the importers to dump their goods here, thus keeping Australian workmen out of a job. MrE .

What the workers dread more than anything else is unemployment. They are sensible enough to know that the people of this country can completely control the manufacturers here, but not the manufacturers abroad. The honourable member for Forrest( Mr Prowse) described this tariff item as a farce, which is a wild, thoughtless term to apply to a very serious and important proposition. I repeat again that the result of this item has been wonderful. It has established a new industry in which ing fixed orders. hundreds of workers will be employed. The honourable member for Perth said honourable member in regard to that statethat this industry could not be successment.

Honourable members have seen the quality of the product, and have been told the price at which it is being sold, and the guarantees that are offered in regard to delivery. woollen tweeds. That These are facts that can be verified by investigation. One of the most remarkThe question now able developments in connection with this controversy is the fact that during the last few weeks the British manufacturers, who had sent to honourable members data that would not.stand investigation, bave climbed down and practically accented the principle of taxing cotton tweeds. their position was untenable, and in order to cover their retreat have said that as the requisite quantities cannot be supplied by local mills the duty should be deferred. As the Minister pointed out, it is not necessary to do that, because as soon as this duty is confirmed wheels will be whirling and employees w ill be I have heard no comoperating looms in at least eight mills. In one m ill I visited during the week, 40 automatic looms such as are required for the weaving of cotton tweeds are idle. But orders are awaiting fulfilment, provided that the proposed duties are i m posed. The only thing lacking is the raw material., which can be obtained within a few weeks. One honourable member asked why, if the local mills can turn out quantities of this tweed, they are not already doing it . The answer is that they are producing, not in the quantities which the country requires, but sufficient to meet the demand pending the removal of the present uncertainty due to the incompleteness of the tariff.

""When this schedule was tabled, it came as a thunderclap to tbe importing interests, and they pleaded for delay. The Tariff Board and tbe Minister were in a difficult position. I do not pretend to have inside knowledge of their actions or reasons, but I shall relate my understanding of what happened. The duty was imposed in September, but was deferred until the end of the year in order to enable firm orders that had been been placed abroad to be executed. Therein, I think, the Minister made a mistake: Any extension of time should have covered only shipments on the water, so that the importers would have no opportunity to take undue advantage of a generous action. , But the Minister, realizing that this industry was not estabWoollen Mills, Geelong, 250,000 yards; lished, and that cotton tweeds were not being turned out in sufficient quantities to supply the market, and not desiring to impose the duty merely for revenue purposes, allowed all fixed orders to be cleared free of duty. I am firmly convinced that some importers took an improper advantage of that concession; they pretended to have firm orders which they had not. The importations in December, 1924, were valued at £19,900, and in the corresponding month of 1925 at £64,600. That increase was startling and significant. ber aware that firm orders are placed for delivery months ahead? number of methods employed in business, and I am giving to the committee hard facts. For the quarter ended December, 1925, the importations totalled £111,000, as compared with £67,000 for the quarter ended December, 1924. Those figures prove that the importers took an undue advantage of a concession, and swelled their imports. In the light of those figures I refuse to believe that there is any shortage of cotton tweeds in Australia. Can this article be made in Australia ? The manufacturers are organized from end to end of the Continent, and, through their representative bodies, they have ascertained the capacity of all the mills, beyond their present output. As the Minister stated this afternoon, the textile industry was in a bad way. The fiscal policy is that for three years no steps were taken to protect this and many other industries. The inquiry by the Associated Chamber of Manufactures resulted in certain guarantees, promises, and undertakings. The honourable member for Perth( Mr Mann) may sneer at them; they may not all materialize, but we must give some credence to written undertakings sent to this Parliament. At any rate, if they are not fulfilled, we bave our remedy. The Sydney Woollen Mills Limited (J. Vicars and Company) offer to turn out 1,000,000 yards per annum: George Bond and Company, 500,000 yards; Tweedside Manufacturing Company, Abbotsford, 400,000 yards: Foy and Gibson, 100,000 yards; Pederal Geelong Returned Soldiers and Sailors' Woollen Mills, 50,000 yards; Airedale Mills, 50,000 yards; and the Ballarat Woollen and Worsted Company, 25,000 yards. Those undertakings practically cover the whole of the requirements of Australia. eight out of 52 mills in Australia. are comparatively small, but the company controlling them is now seeking a site for a new mill that will produce cotton tweeds. One wonderful effect of this duty is that it has given birth to at least high hopes of a new industry. I have never previously known a tariff to produce such a remarkable response in so short a time. Of all the items in the tariff on which the free traders might base their attack, that relating to cotton goods is the worse. The next question that arises is the price at which the cotton tweeds can be produced. Is the working man to be penalized by higher prices? Tweed has been produced and sold at prices ranging from Is. 9d. to 2s. 9d. per yard of 28-in. material. The average price of the English article is 3s. Sd. a yard of 54-inch.

The mere fact that a duty was necessary to assist an industry at the beginning ought to be sufficient for a good Australian. I have said before that the result of this item has been wonderful, because it has been the means already of establishing this industry. In this instance it has been shown that prior to the duty cotton tweed was not being manufactured, but looms here for the manufacture of woollen goods, many of which were idle the owing to the absence of orders, are now being used for the manufacture tive duty, which I admit this is, was imposed, a new industry was established and a market guaranteed for our manufacturers. What is the use of some honourable members opposite trying to get away from the facts by belittling our production ? We are not being penalized because we are establishing a new industry in Australia. The article produced is not any dearer, and goods are being manufactured at the imported cost. I confess that when this tariff schedule was first submitted, keen as I am for protection, I felt that a strong case would have to be made out to justify heavy duties on fhis article, and if this debate had taken place some months ago I should not have felt as strongly as I am to-day in supporting the item.

I have .no doubt that Foy and Gibson Limited would at once undertake the manufacture of cotton tweed if it could be done profitably; but it could only be done with the assistance of an extortionate duty.

The consuming public of Australia is about the last section of the people to receive consideration nowadays. Mr E. upon the Government. it is a fact. The honourable member for Yarra observed, in the course of his speech, that the honourable member for Perth( Mr Mann) had made the statement that the introduction of the tariff in September last year was something like a political trick for election purposes. If it was so, the trick was effective only within a radius of 10 or 15 miles of the Genera] Post Officesi n the capital cities. It was a rotten trick to play on the country people in every State. Next to the supreme issue of the recent elections, the people in my constituency were concerned about the proposal to impose this heavy duty on cotton tweed. The workers were disturbed about it ; but their wives, more so. I submit that there is no reason whatever to justify this practical prohibition on the importation of cotton tweeds manufactured abroad. A few prohibition in some directions. that the prohibition extends a good deal farther than he imagines. W it h' that I observed then cocksureness that characterizes all his remarks on tariff matters, the Minister suggests, and so does the honourable member for Yarra( Mr Scullin), that the imposition of this duty will enable us to manufacture our own raw material in Australia, just as the duty on woollens enables us to manufacture our own wool here. But the fact is the reverse of The Minister for that.

We ought to remember that, relatively recently, we entered into a reciprocal treaty with tbe Old Country. That treaty contains within it the possibility of much good to Australia. When we recall what the Mother Country has done for us, and not only us, but also for other countries that pulled through the Great War, any man who is prepared to treat her in this way deserves to have the stamp of ingratitude branded on him for ever.

If so, why does he speak like that? good Britisher that I never forget Britain, and by not ' forgetting her I am rendering better service to Australia. Another fallacy is that this cotton tweed is displacing Australian woollens. No more stupid statement was ever made. It can only affect Australian shoddy. Possiblyi t does do that, but to say that in the broad sense it displaces woollens is simply nonsensical. Its effect in displacing shoddy is to the infinite good of the working man.

The truly patriotic Australian tries to provide for manufacturing our requirements in our own country, thus giving employment to hundreds of thousands of additional people, and creating a well balanced, self-reliant community, and a permanent local market for the primary producers, who are so consistently misrepresented by honourable members in the Ministerial corner. One would think, to hear the honourable member for Wakefield, that the item we are discussing would rob Great Britain. But what are the facts ? It will rob not Great Britain, but Japan of £139,000 of trade per annum. That trade is constantly increasing. Great Britain supplies us with only £63,000 worth of cotton tweeds per annum, and that amount is constantly decreasing. this market Geelong Returned Sailors' & SolBritain have increased this year. honourable member will find if he consults the statistics. From the United States of America we imported £20,000 worth; from Belgium, £20,000; from Italy, £9,000 worth; and from other countries, £568 worth, making a total of oyer £250,000 worth. honourable member for Wakefield tried to lead us to believe that dear old Mother Country was being given a cowardly blow by being robbed of £63,000 worth of trade. Tbe British stated the case for the English manufacturers correctly when it said that all the manufacturers asked for was that the duty should be deferred until Australia could manufacture the goods.. answer was given eloquently by the honourable member for Yarra( Mr Scullin), who pointed out that Australia can now manufacture all . her requirements of cotton tweeds. also given that assurance. a very good reason why the expensive machinery necessary in this industry was not previously installed. The Australian companies had some doubt whether the tariff schedule would be passed. the free trade element that sits behind the Government, for tbey did not know how strong it was. They had heard a lot about free trade propaganda, and had been told that the free traders had a weakening influence on the protectionist policy of the Government. If these free trade members controlled affairs, every secondary industry would be slowly and surely strangled. Large manufacturing firms have given a guarantee to the Department for Trade and Customs to manufacture the following quantities of cotton tweeds per annum:Yards. Marrickville Woollen Mills ... 1,000,000 Geo. A. Bond& Co. Ltd., Svdnev, up to "".. 3,000,000 Tweedside Manufacturing Co. Ptv. Ltd., Abbotsford 400,000 Foy& Gibson Pty.

A certain quantity will be supplied also by J. Aitken& Sons Ltd., Hobart. It will thus be seen Yet the that the Australian manufacturers will shortly be in a position to meet the whole the of the local demand. It is but natural that there should be for a time a slight dislocation in the trade. Honourable members should afford the necessary Chamber of Manufactures measure of protection to those who are prepared to embark upon an expenditure to establish new industries, and thus give employment to Australian workmen. Tbe honourable member for Wakefield ( Mr The Foster) would lead us to believe that the withdrawal of this trade from British factories will cripple them. He is obsessed with that idea.

313,Mr Forde,"That is not so, as thedemand within six months of the imposition of the duty is an evidence of their bona fides. Complaint has been made that in Queensland and other distant States difficulty is experienced in obtaining supplies. It is the duty of the Government to investigate those complaints. The Minister( Mr Pratten) has given us the assurance that wben the schedule is passed there will be no shortage in the supply. That is sufficient for me. Some honourable members have stated that the average price of British cotton tweeds imported into Australia in 1925 was 3s. 8d. a yard for material 54 inches wide. The statement that the working men will have to pay a greater amount for the local product is discounted by the fact that Australian tweeds are manufactured at 3s. 6d. a yard for material 56 inches wide. Engineers' twist, whicfi cost 4s. 4d. per yard before a duty was placed on cottonj tweeds, now made in Australia at the same price. Given the necessary our manufacturers will install machinery that will cope with every demand. Some of the British manufacturers complained that they lost the cotton' tweed trade of Australia when the duties were imposed, despite the fact that they had installed at considerable cost plant and equipment that would have considerably developed that trade. Tbe Australian woollen mills did not get any sympathy when their trade was ruined by the huge quantities of woollen piece goods, sox and stockings that were imported from Great Britain. The figures relating to imports illustrate the gradual decline in the imports of British cotton tweeds. They are as follow:Year. 1922-23 1923-24 1924-25 I speak as the representative of a district that grows more raw cotton than any other electoral division in Australia. other industry is likely to bring about greater climate and everything else that is necessary to develop the industry from the base to the top. It has been proved that cotton grown in Queensland is equal to any in the world. As a matter of fact, Queensland raw cotton brings a higher average price than American cotton. bead per annum in America is 26 lb. We Mr Forde. can assume that the average consumption per head per annum in Australia is 20 lb., which in the aggregate amounts to 120,000,000 lb -seve n times the production in Australia. If we could overtake the demand and utilize our own raw cotton -in our cotton spinning and weaving mills, an additional £3,000,000 would be distributed amongst cotton growers in Australia. Surelyi t is a laudable ambition for any country to strive to supply all the necessary raw materials for her cpttorn-spiiining and weaving mills, and to turn out all her requirements in manufactured goods. Queensland has led the way in the encouragement of the production of the raw material, thanks to the encouragement that was given in the first instance by the Queensland Government, and latterly by the Commonwealth Government. I hope is that a bounty of 2d. per lb. on raw cotton produced will be given for a period encouragement, of at least five years. That would give such an impetus to the industry that within the next three years Australia would produce the quantity of raw cotton necessary for the manufacture of !her own requirements. member advocate a bounty iu addition to the tariff? knows that I support a bounty on' raw cotton for a period of five years in order to place the industry on a sound footing. The guaranteeing of a certain price has enabled the industry to make wonderful progress, but a bounty also is necessary, and the Tariff Board is now considering that matter. England in 1924 paid Value. out to other countries approximately £116,831 £120,000,000 for raw cotton. In 1923 £64,061 her expenditure in that direction £63,329 amounted to £91,188,745 and in 1922 .to £85,500,000. Her chief suppliers in 1924 were: United States of America, No £48,000,000; Egypt, £26,000,000; Peru, £5,283,000; British India, £5,565,000; development.

I desire a market to be established in Australia for the Australian cotton-grower. enable him to secure a higher price than he now secures on the other side of the world in competition with cotton grown in black-labour countries such as Egypt, Nigeria, and Africa. We should support this item in the tariff schedule, as it will increase the demand for our raw cotton. We should treat this as an industry possessing far-reaching influences, the ramifications of which will bring benefit to not only the city worker, but also those who are engaged in primary production. There has been a steady increase in the growth of Taw cotton, because of the encouragement that has been given to it . That is proved by the following figures relating to the production in Queensland, and its value: lb. 1919-20 1920-21 1921-22 3,878,225 88,491 1922-23 1923-24 1924-25 Those figures show that since encouragement has been given to the industry it lb. of raw cotton, valued atover £1,000,000.

[9.47] -The honourable member who has article dealing with this industry. just resumed his seat ( Mr Forde) ' has invite honourable members to peruse it'. [77] [23 MARCH , 1926.] Tariff. 1921 painted in exceedingly glowing colours a picture of the cotton-growing industry in Australia. It is, indeed, impossible to divorce consideration of the cotton growing industry in Australia from its effect upon the general community Such a market would through the tariff. The Governor General's Speech at the opening of this Parliament contained this reference to the cotton industryIt is proposed to terminate the present system of assisting the cotton industry by a guaranteed price, and in lieu thereof to stimulate the production of cotton by a bounty. The matter has been submitted to the Tariff Board for inquiry and report with a view to legislation being introduced. I should prefer to make my remarks concerning the cotton industry when that measure is before us, but as this is the first instalment of the Government policy, I shall do so now, and be as brief as possible. AlthoughI do not profess to be an expert on this subject, I believe that cotton as good as that produced in any £ other part of the world can be grown 45,581 1,038 in Australia; but, as the honourable mem922,778 21,145 ber for Wakefield ( Mr Poster) remarked, 11,769,502 264,893 it resolves itself into a question of cost. 15,179,046 314,980 One has to consider the position of the 18,188,051 343,796 world's markets, and what is being done by other countries. As we all know, reremarkable progress in cotton production has produced over 50,000,000 has been made in the Soudan and Egypt, where huge developmental schemes have been in progress since 1915. As to the Soudan, I may make the following quotation :The large developmental schemes started since 1919 for irrigation and cotton growing in the Gezira and at Kassala have not yet affected the export figures, as the schemes will not be completed till 1925. The increase in cotton exports will then be very great. ' Apart from an additional sum of these two large schemes, development is being carried out in many other districts. Thus the export of ginned eotton for 1923 was about 5,000 tons. For 1924 it should be at least 10,000 tons. As soon as the first instalment of the Gezira scheme comes into operation after 1925, This is a great it should increase to 25,000 tons, say, 135,000 bales of 400 lb., worth, at Is. per lb., f2,700,000; or, at 2s. per lb., £5,400,000. of the history of cotton growing in Australia discloses an entirely different position fromthat suggested by the honourable member for Capricornia.

Some of these difficulties still exist today. attempts made by various Governments to establish the industry on a profitable basis, and statesThe Queensland legislature in 1888 tried to revive the industry by offering a bonus of £5,000 to the first person or company who manufactured cotton goods to the value of that sum from fibre grown in the colony. The Ipswich Cotton Company thereupon established a factory and produced the goods, cotton cultivation in the West Moreton district being greatly stimulated by its operations, but in 1897 the firm was obliged to close down owing to financial difficulties. Throughout, the article emphasizes that the chief deterrent to more extensive cultivation was the high cost of picking, especially as the pickers were unskilled. ted States does not find labour costs a deterrent. my intention to detain the committee for long, and I do not propose to be diverted by the honourable member for Capricornia from the point I am seeking to make. That the position of the cotton industry The result of this fresh impetus is that the area under cotton in Queensland has increased from 72 acres in 1919 to about 35,000 acres in 1923, and the 1923-4 yield of unginned cotton was over 15,000,000 lb. The guarantee for 1924 was 5d. per lb.; for 1925 it took the form of a series of rates from 5Jd. down to 3£d., according to quality. None of these guarantees held good for ratoon cotton. In spite of the high price of cotton in the world's markets, these guarantees involved the Queensland Government in serious loss, amounting in the two years, 1922-3, to nearly £65,000; the Commonwealth shares part of this loss. growing in Australia.

Some honourable members have suggested that cotton-growing is in the same position as wool production. It is, of course, conceivable that some day it may be. I know that certain honourable gentlemen believe that it will be, but I have no such belief. In my view, profitable cotton-growing in Australia will be impossible, for the simple reason that we shall have to compete in the markets of the world with similar produce grown in other countries by cheap coloured labour. Any attempt to stimulate the industry by a bonus on the one hand and high tariff protection on the other, can only result in increased direct and indirect taxation",68,Honourable Members Hear Hear

I bave no desire to open up a general discussion on this subject, but I must say that, in my opinion, the proposed new tariff impost w ill react harshly upon a very large section of the general community. It may be that in one or two States that may not apply, but I think it will apply to South Australia, and to a great part of the Commonwealth. There will be a great increase in the cost of cotton garments, and cotton underwear. I have here a letter written to me, some months ago, by some very reputable merchants of Adelaide, which saysOn account of its strength and hard-wearing qualities, cotton tweed is used almost universally in the manufacture of clothing for the working classes, and if the present proposed duty is insisted on the worker will find himself in the position of having to pay approximately double the amount for his clothing; for example, a pair of men's working trousers, which under the old tariff were retailed at 7s. 6d., will now cost him at least 15s. It goes on to point out that so far as underwear is concerned, the working classes will have to pay treble for the low to medium grade of goods imported i u the past for their use, and as this class of goods cannot be produced in Australia, except at approximately treble the cost, the hardship to the worker is manifest. He deals briefly with towels and towelling, and, speaking generally, he saysIn generally reviewing these facts, we must ask you to take into consideration one very potent fact, and that is that the working classes are most seriously affected, and the increases they will be called upon to pay must, speaking generally, cause considerable hardship to the community, and if the proposed tariff on cotton tweed and underwear is adhered to it will mean that the importation of these goods is absolutely prohibited. On the one side we have this greatlyincreased cost, not only to the working man, but also to the poor man. I must here say that I rather resented the laughter which was excited when the honourable member for Wakefield ( Mr Foster) spoke, of the working man. The honourable member has as much right to speak for the working men in his constituency as I have to speak for those in mine. I see no reason whatever why the working man, moderate means should be forced to pay an additional price for the cotton garments he requires, unless there is some corresponding advantage to be derived, to obtain not now, but in the future, by assisting the cotton industry in this double way. did not speak in the interests of the working man when he opposed the increase of old-age and invalid pensions from 17s. 6d. to £ 1 per week. address the committee it is to give the views I really hold, and not for the purpose of exciting prejudice.

I can see no compensating advantage in the future for the additional prices which the majority of the people will have to pay for cotton goods. Very few people ever appear to think of the consumer. I have been surprised that some honourable members have not risen to say a word for him. Surely he has rights as well as the manufacturer and the primary producer. I repeat that I can see no corresponding advantage for the additional cost which the consumer will have to pay for cotton goods, and generally I agree substantially with what the honourable member for Wakefield had to say on that subject. I feel impelled to say a word or two on this question because of the loquacity of South Australian representatives on the other side, and the views to which they have given utterance in the interests, from their point of view, of tbe working man.",69,Honourable Members Hear Hear

I feel that perhaps I am better qualified to speak on behalf of the working man than is either of the three South Australian representatives-the honourable members for Angas, Wakefield, and Boothby (Messrs. Parsons, Foster, and Duncan-Hughes)who have addressed themselves to this question. The workers of South Australia do not desire to obtain a cheap product at the expense of an industry that has already been established in this country, and is a very valuable adjunct to our secondary industries. I am sure that the workers recognize the value of the product of this particular industry. I was present in the chamber this afternoon when the honourable member for Angas( Mr Parsons) was speaking, and I was somewhat amused by his spectacular demonstration of the effect upon certain materials of a test which he applied to them. The honourable member's test was far from convincing. When he was challenged to apply the same test to certain English tweeds he was not prepared to do so. Unless those who advance the results of those tests as arguments against orable member make that charge against the Australian product are prepared to apply the same tests to the imported product honourable members are not likely to be convinced by their demonstrations. Those who do support the Australian cotton tweed industry invite those who place so much dependence upon such tests to bring them any kind of imported material they please,' and give them the opportunity of putting thatmaterial to the test. If the imported materials are supplied we undertake, by the application to them of the same test, to produce the same results as were produced by its application to the Australian product. That challenge is not accepted. Honourable members opposite are not prepared to prove their bona fides, and we are therefore justified in discounting many of the utterances to which they have given expression. fidence men. larly generous mood to-night, otherwise I might say something more severe than -The community that"" about them. The great bodjr of workers in the electoral division of Hindmarsh, which is the greatest industrial district in South Australia, are prepared to extend the protection which has built up that great industrial constituency to the Australian cotton tweed industry, which they regard as of great value in helping to make Australia self-contained. The honourable member for Boothby( Mr Duncan-Hughes) quoted a letter from, I understand, a committee of the Chamber of Commerce. men's association. curred to these people that this is a wonderful opportunity for the publication of propaganda justifying an increase in their prices. They think they can make the working man believe that this Parliament will have been responsible for the increased cost of tbe goods upon which tariff duties are imposed, and that that will relieve them from the charge of profiteering. This affords a wonderful cover for warehousemen-to make an attack on tbe worker and his pocket by imposing additional duties that will bring added profits to them. a reputable firm? ber bas any doubt about what I am saying, let him read the report of the Interstate Commission dealing with clothing and textiles. He will then be thoroughly convinced as I am that warehousemen are prepared to make use of any form of cover to increase prices. The honourable member for Yarra( Mr Scullin) this afternoon ably dealt with the tariff from a truly Australian stand-point. I wish to take to task the honourable member for Wakefield ( Mr Foster) who, to-night, made an impassioned protest against what he described as the grave injury and great injustice that this tariff inflicted upon British interests. He seems to think that we are under some form of everlasting obligation to great Britain in these matters.

It seems to me that the tendency of these imposts is to inflate considerably the cost of working men's clothing. That does not commend itself to me. Our aim should be rather to cheapen the requirements of the worker. I am not satisfied that there exist in Australia looms specially designed to weave cotton tweeds. I do not claim to have expert knowledge, but I know that certain looms are used for the manufacture of woollens, others for worsteds, and yet others for cotton tweeds. I am told that certain looms designed for the weaving of woollens are being used for the production of cotton tweeds in Australia.

A t present I have too great a responsibility to my constituents to vote for an increase of duty which, while increasing the cost of living to the workers, will not commensurately advance the prosperity of Australia-. no other tariff item have I ever felt more inclined to vote for a prohibitive duty. I desire something done that wil l further my endeavours during the last five years to make the Australian people realize how absurd the policy of high protection is. I know of no better method of doing that than the imposition of the duties that are being proposed by a mad department, supported by an almost mad Parliament. The burden they involve will f a l l wholly upon the workers. The Minister has said T h a t is not the mathat the duties will be almost prohibitive.

I was interested in reading in Dunn's Weekly the other day, of one of our manufacturers who was placing all his assets into one huge company. This is the sort of thing we are encouraging in Australia by the imposition of high protective duties. opposite, such as the honourable member for Yarra( Mr Scullin), supporting the Minsteri n imposing prohibitive duties. The honourable member for Yarra, towards the conclusion of his speech, referred to unemployment in Australia; and it is a significant fact that ever since we have had high tariffs, particularly since the tariff of 1921, there has been a large increase in the number of unemployed in the Commonwealth. Yarra submitted a pair of Australian made trousers, which, he said, were made of all Australian material and sold wholesale at Rs. 2d. per pair; but the local production of this commodity will benefit only a few, and will be to the detriment of many. Isi t expected that we shall be able to purchase articles of good quality at a reasonable price as the result of the imposition of high duties ? W ill the industry which we are now asked to assist ever be able to flourish without the assistance of high protective duties? Boots, shoes and hats have been manufactured in Australia for many years with the assistance of a protective tariff, but we have never been able to produce sufficient of these articles to enable us to-enter the export trade. What position shall we occupy in connection with this and other industries if we do not alter our methods? I have I cannot not the slightest doubt that we cannot progress u n t i l the workers are paid by results, and workmen enter into some form of partnership with their employers, as is done in the United States of America, where the wages are practically double those ruling in Australia, and where they have a large export trade. tionist country. country the workers are paid by results. I am not in a position to give the wages in the textile industry; but when the committee is dealing with agricultural machinery I shall quote from American statistics to show that the wages paid in the industry in America are practically double those ruling in Australia. It is absurd to imagine that under high protective duties prices will come down to a proper level. If we wish to see Australia progress as a nation, and our population increase, we shall We find honourable members have to adopt other methods, because in trying to build up one industry by high duties we are actually destroying others of greater importance. The honourable member for Capricornia ( Mr Forde) is supporting duties ranging up to 100 per cent., and at the same time is asking for a bounty on the production of cotton. Whence is the money to come? Who is to be taxed in order to meet the heavy expenditure involved ? The wealth of the country The honourable inember for comes from the land, and if costs are made so heavy the ultimate result will be that people will be driven from our rural areas, and the operatives in the cities will bave no one to manufacture for.

The Tariff Board makes recommendations, and immediately the IVIinister introduces the schedule the duties become operative. Shortly afterwards we find that duties are being remitted, as is disclosed in the following telegram, received by the Sub-Collector of Customsi n Western Australia: Cotton tweeds for which firm order was actually placed with oversea suppliers on or before 2nd September, 1925, and which are entered for home consumption in Australia on or before 31st December, 1925, are to be admitted under Tariff item 404.

The establishment, of the cotton tweed industry in Australia may be the means of giving employment to a few additional men, but what benefit is that to Australia when we consider the huge number of persons who will be compelled to pay higher prices for a necessary commodity ? When it is found that extra prices are demanded, workers will approach the Court and say that as the cost of living has increased, their wages must also be increased. How is primary development to increase ? We shall reach a period when the primary producers will say that they cannot produce at a profit. been no increase in primary production in Australia for ten or fifteen years, and the number of migrants coming to Australia during recent years has been comparatively small. There is no inducement for people to settle in the country and, in consequence, the population in our cities has increased.

It is madness to ask tbe committee to agree to some of the high duties proposed in this tariff, which in the interests of the people of Australia. I strongly oppose. propose to speak briefly on this matter. The honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr Makin) appears to think that he is -better fitted than any other honourable member of this House to speak for the working man; but I am able to say that working men all over the country realize that the burden of this impost w ill f a l l on them.

If the people of Australia will take the bit between their teeth and rush to destruction, they must suffer for it. If they w ill not learn through their head, they must learn through their bellies.

When I see manufacturers making these goods, and employing'Australian labour under those conditions, I am prepared to assist them to the utmost of my ability, always with thisi n view; that while we accept the policy of protection as put forward by this Government, ultimately we shall introduce a better policy, which will include protection for the workers, the consumers, and the manufacturers. Por the time being our task is to build up a great Australian nation, and we can do that only by protecting Australian industries, which are financed by Australian capital, and, in some instances, I am pleased to say, by -American and English capital. While we are prepared to allow England, America, Japan, or other countries to make our goods, they will make them under the conditions prevailing in those countries; but if we make it impossible for them to supply us from overseas, the incentive is for them to bring capital to this country and invest large sums of money here. We have evidence of that in Ford's and Dodge Brothers' motor works, and in the manufacture of machinery, electrical instruments, and many other things. We have had, I suppose, more than twenty illustrations of American and English capital being forced to come to this country by the protection we afford to Australian industries. years' time, as a result of this policy, we shall have in this country, notwithstanding the calamity howlers, vast industrial undertakings.

I cannot register a silent vote on this item. on item No. 1. I brought under the Minister's notice certain representations made to me by old and established firms in Brisbane. I said that in Queensland it had not been possible to secure supplies of Australian-made cotton tweeds, and I also said that the firms who had made representations to me had clearly stated that they were not opposed to the duty if the Parliament thought i l necessary. I put several questions to the Minister, and have since received his replies to them.

Aitkin and Sons, Hobart. Question -The approximate aggregate quantity of cotton tweeds produced for the twelve months ended the 30th June, 1925? Answer -This information is not available, hut it is believed that the quantity turned out was very small indeed. Question -The anticipated aggregate quan tity to be produced for the year ending the 30th June, 192«? Answer -It is extremely difficult to give the precise information owing to the fact that the imported cotton tweeds ordered before the 3rd September last were permitted to come in free up to the 31st December, 1925. The following information is, however, given of guarantees undertaken and given to the Department as to the quantities of cotton tweeds the mills are prepared to produce:Bond and Co., Sydney, up to 3,000,000 yards per annum; Marrickville Woollen Mills, 1,000,000 yards per annum; Tweedside Manufacturing Co. Pty Ltd., In. twenty, 400,000 yards per annum; Federal Woollen Mills Pty. Ltd., 250,000 yards per annum; Foy and Gibson, 100,000 yards per annum; Geelong Returned Sailors and Soldiers' Co-operative Manufacturing Co., 50,000 yards per annum; Airedale Mills, Footscray, 50,000 yards per annum (if proposed item passed by Parliament, they will increase plant and produce 1,000,000 yards per annum); Ballarat Worsted and Woollen Co., 25,000 yards per annum; J.
