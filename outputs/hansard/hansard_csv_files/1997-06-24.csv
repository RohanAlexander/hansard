As we said yesterday and as we have said Once again we come before this House with to the very heart of the defence which the a very serious matter to raise. The Leader of Acting Prime Minister brought to this place the Opposition ( Mr Beazley) in moving this today. The fact is that, in answer to a question censure motion has done so on the basis quite in this parliament last Thursday, this minister simply of matters which have been raised for small business once again sought to over a period now in connection with the conceal the truth from the parliament as to the Minister for Small Business and Consumer extent of telephone conversations with Mr Affairs( Mr Prosser). As a minister of the Nick Greiner, the deputy chairman of Coles Crown he has used his ministerial position in Myer, in respect of a lot in Bunbury, Western a way which we believe is in conflict with his Australia, a lot on which the minister for duties as a minister, has used his ministerial small business and his business partner-his position to advantage perhaps his own busi . . brother, the manager of his business, as he ness interests and has used his ministerial claims in this place-sought to get some position quite obviously to mislead this material benefit.

We will wait and see on that ques . . ministerial code of conduct that the Prime tion. Minister( Mr Howard) has laid down went to But the simple fact is that, the moment the very specific matters. The Deputy Prime minister for small business-and I think in his Minister( Mr Tim Fischer), Acting Prime heart of hearts the Deputy Prime Minister Minister, in defence-if you could call it knows this-put his hand on the telephone, that-of his minister today tried to say that lifted it up and dialled Nick Greiner, he was that ministerial code of conduct has been in breach of ministerial standards and the satisfied at every term. Acting Prime Minister, ministerial codes laid down by his Prime let me remind you of five important elements Minister. The Deputy Prime Minister, the of that ministerial code.

That fax whether the price of fruit and vegies was from Mr Greiner said: going to be up or down next week. He did not do that. As I have previously indicated, Mr Geoff Prosser rang me. We had a short conversation. He rang him up to ask him about planning issues and issues associated with the Eaton lot That should be enough to hang this minister in Western Australia. If that is not the case, then and there. A minister of the Crown has why did this minister come in last night and rung the Deputy Chairman of Coles Myer supposedly correct the record-supposedly, about his business interests. Where in this fax with his introduction, at the first opportunity? in its entirety, does it mention Eaton, Acting Minister, it was not the first opportunity. Prime Minister?

You have got to be able to say what a Target store as a key tenant for his Eaton influence he had, how that affected Coles shopping centre'. That is the allegation, but Myer and how that conflict was used not for where is the evidence? There were two parties the public purpose but for his personal gain. to the conversation. One was the minister Where is the personal gain? The first thing himself who said, 'I rang Nick Greiner in you should start off by saying is, 'Here is the order to get a contact.' The other is Mr Nick personal gain, here is how it arose and here Greiner who said, 'He rang me in order to get is where the minister had a conflict between a contact.' Where is the discussion about personal gain and his public office.' But there securing the Target store? is no personal gain. You cannot start with the first factual proposition in relation to that. I will tell you who has been misleading the House here: the shadow minister for small So what do you get? A bevy of allegations business and consumer affairs. He started raised under parliamentary privilege-by misleading the House yesterday. He asked this people who do not know any better-on the question: theory that, if you can create enough smoke, people are going to say, 'There must be Is the minister aware that Mr Greiner was reported something going on, because why would they in the Age on 20 June as saying that the minister waste parliament's time and why would they had discussed getting a Target store into one of his waste all that effort if there was nothing to shopping centres? it?' The truth is painful. They waste all that That was the allegation put to the Minister for time because they want to take attention off Small Business and Consumer Affairs.

It You get up here and say that the Age has would be very different if they were engaged alleged that Prosser has been on the phone in it on a daily basis, and the code of conduct trying to get a Target store into his shopping is quite clear. You want to read out that centre. He does not have the Age, he does not phrase, 'daily work.' What have you got to know what has been reported. When you go show that he was engaged in daily work? The to the Age, it says that Mr Prosser had asked Labor Party's charge is that this is a minister him if he knew of a contact at Target stores, who is engaged in daily work. Why? Because a Coles Myer subsidiary. That is exactly what in four months he made a telephone call. the minister himself said. I have got to tell you it gives you an insight didn't he answer-three times?
