The Government have considered the matter, and are not prepared to offer any increase in the rate of interest. The conditions under which the loan is offered are sufficiently liberal to justify all patriotic persons who have money to lend in investing in the loan. Tlie conditions under which the British loan were offered were quite different. In come tax is chargeable in respect of the interest paid on the British loan, and the loan, . it must be remembered, was a conversion loan.

54,Mr Speaker,"I have received anFive honourable members having risen in their places, Question proposed. bring forward this"" question, firstly, because it is of very vital importance to the town of Lithgow, which I have the honour to represent; and, secondly, because I think, on national grounds, there is every justification for leaving the Small Arms Factory where it is and effecting any necessary extensions there, instead of incurring the enormous expense of transferring the whole plant and the men to' Canberra, in addition to installing any new plant that may arrive at the Federal Capital. Apart from the intrinsic merits of the proposition, to my mind the Public Works Committee, in the first place, and the Government, in the second place, have been guilty of tactlessness of the most extreme character in announcing at this particular juncture that it is intended to transfer the manufacture of small arms to Canberra. A f t e r considerable agitation and a great deal of trouble we have stimulated the Small Arms Factory to work a double shift. The assistance of the people of Lithgow has been a material factor in bringing about that result, and in many cases they have voluntarily suffered in convenience in order to accommodate the extra men now employed at the factory. The general impetus given to Lithgow by the establishment of the factory there was very great, and an additional impetus was given by the announced intention of the Government to increase the size and output of the establishment. people were unanimous and happy in rendering all possible assistance to facilitate the output of arms in this time of national trouble. But suddenly, like a bolt from the blue, comes the proposal to shift the whole concern to Canberra. When the transfer is to take place is not stated in the report of the Public Works Committee, and when I put a question to the Prime Minister he replied t h a t it was not intended to move the factoryI did not for a moment think it wasbut that a new building was to be erected in the Federal Capital area which would house the new machinery when it, arrived. answer. tory in it . Even were it advisable to remove the factory from Lithgow, it was distinctly unwise to announce the fact at this juncture, when the Government are asking for the unanimous co-operation of the people resident in the centre where the small arms are being manufactured, and who have ' been of material assistance in increasing the output. This new policy is announced without justification, and even if there were justification, the unwisdom of taking such a step now must be apparent to all. Already the town has stagnated, and whereas up t ill about a week ago, the Town Council was receiving applications for twenty building permits per week in order to accommodate the extra workmen, it is now receiving none. Those people who are temporarily housing the extra employees of the factory find that responsibility irksome and require further accommodation. Instead of providing them with that accommodation, we are imposing on them the burden of keeping those men, knowing all the while that in the course of time the factory is to be shifted. The folly of such an announcement is hard to assess. Eveni f it be necessary to remove the factory from Lithgow, knowing that the transfer cannot be effected for a couple of years, wby should the Government throw a pall over the town now ? We might as well have a German aeroplane hovering over L it h gow. The enthusiasm of the people has vanished; their aspirations are ended, and the heart has been taken out of the town. The lack of imagination on the part of the men who recommended this step is beyond my comprehension. We, The whole as a party, were particularly careful in nominating to the Public Works Committee the cream of the party, men of judgment-me n who it was thought would not commit an error of this kind. So careful were we on this point that we declined to give the Opposition a f u l l sh£re of representation, and insisted on having six members on the Committee to the Liberal party's three, because we desired to assure ourselves that what was done by the Committee would be sound. But what have they done? They have come forward with a scheme that cannot be carried into effect for two years, and by the announcement of which they are cutting across the grain of the efforts which the townspeople of Lithgow are making to meet the sudden demand for arms. They are suffering by this announcement of policy, and their properties have been depreciated by 50",8,Adjournment Formal Removal Of Lithoow Small Arms Factory

57,Mr Carr,"There is nothing satisfacper cent. What sort of imagination must the members of the Committee possess when they could put forward such a proposal? women in Lithgow because the prospects of their husbands are ruined. The whole proposal to my mind is an outrage, and represents a tactlessness that it would be hard to parallel. After all that has been done to get this factory going at Lithgow, this is the result. We are told by the Prime Minister that the factory cannot be moved-in fact thai it will not be moved-and the meaning of that can only be that the plant will be ultimately taken away. This, of course, is just as bad as if it were taken away At once. It is sufficient to damn the prospects at Lithgow, and a proposal of the kind is deserving of the severest censure. Not only is the contemplated action tactless, but the whole idea is entirely impracticable for various reasons. To quote the high-flown language of the limited report which the Public Works Committee has supplied, I say that, "" on broad national grounds "" it is unwise to (have this factory removed from where it is to the Pederal Capital area. If it is not intended to move the factory as it stands, with the men and machinery, it is intended to have two factories, with two sets of overhead charges and other incidental expenses; and such an idea seems to me altogether too foolish, even for the Public Works Committee or the Government. It is suggested that the removal -of the factory will make no difference to Lithgow, where some other industry may ""be undertaken. But I say that it will make a difference to that town, because there is nothing that can be substituted for such a permanent undertaking, and the severing of personal interests cannot be atoned for. If there be a demand for some other kind of factory, let Canberra have it-let benefit of the new idea; it is not required in Lithgow, where there are many advantages for the manufacture of small arms not presented at the Federal Capital. I should like to quote some of the figures of the Public Works Committee to show how impractical their proposal is, and how ill-digested their report. And this is the committee which was appointed from the cream of our party to see that no errors of the kind were made! The Committee -say that for the extra land and buildings Mr Carr. at Lithgow, including power plant and so forth, the cost will run to £66,000, and that they can put up a building, with To-day there are weeping power plant, at Canberra for £92,100, with, twice the capacity of the present factory. 1 deny that that is so, and I shall tell honourable members why. To begin with, the £66,000, the estimated cost for the additions at Lithgow, includes £10,000 for additional power plant, while there is no allowance made in the £92,100 for a similar purpose. Why? Because there is already at Canberra a gigantic power plant with very little to do. berra is just large enough for the efficient service of that place, and it would have to be added to for the purposes of a Small Arms Factory. not, the fact remains that in estimating the cost of a new factory, any sound business man, with an elementary knowledge of bookkeeping, would allow for the cost of a power plant. In order, however, to discredit the existing factory, the Public Works Committee, with their idea of concentrating all works in this Utopia they are dreaming about, leave out, as is customary with dreamers, the actual cost that must be faced, though they do not forget to include it when they speak of works at Lithgow. I suppose Canberra is going to be the'haven of officialdom; and the Public Works Committee have apparently accepted official ideas on the subject; in fact, the members of the Committee have simply been bulldozed. Further, the Lithgow estimate makes the assumption that 10 acres of ground will cost £300 per acre, that 50 acres will cost £250 an acre, or £12,500, and another 50 acres will have a similar price, making £28,000 in all. I Canberra have the am in a position to say, however, that I could get the necessary land at Lithgow for £10.000 or less. here, namely, 110 acres, I would undertake to get for £10,000 while the Committees say it will cost £28,000. The value in my opinion, haa been intentionally inflated by the officials, who have not gone the proper way to work to ascertain how the land can be bought. If the Government, some years ago, had taken the advice of the honourable member for Darwin,",9,Adjournment Formal Removal Of Lithoow Small Arms Factory

61,Mr Carr,"The acreage estimated-wheu he was a Minister, they would have adopted a cheap and effective scheme; hut, as is usual when a practical, common sense proposal is made, they turned the deaf ear, preferring to listen to officials who, of course, know everything. The idea of men, who claim to be business men asserting that similar land at Can| berra will cost only £ 5 5 0 ! to learn that land in the Federal Capital will be of less value than Lithgow land. A t any rate, there is the potential value in the Federal area. real value by placing works there. works there. Why destroy a flourishing town to build a fanciful capital? The proposal is open to the gravest possible objection. the works from my electorate to the Federal Capital. talks very largely and easily, but if he looks into these matters he will see that they develop an entirely different aspect. In order to show the absurdity of the estimated cost at Canberra, let us consider what was tlie original cost of the Factory at Lithgow, exclusive of land and fittings. According to the original contract, the buildings at Lithgow cost £55,890, exclusive, as I say, of land and equipment. Since then-thoug h the report of the Committee takes no cognisance of this-some think like £10,000 has been spent on additions to the buildings, and, approximately, £10,000 on officers' dwellings!which are of the best in Lithgow, and may be described as palatial. A f t e r all this has been done, it is proposed to play fastand-loose with the interests of the town. If we add this £20,000 to the original cost, we find a total expenditure of £75,890. The two items' of £10,000 each are my own, but they are substantially correct. The Committee, however, did not take them into consideration, but only had regard to the original contract price. The Committee, in their report, go on to say that for the £92,100 at Canberra there will be provided a complete structure with twice the capacity of the present works. In order to obtain a fair test, we must deduct from that £92,100 the sums mentioned in schedules 2, 3, and 4 in appendix A of this report.

Labour difficulties have also to be* considered, and we have also to bear in mind there will be no educational and other facilities, all of which will tend to discourage men from going there. Men employed at the Small Arms Factory are for the most part trained men, of high intellectual order. They draw good wages, and they want educational facilities in order to give their children a chance in life, and they do not want to be taken away from all the conveniences of civilization. Added to this, we have to bear in mind that all the people who go there will be disfranchised. Before any recommendation was made by the Public Works Committee, all preliminaries of this sort should have been threshed out.

I have on a previous occasion told the Government that there is at Randwick a plant capable of adding 100 per week to the output of small arms. Yet that plant has been idle for twelve months because of some dispute between Mr Balsillie, the Government wireless exto small arms purposes, would increase the pert, and the owners of the place. I understand that Father Shaw is one of the principals; I do not know who is identified with him-but the position is as I have stated, nevertheless. The premises were offered to the Government for £45,000. Included in the offer was machinery which alone cost £75,000, some of it equal to anything we have in the Small Arms Factory; yet nothing has been done.

We are proposing to do something which we cannot possibly do for two years, and, in the meantime, we have damaged a flourishing community like that of Lithgow by this premature announcement. opinion it is a shame and disgrace that the machinery at Randwick should have been allowed to remain idle on account of some paltry dispute brought about by a gentleman who came out a discredited man, and who, I make bold to say, is a further discredited man because of his retwenty months or two years. We have commendation regarding this plant.

77,Mr Carr,"They are, and have beenis still dreaming about tbe Utopia at Canberra and bringing in a proposal that will only have the effect of disturbing all the carefully-prepared efforts that have been made to stimulate the output of rifles, and taking the heart out of the people. The Public Works Committee would have been much better occupied had it given attention to the housing of our soldiers, instead of making suggestions of this kind, which cannot take effect for some years. I draw attention to the injustice of what has been done. The Government Owes something to the town of Lithgow. Surelyi t is not government to l if t towns up, and then to drop them again. it is not the business of Governments to boost a township here, and another there, and then to withdraw all support, leaving the townsfolk to struggle as best they may, after they have spent their money in making accommodation for the works that the Government had established. This wanton action is as vicious as it is disastrous. The proposition that has been made has affected, not merely the original settlers in the town, but at least 200 of those who have gone there comparatively recently, and have invested in property there. The Committee puts down the number as only ninety-five. The value of the houses and property owned by these persons runs into many thousands of pounds, but the announcement that the Small Arms Factory was to be removed to Canberra has been as effective in depreciating the value of that property as the removal of the Factory would be. The townspeople have provided accommodation for the convenience of tlie 500 men who have been brought to Lithgow to work in the Factory, and should receive some better return than the wholesale depreciation of their town values. stability of the Factory has gone, and confidence in the stability of the Government is gone too, so far as Lithgow is concerned. Other towns will, no doubt, feel much as Lithgow feels, and wonder when the long arm of the Federal Government will be stretched forth to steal away what they have been giving, in order that this isolated refuge whicli the oflicials have made for themselves at Canberra, and which is going; to be made for workmen as well, may be fostered. ber's time has expired. am glad that the honourable member for Macquarie has raised this question. I have not been able to find, either in the report of the Public Works Committee, or elsewhere, any justification of the step recommended. The honourable member has dealt faithfully with the main line3 of the recommendations of the Committee, but, to my mind, these recommendations are more to be deplored because of what is omitted than because of what is stated. The Committee speaks of the cost of building at Lithgow arid a function of Canberra, the cost of land at tlie two places, and the cost of installing maSurely chinery at one place, without taking into account the cost of installing it at the other; but it has entirely overlooked the prime essentials that govern the considerations of business men when they locate a factory: these being, first, availability of raw materials, and, secondly, availability of labour. In regard to these essentials, it is proposed to go from a place which has them in part, to a place which is wholly without them. There is no steel at Canberra, no iron, and no coal. Every ton of coal that is used there must be brought there by train, and enormous freights must be paid for its transport. Similarly, every ton of steel that is used there will have to pay heavy railway carriage. Then, when the rifles have been made, it will be found that the freight from Canberra to the sea-coast is larger than that from L it h gow to the sea-coast. I do not say that Lithgow is an ideal site for the Small Arms Factory. Personally, I think that the Factory ought to have been established in a large centre of population, such as Sydney or Melbourne, but preferably Newcastle. But if you go away from such cities as those, I doubt whether you Confidence in the can get a much better place than L it h gow. You certainly have advantages there which do not exist at Canberra. rail with districts to the west, south, east, and north of it . Canberra has no advantage for the successful manufacture of rifles. In a casual conversation with the Director-General of Public Works, I asked what he thought the cost of making rifles at Canberra would be.

It is about time the House and the country woke up to what is being proposed. The Government are proposing to remove the Small Arms Factory from a centre where iron is being produced from native ores, where there is already an unlimited coal supply, and tlie elements of all the materials of manufacture, to another site where we have at present no industrial population, and no raw material for the manufacture of rifles, and where the cost of manufacturing rifles in Australia will be loaded for all time. The proposal should be dropped. It is about time the people realized what is sought to be done, and that it is altogether wrong. I hope that the Government will not proceed with the proposition, and that, if on no other grounds, they will, at any rate, take time to consider the whole matter on the plea put forward by the representative of the district that the removal of the Factory will destroy the loyal co-operation of every person connected with the turning out of rifles at Lithgow afc the present time. effect.

Here, then, we have the evidence of three of the most expert men in Australia in the manufacture of rifles that it was a mistake in the first place to erect the FacThen, again, a further proposal was that tory there. Tliat mistake was made before the appointment of the Public Works Committee, and prior to the selection of the site for the Pederal Capital. In view of all these facts, the Public Works' Committee had to determine what was the best course to pursue. The honourable member for Wentworth has said, "" The Public Works Committee are proposing to remove the Pactory from the district where the raw material, in the shape of pig iron and steel, is manufactured, to a site where there is none."" Such a plea might carry some weight with those who are not acquainted with the actual facts. The truth is that not one ounce of locally manufactured steel has been used in the production of rifles at Lithgow. All the 6teel required for the manufacture of rifles has to be imported and carried from the seahoard by rail to Lithgow. So much for the first argument. ried much further if the Factory be established at Canberra? member for Macquarie has laid great stress on the point that the removal of the Factory from Lithgow will greatly disturb and upset that town. No town in the Commonwealth owes more to the Federation. Lithgow, which, according to the honourable member, will be ruined if we remove this factory, has received, by way of bounties from this Parliament, no less than £180,000 to keep its iron works going, to say nothing of the benefit that it has derived from the employment of a large number of men in the Commonwealth Small Arms Factory there. The people of Lithgow have no reason to complain of their treatment at the hands of the Federal Government. The Public Works Committee must be guided by the evidence, and there is an overwhelming volume of evidence that Lithgow is not a suitable site for a Small Amis Pactory. If a mistake was made in establishing it there in the first place, surely we have no right to perpetuate that mistake by proposing to extend the Factory. An important consideration is that the making of additions to the Factory would interfere with its output. In order to duplicate it, one end of the Factory would have to be taken out and partitions put up. That would interfere with the work of the Factory at the present time. another story should be added to one part of the building, and that additions should be made to the front elevation. We could not make such alterations without upsetting the arrangement of the Factory. need not have that effect. t.he plans say that it would. If additions were made, then the power plant would also have to be increased. That, in itself, would be an expensive item. Turbines and additional boilers would have to be put in, and this work would also hamper the output of the Factory. The members of the Public Works Committee considered that they should endeavour, if possible, to devise a scheme whereby the output of rifles in Australia could be increased without any interference whatever with the present work of the Factory. The honourable member for Wentworth, cheered by the honourable member for Macquarie, said that there was railway The honourable communication between Sydney and Lithgow, and that all the material could be brought up at very little cost. The cost of building tlie Factory at Lithgow, however, was largely increased by reason of the. fact that tliere was-and there still is -n o railway communication with the site, so that the material had to be carted over very bad roads for a considerable distance. A t Canberra, on the other hand, we have one site, amongst others, that is almost alongside the railway line. Material would not have to be carted half-a-mile from the railway to that site. Then, again, it is proposed that the Factory at Canberra shall be built of concrete, and in the bed of the river, quite close to one of the suggested sites, there is an unlimited supply of material for the making of concrete. That material will cost us nothing since it is in our own Territory. As one who is in the building line, and, therefore, knows a little about building, I venture to say that the making of additions to the present Factory would be very costly.

A t the present time there are nearly 1,000 men working in and about the Federal City. They have not ideal homes to live in , but still they go there to work. able member's time has expired. I do not wish to go into the general question of the recommendation of a majority of the members of the Public Works Committee to remove the Small Arms Factory from Lithgow to Canberra. desire only to offer some observations on the proposal of the Cabinet to establish a new factory at Canberra, and to allow the existing factory to continue at L it h gow-for how long, I do not know. This is entirely a new proposal. The majority of the members of the Committee decided ' ' that it is desirable to transfer the Commonwealth Small Arms Factory from Lithgow to Canberra, and that a building of double the capacity of the present factory be erected in the Federal Capital area."" Six members voted in favour of and three against that proposal. The minority were of opinion that the existing factory at Lithgow should be doubled in size. When the Committee's recommendation comes before the House, I hope to have an opportunity of explaining my own action in voting against the transfer of the Factory to Canberra. In my opinion, the weight of evidence presented to the Committee was in favour, not of removing the whole factory to Canberra, b u t of doubling the size of the existing establishment at Lithgow. Members of the Committee will agree with me that the question of allowing the present factory to continue to manufacture rifles at Lithgow, and at the same time to erect a separate factory at Canberra, is one that was not seriously considered by the Committee; at any rate, the records will show that no decision was given by the Committee on that particular issue. Now a new situation has arisen by the decision of the Cabinet to spread the manufacture of small arms over two factories of equal sise. The conduct of two separate factories must increase the overhead and administrative costs, and also the cost of the product. I desire, by an argument L e t tiie honourable memon purely business principles, to show that if the decision of the Cabinet is carried out it will involve the Commonwealth in an enormous expenditure which is entirely without justification. to make an announcement of the transfer at this stage? of the Cabinet was unwise. I do not propose to deal with the matter of the erection of workmen's^homes. It is possible to purchase land at Lithgowf o r the purpose of increasing the number of workmen's homes, in addition to the 100 houses or blocks of land which have already been purchased by the Factory [workmen at Lithgow. If a factory is established at Canberra, the land required I for workmen's dwellings will probably cost £ 1 per foot, or £ 5 0 or £60 per block. It is not a fair argument to say that land can be bought in Canberraf or £ 4 10s. per acre, because the enormous expenditure there w ill mean that every workman who acquires a home w ill hie required to pay a ground rent that w ill probably be equal to the interest t h a t would be paid, on the freehold value of land at Lithgow. However, I shall deal with that aspect of the matter when the Committee's report is under consideration. If the new plant which has been recommended by the Committee is in stalled in a separate factory of the same size as that existing at Lithgow, instead of being added to the plant in the present factory, and if it is desired to get from the second factory the same output as from the first, it will be necessary to incur an expenditure, based on that of the Lithgow establishment, of not less than £155,000. Mr Wright, in his report for the year 1913, said that the cost of buildings already erected at Lithgow was £55,890, and of plant £79,871. we have gained nothing by experience? we shall have to pay more for plant now because the price is increased on account of the war, and, whilst the cost of the buildings was much in excess of the original estimate, I have yet to learn that it was excessive for buildings of that character. The power, heat, and lighting plant cost £1.2,966, office requisites, furniture and fittings £1,639, factory fittings and furniture £ 3 , 6 1 1 , and",17,Adjournment Formal Removal Of Lithoow Small Arms Factory

We are faced with the necessity of increasing our output of small arms, and I have heard no reason yet why there should not be erected a factory capable of doubling the present output, thus really making the production of rifles fourfold what it was some little time ago. There is the fact that at Canberra we have the necessary power, and it ought to be utilized. Further, I do not believe in dual control-in allowing a State authority to have anything, directly or indirectly, to do with works that are necessary in the Commonwealth-and any works erected at Canberra will, of course, be under our own exclusive authority. The question of the interests of particular districts should not be introduced into a matter of this kind. If such questions are to be introduced, then I may claim to have a grievance, because I think that the Small Arms Factory ought to have been in Hindmarsh. I am not a Canberra fanatic, and I do not for one moment suggest that every activity should be centred there, regardless of common-sense considerations.

I am merely saying what is in my own mind; and it does not occur to me that two factories can be kept permanently going. Does the honourable member for Macquarie think that it is the intention of the Government to raffle the Factory at Lithgow? Is there no other purpose to which that Factory could be put 1 purposes. Minister has expired. have some sympathy with the Minister in being asked to discuss a question without having been given proper notice. A t the same time. I think that, with the information we have, and which, I presume, was available to him, he should have been able to give a very definite answer to the question raised by the honourable member for Macquarie. To my mind, the answer given by the Prime Minister yesterday was quite misleading. I am strongly of opinion, and I am supported by the information before us, that the Department of Home Affairs is preparing plans for a factory which is going to house, not only the plant that has been ordered, but also the plant at the present time at Lithgow. As the Minister has said, it would be absurd to have two factories going; and if a straightforward answer had been given, the been informed that it is the intention of the Government, as soon as it is necessary, to move the machinery from Lithgow to Canberra. I have no particular anxiety for the residents either of Lithgow or Canberra in dealing with this matter. To me the only question is as to what is best in the interests of the Commonwealth, and I can see not the slightest justification for the suggestion that the Small Arms Factory' [201] should be removed. The site at Lithgow did not appeal to me at any time. it is a good one. who also objected to it, pointed out in his evidence before the Public Works Committee that the site at Lithgow was Governso far away from any large centre of population that he thought that the right person labour difficulty would become acute. Had he had his way, Engineer Clarkson said, he would have established the Factory near Melbourne or Sydney. In answer to a question by myself, Captain Clarkson said he did not think it would be a good business proposition to move the Factory to Canberra, and he repeated that if he were to select a site he should look for one near a centre of population. If any change is to be made in the location of this Factory, according to the expert evidence, it should be to some site where the management would be able to get plenty of labour, and have a good choice of workmen. How are we going to improve the position from this point of view by going to Canberra? Lithgow already has a magnificent water supply, coal, gas, and other conveniences. We have iron and steel there, and I believe that if the requirements of the Small Arms Factory were sufficiently great, we should be able to get all the steel we require either from Lithgow or Newcastle. The same cannot be said of Canberra. The last balance-sheet issued in respect of the Factory's operations in 1913 showed a deficiency of about £190,000, after a heavy expenditure on machinery and stocks. We know, also, that there was a big initial loss, which might occur again at Canberra, and are we going to repeat that loss simply because somebody with a fad thinks we can use the Lithgow Factory for some other purpose than that to which it is now put? T agree with the member for the district House would doubtless have in what he has said regarding the schedule that has been placed before us. In that it is suggested that a factory can be built at Canberra for less than the additions at Lithgow would cost. I say now, after giving full consideration to the statement. I ' am making, that I believe these statements were made either without proper care, or that they were deliberately misleading.

When the Commonwealth Munitions Committee was formed, it was asked to consider the following qiiestions:(1) The supply of material to Australian Government by Australian manufacturers. (2) Government manufacture of war materiel. (3) Contracts between War Office and Australian manufacturers. And in its investigation it was instructed to consult with sectional trade committees which might be formed, or with individuals. For tlie information and satisfaction of the delegates of the Associated Chambers of Manufactures and Commerce, States Governments, universities, &c, the following brief resume of the work of the. Commonwealth Munitions Committee is given:(1) The Supply of Material to Government by Australian Large quantities of war materiel of Australian manufacture have been, and are still being, supplied to the Commonwealth Government for the equipment of the Expeditionary Forces. f2) Materiel. The Committee is collecting information for the preparation of a report on how best to increase tlie output from Government workshops of rifles, small arms, 18-pr. cartridges, cordite, & c , and what new factories should be erected for the manufacture of machine guns, tubes, fuses, & c , so as to render Australia independent of outside sources for the production of munitions of war, and the raw materials used in the manufacture thereof. (3) Australian The Associated Chambers of Manufactures bave been asked to supply a list of munitions of war (exclusive of shells and ammunition) which it considered its members could supply, and the Commonwealth Munitions Committee now awaits this information. Light rails, sleepers, and waggons, which the Committee was informed could be expeditiously supplied in large numbers, were offered to the British Munitions Department, but a cable reply was received yesterday (12th July), that the supply of these items in Britain exceeds requirements. When the report of the Associated Chambers of Manufactures is to hand, other items w ill be submitted to the Home Government with a view to securing contracts. As regards shell bodies, cartridges, & c for same, the manufacture of these could not be commenced until the Commonwealtli Government had from the British Government some definite assurance that it wanted shells, inforriiation as to type of shell required, and whether Australian-made shells would be accepted. Because of the huge amount of work [201]2 entailed in the organization of the new Department, the British Munitions Department was unable to give early attention to repeated cabled' requests for information from Australia, but a reply has now been received that high explosive shell are required, and will be purchased at a price, and that f u l l specifications and drawings have been sent, but until these arrive, the work of making shells cannot be proceeded with . Meantime, every preparation possible has been made: a specification of tlie steel to the correct formula has been issued, sample casts have been made by the BrokenH ill Proprietary Company, and a sub-committee of experts is at present in Newcastle inspecting the processes of manufacture of thc steel with a view to making physical and chemical tests. To commence, it is proposed to make forgings of shell bodies at two selected centres (preferably one in JTew South Wales, and the other in Victoria), to facilitate inspection, and for the same reason the number of firms asked to finish the first shell bodies will be limited u n t i l the best procedure of handling, manufacture, and inspection of shells has been discovered and approved, when provision will be made for the instruction and training of mechanics in the making Australian of shell bodies. Manufacturers. In order to further facilitate this work and secure uniformity in all manufacturing centres, the Commonwealth Munitions Committee think it desirable that the various subcommittees in each State, comprising GovernGovernment Manufacture of War ment representatives, Chambers of Manufactures and Commerce, universities, labour organizations, and large engineering firms, &c, should amalgamate, forming what may be styled State Munitions Committees. The subcommittees in each State would be represented on, and would report to, the State Munitions Committee, which in turn would report to the Commonwealth Munitions Committee in Melbourne. All instructions, &c., from the Commonwealth Munitions Committee would be issued through tlie State Munitions Committees. Letters have already been addressed to Contracts between War Office and the Premiers of each State suggesting the Manufacturers. above amalgamation. I propose to this Conference that each State Committee should be asked to nominate a member to represent tliat State on the Central Munitions Committee. Co-operation of various educational bodies and large engineering firms is desired in the matter of selecting suitable inspectors for shell. Gauges for high explosive shell are now being made, and, as soon as tested and approved, the necessary number w ill be completed. Twenty-five provisional drawings of high explosive shell w ill be issued immediately. Provisional specification for manufacturing is now being compiled, and instructions for, and duties of, inspectors have been almost completed, so that until drawings and specifications and the forged blanks are available, much further advance cannot be made. It is, however, recommended that intending manufacturers of shell bodies should select and prepare such existing lathes and grinding machines as they may have available in their shops, so that no time may be lost when the forgings are ready for them. Shops w ill be inspected as soon as reported as suitable for accommodation had been provided for the manufacturing shell, but the Commonwealth treatment of cases at the Victoria Barracks by Munitions Committee desire to draw particular the Dental Relief Board? attention to the repeated warnings in cablegrams from tlie High Commissioner that many affairs yet been remedied and reasonable difficulties are encountered in the manufacture accommodation provided? of shell bodies, and that the percentage of rejections have in the early stages of manufacture been extraordinarily high.

Navy) [4.38] -That is a very difficult question for a Minister to answer, as it depends upon the extent of the injury and the state of incapacity. If a soldier is only partially incapacitated, he will, in all probability, be able to earn a certain amount of money. Mr J. H . CATTS I mean, what allowance is made while he is wounded and under hospital treatment? pay until he is discharged. He is, bf course, in receipt of pay while in hospital at Alexandria, on board ship, or in hospital in Australia. I would like to hear an explanation from the Minister in connection with a case in my own district. A lady, whose husband has been in an asylum for the last seventeen years, has two sons at the front, one being a married man. understand that, in the case of incapacity of her sons, she cannot sign the papers, because she is not a widow. can discuss that case under clause 12, which deals with the amendment of section 8 of the principal Act. do not know whether we can discuss under clause 12 the matter discussed by the Tasmania-Fo r Defence honourable member for South Sydney, but it is one of very considerable importance. I know of a case in whicli the circumstances are similar. member will not be in order in discussing it on this clause; he will have an opportunity later on. my mind is that of a mother who has two lads at the front. One has been killed, and the other is still serving. The father is unable to work, and yet the mother cannot claim that she is wholly dependent on one of the sons, as both were contributing towards her support. I think the amendment circulated by the honourable member for Richmond might meet this case; but we ought to get a declaration from the Minister in charge of the Bill. It will be foolish to pass the Bill without provision to meet cases of this description. I fear we are going to be landed in endless trouble because of the manner in which the Defence Department have been circulating statements regarding the pensions to be paid. In one poster, signed "" George Pearce, Minister of Defence,"" it is stated that dependants of a lieutenant will receive £90 a year as a pension, but I know of two cases in my constituency in which one lady receives £65 a year and another £54 a year. Naturally, these people feel that they are not being justly treated. The circular should never have been issued, because it is misleading. Those people, of course, were under the impression that they would get that amount of pension, but when one of them made a declaration the other day, she was quietly informed that, as she was the widow of a deceased clergyman, and in receint of a pension from lhat source, she could not get the amount stipulated in the departmental statement. member is not in order in discussing I that matter at this stage.

230,Mr Greene (Richmond) [4.52],"IBallarat is an example of tbe sort of case in regard to which I think a definite rule sbould be laid down for the guidance of those who are to administer the law. The widow of a clergyman of the Church of England, who is in receipt of £ 2 6 a vear from church funds, has lost at the f r o n t a son who was a first lieutenant. The Act provides that the maximum pension pavable to the dependant of a first lieutenant shall be £ 9 1 per year, but the Pensions Board, in dealing with the case, apparently argued that the intention of Parliament was that £ 9 1 a year was the maximum income that should be assured to a pensioner, and, tlierefore, allowed to this widow only £ 6 5 a year, which, with the £ 2 6 that she receives from another source, makes up £ 9 1 . In my opinion, it was not the intention of Parliament that pensions should be allotted in that way. pendants should be paid for the loss of the breadwinner the f u l l amount of compensation I acted that if a person can show that for twelve months prior to the death or incapacitation of a soldier, he or she was dependent on him, the Commissioners shall assess the pension at an amount not less than the support contributed, so long as that amount does not exceed the maximum pension provided in the schedule. sions definitely ? that being done.

Department, bearing his signature, it is In most cases, the amount that is given stated that the dependants of lieutenants by way of support is paid regularly, killed at the war are entitled to a penweekly or fortnightly, and the amount of sion of £ 9 1 a year. This statement will a pension should not be reduced by the cause a lot of trouble, because the fact amount of any other income that the deis that it is only the dependants of a first pendant may have. lowances to their sisters. Would such sisters be dependants? sioners would be guided in their decisions by the evidence in each case. The word "" dependant"" is defined in the Act, and my amendment would not have any force except in regard to those who proved that they were dependants. If the claimant had been receiving gifts only, and was not a dependant, he or she would not be entitled to a pension. I am confident that honourable members do not desire that the War PensionsA c t should be administered on the lines on which the Old age PensionsA ct is administered. Parliament has decided that no person wna has an income of £ 1 a week shall receive an old-age pension. If a person has. an income of £ 2 6 a year, the old-age penWhat was intended was that desion may be £ 2 6 ; if the income is £3U the pension may be £ 2 2 , and so on, the principle being the greater the income set down in the Act. the less the pension. In regard to war desire, therefore, that it be enpensions, however, the f u l l amount stated in the schedule should be paid to all persons who prove that during the twelve mouths preceding the death or incapacitation of a soldier they were dependent on him. MrM c GRATH (Ballarat) [5.2] I trust that the Minister w ill accept the. amendment. It seems to me to be an. eminently reasonable one. In the case because of assistance that she receives I am not opposed to from a church f u n d than if she had no> crease the number of persons entitled to pensions, and does not alter the definition In my opinion it they should get, that is. the f u l l pensionI do not think that set out in the schedule.

236,Mr Greene,"The Deputy Commisat that rate, the pension for the dependant of a second lieutenant being only £ 7 7 10s. Nothing is said in the advertisement of two rates of pensions for the dependants of lieutenants, and many persons do not know that there are first and second lieutenants. Two or three cases, in addition to those T have mentioned, have been brought under my notice, where pensions less than those advertised are being paid, and are quite in accordance with the Act. I am complaining, not of the amount that is being paid; but of the misleading advertisements published by the Defence Department as to the pensions actually payable. If the Government wish to avoid trouble, they should withdraw these advertisements, and publish others which will show the actual position. I am quite in accord with the amendment. I do not believe that the mother of a man who has been killed at the f r o n t should be awarded less than the f u l l amount of the pension to which his position entitled her merely because she happens to be drawing a small pension or allowance from some other source. Why, for in stance, should the widow of a clergyman, who is receiving a small allowance from the deceased clergy f u n d , receive a smaller pension on the death of her son than is given to the dependant of another man who is not in receipt of such an allowance? Surelyi t was not intended that the mother of a deceased lieutenant should receive a pension of only £ 5 4 instead of the f u l l pension of £91 per annum, because she is drawing a small allowance from some other fund . she obtaining this allowance? MrM c GRATH cases I am told that the lady is the widow of a clergyman, and is drawing a small allowance from a deceased clergy f u n d . I have heard honourable members of Parliament read from public platforms advertisements published by the Defence Department, setting out pension rates which now prove to be incorrect. I am sure honourable members on both sides desire that justice shall be done to those who have allowed their sons to go to the front. Surely their financial position today should not be allowed to be worse than it was prior to the enlistment of their sons. It is our duty to see that they suffer no financial loss by reason of the death of those on whom they were dependent. I hope the amendment will receive favorable consideration. member for Fawkner has intimated that he desires to move a prior amendment. my amendment to be temporarily withdrawn. Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. is with regret that I have to say that some of those who have gone to the fron t did not make provision for their mothers to receive out of their pay the amounts to which they were properly entitled, and I fear that, under the amendment proposed by the honourable member for Richmond, a grave injustice might be done to the parents of such men. Sub-clause c of proposed new clause 5A provides that each Deputy Commissioner shall be charged with the duty ofassessing the rates of pensions of members of the Forces and their dependants, and determining the dates of the commencement of such pensions. I move as an amendmentThat the following words be added:-""pro viding that such assessment shall not be less than £52 per annum."" If my amendment be carried, it will be provided in the B ill itself that the amount of the assessment of a pension shall not be less than £ 5 2 per annum. ber's amendment would apply to the case of a man who had been only slightly injured as well as to the man who had lost his life. Many men might be only slightly injured, and entitled therefore to a pension of only £ 1 0 or £ 1 5 a year. insure as a right the payment of a pension of not less than £ 5 2 per annum, where a soldier has lost his life, or has been totally incapacitated. As the law stands at present, the dependants of a man who has lost his life have to plead poverty, so to speak, before they can secure a pension. poverty. Where a pension is claimed on the ground of total or partial incapacity a doctor's certificate as to the in j u ry received must be produced, and to that certificate great weight is attached in determining the amount of pension.

I trust the Committee will be able to devise means of fixing the pension in such a way that a parent will be legally entitled to the minimum amount of £52 per annum.

The inference was that the pension was given only to persons who needed it. only to dependants. a son who had been injured at the war, would that son be deprived of his pension because his father was in a position to maintain him? such a thing.

I understand that when a widow proves that she is the widow of a deceased soldier, she will get her pension, but I understand the Pensions Board has made inquiries as to whether a widow has been in receipt of a private income. for under the Act. point for which I am now contending. What is suggested is that, notwithstanding that a widow may be in receipt of a private income, if she can show that she was in receipt of a contribution towards her support equal to or exceeding the actual rate of a pension specified in the schedule from a member of the Force, then the Commissioner should be prohibited from assessing her pension at a less amount than that specified in the schedule. To that I heartily subscribe. hope the House will insert in this measure some definite regulation regarding the payment of pensions, and not leave the amount at the discretion of the Commissioner. I take it that the widow of any member of the Force killed at the war is entitled to her pension as a widow, irreGovernment sbould have had notice of spective of what private income she may be in receipt of. Similar provision, I understand, is made for children. They arc entitled to their pensions owing to their being the children of a soldier killed on active service. On that point, the Act seems to be clear. I also see nothing in the Act that gives the Commissioner, or any other person, power to alter the sum payable to a soldier who is totally incapacitated. them. they are going outside their powers. In the matter of the dependants, however, the position is different. Assuming that 1 had a son killed at the war, under the scheme suggested by the honourable member for Barrier my wife would be able to The father and the claim £52 a year for the rest of her life because my son is killed. I do not think it was the intention of the Government that this should be so. of the Government; you are quite right there. who was dependent upon the son prior to his going to the war, the pension should be paid, and I agree with the honourable member for Fawkner that no pension in such circumstances should be less than £52 a year. It was never intended that pensions should be provided for all persons who might lay claim to any sort of dependence, but I think consideration might be extended to any dependants who are really suffering. I am sure that it was not intended that, because the honourable member for Barrier and myself have sons at the war, our wives, should those sons be killed or totally incapacitated, should draw war pensions for the rest of their lives. That, however, seems to be the proposal of the honourable member for Fawkner. Certainly, the dependants of those who are killed or incapacitated should receive assistance, and the amount paid to them should be at least £52 per year.

340,Mr Wise (Gippsland) [6.17],"I dowill never make up for the loss of the man who has gone. -There is some force in the point raised by the honourable member for Gippsland, and it would be well for the Minister to consult the Attorney-General upon it , as weil as in regard to the other matters mentioned by him. I fail to see why the Government should not accep*t the amendment moved by the honourable member for Richmond. It was the intention of Parliament, when passing the original measure, that the dependant of a soldier killed or incapacitated while on active service, should receive a pension equal to the amount of support which the deceased was contributing, but limited, of course, by the amount fixed in the schedule. The Leader of the Opposition, however, pointed out yesterday that this intention was not being carried out. He cited the case of a soldier killed at the front, whose widowed mother was not receiving, by way of pension, a sum equal to the amount which he was contributing towards her support prior to his death. The payment to her was less than the full pension rate allotted to a man of his rank. The honourable member for Richmond's amendment would get over that difficulty, inasmuch as by its adoption we should declare in the Bill itself that the Commissioner, in assessing the payment to be made to a dependant, should fix it at a rate not less than tbe amount contributed for twelve months prior to death or incapacity, provided that it did not exceed the scale in the schedule. I do not think that this would involve an excessive appropriation. It would certainly carry out what is the evident wish of the Committee, and the Minister should have no hesitation in accepting it. [6.22] I do not agree with the proposal before. made by the honourable member for Fawkner and the honourable member for Barfather who has sacrificed himself for the rier, inasmuch as in adopting it we should sake of his son-wh o has spent hundreds be absolutely in the dark as to what its of pounds in the education of his son, in effect was likely to be. We are asked to the hope that later on that son will be of agree to the making of a payment which some advantage to him. If such a youth we cannot compute, and which might ingoes to the front, and is killed, surely volve the country in an altogether unreathe father sliould be entitled to the full sonable expenditure. If we knew exactly amount of the pension. how many were likely to come under the proposal, the position would be different, trouble is that, under the honourable membut I am not prepared to vote in the ber's proposal, not only would men so slark. The amendment moved by the situated receive the full amount of the honourable member for Richmond is a reasonable one, and goes quite as far as honourable members generally, in my opinion, are prepared to go. The honourable member for Barrier asks that the relatives or next of kin of any man killed or totally incapacitated at the front shall receive the full amount payable by way of pension under the schedule to the principal Act, whether that next of kin is or is not a dependant. If that were provided, a difficulty might arise. Very many of those who are going, or have gone, to the front have no dependants, and many prior to enlisting were dependent upon those whom they have left behind. under the honourable member for Barrier's proposal, the pension would go to a father who was well off. doubtedly. I know of several young fellows who have gone to the front, and who have never contributed, and have never been asked to contribute, a penny to the support of those whom they have left behind. On the contrary, those whom they have left behind have been contributing to their support. If the honourable member for Barrier's proposal were adopted, these persons would be entitled to the full pension. The point is that those persons have allowed their sons to go while others have kept their sons at home. prepared to admit that that is so. Those who agreed to their sons enlisting did so in a spirit of patriotism.

The officials can take no heed of the intentions of Parliament, but only of our enactments; otherwise they would find themselves in a dilemma. When it was contended that we need only make provision to give a full pension to the father or mother, seeing that the widow and children were automatically in receipt of a pension, I expressed the opinion that the increased amount of money required would not be very much. However, the Minister has since admitted that the pension does not fall to the widow automatically. no matter what the relationship of the applicant to a member of the Forces may be, a pension cannot be paid until dependence is proved. merly was of opinion that the widow was entitled to the pension by the mere fact of being the soldier's widow! Therefore, if an amendment is made to insure the payment of the pension to the widow, no objection can be raised by the Minister on account of increased cost, because the Commonwealth will not be called upon to pay more money than he thoueht it was liable to pay prior to his discovering his error. but it may not have been the view of the other members of the Government. think that what we have now discovered is news to many honourable members. the fact'that it has been proved very conclusively that the widow is not entitled to a pension without proving dependence, it would be wise to adjourn the further consideration of the Bill until next week. The discussion this afternoon shows how necessary this amending Bill is. I think it would be advisable to postpone its further consideration, however, until next Wednesday, the Minister in the meantime to consider whether it is possible to meet the wishes of a number of honourable members. If it can be shown that what the honourable member for Fawkner and myself desire will not prove a crushing burden on the country, I think we shall have the support of the honourable member for Indi, whose objection is that we may be called upon to vote in the dark. jection of the Minister. objection; By next Wednesday the Government might be prepared to accede to our request, or show conclusively it is impracticable. There is, I think, one objection to the amendment foreshadowed by the honourable member for Richmond, which, as I understand it, provides that a widow shall receive an equivalent to what she had been receiving from her son before he went to the war. A son of 'eighteen or nineteen may earn only a small salary, and yet give his mother the greater part of it,"" while the son of another woman may earn a larger salarv and give his mother more than the former, but no more in proportion to what he earns. I take it that under the amendment of the honourable member for Richmond, the mother of the last-mentioned son would receive a higher pension. I have used the words "" not less than."" It does not mean that she sball receive the same amount, but that it shall not be less. mother could receive more than £52 ? amount would depend to some extent oo how mftch the son had previously given to his mother?

378,Mr Thomas,"Howeve r that maylawyers, and we have seen some difference of opinion between the honourable member for Darling Downs and the honourable member for Gippsland. The honourable member for Darling Downs gave us to understand that under the Bill a widow, as a widow, is entitled to the full pension. intention. orable member to say that that was the law. look into the question. seemed satisfied that the law was against the honourable member, and in favour of the view of the honourable member for Gippsland. The Minister now assures us that a widow is not entitled to automatically receive a pension, but only to receive an allowance to the extent that she was dependent on the deceased. Under all the circumstances I suggest that the consideration of this matter should be postponed, if only in view of the fact that it may probably mean considerable expenditure,and that the Minister does not see his way to decide the point "" off his own bat."" think that the request for a postponement might be acceded to by the Minister. The discussion has been such as to warrant our giving some reconsideration to important clauses, especially that which defines '' dependant.'' I am in agreement with the amendment suggested by the honourable member for Richmond, but I am not quite sure that the requirements of the Act in regard to dependants will not put another difficulty in the way. It seems to be competent for the Commissioner to make a pro ratd reduction if it is is really dependent on the other. This shown that the claimant is in receipt of a certain income; and if the Act makes it mandatory to pay not less than the amount received by the claimant previous to the death of the soldier, the Commissioner may more strictly interpret "" dependant."" Under all the circumstances, I think that the Minister might consider the arguments advanced to-day with a view to introducing an amendment making the provision more elastic. I have in my mind a case of a lieutenant who was killed shortly after the first attack at Gallipoli. Previous to joining the Forces, this lieutenant was the right-hand man of his father in a small business. He received no salary, but had his living, and no doubt pocket-money; and the small amount sent to the father while the son was at the front was some kind of compensation for the absence of the latter. There is a probability that if the father sent in an application for a pension he would have to prove that he had been dependent on his son, and, as the father has some property of his own, that might be dimcult, although there is no doubt that he is entitled to some consideration for the loss he has sustained. We may be sure that there are hundreds of similar cases, and the Minister would do well to allow the clause to be postponed, with a view to introducing some provision to meet the wishes of honourable members. There are several amendments with which I disagree, and other proposals that I consider require amendment. I suggest that if we consent to pass this clause, the Minister should give us an assurance that the Bill will be recommitted next Wednesday. This would give us an opportunity to obtain the opinion of the Attorney-General on some of the clauses. I referred earlier to the case of a lady who has two sons at the front, and whose husband is how ini a hospital, and has been unable to earn anything for the last seventeen years. Under these circumstances, this lady cannot make an application, because she is not a widow, although really and truly she is one, and entirely dependent on the Bons. application as a mother t one of the sons liked to leave her. One son is married, and his wife, of course, has to be provided for, so that the mother lady desires to have the 10s. a week proposed to be given to widows; and such cases ought to be provided for. If the Minister will not accept the suggestion I have made, an amendment will have to be moved. vided for. My marginal note on the subject escaped my eye, but such cases are covered by section 8 of the Act now. The honourable member for Darling Downs has looked into the matter. -The point raised by the honourable member is one of importance.

388,Mr Groom (Darling Downs) [8.15].,"only introduced yesterday, and the second reading debate took place before we had time to closely examine it, and I have not had time myself to do that yet. I understood that the Minister stated that an alteration was being made by the Bill providing for the payment, in every case, of pensions at the full rate to widows and children in cases of death or permanent incapacity. Section8 of the original Act merely sets out that the rate of pension shall not exceed a certain sum, which seems to suggest that pensions may be less than the amount specified, and therefore, under this Bill as submitted, provision is made that "" the rates of pensions payable under this Act shall be as follows."" This fixes the amount to widows and children in case of death or total incapacity. The Minister explained such to be the alteration yesterday. referring to section 8. We have not come tn it yet. the Committee is that widows and children shall receive the full amount specified in the schedule in cases of death or total incapacity of a member. for that in an alteration which will be submitted later. for Gippsland also pointed to an ambiguity. He admitted that that was the intention of the Bill, but he raised grave doubts as to whether that intention would be given eifect to in the Bill as it now stands, pointing out that tbe definition of "" dependant"" was such that, read alongside section 8, it might be that, though a widow and child ultimately received the full amount specified in the schedule, they titled to their pension, should death occur, would be called upon to prove actual dependence before receiving anything at all. bhat, or will they not? by the honourable member for Gippsland, and I think there is some force in his argument. I suggest that the Minister should put this point of view before the Attorney-General, in order that all possibility of doubt may be removed, because the intention of the Committee, so far as I can gather, is that widows and children shall not receive pensions simply because they are dependants, but that the pensions specified in the schedule shall come automatically to them, no matter how rich or how poor they may be. to section 8 will bring that about. Minister that that point should be brought before the notice of the legal officers of the Crown, in order that it may be cleared up beyond doubt. mittee that if the Attorney-General has any doubt on the point the clause will be recommitted. is another matter which I should like the Minister to bring before the notice of the Attorney-General. Section3 of the old Act simply says that the Commonwealth shall be liable to pay to dependants, and it seems to me that unless the words "" widow and child "" are added to section 3 in addition to the word "" dependants "" they will receive pensions, not as the widow and child, but as dependants. think, should also look into that point, in order to place it beyond doubt. There is a clause in the regulations that makes me doubt how the dependants of a soldier who might be killed in camp would fare. Clause7 of the regulations seems to suggest that the Act will only apply to a member of the Commonwealth Naval or Military Forces on active service outside Australia. In case death occurs as the result of evolutions in camp in Australia, will not widows and children be entitled to a pension? as soon as a man has enlisted and is sworn in. I am given to understand that pensions have already been paid in respect of deaths which occurred under such circumstances. where a pension had been refused in respect of a man who became ill , on the ground that he was not engaged in warlike operations. read it, seemed to indicate that pensions are only payable in resnect of those who go outside Australia.

There may be difficulties with some of the succeeding clauses, to which amendments may be required, and I want to add my request to those already made to the Minister to recommit any clause upon which difficulties may occur, after he has had a consultation with the* legal advisers of the Government, in order that we may have the matter before us in a form that will be more clearly understood. Jn my view there is no question that the widow and children of a deceased soldier are entitled to pensions. It may be as the honourable member for Gippsland has pointed out, that further amendment will be required to clause 3, but that will not affect in any way the proposal I submitted in the amendment that I have for the time being withdrawn. I should like the Minister to give me some assurance that if this Bill is held over till next week, the ends. point I raised will receive some consideration. member a similar promise to that I have made to other honourable members. I will bring the honourable member's suggestion before the notice of the Cabinet, so that the Government may consider whether the point shall be taken up as a Government matter. understands what it is I have in mind. I want to make quite sure that where a dependant, other than a widow, shows clearly that he or she has been in receipt of an amount from the member of the Force who is dead, either equal to or exceeding the pension awarded by the assessment, that fact shall be presumptive proof of dependence to that extent, and that it shall then be incumbent upon the Commissioner to grant a pension not less than that which appears in the schedule. In asking fpr that, I am asking only for what is reasonable and fair, and what is, 1 think, the general desire of honourable members.

I know the contention is that if we give pensions to all parents, the Commonwealth will be compelled to pay away an enormous sum of money; but I am not impressed by that argument. We should not consider £52 a year an exorbitant payment to parents who have had the courage to consent to their sons going to the front, should those sons lose their lives in the service of the country. I do not like the idea of persons having to expose their circumstances in life in order to make good a claim on a pension to recommit the clause. fund. HaveI an assurance from the Minister that the Bill is likely to be more about the matter. I am sure that altered in the manner I advocate? orable member entails such a large expenthe dependants of those who are risking diture that it would have to be considered their lives at the front. I confess that I by the Cabinet. means a large expenditure, and the inhe enlist as a creasing of taxation; but the privileges which our people will enjoy in the future will have been maintained for them by the voung fellows who are laying down their lives in Gallipoli to-day. I desire that the fathers and mothers of these young men shall be able to claim pensions as of right, instead of being compelled to plead poverty to obtain them. Although this will increase the expenditure of the Commonwealth, we should not shirk our duty, or failto show appreciahas tion of the sacrifices of our fallen soldiers and their parents. -The subject of pensions opens up a very wide question. I have always held, and still hold, that there should be only one pension, and that every man and woman should receive an equal sum. The most up-to-date Socialistic viewI think . it is that of Bernard Shaw-is that, while it may be impossible to get equality of brain and equality of muscle, it is possible, in a well-ordered community, to have equality of revenue. It has always seemed to me that the widow and children of a private should not be treated differently from the widow and children of an officer. I am the guardian of what is known as an ex-nuptial child, so branded by the infamy of law, man-made, not by the great Creator. The father, who has gone to the front, has made an allowance to that child, and has asked me to be his guardian; but it is doubtful whether, should the father die, the child will be able to get a pension as a dependant. I understand that some doubt has been expressed as to what would be the position of the mother in the event of the father's death. An honourable member of the Opposition, who is a member of the legal profession, has stated that she is properly secured, but if, upon consideration, it is found that a further amendment is necessary, I am sure that the Minister will agree to recommit the Bill. we are all anxious that this Bill shall be never refer to the subject of war without",41,Chaieman Th E Honourable More Than Under The Act 1 Have Men

Amendment negatived. Clause agreed to. Clauses8 and 9 agreed to. Clause 10After section seven of the Principal Act the following section is inserted:"" 7A. If any pensioner is convicted of an offence and sentenced to any term of imprisonment, the Commissioner or a Deputy Commissioner may suspend his pension during the term of his imprisonment or any portion thereof or forfeit any instalment thereof accruing during such term or portion."" Under this clause the Commissioner may suspend the pension of any pensioner convicted of an offence and sentenced to any term of imprisonment, or forfeit any in stalment accruing during his imprisonment, or any portion thereof. The honourable member for Batman last night took exception to the clause in its entirety, holding that a pension, once having been granted, should not be withheld in any circumstances. WhilstI do not go as f a r as that, I think that the clause as it stands is not equitable. It was urged last night that if a pensioner committed a crime which led to his imprisonment, it was only reasonable that his pension should be suspended, since while in prison he would be maintained at the expense of the country. On the face of it , that seems to be a reasonable argument; but if the clause be passed as it stands, I am confident that it will give rise to a great deal of hardship. A soldier who is totally incapacitated is entitled to a pension of £52 per annum, and his wife to £ 2 6 per annum, while a pension of £ 1 3 per annum is allowed in respect of each child. If a pensioner with a wife and two children were convicted of an offence, his wife would lose the £ 5 2 per annum to which he was entitled, so that the total allowance drawn by the pensioner and his family would be reduced by one-half. Thus, in addition to the husband being imprisoned for his offence, his wife and children would be penalized. contend, would be unjust. I do not think honourable members would care to place a woman and her children in such a position because of some act on the part of her husband which we could not condone. I therefore move as an amendmentThat the following words be added:-""provided that in the case of a pensioner with dependants upon him the amount forfeited during the term of his imprisonment shall be paid to such dependants."" If the clause were so amended, the pension, or any portion of the pension, payable to a pensioner, but suspended by the Commissioner, would be drawn by his wife and children during his imprisonment.

I hope the clause.will be negatived. We do not desire to have an army of detectives watching the conduct of pensioners under this law. If a man is awarded a pension, it should be given to him for life, free from all conditions. I gave reasons last night why, in my opinion, the whole clause was bad and That, J ought to be omitted.

445,Mr Brennan (Batman) [8.57],"contention that these pensions were merely given by way of compensation for injuries received in war, and not because of service at the front. But we should put the whole scheme upon a higher ground by declaring that every man who becomes entitled to a pension under this measure shall receive it-fre e from any grudging condition or restriction-as an absolute right covering the whole period of his life. If we give him anything less than that, we shall place him at a disadvantage, as compared with an ordinary citizen in his own walk of life who has given no service to the community as a soldier. Surely at this very time, when we all feel a sense of gratitude to, and pride in, those who are entering upon the risky and onerous work of soldiering, we are not going to look ahead to a time when possibly one of these men who comes back and is awarded a pension shall in some way or other transgress the law. Surely we are not going to hold up to him an Act of Parliament in which we say, "" Although we think you worthy of this pension, we want you to remember that if you should at any time, because of weakness or. acting on a sudden impulse, transgress the law, so as to be cast into prison for a few days, we shall stop the payment of this pension which you have earned."" to prison for exercising the right of freedom of speech. slender grounds on which a man may be nut in m-ison, and, on the other hand, there are persons guilty of culpable conduct who are not put in prison at all. this clause will be at the discretion of the Commissioner. If the offence were a trivial one, no doubt the pensioner would get sympathetic consideration. Act provides for a review of the assessment or determination. That ought to be sufficient, without holding before men who have served at the front the threat, that they will be liable to lose their pensions if they are guilty of unlawful conduct. By agreeing to this clause we shall be putting the soldier in a worse position than the ordinary citizen. Suppose two men, one a pensioner, who has served his country at the front, and the other a waster, jointly commit an offence, and are sentenced to the same term of imprisonment. The less worthy member of the community, having served his sentence, is considered to have expiated his offence and to be entitled to go free, as he ought to be. He has paid the penalty, and the law says that a man shall not be saddled afterwards with the consequences of his offence. Why, then, saddle the consequences of his offence on the second offender, the man who has rendered signal service to his country, by depriving him of portion of his pension? The proposal is illogical, but even if it were not, we shall be treating these men grudgingly if we hold before them the threat that, should they undergo imprisonment for some offence, they will also suffer a proportionate loss of their pension. I hope the clause will be negatived; but, if it is not, I shall support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Hunter. The Commissioner ought to be in the position to hand over the money, to which the pensioner would be entitled in other circumstances, to his wife and children, so that they, at all events, might not be the sufferers through his lapse. I do not favour the elimination of the clause. It is quite competent for the Commissioner, as custodian of the funds, be committed to see that the pension is properly directed. The pension of a widow ceases when she re-marries, though one would think that was a commendable action on her part. We also reserve the right of disfranchising persons who have committed certain crimes. In this clause we are only following the same principle, and holding a kind of censorship over those persons who, by their own act, have deprived themselves of the right to enjoy the privileges of citizenship. I agree with the honourable member for Batman that the pension, once granted, should have a reasonable permanency associated with it, but the State should retain the right to direct that the pension be paid to the person really entitled to the use of the money, so that it can be expended for the support of the dependants in accordance with the inten ion of this Parliament. I think all requirements will be amply met by the amendment of the honourable member for Hunter. would prefer to see the clause struck out",43,Chaieman Th E Honourable More Than Under The Act 1 Have Men

I take the view that the pension belongs to the person who has won it by risking his life and suffering incapacimember for Hunter, which, at all events, tation. If a person commits a crime he is punished by the law of the land, and it is not just to further punish him by taking away his pension. It is a reflection on the men who have gone to the front to suggest that there will be such a percentage of law-breakers amongst them on their return as to make necessary such a provision as this. Section9 of the Act makes it possible to commute a pension by the payment of a lump sum, and I imagine that it is not the desire of ParliaNavy) [9.18] -This clause is inserted bement that, if a pensioner is imprisoned after he has received such a lump sum, portion of the money shall be recovered from him. Yet it would be equally unfair to interfere with his pension if he were receiving it in periodical instalments. 1 shall vote against the amendment, in the hope of having the clause struck out. -In the very serious libel case, Ronald v. Harper, the man who was convicted of having suborned witnesses to commit perjury in behalf of the defendant, and who was sentenced to imprisonment f o i three years, did not lose his pension. person showed the vilest ingratitude, because it was Mr Ronald who had obtained for him his pension. I think this clause must have been culled from the Old-age Pensions Act. Frequently in the Courts of Melbourne old-age pensioners have been sentenced as vagrants for having no visible means of support. A magistrate who would sentence an old age pensioner as a vagrant either says that the Commonwealth does not pay the pensioners enough to exist upon, or he does not understand what he is talking about. I was hurt to find the Commissioner of Old-age Pensions taking a month and a week to answer a letter inquiring which magistrate it was who had sentenced a certain old lady; and when I got the reply it was simply to say that no record was kept. If that was the only reply that could be sent, then I think it ought to have come by return of post. That old lady's pension was taken away, and I resented that action, as I should any similar action taken under the clause before [203] us. If the Minister cannot see his way to withdraw the clause, I hope he will accept the amendment of the honourable would limit the power of the Commissioner, and insure that, in the case of a serious criminal offence, those dependent on the criminal would not be deprived of pensions. In the case of the electoral law, a man who has served a sentence is allowed to resume his citizen rights after a short interval; and, surely, similar consideration may be shown in the case of war pensions. cause there is a similar provision in another Federal Act; and I myself think it is necessary. It is provided that if a pensioner is convicted and sentenced to imprisonment, the Commissioner "" may "" -no t ' ' shall ''-suspen d his pension during the term of the imprisonment, or any portion thereof, or forfeit any instalment accruing during such term. It will be seen that the whole matter rests with the Commissioner, who, I take it, as a man of common sense and judgment, will investigate every case. Of course, if a man is only convicted of some such trivial offence as that of being intoxicated, the Commissioner, I take it , would not interfere; but, no doubt, he would if a man were sentenced to imprisonment for five or ten years. In any case, the offender's wife and children should not be called upon to bear a double privation. The amendment will not cause any extra expense, and, under the circumstances, I am prepared to accept it . Amendment agreed to. Clause, as amended, agreed to. Clause 11 (Amendment of section 8).

CATTS (Cook) [9.33] I am glad the Postmaster-General is present. From a report which appeared in the Sydney Sun of Tuesday, 27th July, it appears that great dissatisfaction exists at the General Post Office, Sydney, in regard to a matter that I brought under the Minister's notice a couple of weeks ago. The reference is in Hansard, No . 41, page 4499. This is a brief statement of the positionThe mail branch of the G.P.O. is on the verge of striking and holding up the delivery and despatch of the business houses' letters. The men say that they were told by. the present Government to appeal to the Commonwealth Arbitration Court for a redress of their grievances. This they did, but, instead of receiving benefits, they have been cut down in salary, and are now worse off than ever. The letter carriers appealed to the Court for an award, which came into operation on 1st July. On 16th July the postal heads are declared to have committed a breach of the award. The men state that they approached their head, who refused them any redress. The result was that the whole of the letter carriers threatened to walk out of the G.P.O. unless their demands were satisfied. The Department then agreed to the terms under the award. The postal sorters then received their award, which is to date from 1st August. Even in the face of that award, it is stated that the Postal Department has introduced provisos and barriers which Mr Justice Powers did not stipulate. The officials have communicated with the central executive in Melbourne to make representations to Parliament, and if their demands are not satisfied, an ultimatum will be sent to the Prime Minister threatening to cease work on a date to be decided upon. Mr Christie, superintendent of mails, does not regard the threat to strike very seriously. He says that the sorters are a reasonable lot of men, and he does not believe that they will resort to extremes. Mr Christie explained that the trouble with the letter carriers had arisen from a misunderstanding on the part of an official who had unwittingly worked a man overtime, but this matter had since been rectified. It appears that there is more in this trouble than is admitted by the Superintendent of Mails. I do not expect the Postmaster-General to be in a position to give a definite replv to this matter offhand, though the probabilities are that it has been brought under his notice during the last couple of days by Sydney officials. If that is so, and the honourable Minister can say whether an inquiry has been made, I shall be glad to know what in formation he has got. Otherwise I will ask him to have inquiries made, in order to discover whether the dissatisfaction cannot be redressed.",45,Chaieman Th E Honourable More Than Under The Act 1 Have Men

459,Mr Fisher (Wide Bay,"Prime M i nalso desire to bring before the notice of the Postmaster-General a matter concerning casual letter carriers. Prior to the award of the Arbitration Court, men of between eighteen and thirty-five years of age were engaged to do this work, but since the award was published, the Deputy Postmaster-General of VictoriaI do not know what is happening in other Stateshas issued an order to postmasters in all inland towns, instructing them that, where possible, they must engage youths to do this work. under the award it would be necessary to pay 8s. 6d. a day, the Deputy Postmaster General proposes to employ boys, and pay them 5s. 4d. a day. It seems to me that some officials take a special delight In defeating an award of the Arbitration Court. I have written to the Postmaster-General on this subject, but so far I have had no reply, though the matter is, I think, one of urgency. In the House the Minister stated that the Department were not going to dispense with the services of any of the casual letter carriers. It may be perfectly true that they are not going to dispense with any who have not served for six months, but when the six months is exhausted others will be employed. I do not suggest that youths are not fit to do this work. If they are fit enough to go and fight for this country, as they have been fighting in Gallipoli. they are fit enough to earn more than a paltry 5s. 4d. a day. The position of a letter carrier is one of some responsibility. No Liberal Administration ever made any attempt to bring in cheap labour to do the work these men have to do, and it remains for the Postmaster-General in a Labour Administration to send broadcast through Victoria the order to which I have referred. I trust the Postmaster-General will see that it is cancelled. we have the Postmaster-General witn us, I should like also to bring forward a matter for his consideration. Some time ago I asked him whether it was a fact that the young women in the Telephone Branch of the Postal Department were to be called upon to work all night. The Postmaster General then assured me that, as far as he knew, there was no such intention, but that nothing would be done without consulting the young women concerned. I am now informed that this reform-if it is a reform; I think it is a retrogression[203]2 is to be brought about, and I understand that it is alleged, also, that the women concerned have been consulted. I am satisfied, however, that they have not been consulted in the proper sense of the word. In this matter, also, it seems that only the will of the departmental head has been considered. ferring to? the Melbourne staff. I am told that it has This means that, whereas been reported to the Postmaster-General that it is the wish of the staff that this change should be made. Such is not the case.' word about Melbourne. a just ground for complaint. Why has not the Minister heard of it? I have heard of it . able member's question referred only to Sydney. Melbourne. The honourable member for South Sydney raised a similar question regarding Sydney. I know there is im-. mense dissatisfaction on the part of the young women who have been called upon to work all night at the Melbourne Exchange. It is neither proper nor neces' sary that this should be, and I would point out to the Postmaster-General that the reason alleged for these young women being employed all night is that the young men who formerly did that work are anxious to go to the war, and that they are to be encouraged in their desire. But the fact is that this work was previously done by lads of between sixteen and eighteen years of age, and nobody under the age of eighteen can go to the war. I would ask the Postmaster-General 'to consider whether it is either fair or necessary that this change should be made. If it is not absolutely necessary, I would urge him to take a vote amongst the ladies themselves in order to discover what their attitude is. If the change is necessary, I do not object; but I do not think that the change should be introduced by the Postmaster-General under any misconception as to what the wishes of the people themselves are.

I hope that consideration will be given to what appears to me to be a just complaint, and that the female telephonists will not be compelled to work all night. I wish to give the Minister timely notice of a complaint with which I intend to deal with more fully on some other occasion. Of recent years, it has become the practice of the Department, especially of the Telephone Branch, when engineers are required, to appoint men from overseas, alleging that the men trained in Australia, and acquainted with Australian conditions, are not capable of fillGeneral) [9.52] -With regard to the ing the more important positions. Honourable members know, however, that the undergrounding of the telephone wires in the main cities of the Commonwealth has been carried out under the supervision of able engineers, who learned their profession and acquired their experience in Australia, and naturally such men resent the giving of the plums of the service to engineers from Great Britain and other places. Some years ago there came under my notice the case of a young man who was fully qualified for a certain position, and had been performing its duties to the satisfaction of his superior officer; but the Public Service Commissioner held that, as he was only twenty-six years of age, he was too young to receive the salary attached to that office, which was £310 per annum as a minimum. That is no way to encourage smart young Australians. know; is willing to give encouragement to Australian industry and to Australian workmen, and he does not object to the men joining associations so that they may express their grievances firmly and obtain redress. Australian-trained men are entitled to more consideration than men from overseas. We have it on the best authority that there were telephones in Melbourne before there were any in London, but the Department is bringing from Great Britain men of limited experience who have no knowledge of Australian conditions, and some of these men have put the country to considerable expense by julling down useful works in order to erect others of their own design, which may suit London, but not Australian cities.

I have received several letters from letter carriers to say that no change has been made. matter referred to by the honourable member for Cook, all I know of the alleged trouble at Sydney is the statement published in the Sydney Sun, which I am loath to accept as reliable. Since the award was made, the definitions adopted by the Judge have been carefully drawn out and submitted to the Deputy Postmasters-General, and the instruction has been given that the conditions of the award are to be observed. The postal service is practically fully organized, and the executive officers of the unions do not neglect the interests of their members, but, very properly, promptly bring complaints under the notice of the authorities. Therefore, I think that the press statements are incorrect, nothing having come to my ears either from the union or from the Deputy Postmaster-General at Sydney. But I have asked the Central Office to inquire into the matter. Of The Postmaster-General, I course, when a new award comes into operation, some changes are necessary. It has been stated that no increases have been given; but the award itself contains certain increases-in the case of letter sorters, for example. Sometimes there Surely Australian-born and is a difference of opinion as to the interpretation of a clause of the award, and then matters are referred to the Public Service Commissioner. Certainly, the policy of the Department is to give effect to the awards. As to the matter referred to by the honourable member for Ballarat, I see nothing wrong in the circular to which he draws attention.

Unfortunately, owing to the outbreak of war, the officers whom we sent to Europe were not able to visit Germany, but they brought back some valuable information from America and elsewhere. Upon their return a conference of heads of Departments from the different States discussed the suggestions which they had to make, and some were approved, and are now being put into operation. I repeat that the two engineers ta whom reference has been made are not being brought out to take the place of any man already in the Department. There is a shortage of such engineers in Australia, and I do not think any harm will be done by the introduction of a little new blood into the service.
