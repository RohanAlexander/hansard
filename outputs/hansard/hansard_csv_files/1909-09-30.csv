2,Mr Fowler,"It is alleged that serimanner in which recent quarantine regulations were ehforced;.'. The following letter contains a statement of the occurrence out of which the complaint has arisen:The news of the arrival of the Osterley was received on board the Swan River steamer Zephyr at a quarter to i o'clock p.m. on the date mentioned-hal f an hour, by the way, before the signal was hoisted at the Town Hall. On arrival of the Zephyr at Fremantle at half past 2 o'clock, the mail steamer was anchored off the entrance of the harbour, and was flying the quarantine Bag, meaning that she had not yet been passed by the local doctor. It was half-past 5 o'clock -three , hours afterwardswhen she was hauled alongside the quay, and at 6 o'clock when the Zephyr left for Perth, the mail train had not started from Fremantle. The consequence was that the Gold-field's mails missed the Kalgoorlie express, and merchants' mails were not delivered until the following morning, although the mail steamer was at Fremantle shortly after mid-day on Friday. In this morning's Melbourne Argus the opinion of the local manager for the Orient Steam Navigation Company at Fremantle ' is published that the regulations were drawn up by medical men in Melbourne without regard to the .practical conditions under which they' would have to be applied. Will the -Postmastej-Gener/al,. in conjunction with the Minister of Trade and Customs, investigate the matter forthwith, in order that some solution of the difficulty may be arrived at? as stated, it must appear that the administration of the regulations, to some extent, has delayed tbe discharge and delivery of the mails. I am obliged to the honourable member for having called my attention to the facts. suggestion, I shall place myself in communication with the Minister of Trade and Customs, to see whether arrangements can be made for expediting the delivery of mails without m any way lessening the necessary precautions for the preservation of the public health.

' 3. Does he not think that the above case shows that the system used for estimating revenue from such lines requires alteration? the honourable member's questions are1.

I think it is necessary, in considering the returns upon which honourable members have based certain conclusions, that we the should remember that we have been experiencing a period of almost unparalleled prosperity in all the States, and that we must be prepared in the future, as we have been in the past, for recurringdroughts and reverses. On the other hand, Australia's recuperative power is simply marvellous, and I do not know that our primary producers, broadly speaking, are subject to more serious reverses than are those of other countries. No one desires to -depreciate Commonwealth functions, but we must admit that they do not so closely or directly affect the development of the country as do the State functions. The Commonwealth Government, for instance, may introduce an immigration policy and bring immigrants to Australia, but the States must direct the energies of the new-comers into profitable enterprises. The idle lands and the idle hands of Australia must be the Executives of the States. From every point of view, the probable needs of the States will, I think, increase at a",15,Trawler Endeavour

There is another value, which should George, and arousing such opposition, are not be under-estimated, attaching to this simply initiating in Great Britain the very agreement, and that lies in the fact that principle which has obtained in Australia it gives absolute freedom' to both Comfor a very long time past-the principle of monwealth and States. It is a fair barapportioning the burdens of taxation acgain, which recognises the liabilities on cording to the ability of the taxpayer to both sides. Both Commonwealth and States bear them-and I take it that there is no are told that, so far as future needs are disposition in this Parliament, and little, if concerned, they will start from the same any, in any of the State Parliaments, 'io mark, each exercising its own functions, and follow any' other course than that which making provision in its own way. .1 also has been recognised in this country for desire to refer briefly to the question years past.

As little attempt as possible should be made to interfere with or alter the Constitution. honourable members have expressed-that the Constitution should be regarded as view, and that a change should be proposed only when it is most urgently demanded. however, the proposed change simply completes a portion of the Constitution which was unfinished when the Convention framed it for Australia. It is a Constitution of which we may well be exceedingly proud. It has been characterized by distinguished British statesmen as the finest instrument of government of which the world has any knowledge. hope, therefore, that, for all time, alterations will be suggested only when the strongest need exists. The principle of the proposed dual referendum has been objected to, but I consider the objections altosatisfactory scheme for the transfer of the gether frivolous. Of course, coming from those who are opposed to the agreement, the objection is quite natural, and. the advice to the Government to bring the two questions under the same referendum is advice which 1 am pretty well satisfied the Government will respectfully decline. should consider that the Government did not know much about their business if they were to jeopardize either one proposal or the other, by submitting the two in such a form that the rejection of the one would involve the rejection of the other. Another point is the willingness of some honourable members, who are opposed to the agreement, to accept a provision for a time limit of, say, five years. I stated, at some length, yesterday, my objections to a time limit, pointing out the necessity for permanence in the interests of the States, not from a parochial roads-and-bridges point of view, but from the point of view of financial stability. This is the point which, I take it, will v 0 be continuously fought by the States. Not only is there the element of uncertainty to be objected to, but some honourable members, by interjection, have suggested that the States have no right or standing to demand any consideration. Legally speaking, the States have no right, The honourable member obbut morally speaking, they have every right; and I cannot help thinking that with some honourable members, who desire to fritter away the value of the agreement to the States,'"" Nationalism "" spells "" Unification,"" in big letters. It is the fear of unification which will undoubtedly lead the . States to regard this as one of the main, I quite admit what several if not the main, question for determination at the next general election for the Federal Parliament. There is a value in sacred from every point of the referendum, not only from the point of view of the member, but from the point of view of the State, or district, in that it keeps In the present instance, the consideration and settlement of the question entirely away from the election itself. The rejection or acceptance of a particular candidate will not be necessary in order to secure this agreement, which the people, from one end of Australia to the other, undoubtedly desire. The other provisional proposal is that relating to the transfer of the State debts. Some' I honourable members profess to favour this agreement, provided that it can be coupled with one for the transfer of the State debts, and that both can be carried concurrently. I am confident that if a debts were formulated and submitted to the States they would readily agree to it. sary. The debts have only to be taken over. but the transfer of the State debts is entirely dissociated from this agreement, so far as its acceptance or rejection is concerned. The one does not affect the other. lutely inseparable. not, so far as the necessity to secure the passing of both concurrently is concerned. If a Board consisting of the best available financial experts-of men outside Parliament, and free from political bias or trammels-were appointed, and could show the States a means of securing considerable savings on their debts, while at the same time conferring upon them distinct advantages",16,Telephone Exchange Vide Page 3913 On Motion By Mr Deakin

23,Mr Richard Foster,"They are in borrowing it is hardly conceivable that they would offer any objection to their transfer. Such a scheme would, in my opinion, be gladly received. better scheme than one to take over the debts; the Commonwealth would take all the risk. not; the States would still have to pay the interest on the transferred debts, and the proposed per capita payment of 25s. per annum, instead of being handed over to the Slate Treasurers, could be credited against the liability of the States for interest on the debts taken over. There is possibly in the minds of some of the State Treasurers an objection to the transfer of the whole of the debts. Probably there would be a general agreement on their part to a proposal that the Commonwealth should take over all loans floated by them on the London market, allowing the debts represented by local borrowing to remain with them. I cannot conceive that this Parliament would offer any objection to the States being given freedom, not only to control their own future borrowing, but Jo engage in borrowing on the local market without the intervention of the Commonwealth Board of Experts. would have no power to interfere. would not desire to interfere. I have only to say, in conclusion, that I believe that there is no disloyalty to Federation in any part of the Commonwealth. Federation up to date may not have justified all expectations; but there is on the part of the people of Australia a spirit of expectancy and a belief that eventually the Union will develop on the broadest national lines; that the National Parliament will take the widest possible survey of the necessities of the Australian people; that it will, promote perfect freedom of commercial intercourse from one end of the Commonwealth to the other, and that it will for ever stand as the guardian of the liberties of a peaceful and prosperous community. I confess that the importance of fhe subject before us is to me almost so overpowering that I tremble to follow the great financial experts in this House who have so far addressed themselves to it. We have before us the greatest question that has yet been submitted to our consideration, and honourable members are now afforded an opportunity to prevent a great constitutional transgression. Tariff Bills and measures relating to defence, coinage, and land taxation are undoubtedly important, and deserve careful consideration, but they are, after all, only instruments and means to the efficacy of government. Whether they are passed or rejected, the machinery of Government will not cease to revolve-the Commonwealth will not cease to exist. But it is otherwise with the imminent question before us, involving as it does national supremacy in finance, the peace, good government, and prosperity of generations yet unborn, and our good name in history for all time. Two years ago I presented to this House a scheme for the settlement of the financial relations of the States and the Commonwealth. Brisbane Labour Conference scheme? posed that scheme. member's party did not oppose it, and he will have to support it at the next general election. is to me what the first-born is to every mother. Every mother thinks her firsttorn is the greatest child on earth, and T have the same opinion with regard to the scheme I have formulated. I would direct the attention of honourable members to the early history of the American Constitution, and would ask them what would have happened if the amendment proposed hy one of the delegates from South Carolina on behalf of the Southern State Righters had been accepted. That amendment proposed that the Federal Government should make to the States for all time a per capita payment of 5 dollars per annum. If Alexander Hamilton-who , by the-bye, was a Britisher, born in the West Indies, and was one of the greatest financiers the world has ever seen-ha d not opposed that amendment, it would have become part of the Constitution, and the United States of America would now be paying out of her annual income of £120,000,000 £90,000,000 to the States. The Federal Government would thus have had only £[30,000,000 to pro-",18,Telephone Exchange Vide Page 3913 On Motion By Mr Deakin

33,Mr King O'malley,"My schemevide for the carrying out of its national functions. AlthoughI am an uncompromising, dipped-in-the-dew and dyed-in-thewool Radical, I admit that history shows that the Conservatives of more than one country have come to the rescue of its Constitution at its Hamilton and Washington framed the American Constitution, and I believe that the honourable members for Flinders, Mernda, and Parkes will save this Constitution, although it is at its last gasp. A week or two ago I saw it dying, now I see it living; I saw it being taxed, not out of its existence, because that cannot be done, but out of its vitality-the national supremacy of finance gone. NowI see hope. "" Listening love hears the rustle of its wings."" I am pleased that we have members great enough, notwithstanding their surroundings, to do their duty. In this case it is a great duty. are legislating for the countless multitudes of future generations, who may either bless or curse us. My honourable friends opposite, for whom I have no ill-will, propose that the arrangement contained ini the agreement with the Premiers shall be put into the Constitution. They say that if afterwards it needs alteration, the Constitution! can be amended. Had such a provision been put into the American Constitution how could the Northern States have successfully put down the rebellion of the Southern States? I remember when they were hanging negroes to the lampposts in the streets of New York, at the time of the income tax being put on. Abraham Lincoln issued his proclamation declaring the State of New York to be under martial law, but Governor Seymour said that the people would not pay a penny of the tax, because it was unconstitutional. Had the Northern States been considerably hampered for want of money, what hope would they have had of puttinig down the rebellion?' There is no difference between us and the people of the United States. We both spring from British loins. At the time of the war nearly all those in the United States were of British descent. When families come to fight about money matters, they fight more fiercely than strangers. When the validity of a will is disputed in the courts of law, it is wonderful how hard the.children swear that something was wrong. If this provision! is put into the Constitution, an evil will grow out of it as the slavery evil grew in America. When George Washington, Jefferson, and others freed their niggers, the people said that it was of no consequence; but when, in 1806, Whitney invented the cotton gin, making cotton, and, consequently, negroes, valuable, slavery got a strong hold upon the country. We know how English artilast gasp. sans suffered by the closing of cotton factories during the war. Never settle a question on a wrong basis. If it is settled rightly, it will be settled for ever. If the proposed arrangement is put into the Constitution, we shall ultimately have a fight, not on the question of slavery, but in regard to money. The insertion of this arrangement in the Constitution will mean the laying of a foundation for the dissolution of the Union. It will not affect me personally, but it will affect the children of honourable members,, none of whom desires that his posterity should curse the day when he entered this Parliament. The We proposed arrangement would reduce the Commonwealth to the level of a paltry corporation like the Hudson's Bay Company. It would weaken the National Government and strengthen the State Governments. BeforeI tackle this question in dead earnest, let me say that I am a State Rights man. But I am also a National Constitution Supremacy man. It is wonderful how much better a little experience is than theory. Ability which in the abstract is wonderful, in the concrete nearly always fails. Experience is the unerring test of the wisdom of human undertakings. When a man has lived under a Federation, and watched the battles in which, sometimes, the National Government has been the aggressor, and, sometimes, a State Government, and has carefully studied in such circumstances economical, social, and financial conditions he must feel that the delegated powers of the National Government should not be diminished. The Commonwealth exercises certain powers delegated to it by the Constitution, which was framed by a Convention elected by the people. f These powers are set down in black and white. All others remain with the States. The Commonwealth, however, is supreme in regard to finance. My honourable friends opposite propose to take from the Commonwealth that supremacy, giving it to the States. In borrowing £202,000,000 prior to Federation, the States pledged their Customs and Excise revenue to the money lenders of the world, and in borrowing some £48,000,000 since, they have similarly pledged their three-fourths share under the Braddon section. with which I am connected recognises that.

I want to look carefully into this matter, because there has been so much talk about the incompetence of the Commonwealth and the competence of the States, to whom we are asked to hand over this trust. A vast amount, then, has gone for the repurchase of land for various purposes. That is to say, the States have sold land at a low price and treated the proceeds as revenue, and then they have bought the land back at a high price out of loan funds! treating the revenue from that as ordinary spent for works which were good and revenue. treat the return from the repurchased lands or renewal fund, to replace them, you as ordinary revenue.

Another £[15,000,000 of borrowed money has been utilized on works which were at. one time reproductive, but which are no longer so, because they are virtually worn out, and there is no repair or renewal fund to replace them. I find that another j£i5,000,000 was actually borrowed for the purpose of paying interest on debt. Moreover, in fully seven cases out of ten, the States floated their loans at a rate of interest which their unorganized credit did not warrant, and consequently had to float them at a huge discount. When a State floats its loan at a lower rate of interest than its unorganized credit warrants, it must submit to a huge discount, and that discount becomes a part of the interestbearing permanent debt. If a State whose unorganized credit will float a loan of £2,000,000 at 3 per cent, par, floats it 1 A vast at 3 per cent., it creates a liability of £2,000,000, and receives only £1,860,000 cash.

Under my scheme, Tasmania would have received £258,261, or £23,672 more than she will receive if this agreement be accepted. I would ask the representatives of Tasmania8 and Victoria whether they realize what they are proposing to do by voting for this agreement. They must remember that both Victoria and Tasmania are settled States, and that no matter what land taxation may be resorted to, or how the lands may be subdivided, they will never secure a big population unless they draw it from the back-wash of the other States. If Queensland and New South Wales enter upon a boom policy, and bring out thousands of immigrants, they will have to build more railways into the interior, and provision will have to be made there for more postal buildings, new telegraph lines, and increased services generally. Young men in Victoria and Tasmania will not P y £$> £ > 01 £ 7 per acre for land a 6 there when they can obtain equally good land in Queensland for £ 1 per acre. land is obtainable at ios. per acre, and a block of 160 acres may be secured free of charge. of that. What has happened in America will happen here. Some of the New England States have not increased their population for forty years. Many of their young men and women some time ago took up land in the Western States and settled there, leaving the old men and women behind. Tasmania and Victoria will have a similar experience. As it is, their population comprises more old ""men and women and children than does that of any of the other States. population remains stationary they will be called upon to bear their share of the cost of providing additional services for the increasing populations of the other States. Under this agreement, they will not be benefited by a Protectionist policy, although they certainly would have to pay duties under a revenue Tariff. I fail to understand, therefore, howa Protectionist can vote for this agreement. It suggests to my mind a conspiracy. I do not think that the Government are mentally responsible for this proposal. We know that there comes a time to every man when, for some unaccountable reason, he is led to do something which he afterwards Tegrets. During the last ten years, the increase of population in Victoria has been only which, at 25s. per head, would give the State a return of ,£10,000. But, under this scheme, her people will be called upon to pay for the public works constructed in the States whose populations are growing rapidly. I should not object to that were the arrangement a fair and square one, but it is not. rage. The people of Victoria and Tasmania make a great mistake if they think they will greatly benefit by it. I hear it said that if a land tax were imposed which would have the effect of cutting up the large estates in Victoria, a huge population would settle there. But Vermont has not a huge population, although its Government would almost tax your nose off your face. Neither has Maine a big population. But the Western States, whose land is cheap, are adding to their populations by millions. Oklahoma, the new State which has just entered the Union, has a population of over 1,500,000. territory. the time when I left America, one could not cross its borders without being stopped by United States soldiers. The States of Vermont and New Hampshire have contributed healthy young men and women to build up that new State. Similarly, a considerable part of our vigorous population will leave Victoria and Tasmania, and move to the larger States, where land is cheap. Twenty or thirty years hence, there will be a backwash, but while land is ' cheaper elsewhere than it is in these States, population will not greatly increase here. I am amazed, therefore, that the representatives of Victoria and Tasmania While their should be ready to vote for the agreement. I hardly know what to call it-the compact forged in a secret conclave of the enemies of the Commonwealth, or the proposal of the special representatives of Australian combines and rings and trusts. At any rate, the danger signal is flying. Under myproposal the States would receive yearly £6,109,564. more than the States are entitled to. Under the proposal before us, the States would receive yearly only £5J543>75°> t 0 which must be added another £'125,000, making in all about £5,668,750. If that sum is deducted from the £6,109,564 which I would return to the States, the difference amounts to only £440,814. about 8,000 a year, Uncler the Premiers' scheme, however, there would be an expanding mortgage on the Commonwealth assets, and its sovereign national financial powers would be mortgaged to the States. In addition to paying to the States annually £6,109,564, my scheme contained this proposalIn recognition of the fact that the increase It is a constitutional outin the population of the Commonwealth and the further development of its resources will entail upon the Governments of the settled States increased expenditure in connection with the functions of government retained by them, while such increase and development will produce a concurrent increase in the revenues derivable by the Commonwealth, in respect to Customs and Excise duties, it is proposed that the surplus Commonwealth revenue resulting in any nnancial year from the excess of revenues received in that year over the expenditure which takes",23,Telephone Exchange Vide Page 3913 On Motion By Mr Deakin

Not only would I return to the States £6,109,564 a year, but I would give them a perpetual interest in any surplus above the Commonwealth requirements. delegates of the Southern States of America made a mistake in not insisting on a perpetual interest in the national surplus-the amount remaining after national needs had been provided for. Many a time the Federation has had a huge surplus which might well States, and w ould have helped them in r many ways. I also proposed the establishment of a national postal banking system, which would enable the Commonwealth to finance its requirements. If , two years ago, £174,588,795 of the State debts had been transferred to the Commonwealth, the taxpayers of Australia would now be saved £436,397 per annum. I proposed that, in addition to taking over so much of the debts, and paying the States .£6,109,564 a year, a sinking fund of ,£870,000 a year should be established, which, invested at 3J per cent, would pay off the transferred debts in sixty years. It is useless now to speak of getting money at 3 per cent. Only great nations like the United States and Great Britain can do so. Germany and Japan cannot. The balance of the debts was to be financed by the national bank. If the debts were transferred to the Commonwealth, under the scheme of the honourable member for Mernda, Victoria would be made responsible for £18,000,000 more than she now pays interest on, which would increase her annual interest payments by £692,000, and her fer cafita indebtedness by £14. Similarly, New South Wales would be made responsible for an additional ^3J5°°J°OO, bility would be increased; while Queensland, South Australia, and Western Australia would gain at the expense of the other three States. Under my scheme, Victoria would not be responsible for more than she has borrowed. She has not been as much a spendthrift as the other States. Why, then, should she be called upon to pay part of the debt into which Queensland was thrown? Although not a parochialist, I wish to be fair. I would, transfer to the Commonwealth only so much of Mr King O'Malley. the debts of the States as they would have revenue to pay for, and, as the loans fell wealth stock. In sixty years the sinking fund of which I have spoken would wipe out the debts transferred to the Commonwealth, and the States would then be paid their share of the revenue directly. the I should like to' ask honourable members why they have not looked into and examined my scheme, and what it contains. It is as follows:I -FEATURE S OF SCHEME. The essential features of the present scheme of adjustment are :have been handed to the (i.) The cessation of monthly payments of surplus revenue by the Commonwealth to the States, (ii.) The assumption by the Commonwealth of f u l l responsibility for such portion of the debt of each State as would involve for interest and sinking fund an annual payment equal to that State's fair proportion of the average three-fourths of the net Customs and Excise revenue of the Comin interest monwealth, such average three-fourths to be based on the results for the six and a half years ending 30th June, 1907, and to exclude the revenue collected under the special Western Australian Tariff. That is based on the Braddon section, which we are going to dispense with now, in order to take on either the Wade or the Deakin blight(iii.) The establishment of a National Bank of Deposit, Issue, Exchange, and Reserve, for ""the purpose of carrying out with facility and economy the financial transactions of the Commonwealth and States Governments. (iv.) The establishment of a Sinking Fund. in connection with all Public Debt for which the Commonwealth becomes responsible. (v.) The appointment of Sinking Fund Trustees, whose position shall be such as to prevent the misappropriation of the fund by an impecunious Treasurer. and Tasmania's responsiEvery one is aware that in this country, when State Treasurers have found themselves short, they have put out both hands, grabbed whatever sinking funds they could get, and utilized them to inflate their revenues. Under my scheme, I propose that trustees shall be appointed who will be independent of Parliament, and free from the influence of the Treasurer of any impecunious Government(vi.) The inauguration of the scheme to take place .on ist July, 1908, or, if that be unconstitutional, at the expiration of the Braddon clause. II -CESSATIO N (i.) Up to the present time, payments have, in accordance with sections 89 and 93 of monthly by the Commonwealth to the States. (ii.) These payments have consisted of surplus revenue ascertained by crediting each State with the Commonwealth receipts in respect thereof, and debiting it with the Commonwealth expenditure on its behalf. (iii.) This method of adjusting the financial relations of the Commonwealth and the States has been very generally known as the ""book-keeping system."" (iv.) The"" book-keeping system"" was compulsory under the Constitution for "" five years from the imposition of uniform duties of Customs,"" and might then, under section 94, be replaced by such other method as Parliament deemed fair. (v.) The five years period expired on 8th October, 1906. (vi.) During the six and a half years from ist January, 1901, to 30th June, 1907, the surplus Commonwealth revenue paid to the States has totalled £48,919,706, £7,526,108 per annum. (vii.) It is proposed under the present scheme to discontinue these monthly payments as from ist July, 1908. (viii.) Under the Braddon clause (section 87) the States are, for ten years after the establishment of the Commonwealth, arid thereafter until Parliament otherwise provides, entitled to receive at least three-fourths of the net revenue from Customs and Excise. (ix.) This period of ten years expires on 31st December, 1910. (s.) Payments made by the Commonwealth to the States as a whole have invariably exceeded three-fourths of the total net revenue from Customs and Excise. (xi.) land fell short of that State's three-fourths of net revenue. (xii.) January, 1901, to 30th June, 1907, the aggregate three-fourths of net Customs and Excise revenue of the whole Comrevenue amounted to £43,191,357; an monwealth, exclusive of revenue under Western average of £6,644,824 per annum.

In lieu of the payments now made monthly to the States, it is proposed :(i.) That the Commonwealth sliall undertake the responsibility for a portion of the Public Debt of each State. (ii.) That, for the purpose, of determining the portions to be taken over by the Commonwealth, an actuarial valuation on a 3? per cent, basis shall be obtained of the future payments to be made by way of interest and redemption on all loans outstanding on 30th June, igo8. ' (iii.) That the Commonwealth shall relieve or an average of each State of such of these loans, taken in order of dates of maturity, as would represent a present liability on which the State's average three-fourths of net Customs and Excise revenue would pay interest at the rate of 3^ per cent., and sinking fund at the rate of £ per cent. (iv.) That, on account of the leakage in Tasmanian Customs and Excise revenue, due to the unrecorded purchase of dutiable goods in other St.ites for 'consumption in Tasmania, additional Tasmanian debt representing a present liability of £500,000 -shall be assumed by the Commonwealth. (v.) That, in respect of properties transferred from the States to the Commonwealth, each State shall be relieved by the Commonwealth of the responsibility for debt having at ist In three years the payments to QueensJuly, 1908, a value equal to the estimated value as at ist January, 1901, of the property of that State so transFor the six and a half years from ist ferred.

The amount of interest payable on the ment about £870,000. I come now to the bank. important. What has amazed me is that the States, In all the years that they have been piling up debts, have never tried to get the benefit of an institution that would enable them to organize their credit. We have now reached a time when, if the Commonwealtb or the States do not organize some sort of financial system that will enable them to utilize their credit, John Bull, or John Bull's investor, will tell them that they have reached the end of their tether. I can see that coming. It came in all the South American States; it came in Mexico; it came in the Central American States; and it will come in Australia. I have, therefore, had this banking scheme carefully drafted upon a financial basis. All finance rests upon some fundamental basis, and the people that deviate from that basis must become bankrupt. bank wants a basis. I have laid it down in my scheme, because I am a banker. If I did not understand it, and if I had not had experience among some of the cleverest financial men that America has ever produced, I should not have presumed to submit a scheme to the House. It would have been an impertinence. My proposals, then, in regard to the National Postal Bank, are as Some exception has been taken to the power follow :IV 1. In order to .facilitate and economize the and I desire to show the House the reason carrying out of the nnancial transactions of the Commonwealth and the States, and especially for the suggestion. Many years ago, in those connected with the conversion, redemption, America, when specie payments were rerenewal, and issue of loans, it is proposed to sumed, several of the large brokers-of Wallestablish a National Bank of Deposit, Issue, street, and, I am sorry to say, several Exchange, and Reserve. 2. It is proposed :(i.) That this bank shall be conducted manded all their payments in greenbacks, purely as a Government Department, absolutely free from political conand, when they had secured about trol. Honourable members will see, therefore, that from the Sub-Treasurer. w^hile I have great confidence in members Sub-Treasurer did not have that amount of Parliament as politicians, I have not the of gold, and a contract had to be given same confidence in them as hankers-(ii.) That it shall be so constituted as to bonds, with the result that half-a-dozen possess all the powers and immunisyndicates made a profit of several million ties requisite to its security, to the dollars. recovery of its debts, and to the disposal of its property, (iii.) That its capital shall be represented by 12,000 shares, of £100 each, of which at least 6,000 shall be in the hands of the Commonwealth Government, and that of the balance no State Government shall hold more than 1,000 shares. This is very (iv.) That the shares of the bank shall be transferable only to the Governments of the Commonwealth and the States; that the failure of any or all of the States Governments to subscribe shall not prevent the bank from commencing operations; and that in the event of a State Government desiring todispose of shares in the bank, the CommonweaUh Government shall have the first option of purchasing. (v.) That the Commonwealth and State Governments holding shares shall be jointly and severally liable in respect of all transactions of the bank. (vi.) That the bank shall act as the agent for the Mint in the purchase of raw gold and silver and the issue of coin. I emphasize that paragraph because I have heard it said that I wanted to flood Australia with paper money. I have never proposed to do so. I want the money issued by the National Bank to be guaranteed by gold or by Australian bonds. I want to know when I have it in my pocket that it is valuable. (vii.) That the bank shall be empowered to issue notes which shall, throughout the Commonwealth, be legal tender at all places except the head' office of the bank in each State; and that at sucb head offices payment of the value of notes presented may be made in gold . or Commonwealth Consols, at the option of the Comptroller-General of the bank. I propose to give the Comptroller-General THE NATIONAL POSTAL HANK. to redeem notes in Commonwealth consols; bankers, combined to make the United States pay heavily for the resumption.

I do not propose that the National Postal Bank shall be run by civil servants who are not trained bankers; because a man cannot run a bank any more than he can a law office or a store without training.

There is no love in the matter; the only difference would be that a boror 5 per cent, instead of 7 per cent, or 8 per cent. If a borrower pays 5 per cent, or 6 per cent., he doubles his interest every twelve years, and if he pays 8 per cent., he doubles it every nine years, and so on; all the system does is to give the farmer the advantage of the difference in time. This proposal for a National Postal Bank, if not carried now, will have to be carried at some time: Perhaps when I am gone, some man will arise, and see the scheme a banking system.

This is where the proposed Council of Finance fails. If Victoria, New South Wales, and other of the States required money, for instance, for railway construction, the Council of Finance would be in London investigating the whole matter; and the States would have to go on the market, and compete with each other, seeing that they could not delay the work. But under the system I am advocating a State Government could go to the National Postal Bank in the State, and get a credit on the ledger, just in the same way as the British Government have a credit on the ledger of the Bank of England, and as the municipalities have credits. Bank would operate for the States until the bank itself, and not the States in open competition, could float the loan. Council of Finance is a proposal for State Socialism which must mean failure; indeed, I call it anti-Socialism, because any one who desired to make Socialism a success would never have submitted such a proposal. Under my scheme, it is further provided(x.) That the bank shall, in other respects, carry on an ordinary banking business, receiving from the public moneys on current account or fixed deposit, and making advances on good security. (xi.) That the bank shall carry out the inscription of all Commonwealth and State Inscribed Stock, and make all arrangements necessary for the conversion, redemption, renewal or issue of Commonwealth, State, and Municipal Loans.

That the General Posi Office in each capital shall be the head office of the bank in that State, and that any post office within the Commonwealth carrying on the business of a money-order office may be constituted a branch of the bank. (xvii.) That the bank shall be a bank of reserve for the deposit of reserves of the banking companies operating in the Commonwealth, (xviii.) That the regulations requisite for controlling the bank reserves shall be drawn up by the Board of Management of the bank and the Council of the Associated Banks of -Australia, and approved by the Governor General in Council.

That at the London office, and at the head office of the bank in each State, Commonwealth Consols shall be ob-' The National Postal tainable in sums of £10 and upwards. V -SINKIN G FUNDS. 1. It is proposed that in connection with all The Public Debt for which the Commonwealth assumes responsibility, whether by direct flotation or by assumption of liability on behalf of a State, there shall be established a sinking fund of i per cent. 2. A sinking fund of this amount would, . if invested annually at 3 per cent., provide for the repayment of a loan in the sixty-sixth year. 3. A sinking fund of 1 per cent.; similarly invested, would liquidate a loan in the fortyseventh year; one of i i per cent, in the thirty-eighth year; and one of 2 per cent, in the thirtyfirst year. 4. It is further proposed :(i.) That the sinking fund shall be placed under the control of a Board of Trustees, and shall not under any circumstances be available for any purposes other than those connected with the conversion, redemption, or renewal of Public Debt, (li.) That the trustees constituting the Board shall beChairman -The Comptroller-General of the National Postal Bank. The Chief Justice of the Commonwealth. The President of the Senate. The Speaker of the House of 'Representatives."" The Auditor-General. The Chairman of the Associated Banks. This would not be a labour bank, nor a bank for aristocrats.

That all moneys received for Commonwealth Consols sold over the counter by the National Postal Bank shall be placed to the credit of the Sinking Fund Trustees.",30,Portion Of State Debts
64,Mr King,"(iv.) That, in so far as they are not required for the purposes of immediate redemption, conversion, or renewal, the sinking fund moneys shall be mainly invested in the purchase of such State securities as the Commonwealth has accepted the responsibility for, and as may from time to time come on the market.

That such stock shall bear interest at the rate of 3 per cent, per annum, payable half-yearly. -(iv.) That the price payable for Commonwealth Consols sold over the countei by the National Postal Bank shall be fixed from time to time by the Governor General in Council on the advice of the Comptroller-General of the bank.

It is proposed that arrangements shall be made between the Commonwealth Treasurer and the several State Treasurers to avoid clashing in the applications for loans. State. New South Wales Victoria Queensland 'South Australia . . . Western Australia.. Tasmania Commonwealth [143] I propose that the States shall have perfect freedom to borrow, either locally or on the London market, but they would not require to go outside the bank in order to raise a loan. If we shut them out, and forced them to borrow locally, half-a-dozen Australian brokers might unite to raise brokerage and underwriting charges in such a way that the States would be sacrificed. On the other hand, if they were free to borrow money on the London market, they would be able to float their loans either through this bank or independently of it, and would save thousands of pounds. order to enable the Commonwealth to renew, or redeem loans taken over by If they were tied to the Australian marthe States, it is proposed :ket, the local brokers would 110 sooner disThat the Commonwealth shall, from pose of a loan than they would sell it in London. I would let the States borrow where they like, and as they please, and under my scheme they would not have"" to make any sacrifices for the benefit of the Australian brokers. If by means of the National Postal Bank System they could float their loans at a quarter, or a half, per cent, less than they could float them independently on the market, they would not desire to go beyond it. Then, again, if they were able to obtain from the bank an overdraft to enable them to carry on their local activities, they would not need to go into the market to borrow money. The States, go on to the money market now because they have no option. They cannot ask a banking corporation for an and therefore, they are forced to float a t loan on the public money market when they are in need of additional funds to carry on their undertakings.

Regarding my provision for the division in perpetuity of the surplus revenue of the Commonwealth, I sayIn recognition of the fact that the increase -in the population of the Commonwealth, and the further development of its resources, will entail upon the Governments of the several States increased expenditure in. connection with the functions of government retained by them, while such increase and development will produce a concurrent increase in the revenues derivable by the Commonwealth in respect of Customs and Excise duties, it is proposed that -the surplus Commonwealth Tevenue resulting in any nnancial year from the excess of the revenues received in that year over the expenditure which took place therein, shall in the first instance be applied to the liquidation of any Commonwealth revenue deficit which may have accumulated, and that the balance shall be distributed amongst the States on a per capita basis. ""As to the liquidation of Government liabiliducers and traders of Australia would be ties to the National Postal Bank by the crippled. proceeds of the issue of Commonwealth branch managers, when they had obligaconsols, it is proposed thatIn the event of the National Postal Bank rethough there might be more money within quiring repayment of the overdraft of the Gothe control of the banks than ever before in vernment of the Commonwealth, or any State, the Federal Treasurer may, at his discretion, their history. I shall presently show that authorize the issue of Commonwealth consols to the Yankees, in trying to get control of the the value of the repayments so required, and meat business of the Argentine, have comutilize the 'proceeds in liquidating the liability .menced by starting a bank. to the bank. made by the borrowing Governments shall be my notes regarding the necessity for estab.paid to the Sinking Fund Trustees for investment lishing a Government national bankin Commonwealth and State securities. The National. Postal Banking system will eventually become the clearing house for the Commonwealth, the States, and the municipalities of Australia. I have also added notes on the necessity for establishing a Commonwealth National Bank, which I desire to read, in' order that they may be embodied in the Hansard report. I say thatThe supreme question in an industrial country is where should the control of the money volume rest ? In whose hands can this omnipotent financial power be trusted ? Every writer on political economy, from Aristotle to Adam Smith, from Ricardo to Calhoun, concedes that a change in the money volume alters the price of every ounce and yard of goods and every foot of land. Whom can we (rust with this financial despotism? the managers and directors of the private banking corporations and other fiduciary institutions wield this power. They possess the yard measure, and can lengthen or shorten it as they please, and when they will. They control the pound-weight, and can make it heavier or lighter as they choose. This explains the puzzle so mysterious to ordinary people, why those who Mr King O'Malley. deal in money always get rich, while many of those who trade in other commodities go through the bankruptcy courts. The great question now is, "" Shall the Commonwealth establish its own national postal banking system and manage its own finances through the regulation of its own money volume, or continue under the benevolent guardianship of capitalists-lamb s in the keeping of wolves?"" Bank managers and directors now possess this power. The men who increase and diminish at their pleasure the currency (not bank-note currency merely, but discounts, cheques, credits, promissory notes, drafts, letters of credit, and coin), possess the power to change prices at their will. No one will deny that the managers of the banks can make or break a town. Honourable members must recollect how, during the crisis of 1893, small communities were made to suffer by the closing of banks. At the present time, a few men in the great cities could ear-mark every £ \ they lend, and have telegrams Sent to the country banks, saying, "" Stop discounting for a few days,"" when the proThey would be told by the tions to meet, that money was tight; alTo continue The repayments subsequently In 1874, the New York city banks increased their money volume £600,000 in one month, causing prices to rise, and in March, 1875! decreased it £1,000,000 in one week, causing prices to f a l l , thus changing the value of every commodity in that city. The"" British Bullion Committee "" of 1810, recorded an emphatic statement, that, in the presence of a panic, it is the duty of the Bank of . England to lend money freely to all solvent parties. In 1825 the Bank, at the request of the Government, lent money even on goods to merchants. In 1857, its loans on private securities went up to £55,000,000 in a few months. orable member is getting wide of the question, and is now dealing rather with the banking system than with the financial relations of the Commonwealth and the States. institution of a Government national bank for managing thefinancesof the Commonwealth and the States, and received the assurance of the Prime Minister that, on this motion, I could discuss that proposition.

In the panic of 1893 the banks, instead of relieving the money famine, actually contracted their loans by millions in the worse of the crisis, and forced the debtors least able to pay, to sacrifice all their property, of any change in credits or production can be although their cash resources had increased by millions. If that is so, and the private banks are not able to carry on the financing of private corporations and business men, how are they going to help this Commonwealth or the States when a great crisis approaches? That is why I want to prove to the House this afternoon the necessity banking system in place of a Council of A Council of Finance, which The fundamental principle of the importance If they are not inof controlling the operations of the money recognised economic thinkers. The way to prevent a speculative disaster or shrinkage of proper medicine for the prevention and cure of panics, is recognised by the Bullion Com' and all the other financial doctors. But the banking corporations refuse to administer the prescription because it is dangerous to midnight madness. But the Commonwealth is big enough and strong enough to loan money from itself, instead of bringing loss on itself. A moderate increase of the money volume when on financial facilities would be extending juschange, and when the crops are being hara scarcity of currency. If we had a postal banking system, the Our private banking The operation of the price average is principally influenced by the movements of money volumes, credits, and production.

I am never frightened to be in a minority if I am rightThe movement of the money volume is the vital monetary problem-the master-key to the nnancial situation. Through the control of this movement prices may be made to rise or f a l l or remain substantially steady. control of justice or .injustice, prosperity or panic, wealth diffusion or wealth congestion. Power to dominate the operation of the money volume is power to do justice or injustice between debtors and creditors, employees and employers, purchasers and sellers, landlords and tenants, money-lenders and borrowers; power to increase the weight and value of every debt -publi c or private-in the Commonwealth, power to generate prosperity or panic, power to regulate industry and determine the distribution of wealth. Such power is an attribute of sovereignty, the prerogative of the King, and ought to belong to none but the sovereign people exercised through His Majesty's Parliament and Government in the interests ot the whole people. At present the vicissitudes of mining speculations, management of private banking corporations and the blind chance of monopoly determine the movements of money. The private banking system of the Commonwealth is only a legalized monopoly for the gathering of wealth from the many, and its concentration in the hands nf the privileged few. The private banking corporation system rests on a credit given by usage to bank notes, for which the Australian people provide the security in their endorsed promissory notes, bonds, and mortgages. The legal representative possesses no value in itself; it is based on actual wealth, the land of the Commonwealth and its productions, and not upon the inherent value of its material. The question is why the Commonwealth and States cannot operate a banking system on a sounder security, and gather the profits for the public benefit, instead of empowering a special privileged few to become r/ealthy by private banking. By increasing the rate of interest, both the principal of the money and the interest upon it have an increased power over property. The value of money depends upon its power to accumulate value for its owner by interest. Money could not be the object of a medium of exchange unless it were necessary to part with it to make it valuable. For this reason it possesses no power to accumulate by interest in the possession of its owner, for, if it accumuthe wealth of the nations. lated, it would be legally equivalent to an interest bearing bond or mortgage or productive property, and its owner would not need to dispose of it to make it productive. All goods, wares, and merchandise, although they may be exchanged for money many times, soon find a place where they are consumed, but money never reaches a point where it can be used except for exchange. If money be capital seeking investment, it is always seeking investment without ever being invested, because when it has discovered one investment it is as much a seeker after a second and third investments as if it had not been invested at all. Money is a combination of legal powers, expressed on metal, paper, or some other subMr King O'Malley. stance; its value is the standard or determiner of the value of all other things, and it serves as a public medium of exchange for land, labour, and all commodities. When the abolition of simple barter occurs the power to inflate begins. This power must always exist in nations which have abandoned barter. The only vital question is where shalt it be trusted ? Under the present financial system it rests in the keeping of the directors and This means managers of the private banking corporations, who operate for the benefit of their shareholders. The men who increase and diminish at their pleasure the currency (not bank-note currency merely, but discounts, cheques, credits, promissory notes, drafts, letters of credit, and coin), possess the power to change prices at their will. Now the directors and managers of private banks possess this power, which is an attribute of sovereignty, and should only be exercised by all the people through the Government. The largeness of the public debt, the enormous business transacted by each State, and the huge amount of interest that must be paid annually by all, appear sufficient to impress a f u l l conviction of the utility of a Commonwealth banking system, operated in conjunction with the postal system, not only in relation to the administration of the national finances, but in the general system of political economy. The Commonwealth banking system, linked with the Postal Savings Banks throughout Australia, will control the movement of the money volume, credits, and production, in the interest of all the people. All private profits on the circulation of bank notes will cease, and the postal banking syslem will be so safe and sound tlirough the confidence reposed in Government institutions, that it will absorb as deposits all the money now hoarded. This fact, together with loans at low interest, and the facilities and safety of transmitting money through an institution with an office in every village and town, and possessing the entire wealth and power of the Commonwealth back of it, would forever prevent panics. The cost of war should be deeply emphasized The total .debts of the nations of the world amount to more than £7,000,000,000. The interest on the debts, largely created by war, plus the annual appropriations for military purposes, calls for an outlay every year in times of peace of fully £625,000,000. The total gold in the world available for currency amounts to about £1,210,000,000. It is evident that nations cannot fight without borrowing. The world's supply of gold does not express THE TRADE OF THE GREAT NATIONS AND THE The trade of the chief countries of Christendom last year reached a total of £4,000,000,000, an increase of £275,000,000 over last year.

Germany United States France Austria-Hungary Italy Spain Over 56 per cent, of the stock of silver was held by the same countries, the United States leading again with £143,800,000. In 1890, Mulhall estimated the world's banking power a t £3,289,000,000, of which the United States was credited with £1,060,000,000. Since that year the banking power of the United States alone has increased to £2,608,000,000, over 146 per cent.,. that of all the other countries has increased only to £3,333,000,000-the banking power of the United States being thus little less than one-half that of the entire world.

Leaving These are deposits due to the Australian public, against which there exists no gold nor paidup capital, but simply the promissory notes, mortgages, bonds, and other securities held by the banks. The national postal banking system will, in addition to possessing security of equal value, also be guaranteed by the collective wealth of the whole of the Australian nation. Falling prices are unjust to debtors : Their debts remain the same, but their means of payment shrink, the paper instruments call for as many sovereigns as ever, but the number of bushels of wheat, or bales of wool, or tons of potatoes that must be sold to get these sovereigns is double what it was when the money was borrowed and the notes written. Many a man whose assets are far greater than his liabilities is ruined for the want of a few pounds in cash at times, because it is impossible for him to collect the amounts owing . to him in time to meet his own obligations. The spasmodic rise and f a l l of general prices is one of the greatest evils that can possibly afflict an agricultural, industrial, and commercial people. Industry is liable to be unduly inflated by rising prices, and so demoralized by their f a l l , that great depressions and panics result. The operation of prices changes the distribution of wealth, alters the proportion that belongs to labour, capital, and management; gives great value to hoarded money, and lightens or intensifies .the burden of debt. D purchases a farm for £6,000, and borrows £3,000 to help world at pay for it. In a few years the fall of prices, through' rise of interest, brings his land down to a value of £3,000, but the debt has not Gold. shrunk, and the creditor takes the whole farm for a loan that was worth but half the farm £ at the time it was made.

This injustice has been inflicted on debtors by the manipulation of the money volume under the controlling influence of the financial magnates governing the present banking system. Under the regime of the National Postal Bank, we shall possess a. great financial system consistingof bank credits having the power, by authority of law, to pay debts all over the Commonwealth. All the people of the Commonwealth who do business with the National Bank, through each keeping an account there, will enable the bank to make all reciprocal ... £112,697,969 payments without moving a shilling of their ... 3,563,181 money. ... 1,490,869 Foreign exchange is a system by which com... 42,098,289 mercial nations discharge their debts to each other.

Such shipments of commodities are the fundamental facts in international commerce. It is upon such facts that bills of exchange are based. International trade is an exchange of commodities, not a direct barter, but an indirect one It would make no difference in the foreign trade of any nation if it did not possess an ounce of gold or of silver, or whether its money was gold, silver,' or paper. The rates of exchange are not determined by the nature of the currency, but by the relative amounts of the settlements to be made in each"" direction between the two countries. If France and America had the same currencies as England and Australia, it would still happen as now, that bills on Paris, London, or New York would be at a discount or a premium. The amount of money wishing to go to London, New York, or Paris, and the amount wishing to come from Paris, New York, or London, would then, as now, settle how much was to be paid in London for bills on Australia, and how much was to be paid in Australia for bills on London,. Paris, or New York. With any kind of money our foreign exchanges would be conducted just as they are now. The value of each commodity would be calculated on the basis of its real value, first in the money of its own country, and ' thentranslated into the other, according to the exchange value, which is governed by laws of comparative values, and is never difficult to discover. Bills of exchange are emitted by dealers in foreign exchange on the basis of the comparative value of the two mediums, each in its own country. Our money of whatever kind is worth in a foreign country just what it is worth here, less brokerage and transportation. If more money is paid away by a Government in its ordinary expenses or for special public improvements than is received from taxation, the volume of the currency is increased and prices raised. While on the other hand if the taxes are made greater than the expenditure, the volume of money ""is decreased and prices lowered, or a rise counteracted. ever great the natural resources of a nation, however genial its climate, fertile its soil, ingenious and enterprising its citizens, or free .its institutions, if its money volume is manipulated by private capitalists for selfish ends, its -credit shrinks and prices f a l l. Its producers .and business people must be overwhelmed with bankruptcy, its industries will be paralyzed, and .destitution and poverty prevail. A few great failures from wild speculation, a contraction of the money volume, an adverse balance of trade, a foreign nnancial crisis, large sale of Australian securities held in foreign hands, heavy purchase of gold by foreign governments or banks, any drain of gold to foreign nations, a corner on gold in America, or a rapid withdrawal of loans -by concerted action of great banking corporations and unscrupulous capitalists, destroy confidence, produce nnancial stringency, and bring the producing and commercial classes face to face with ruin. The burdens of the producers inr.rease with the scarcity of money and fal l of prices. Their debts and taxes remain the same, while their labour and property decrease in value. Their property being at last exhausted, 'liquidating their debts, they become the slaves of the money lenders. All incentive Jto energy is destroyed, agriculture decays, industry is paralyzed, the producers reduced to miserable dependents on capitalists, while the ruling classes are enervated by idleness and luxury born of unearned wealth. The National Postal Banking System would prevent panics. A panic is the product of fear. Something makes business men suspect credit, and it shrinks. more plentifully cf the departed credit, takes flight itselfto the vaults of the banks. to borrow money at outrageous rates of interest to pay debts, business men slaughter prices, and widespread ruin follows the fall. the trouble. turns the failures of a few speculators into a national panic. The National Bank will stand ready at all times to prevent panics. will be no money famine while the private banks are full of money, no big interests, no need for business people, really sound, to sell at a loss. The very knowledge that the Com. monwealth will issue funds and lend money at a low rate of interest in any reasonable quantity on good security will prevent the fear and distrust of the future which forces men to rush into the market and outvie each other in selling goods at a lo°s the community except the wreckers and parasites. It will fulfil the constitutional annihilate a dangerous special privilege, and return to the sovereign people as a real possesMr King O'Malley. sion one of the most important of sovereign powers-the power of issuing and regulating the money volume of the nation. It will be as ready to finance the Commonwealth in time of war as in peace, without demanding usurious rates of interest. It will not lend money to the foreign enemies of Australia for higher interest than the Commonwealth can afford in time of danger, but it will equip the army, and send it to the front of the tight. It will free our financial system from the blighting influence of foreign disturbance. Not only would Howwe be safe from foreign panics and the vicissitudes of foreign mining speculators and markets, but the ups and downs of foreign legislation would affect us but slightly as compared with the present. It will operate as a beneficent influence in the regulation of industry and the distribution of wealth. Neither landlord nor tenant, labourer nor employer, capitalist nor magnate would be deceived nor defrauded. It would not encourage business men in times of prosperity to borrow and engage in commercial enterprises, and on the first sign of dulness demand the decrease of their overdrafts, selling their securities for less than half the value at the very time that the banks should protect them. It would beget neither feverish excitement nor despair, but the calm serenity that comes with certainty of provision. The men of enterprise could invest their money, arrange for overdrafts, employ their workers, and make their contracts with an assurance that their calculations would not be brought to nought and their enterprises wrecked by an unforeseen change of the mind of the bank manager, influenced by the directors of competing monopolies. without The regulation of the rates of interest by the National Postal Banking System will determine what proportion of their earnings the country producers and business people shall pay for the use of money. Producers possess no means of resisting the overwhelming power of accumulation given to capital, except by the establishment of a National Postal Banking System, and the maintenance of a just rate of interest. Then the inequalities of birth and economic condition will Cash instead of circulating be greatly diminished, and none of the agrithan usual to take the place culturists can be kept for any length of time the slaves of city capitalists. It becomes difficult It is not in the power of humanity to continue a more effectual form of concentrating property in the hands of the few than the high We all know rates of interest charged by the present bankIt is lack of elastic money that ing system. This method works rapidly and securely because it extorts consent as it operates. The wealth of the Commonwealth like the There wealth of other countries is rapidly accumulating in the hands of a comparatively few people in the large cities. Still it is indisputable that cities are large consumers of wealth whilst very small producers. A moderate amount of work readily produces an abundant supply of human necessaries, but the present system of the distribution of these products is such that a large number of the It will benefit all classes of hardest worked producers receive a very small share of the products, whilst the big share goes mandate, to those who never do an honest day's work. The value of money is determined by the interest that it will accumulate, and the value of all property is determined by the rent that can be obtained for it. The market value must conform to the legal standard. If the rent of any property be not sufficient to gather a sum equal to the estimated value of the property itself in as short a time as money loaned, the property will fal l in price until the rent bears the same proportion to the Value of the property that the rate of interest bears to the principal. . It is perfectly legitimate that the interest on money should regulate by its own percentage the rent of all property, because money is the legal representative of all property, and the standard by which its value is estimated. This interest is of the same quality and value as the principle loaned, and the percentage on property must be made conformable. If percentage be in the proportion of 1 to 100, the tenant of 100 acres of poorly cultivated land must pay as rent a sum in money equal to Ihe value of 1 acre of land of the same quality. If he improves the farm and makes it produce -double the crop, he must pay the value of i acre of improved land for the use of the improved zoo. He pays more value, but no greater percentage on the value of the land. Money is the legal standard of value. If the percentage interest on it be fixed at a just rate, it will equitably regulate the rent of all property, and also secure to the workers the legitimate fruits of their toil. The value of all property depreciates in pro.portion to the increase of the value of the sovereign that measures it; Whenever tbe value of money increases by a rise of interest there is a corresponding f a l l in the value of all proposits to depositors and others, and charge inperty. When interest on money rises all property falls in price so that one sovereign in money purchases two, three, or five times more property than it did before the rise. Enough .property must be added to make the rent equal to the interest on money; for no financier will invest money in property unless the property returns as good an income as the money he pays for it. Therefore the value of property must fall whenever the interest on money increases that the incomes from property and from money may be equal. Money earns for its owner by an accumulative power, by a power to secure commodities already produced and not by a natural power of growth like that contained in the germ of grain. Where this power to accumulate by interest is made greater and more rapid than the natural production by labour this law of interest becomes a gigantic -engine of evil. It gathers into the hands of a few capitalists the productions of labour "" and often deprives the producers of the necessaries of life. It is absolutely impossible for the producers and business peonle of the Commonwealth to continue to pay high rates of interest for the use. of monev, and also supply themselves witb the comforts and conveniences of l if e. All the percentage collected for the rent on pronerty, or as the interest on monev, must be paid by sales of the yearlv productions of labour, which remain over and above the support of the producers. If a very few wealthy men in any civilized nation should live fniEnllv and their posterity should do the same, in t>e -course of a few generations they would reduce to povertv nearly all the other people of the nation. Consequently, under present economic laws, extravagance in the rich, and the frequent inefficiency and imbecility of their children, are great advantages to producers. The second evil is, therefore, necessary to modify the overwhelming power of the first. In the Commonwealth the National Postal Banking System will so greatly reduce interest rates that useful productions will increase by leaps and bounds. Wealth, instead of accumulating in the hands of the few, will be distributed among producers. A large proportion employed on relief works, building up cities, will be expended in cultivating and beautifying the country. National improvements will be made to an extent, and in a perfection unexampled in the history of the world. Agriculture, manufactures, inventions, science, and the arts will flourish in every part of the nation. Those who are now non-producers will naturally become producers. Products will be owned by those who perform the labour,because the standard of distribution will nearly conform to the natural rights of humanity. Taking an average of the whole amount of the commercial and financial transactions of the Commonwealth it is probable that not one sovereign in joo is paid in specie. A small amount of money is always capable of balancing or paying a large amount of promissory notes, bonds, and mortgages, and also of buying every description of property. The money which pays for one farm may also pay for a second, a third, and fifty, the same day. Banks gain as much by the deposits as they would by the circulation of an equal amount of bank notes. They pay no interest on current account deposits, and they lend their deterest on them. In cities all business men keep a banking account. Suppose 1,000 business men keep deposit accounts of £200 each in the same bank, the total will amount to £200,000. The bank will loan this sum to the depositors themselves, and make them pay interest on it. The money may be paid out over the counter many times during the day, but before three o'clock, when the bank closes, it will return in deposit, and be ready for use the next day. Some of Ihe depositors' accounts may be reduced to a few pounds, while others may be increased to thousands, yet the average balance in bank will vary but little. Each depositor must pay £ 1 annually to the bank for keeping the account. The quantity of monev used in business is very small compared with the amount of business transacted, for it is only the average balance kept on hand. If a business man receive £20,000, keeps it one hour, and then pays it out, he uses the money only one hour. A man may he worth £100,000 and transact a business of half-a-million annually, and vet his average balance not exceed £1,000. The bank, where he keeps his balance, lends it to other depositors. The amount of money which can be kept in active circulation is comparatively small. Interest on money is a standard or governing power which forces all the producers of the Commonwealth to contribute their proportion of the products required to maintain all the non-producers, and most of the capitalists of foreign countries. A large percentage must be taken from fhe price of their products by the traders in order to enable 'the latter to pay their interest and live by the production and sale, and for the same reason, when they buy, a large percentage is added to the price of every article they require. This difference in price must be sufficient to maintain all who live on income from interest without work. In conclusion, I wish to read an extract on "" the Government National Bank of Switzerland,"" from the Age, of 7th Ma.y, 1908. 1 took it from the Age, because the Age is now the great national paper, and we turn to it as we turn to new mown hay for our horses. I hope honourable members will bear with me, because I can assure them that it has taken me forty years to think out and write what I have laid before the House this afternoon. BeforeI give the quotation from the Age, let me read the following conclusions1. That the necessary effect of the high rate of interest maintained by the present banking system, is to' accumulate wealth into large cities and property in the hands of a few capitalists. 2. That the present rates of interest greatly exceed the increase of wealth by natural production, and consequently duction beyond the ability of producers to supply. 3. That the rate of interest determines what proportion of products shall be' awarded to capital and what to the workers 4. That in proportion as the rate of interest on money is increased, the value of property and labour is decreased. Every banker, and every man familiar with economics, is aware of that fact; and it shows why property in the United States is never looked upon as a good asset. 5. That a banking system, causing constant fluctuations in value by varying rates of interest, is no more suitable as a medium of finance for a debtor nation than an elastic yard stick is fit for a measure of cloth; that justice requires uniformity of value. 6. That our present private corporation banking system rests on a fictitious basis, is unpermanent, and is productive of cruel injustice; that while i l compels producers to pay high rates of interest for the use of their own money it assists capitalists, speculators, and financial magAustralia? I am prepared to help honornates in monopolizing money, and enables them to extort large sums annually from the small and weak producers and business people, thus keeping them poor. 7. That the money volume to be of uniform value must be limited only by the requirements of business. 8. That the utilization of the Commonwealth collective credit, for the benefit of the individual, is indispensable to prosperity. I shall now read what the Age of 7th May, 1908, said of the National Bank of SwitzerlandThe absence of monetary difficulties in SwitzerI now come to a proposal which I in no land during the troublous times of 10,07 > attributed to the new central bank of issue, which started operations in that country under the tit'e of the Swiss National Bank. The capital of this organization was fixed at £2,000,000, of which £1,200,000 was subscribed by the cantons and Mr King O'Malley. existing banks of issue. The latter were so eager to participate that they applied for over three times the number of shares available. My own impression is that once a National Postal Bank is started, every private banking corporation in Australia will back it up, because it will be a bank of rediscount, which, in time of trouble, will be of great assistance. posal to bolster up private enterprise? am a believer in private enterprise, and only desire to utilize the powers of the State in order to help it. The object for which the National Bank was founded was to control the paper currency of the country, and three years were allowed for the transfer of the note issues from the existing banks to the new central institution. But shortly after the latter opened no fewer than nine banks of issue renounced their privilege, which thus accrued to the National Bank. By the end of call for pro1907 more than half the note circulation emanated from the National Bank, to which fact is due the increase of its influence on the discount market. Although the proportion of coin reserve was fixed by law at a minimum of 40 per cent, of the whole circulation, the quota retained by the National Bank has ranged from 50 to 75 per cent., and to the improvement in this respect is due the steady growth of confidence in the sufficiency of the currency when the crisis in other centres became acute. According to the Economist, 'the great advantage of the new central bank over the former system of competition in banking lay in the larger choice of bills. Two principles have been maintained by the directors throughout : only the official bank rate has been applied and only real trade bills have been discounted. The exclusion of finance bills from discount reduced the area of speculative engagements, and thus prevented the world-wide Crisis from assuming appreciable dimensions in Switzerland. Surely, what is good for Switzerland ought to be good for a debtor country like able members on the Government side to found a national bank ; and if they know a better scheme than I have suggested, I air.' quite willing to abandon mine in favour of theirs. The use of cheques and clearing houses has greatly increased since the establishment of the Swiss National Bank, which in the first six months of its existence saved cash payments of no less than £200,000,000. Unlike 'the Germans, the Swiss people seem to have accepted the new methods with alacrity, greatly to the advantage of the trade of the country. s way bind the House to carry unless they so desire, because it is my own private suggestion.

When it is stated that Englishmen are afraid of the few Labour men in this country, I can only say that it is probable Englishmen generally never heard of those Labour men. It is only the men in the financial centre who are concerned; and I shall givefiguresto show the capital which they have shut up here in Australia. My suggestion is contained in the following :V -PROVISIO NIN CASE OF SUSPENSION OF In case of suspension of any private bank, it is proposed that the Comptroller-General of the National Postal Banking System shall be empowered to levy contributions on all the private banking corporations for the protection of the -depositors, thus extending to the depositors of -each bank the collective financial strength of all the banks Supposing one of the private banks closed its doors, as did the Federal Bank, or the Bank of Van Diemen's Land a few years ago, when thousands of people were ruined, why should not the Comptroller General have power to make the sound banks' provide sufficient to pay all depositors ? putting money from one pocket into the other. same people and the same depositors; and, that being so, why are certain banks not willing to come to fche rescue of other banks? would rob Peter to pay Paul? we are all one people. The following is a summary of the main advantages of my scheme for adjusting the financial relations of the Commonwealth and the States :(i.) That it involves a minimum of interference with State rights and privileges. (ii.) That it effects a complete separation of State and Commonwealth finance. (iii.) That such separation takes effect at once. (iv.) That it provides machinery for greatly facilitating the financial transactions of Commonwealth and State Governments, both internal and external, (v.) That it deals equitably with all the States. (vi.) That it does not impose an unduly heavy burden upon the Commonwealth. (vii.) That provision is made for the satisfactory settlement of the question of transferred properties. (viii.) That allowance is made for the exceptional position of Tasmania. (ix.) That adequate sinking fund provision is made for Commonwealth loans. (x.) That provisions are made to secure the integrity of the sinking funds. (xi.) That it wiil result in extensive savings in connection with the flotation, renewal, conversion, and redemption of loans. (xii.) That under it considerable reductions will be effected in the charges made for discount, exchange, brokerage, commission, &c. I find that if we take over the whole of the debts under the proposal of the honourable member for Mernda, we shall, on the £250,000,000, save j per cent., or £625,000 a year; and that on the amount of the debts that I propose to take over, namely, £174,558,975, we shall save £436,397 per year. I desire now to give a few'figuresrelating to the financial position in Victoria. In 1891-2, the suspension of the banks in Victoria locked up £11,000,000 of capital. In 1893 the Ibanks which suspended held £68,000,000 of the people's money; and of ,£51,500,000 of fixed deposits, £17,000,000 was due to British depositors, and £34,500,000 to Australian depositors. 1 quote these figures to show why Britishers stopped depositing in Australia-wh y British capital stopped coming here. If we had a national banking system in full operation, I feel sure that the London branch would not be able to hold the money that would be offered by depositors at 3 per cent, or 3J per cent, interest. This money could be brought to Australia, and there is always use in this great Commonwealth for money at 3I per cent. What would be the functions of a national postal banking system in connection with the proposals I have been making this afternoon? First of all, the medium of exchange is the most potent force in the progress of production, trade, and commerce. The ultimate object of all trade and commerce is to exchange commodities for commodities-and what, may I ask, is Australia but a .great trading concern ? When commodities are exchanged for money, the process of trade and commerce is only half completed. The great function of banking is to supply a power for the production and transportation and distribution of commodities of general utility, following them from the original producers to the ultimate consumers.

Whatever assists to facilitate commerce during the interruption of the ordinary instruments of exchange, becomes a temporary medium of exchange, and, to all intents and purposes, fulfils the functions of money. We are constantly being told that money is the medium of exchange. That, however, is an economic mistake. Money is in reality only a small medium of exchange. The real medium is fortified credit. Money is useful for paltry and petty transactions; but in all great financial and commercial operations, the medium of exchange is not money, but fortified credits.

I wish to talk to the House as a banker; but find it hard to do so, since so few honourable members ever enter a bank, save to ask for an overdraft or to make a deposit. I am endeavouring to show the reasons why we must have a national banking system; and I think, sir, that you misunderstood my reference to the question of exchange. I am talking, not of exchange bills, but of that medium of exchange which enables nations to sell their products to each other, and has to do with the methods by which they settle their balances. I view this financial question from a different stand-point from that adopted by other honourable members; I regard it from the stand-point of a man who has helped to run the system which runs the country. I appreciated the speeches made by other honourable members; but they dealt with the question purely from the point of view of the States and the Commonwealth, and without any reference to the establishment of a national banking system. I , on the contrary, am dealing with State and Commonwealth interests, founded on a national bank. I wish to show that a national banking system is absolutely essential. turn more to the States? a sense, because the bank would enable the States to make, profits which they cannot otherwise obtain, and it would transact for them business which they themselves cannot manage. In this morning's issue of the Age there is an interesting cable message as to the efforts of the American Beef Trust to control the Argentine. Mr J. Ogden Armour, head of the meat packing firm of Armour and Company, is a is now virtually the National Bank of America, and it is reported that the treasurer of the company is shortly to become vice-president of that institution. Branches of the bank have been opened in South America, and it is thought that this step is being taken to enable the Beef Trust to control all the credit power there. Comof a nation.

The people will always have confidence in a national' bank, as they have confidence in their nation, because it is immortal. In 1803, this country suffered a greater loss from the action of the banks than it would have suffered had an invading army set fire to its buildings.

M> contention has always been that knowledge must be paid for. That is why I tried to get the salaries of the members of this Parliament increased. I felt ashamed to be receiving what we used to get. Some persons think that the Bank of the United States failed; but that is not so. Let me read a passage from The Dictionary of American Politics, by Everit Brown and Albert Strauss, regarding the American national banksThere have, in the history of this country, been two such' banks, the first from 1791 to 1811, the second from 1816 to 1836. The incorporation of the first of these was a part of Hamilton's financial scheme, and it aroused great opposition. I am the Hamilton of Australia. He was the greatest financial man who ever walked this earth, and his plans have never been improved upon. Honourable members can read his history and his books in the LibraryJefferson, Madison, and others that subsequently formed and became the leaders of the Republican party were foremost in the opposition, which was based on the lack of power nn the part of Congress to charter any such institution. The attitude of public men on this measure was among the first indications of the direction in which party lines would tend. Jefferson and the future Republicans demanded' a 'strict construction of the Constitution, and denied the grant of any such power to Congress in that instrument. Hamilton maintained that the right to charter a corporation was one of the inherent privileges of a sovereign power, that the Federal Government was a sovereign power, and need not therefore have such authority specifically granted, and that the step was "" within the sphere of the specified powers"" of the Government enumerated by the Constitution. The Bill incorporating the bank became law in 1791. The bank was to continue for twenty years, its capital was to be $10,000,000, of which $2,000,000 was to be subscribed by the government. In return the government was to receive a loan of $2,000,000, repayable in yearly instalments of $200,000. Congress agreed to charter no other bank within twenty years. The public subWhen the Bank of Van Diemen's scriptions were to be payable one-quarter ia coin, and three-quarters in three or six per cent, national debt certificates. The bank was authorized to establish branches, and its notes were to be received in payments to the United States. Although Jefferson had originally opposed the bank on the ground of the unconstitutionality of its charter, he nevertheless, while President, recognised its constitutionality by signing various acts affecting it, and in the Courts the legitimacy of its existence was never questioned. Its efforts to obtain a renewal of its charter from the United States at the expiration of its existence in 1811 were unsuccessful, as were the efforts to prolong its life by a .Pennsylvania State charter, and so it went out of existence. The head office of the bank was at Philadelphia. The Government stock in the I would not bank was sold to English bankers in 1S02 at a premium of fifty-seven per cent. The bank, had paid dividends averaging over eight per cent, per annum; while in liquidation it was bought out by Stephen Girard, of Philadelphia, one of the stockholders, and continued by him as a private institution. Any honourable member who has been to Philadelphia must remember the college founded by Stephen Girard, which no clergyman may enterIn 1816 the second Bank of the United States was incorporated. Public sentiment had been inclined in favour of such a renewal by the financial difficulties attending the war of 1812, but although the subject .was broached as early as 1814, it was two years later before the Act passed. I want to put our bank beyond the control 1 of the politicians. I would place it iri the hands of a despotic Scotchman. Scotchman is the only person who can make money without money. Hebrews cannot live in the Texas towns where the Scotch have possessionThis time it was the Federalists that were opposed to it, and by in turn supporting and opposing each of two rival plans, they had compassed the defeat of both. The powers of the bank were much the same as those of the first. Its capital stock was $35,000,000, payable one-fifth in cash and four-fifths in government stock. Does not history repeat itself? Only a few months ago those who are now Ministerialists were fighting for the supremacy of the National Constitution. I used to listen in spiritual ecstasy to the Prime Minister's marvellous declarations in its favour. Now, alas, he is going in the other direction. The American experience should determine us to establish a national banking system which cannot be attacked.

Nothing saddens me more than to see the great Nationalists of this House turning away from national greatness, and descending to the fiats of State Rights ConservatismIt was to have the custody of public funds, and five of the twenty-five directors were to be appointed by the Government. Mismanagement brought the bank into a precarious positionThere was the big mistake-whe n the politicians came in. This was the second time the bank was established. On the first occasion it was run by thoroughly trained financial men, with Hamilton, who was one of the greatest financiers of the world, at their headand the newbank president was obliged, as a matter of necessity, largely to curtail its loans. The stringency thus created awakened considerable feeling against the bank. The first information of any connection of the bank with politics was the demand of certain of President Jackson's political friends for the removal of the president of a New England branch, who was politically obnoxious to them. The president of the bank, Nicholas Biddle, refused, denying any connection of his institution with politics. President Jackson was opposed to the bank, and his messages to Congress in 1829, 1830, and 1831 expressed strong dislike of the institution. In 1832 a Bill to re-charter passed both Houses, but was vetoed by the President, -and failed to pass over the veto. Even the politicians passed it, but the President vetoed it. If a Bill is vetoed in the United States, it must pass over the President by a two-thirds majority, or it is inefficacious. The elections of that year produced a House, a majority of which supported the President. -On the plea that the bank was not safe, the President now removed the Government deposits, And placed them with State banks, which were -called banks of deposit, and nicknamed "" Pet Banks."" House, which decided against a renewal of the -charter, and ordered an investigation of the bank. Of this nothing came. The bank was chartered by the State of Pennsylvania, and thereafter known as the Nicholas Biddle's United States Bank. Only one more attempt to establish such a bank was made. This was in 1844, while Tyler was President. Two Bills having that end in view passed Congress, but they were both vetoed. -Sitting suspended from 6.30 to 7-45 p.m. the state of the House. [Quorum formed.-\ to impress upon honourable members the desirability of creating a national financial -system that would enable the CommonAvealth, the States, the municipalities, the -shire councils, and various other public bodies, to finance themselves independently of floating loans in the open market in competitions like publicans and sinners. I have put a banking scheme before the House, but I desire to give some reasons for the faith that is in me. After all, the whole thing rests upon faith-the faith of the community. Nearly all our borrowings, and nearly all our business, rests upon confidence. It is all a matter of the faith that one person has in another. I want to show that many misconceptions exist owing to the improper use of the words "" deposits"" and ""loans."" When the newspapers announce that the deposits of the banks have increased during the last year by so many million pounds, the general public believe that that means an increase of real wealth in the community. I want to show honourable members that that is fictitious. What is meant by an increase of deposits in the banks is that the producers and the traders, and other business people in the community, have enlarged their indebtedness, and that that indebtedness has been transferred into bank fructified indebtedness, or bank fortified credits, so that it is this increase of indebtedness, and not an increase of real money, which is available as a fortified and transferable medium of exchange. If we consider thc deposits of all the banks in the aggregate, it is evident that, as the loans increase, the deposits increase, and it is clear to a.ll thinkers that the deposits increase only in proportion' to the increase of the loans. Let me illustrate that. I want honourable members to begin to study and investigate these financial problems. have the instinct for them. In this he was supported by the able member is right; and he is one that has that instinct. It always gives me great pleasure to talk upon this question! when the honourable member is here. This is the question of questions, because I think it was the* Prime Minister who said that finance is government, and government is finance, although men who lived hundreds of vears before the Prime Minister existed said the same. The fundamental essence of finance is some sort of exchangeable function. The function of banking rests first upon its power of maintaining legitimate credits. Let me examine this question for a few moments, because I claim that the Commonwealth of Australia cannot continue this slipshod, incompetent, bungling, unnatural, and unprogressive method of finance.

Yet, when I talk to the untrained in this question, they always tell me that the Empire rests on gold. Napoleon was not crushed by gold, but by paper money. I am not advocating paper money; but I do not forget that gold is our worse enemy; it never made a bargain it did not break, or a friend or an alliance it did not betray. I am always being asked how we are to get capital to operate a national postal banking system. Are my honourable friends aware that the whole of the paid-up capital of all the banks in Australia is only rowed £50,000 from it, the bank would £18,000,000, and that last year, on that capital, the banks made a net profit of £2,423,568 ? I take these figures from the Australasian Insurance and Banking Record of 21st January, 1909. That profit was over and above all expenses, and represents 13^ per cent. net. Who paid that interest ? The producers and traders of this country. I venture to say that if the producers and traders of Australasia could get money on overdraft at 4 per cent, or 5 per cent, on good security, production and exportation would be doubled, and that the immense balance, after paying interest to the English bond-holders, would make a vast difference in the health, prosperity, and hopes of the Australian people. For that reason I ask honourable members to bear with me while I endeavour to place before the House some of the reasons why the financial scheme of the Government must prove an utter failure, unless there be a banking system in connection with it. I do not' care whether the period be five years, ten years, or twenty years, or whether we adopt my scheme, the scheme of the honourable member for Mernda, or the scheme of the Treasurer, it is bound to be a failure unless there is a banking system behind it. It is the universal belief that the sequence of banking is, first, deposits, and then loans, and that the amount of the loans must always be restricted by the amount of the deposits. Let us investigate these apparently self-evident, but delusive, propositions. I wish to show how this affects the proposed adjustment of the financial relations of the Commonwealth and the States. Let us suppose that an honourable member to-morrow morning borrows from a bank £50,000. moment that he does so the bank's deposits increase by £50,000. Mr. King O'Malley. that transaction immediately increases the loans and the deposits of the bank by £50,000. Would that be an increase of actual wealth? It would require a great deal of evidence to convince me that it was; but it is to that point that I desire to direct special attention.' The position would really be this : the honourable member would have exchanged his securities, as legal evidence of his indebtedness to the bank, in return for a ledger credit, as legal evidence of the bank's indebtedness to him. It would be only an exchange of indebtedness. The bank would have exchanged its fortified credit for that of its customer. Although the honourable member had borhave no less money than it-had before, and he would have no more than he had when he passed through its' doors. Both would be as they were before. The bank would simply have lent him £50,600 of credit on the ledger of its establishment. . We have no public institution in Australia that can lend the people or the State credit, or can help the State in a time of trial. the banks the confidence of which the honourable member speaks. the honourable member. But to proceed with my illustration. The honourable member who had raised this sum could, by cheque, transfer the indebtedness that very day. His cheque would be deposited with some other institution, and his security for £50,000 would remain with the original bank as part of the deposits until the indebtedness was cancelled by redemption. The whole transaction would be operated upon credit, and when the amount had been paid off, the bank's deposits and assets would have decreased by £50,000. The bank itself, however, would not have sent any money out, and the customer would not have taken any out of it. matter of confidence. In trade and commerce confidence and credit are inseparable. They go hand in hand. In agitating for the establishment of a Commonwealth postal banking system, I have undertaken a proposal which, perhaps, will not be carried out in my time, although I have no doubt that such an inThe stitution will eventually be established.

Bankers in America would say, if they heard me, that I was giving away their secrets, and my uncle, had I made this speech whilst in his service, would have dismissed me on the spot. But how was it that he went into the banking business with a capital of $10,000, and when he died was worth $15,000,000? How do bankers make such huge fortunes? are foolish enough to let them make them. The Commonwealth and the States are blundering along like a horse blind in one eye and wearing winkers. The States are always going to do something, but they never do anything. They view these matters only from the blind side. All transactions between banks are purely the exchange of the fortified credits of. the banks for the fructified indebtedness of the people. The principal deposits are created by the principal loans, and by a system, of bookkeeping both deposits and loans are swelled in equal amounts at the same time. In the mainand this explains how my proposed national bank would secure its capitalthe whole of a bank's deposits are practically produced by the exchange of its credits for promissory notes, mortgages, and other securities-the legal instruments or liens upon property that are handed over to the bank. It is in this way that banking business is carried on. It is true that small streams of money regularly flow in and out of these institutions, but the inflow and the outflow are so nearly equal that the difference, in the language of the classics, "" cuts no economic ice."" A bank's -money is like a metal column with a slight ripple on the surface. The chief ripple on the surface of the Australian reserves is to be seen at clearing time. If we had in Australia a national postal bank system, the whole of the business of the 'Governments of the Commonwealth and the States, as well as that of the municipalities, could be transacted without the use of a shilling, save in paltry or -petty transactions, such as when a man gives his wife a little money to go out and buy a hat or a pair of boots. The daily balance at the great London Clearing House, involving millions ot pounds annually, is settled without the use of a shilling. Modern banking institutions with which I have been connected devote their attention now chiefly to the investigation of credits-jus t as the Commonwealth bank would do for the benefit of the people-and to the extension of the satisfactory credits on their books. To say that banking is purely money lending is to degrade its noble and exalted functions to the level of those'of a gutter-sparrow pawnshop. deal of truth in that, but that is what the banks .in Australia are doing. lift up the banks. I have no grievances. The world has dealt well with me, and if I am hereafter only as happy as I am now, I shall do very well. Having analyzed the chief aspects of the functions of banking, I desire now to investigate the causes of the great financial crises which took place in Australia in 1889, 1890, and 1893, with a view of showing the evils which then beset the Commonwealth owing to the non-existence of a national postal banking system. The development of credits has reference to production and their payment to consumption. There must always be an indefinite period between production and consumption. Consumption cannot be definitely accelerated, and the power to purchase once having been issued, cannot be withdrawn until the products of the producers have been demanded for consumption. Under such conditions there must always be a mighty Armada of credit floating in the sea of trade and commerce. As production and consumption are perpetual processes, as is also the banking function, the institutions which refuse to exchange their credits with the producers and traders during the interregnum between production and consumption inflict irreparable injury on the community, and neglect their sacred function. We have seen the wrecks of Australian financial crises tramping the roads with their swags on their backs. -by the inconvertibility of securities. have confidence in their banking institu tions, that does not matter. But at times of great financial crisis the people doubt their soundness and stability.

Ruin is the inevitable end, and the banks which first stop credit find themof indestructible mutual dependencies, supselves involved in the cataclysm which follows.

We have not a real banking system in Australia. A banking system means a whole plan or scheme, consisting 'of many parts, and united in such a manner that it produces an endless cable plied by a financial reservoir of inexhaustible power. Have our private banking corporations such a scheme or plan? Do they help each other when trouble comes? No. When difficulty arises, each scrambles to accumulate reserves, and to increase its own at the expense of the others. The same thing has Hundreds happened in Australia.

When that terrible crisis overtook the people of Australia in 1893, those classes of property which possess intrinsic value, such as the homes that furnish shelter, the farms that produce food and raw materials, the manufacturing plants and buildings in connection with trade and commerce, became practically of no value in the open market. Labour, the basis ,of all wealth, was in a state The other banks of semi-starvation.

But the people were That proves that a restrictive unable to purchase, and the great instruments of trade and commerce were rusty, and unable to revolve. This was all due to the absence of a good banking system; and yet we were told it was caused by overproduction.

If If we had a national postal banking system, which would enable us to maintain the legitimate credits of the Commonwealth, there never could be a return to the awful crises we went through a few years ago. banking law, in any case. deny that; but I am looking ahead to what will come. I regret that, in some instances, it seems impossible to get honourable members to investigate this' question; but I am glad there are a few who have risen high enough intellectually to look into it, in order to see what can be done. In Australia we have suffered from financial crisis after crisis. Thousands of people are poor to-day who a few years ago were well off; and it was not they who caused the loss, but the institutions to which they had intrusted their money. In 1825, a Parliamentary. Commission in England proved that, in the panic of 1793, over 100 English banks failed, and that in the seven years from 1810 to 1817, 600 banks failed. In the panic of 1825, up to the time of the inquiry, twenty-six banks failed, and paid but a small percentage of their indebtedness. In the great panic of 1837-8, in America, more than 1,000 banks closed their doors-practicall y all the banks in the country. In the panic of 1856, every bank in America put up its shutters, and few of them ever resumed; and, in 1893, most of the Australian banks got sleeping sickness, and suspended, pending reconstruction. In my opinion, a national postal bank, suitable to the people of the Commonwealth, should have its head office in the Post Office of the chief commercial city, with all the other post-offices as branches, thus constituting the head and the backbone of the system. This central bank should hoid the reserves of all other banks, and those reserves should constitute a credit on the ledger of the national bank; and under such an arrangement there never could be another crisis in the Commonwealth. The people of every village and town throughout the Commonwealth would enjoy, at a low rate of interest, the facilicapital. The firm of O'Malley and Glynn ties of a strong sound national banking system. Farmers, producers, traders, and small business people could go to the bank in their own towns and villages, and, if they had security, could have their credit entered on the ledger, stick a cheque-book in their pocket and go about their business one bank in Australia had an account opened with every business man in the Commonwealth, tlie whole of the business of the country could be carried on without exchanging one penny of cash, because the banks are only clearing houses, clearing the business of the producers and traders by offsetting the indebtedness. Banking is the fundamental essence of finance, and finance is a Government institution. Banks should be sympathetic co-workers with producers and traders. A banking system possessing the capacity to continue exercising the banking function during worldwide disturbances would make it impossible that we should ever have a crisis in Australia. A system with such potential powers, in connection with the talent for production, trade, and commerce possessed by the Australian people, and with the boundless wealth surrounding Melbourne and Sydney, would eventually make those cities, instead of London, the chief exchange centres of the world, and make Australia, instead of England, the creditor nation. A creditor nation is not a matter of superior wealth, currency, capital, or geographical surroundings. Nobody claims that little England has more capital or more wealth than has the United Statesj and it is all a matter of banking organization. Let me give an illustration that I have given several times before. Suppose that my friend, the Attorney-General, and myself had £50,000, and that we put up a sign advertising that the firm of O'Malley and Glynn were prepared to lend money. We could only lend until our actual capital ran out; that is, when we had lent our £50,000, we should have to stop unless we had received back some of the loans. Buti f we exercised the banking function, with our capital of £50,000 we might draw interest on millions; that is; we could lend a capital of millions, so long as people had confidence in us. I know one banking company in Australia that, with a paid-up capital of £2,500,000, has deposits amounting to £27,000,000 or £28,000,000, and is thus drawing interest on over ten times the could thus carry on business, if they exercised the banking function, because we would exchange the fortified credits of our bank for the fructified indebtedness of our customers.

132,Mr King O'malley,"I do notnations of the earth in the way of interest, power to the loftiest peaks of the highest not for capital or for tlie use of money, but for the use of her fortified credits, lt enough to plant its flag on the remotest is because of the unique position of the Bank of England as the leader of English finance that England is able to collect infinancial system, whereby it is able terest on millions of indebtedness from other nations. When a nation, a people, or an individual, is able to collect interest it is in a healthy state, and that is the position of England, lt is that which makes England the creditor nation, and London the exchange city of the world. How can a nation'' like Australia, which has no national banking system, and which, if it desires an overdraft, must, like any private individual, obtain it from a banking corporation, compete in the open markets of the world with the producers and traders of a nation like England, which can afford to lend as much as she owes? It is not more capital, or more wealth, that we require to make this country a great financial centre. we need is a thoroughly organized national banking system. banking in England is far less than that used in America. In 1895, the paid-up capital of all the joint-stock banks of EngAyres, Monte Video, Birmingham, Edinland, Scotland, and Wales, including the Bank of England, was only £70,000,000, while the' capital of the National Banks of America, excluding the State banks, and the great trust companies, was £130,000,000. of exchange produced by the banks of England was £775,000,000, the national banks of the United States could issue a purchasing power of only £530,000,000. Owing to the leadership of the Bank of England the banks of Great Britain, with approximately one-half the capital of the national banks of the United States, produced double the amount of the medium of exchange. This is an illustration of the difference between the organization of the joint-stock banks of England, and that of the banks of the United States of America. That organization is wholly in favour of the English banks. We have been told by our greatest statesmen and philosophers, in days gone by, that the nation which controls the shipping of the world will control the trade and commerce of the world; and, having secured the trade and commerce of the world, will command the wealth of the world, and, therefore, the w orld itself. A nation may own ships r that sail on every sea; it may have an army capable of carrying the symbol of its Mr King O'Malley. mountains; it may have a navy strong island of the oceans, and to keep it there; but if it has not established a national to control its foreign exchanges, and to preserve a fairly low and uniform rate of interest at all times, it will never secure the trade and commerce' of the world. It will never command the world itself, nor yet the wealth of the world, even though it flies its flag on every ship that sails on every sea. Trade and commerce does not follow the flag. That, after all, is a fallacy. It follows the fortified credits of the world, and the fortified credits of the world follow the lines of banking. Trade' and commerce follow ""boodle."" They follow the bills of exchange and the time drafts of the world. Let me ask the wise men of the House, who believe that the fastening of a certain What flag to the stern of many ships will change the mighty course of trade and commerce, The capital used in at what price bankers in Boston, New York, Savannah, Mobile, New Orleans, Galveston, Vera Cruz, Rio Janeiro, Buenos burgh, London, Hong Kong, Hamburg, Rotterdam, St. Petersburg, or Frankfort, would purchase bills of exchange or time drafts on Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane, Perth, Adelaide, Hobart, Launceston, But, whereas the medium Burnie, Zeehan, or Queenstown, against commodity consignments, if they believed that by the time those instruments reached those cities, for re-discount, the local rate of interest might be anywhere between 10 per cent, per annum and 3 per cent, per month? How would those foreign bankers re-imburse themselves the money they had laid out, by selling to merchants instruments on frightened Australian banks? Could they sell them to importers? The suggestion, is ridiculous. If honourable members had had a banking training, they would not object to the establishment of a national institution, in which foreigners would have confidence. What was the position of Australians who found themselves stranded in San Francisco with Australian letters of credit at a time when Australian banks had gone across the Jordan for a couple of months ? Their letters of credit were not worth a snap of a finger. What do my honourable friends opposite propose to do when the next great Australian financial crisis takes place? be? coming. It will come, not immediately, but a few years hence. Will they ask the present Prime Minister, if he is in power, to issue a proclamation to all nations that a great financial crisis has taken place in Australia, that most of the banks have suspended payment, pending re-construction; that those which have not suspended are so paralyzed by fear that they will be unable to do business for a. few years, but that he hopes that the business people of Europe will continue to send their commodities to Australian merchants, and that they will make their drafts, or bills of exchange, on the Bank of Japan, which is a Government institution? A country becomes the chief market-place of the world in trade and commerce, not because a certain flag is fastened to \he stern of many ships, but because every banker, broker, and seller of exchanges in all parts of the world knows at all times, within 1 or 2 per cent, per annum, the intrinsic value of a draft or bill of exchange for re-discount at its banks. It is not its flag or its ships that causes a country to become the chief market-place of the world; and I hope I shall drive that fallacy out of the minds of the people. The untrained, uneconomic man, who knows nothing of finance, is like a bob-bull in clover. He is always jumping from one thing to another when the bees are on him. A national postal banking system is absolutely essential to finance. It is the duty of the Commonwealth to help tb decrease the great debt of the States, to use the national power for the benefit of the individual, to help those who go into the back-blocksthe strugglers of this great country-to save a little interest. public and private debt of Australia amounts to £600,060,000. Christian people who love Australia were to reduce the interest rate by 1 per cent., they would save the people of Australia £6,000,000 worth of produce, which must now be raised and sent to the markets of the world to be sold there to meet that liability. Were they to reduce it by 2 per cent, they would never miss the difference. They would have just as many meals, wear as many diamonds, go to as many theatres,, buy on time-payment as many motor cars, and run them on borrowed spirit. would be as well off as they are now, and the Australian producers would save [M5] £12,000,000. But they will not do it. Yet they call themselves Christians, live in a Christian land, go to church, and say '' Amen '' in the right corner. I am sorry that our great Prime Minister has turned from Nationalism to parochialism. No words of mine will ever utter unkind thoughts of that great man, and I hope, with the prayers of the people, to bring him back to Nationalism. I remember when, like a mighty giant, he bore away on his broad shoulders the pillars of the temple reared with the errors and delusions of provincialism. Escaping himself, he left the provincialists overwhelmed amidst the ruins. I was proud of him then, and sent money from Kalgoorlie to Sydney to help Sir Edmund Barton during the first referendum. Afterwards the Prime Minister went to London, and when he returned, he handed back part of the sum which had been granted to him for expenses. great financier there. he was careful. I thought, "" This is-no t the Jefferson, because Jefferson was a State Rights man-bu t the George Washington of Australia."" able member think now? think less of him, but I am sorry. I hope that some day he will return to Nationalism. At that time he erected for himself what I regarded as an enduring monument, testifying to his belief in National financial supremacy. Inscribed on its marble were the' words, "" Commonwealth union, one and inseparable, now and for ever."" It is with pain and regret that I have seen that great man fall from the lofty peaks of the mighty Himalaya of Nationalism away To-day, the national down among the flats of State Rights. I look upon the measure which it is proposed If those to introduce as a Bill of abominations. I do not blame the Prime Minister, but he has made a mistake. Hamilton and Washington were opposed by Jefferson, Madison, Mason, and all the southerners, who fought for State Rights. The compact which we are asked to confirm was framed in secrecy, in the caverns of darkness, in wilful ignorance of economic facts and National constitutional rights. It will be the crowning infamy of its sponsors. I believe that if ever it is put into the ConThey stitution, it will sit, like the Old Man of the Sea in the Arabian Nights tale, on the necks of those responsible for it.",54,Private Banks Depositor S Guaranteed

138,Mr King O'malley,"I do notThe debate-particularl y some of the remarks of the last speaker-ha s shown the wisdom of the Conference in meeting in secret. Had its members tried to arrive at their conclusions while subjected to the advice and criticism of persons who thought they knew more about the matter than they did, no agreement would have been come to. The Premiers and the Commonwealth Ministers with whom they conferred were the elect of Australia. They met to make the best bargain possible in the interests of the whole people, and the result proves that they were the right men ih the right place. I always thought that if the right men came together with the intention, not of fighting each other, but of promoting an amicable settlement, we should get the best possible financial proposals. The opposition to the agreement is based mainly on the fact that it was made during secret sittings. Many of the newspapers have voiced that criticism, because they felt that, We often hear that the working man has by being prevented from reporting the proceedings, they were losing profitable reading matter. Some honourable members appear to be in mortal fear of what the newspapers say. Many of the newspapers wish to rule Australia. It must not be forgotten that, after all, a newspaper is merely a money-making concern. We have all of us read leading articles which must have been written by men ignorant of the real facts about which they were composed. On one occasion, when I pointed out to a gentleman who now holds a very high position on an Adelaide newspaper that his statement of facts was quite wrong, he said, "" I am glad that I did not know it at the time, because then I should not have written so good an article.""Within the last few weeks one of our largest newspapers told the people that the Braddon section would cease to have force at the end of J910. The writer did not know then that it will be terminable at the will of this Parliament. There is a great difference hetween an agreement terminating on a certain date and one terminable, on that date. I consider that the financial scheme which has been put before us is the best that can be proposed. Little or no new matter has been introduced ir* the speeches upon it. The Prime Minister, in opening the debate, instanced New Zealand statistics to substantiate his statement that our Customs and Excise revenue would not decrease, and may increase as population grows. In my opinion, the increase of the New Zealand Customs and Excise revenue is due to her industrial legislation. According to the Prime Minister, it was, in 1899, 56s. per head of population, and had risen in 1907-8 to 70s. per head. The honourable member for Flinders said that the New Zealand Customs and Excise returns have been abnormally inflated within the last few years, and suggested that that might be accounted for by the expenditure. of loan money. In my opinion, experimental industrial legislation and the raising of wages has increased the cost of production. Thousands of men have been thrown out of work by the stoppage of industries, and have left New Zealand within the last twelve months or two years. The artificial conditions created by Acts of Parliament have injured, instead of helping, industries, until at last the people realized that they could not afford to buy New Zealand products, and began to buy imported goods. There is another inference to be drawn. to pay the bulk of the Customs and Excise revenue; but if there are thousands out cf work, surely the working man is not paying it all !. Thousands of people in New Zealand could not book their passages fast enough to get away, and yet at the same time the Customs revenue was increasing. Surely men who were leaving the State through want of employment, and, therefore, necessarily from the want of money, could not be paying that increased Customs and Excise revenue. I have here an article upon New Zealand Labour legislation, from which I should like to read extracts. It saysMore than ten years have passed since New Zealand gave the world a lead along the path of that particular form of class legislation which is nowadays styled labour and socialistic legislation It is argued, however, that such class legislation confers great benefits upon the working classes, and that it is thereby justified, no matter how expensive it may be to the community, seeing that the working classes largely outnumber all other sections of the community honourable member in order in reading that document, seeing that it has no bearing on the subject now under discussion ? honourable member is reading an extract from some publication, in order to show that the Customs revenue of New Zealand has risen from a certain cause.

141,Mr Speaker,"I understand that thethat in fact it must be in the long run beneficial to all, inasmuch as it makes for the greatest good to the' greatest number. Such an argument is specious, but, unfortunately for those who use it, it is demonstrably untrue. New Zealand, as the first countiy to apply these legislative nostrums to the supposed maladies of industrialism, has naturally been the first to realize that they have not profited, and cannot profit, the very classes whose welfare they were designed to promote. late Mr Seddon, after making the damaging admission "" that the industries of the colony had now more than they could carry, and that New Zealand's trade was languishing and going back,"" was also constrained .to confess that, in spite of all the labour legislation satisfy honourable members that comparisons passed in New Zealand, "" the workers were no better off."" About the same time the Secretary of the Department of Labour in New Zealand showed in an official report that the workers were actually worse off than they had been ten years before. orable member connect this with the matter before the Chair? been used in this debate that we shall progress in the same ratio as New Zealand has done. I want to prove that New Zealand has not progressed at all, and that its progress, or want of progress, is altogether foreignto the financial question with which v/e in Australia have to deal. I have only a little more to readArbitration Court awards, he said, had considerably increased the wages paid to workmen, but at the same time the cost of all necessaries of life had increased in a still larger proportion. Again, only in June last, Mr Campbell, of the Trades and Labour Council of Canterbury, told the Sydney Labour Council that the experiment of raising wages by legislation in New Zealand had been a failure. Better wages, and in some cases shorter hours, had been obtained, but the extra cost of living and increased thing, as the honourable member for Gippsrentals left the workers where they were before. In Australia, too, the cry is now constantly heard that workmen reap no benefit from their artificially increased wages, and tliis is regularly brought forward in Arbitration Courts as an argument for yet further increases. That comes from the secretary of the biggest Labour organization in New Zealand, and yet, while I have been reading it, its accuracy has been quertioned from the Opposition benches. I claim that the Customs revenue of New Zealand has been inflated through an excess of industrial legislation. The amount received per capita in _ Customs and Excise -revenue in the United States has been mentioned; but I fail to see that that constitutes any argument. It has never been mentioned in this House that a big percentage of the 80,000,000 inhabitants of the United States are coloured people. The per capita basis has been taken over the lot; but surely it would never be argued, even by the Opposition, that a coloured person pays as much to the revenue as a white person? anything I have heard the Opposition state before. I have never heard them say that Three years ago the a coloured man would be as good a citizen or pay as much in taxation as a white person. I understand that the coloured population of the United States is from ten to fourteen millions. That should between our Customs and Excise revenue and those of other countries have really nothing to do with the financial proposition now before us. I think we must build up something purely on our own account to suit our own circumstances. We have a wealthy country, which is well worth looking after. The honourable member for Gippsland, when speaking on the Addressin-Reply, on 20th February, 1907, said, as reported in Hansard, vol. xxxvi., p. 30There will be . . . . questions of magnitude . . . and the necessary funds will have to be obtained either by the floating of loans or by increasing taxation. He then recognised that the money required for schemes of magnitude, such as he now mentions, would, I presume, be raised by loan; but, when speaking yesterday, he suggested that money would be required by the Commonwealth for such schemes as providing water for Tanami, and for goldfields in central Australia. That is a wildcat theory to put forward here as part of a financial scheme. I cannot imagine a map who poses as such an authority on everyland does, expecting any Commonwealth Government to make provision in their financial schemes for water for unknown or prospective gold-fields in central Australia. in Western Australia. Australian scheme was carried out, the gold-fields were assured. known when it was begun. member for Gippsland was not in earnest when he made that suggestion in regard to fields in central Australia, to which it is hard to take even a camel, to see if there is really any gold there. .We are not certain that the gold that was brought in came from any particular place.

When I first went to Western1 plateau of some of the finest land,.teeming at any rate, there is the business knowledge and ability of Australia, and some honourable members to whom the business must appear as of an ordinary character. SinceI arrived in Australia, Broken Hill, Mount Lyell, Mount Morgan, and Kalgoorlie have all been discovered, with the result that millions have been addedto the wealth of the country and, therefore, of the community. Where is there an6ther country in which such propositions have been found? The working men of Australia have had the same chance of discovering gold-fields as have the capitalists; and, indeed, many of the prospectors and discoverers were working men. the country. -a fear lest we should be unable to settle a little nnancial proposal. As yet, we have only touched the fringe of the fertile country, and there is room for fifty Kalgoorlies and Mount Morgans in parts which have not yet been explored. I am not conceited enough to think that we have as' yet found the best, which may be a work for future centuries. Kalgoorlie was part of the desert when the Treasurer first explored the country, but it has produced £42,000,000 .worth of gold, while Western Australia, as a whole, has produced £82,000,000 worth. At an agricultural dinner at Guildford, in 1894, I heard the Treasurer say that he expected Western Australia that year to produce £500,000 worth of gold, and a lot of old residents shook their heads in doubt; but the honourable gentleman proved more than right. Most of the first gold found at Kalgoorlie was in alluvial form, and has gone to enrich the working men of the country; and from that field alone over £18,000,000 have been paid in dividends, while the whole of the mining in the State has paid £20,000,000 in the short term of about fourteen years. , Why should we be afraid, or cry stinking fish? Have we not the pluck to face a little finanthe people who are talking who are creating cial problem? As I said before, we, as yet, know little or nothing of the country; the proposed railway to Western Australia is practically a coastal line. We have, also, a fine territory in the north, and, as time goes on, the people of Australia may become acclimatised and settle in that part of the Commonwealth. It is certainly going to be populated by white people, and will become a great and glorious country. Many of those honourable members who are criticising this scheme-and who are really depreciating Australia by doing so have never travelled beyond the coastal fringe of the Continent. They have never been far away from a running stream of water. They stick to the home comforts. Yet we often hear them complaining. The men who have the pluck to go out back are not the growlers. The scheme submitted by the Government is approved of by those who are, I claim, the backbone of Australia. I have never heard a complaint about it from one individual in this country who is doing anything to build up our prosperity. himself keeps pretty close to the coastal districts. terests are in the back blocks, and I have lived there as much as I could. To substantiate what I have been saying with regard to the prosperity of Australia, let me quote a few figures. The Commonwealth Year-Book for 1908, at page 599, shows that the total trade of Australia, in 1892, was £92,130,183; in 1907, it had reached £124,633,280. Surely figures like those should cause honourable members not to be afraid to face a payment of 25s. per capita from Customs and Excise. What right have we to assume that that rate of increase will not continue? The assumption is too ridiculous. Australia must go ahead. The lastfiguresthat I have quoted will be doubled in a few years, and I hope to live to see the day when that will be the case. The excess of our exports over imports, in 1907, as shown by the Year-Book, page 619, amounted to £18,007,467. Those figures leave out of consideration goods not produced in Australia. Our total exports were £72,824,247. Our total trade increased in five years by £30,000,000. What is the use of listening to people who are afraid for the future of Australia when our prosperity is advancing at that rate. It is not this prosperity, but those who are at work; and they are the people whom we want to help by returning 25s. per capita to the States. If these people are successful in their enterprises, the Commonwealth need have no fear of receiving plenty of revenue. I am pleased to see the honourable member for Robertson in his place, because I wish to pay a little attention to him. He made a wild attack on Western Australia.

154,Mr Hedges,"The whole of my in4006 Australia is entitled to special treatment, because our contribution to the Commonwealth taxation through Customs and Excise proves clearly ""that we are entitled to it. At page 804 of the Year-Book, it is shown that, in 1907-8, the Customs and Excise collected in New South Wales amounted to £2 17s. 7d. per capita. Deducting 25s. per capita, we find that New South Wales, under this scheme, would have contributed to the Commonwealth revenue £1 12s. 7d. per capita. The Customs and Excise revenue in Victoria amounted to £2 ns. 6d. per capita; deduct £1 ss., and the per capita returned to the Commonwealth would have been £1 6s. 6d. per capita, ln Queensland, £2 15s. 4d. per capita was collected; deduct 25s., and the Commonwealth would have received £1 ios. 4d. per capita. In South Australia, £,2 ns. 6d. per capita was collected; deduct 25s., and the Commonwealth would have received £1 6s. 6d. per capita. In Tasmania, £2 4s. 6d. per capita was collected; deduct 25s., and the Commonwealth would 19s. 6d. per capita. In Western Australia, however, the amount collected was £3 16s. 5d. per capita; deduct 25s., and the Commonwealth would have received £2 ns. 5d. per capita. Those figures show that the average contribution of the four large States, New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland,. and Tasmania, to Customs and Excise would have been £1 9s. per capita, whereas Western Australia would have contributed £2 .ns. sd. That is to say, Western Australia would have contributed £1 2s. sd. more to the Commonwealth revenue than the average of the four principal States. The population of Western Australia is given in the Year-Book for 1907 as 261,563. tiply population of Western Australia, and the amount is equal to Western Australia is paying through Customs and Excise more per annum than the four wealthiest States of the Commonwealth, and! that is why I think that the special allowance of £250,000 per annum is little enough. I desire now to show the honourable member for Robertson that Western Australia is of some value to the Eastern States. During the last fifteen years she has sent to the East through the money order office alone over £1,000 for every working day. It is a reasonable presumption tfi3t that money has been transmitted, not by the wealthy classes, since they Mr Hedges. Constitution Alteration [REPRESENTATIVES.] (Finance) Bill. would use the banks and other financial agencies, but by the humbler sections of the community. I ' desire now to deal withanother phase of this subject as it affects New South Wales and Western Australia. At page 161 of the Commonwealth Year Book, it is shown that the population of New South Wales in 1907 was 1,568,942, and I desire to prove to the honourable member for Robertson, who has expressed regret that it should be proposed under this agreement to make to Western Australia a special payment, that New South Wales has gained more from iFederationthan has any other State. In the first clear year, after the establishment pf Federation, namely, in 1901-2, the New Soutb Wales State revenue was £11,007,356, and in 1902-3 it amounted to £11,296,069, an increase of £288,713. In 1903-4 the State revenue as compared with that of the year 1901-2 had increased by, £240,972 ; in 1904-5 it had increased by £329,562; in 1905-6 it had increased by the enormous sum of £1,275,726; in have received 1906-7 the increase over that of 1901-2 was £2,385,079, and in 1907-8 it was no less than £2,953,407. In other words the total increase in the revenue of the State between 1901-2 and 1907-8 was £7,473,459. If we add to that amount the increased revenue which New South Wales received during the same period from the Commonwealth, amounting to £3,365,674, we have a total increase of £10,839,133. The honourable member for Robertson, in a good humoured way, sought to show that Western Australia should not receive the special treatment proposed, and I think therefore that thesefiguresshould be of special interest to him. Western Australia was the only State which entered the MulFederation with a surplus. New South £1 2s. sd. by the total Wales joined with a big deficit, but that deficit has been wiped out, and she has £283,162. enjoyed an increased revenue since 1901-2 of £10,839,133. On the other hand) Western Australia's surplus of £198,023 at the inception of the Federation has been turned into a deficit, which, in June last, amounted to £312,643. While New South Wales has been enjoying a splendid increase of revenue, Western Australia has accumulated this deficit, notwithstanding that she had the benefit of a special Tariff which, during the five years' period, yielded £868,963. The population of Western Australia is about one-sixth that of New South Wales, and if her revenue had increased in the same proportion as did that of New South Wales, she should have gained over £1,500,000. The representatives of New South Wales should be the last to object to this scheme, which is intended, to benefit Australia as a whole. We must look for the development of the Commonwealth to those States which have not yet been fully opened up, and it is only fair that they should receive a little more than is given to the States that are thickly; populated. per capita return of 25s. per annum, must be of more value to Victoria and New South Wales than to Western Australia or -Queensland, since it would go further in the execution of works in Melbourne and Sydney than_ in the back blocks. The cost ""Of opening up a country is greater than is that of carrying out works in thickly populated States. The honourable member for Robertson recently expressed views which were quite contrary to those to which he gave utterance in this Chamber last night. Speaking on the 18th September, 1908-honorabl e members will find the speech reported in Hansard, vol. XLVII., page. 180-h e saidThe railways and land should be taken over and controlled by the Commonwealth. ' ber for Hume interjected, "" I do not think so,"" but the honourable member for Robertson continuedUnless we obtain control of them we must return to the States at least £9,000,000 per not afford to do so. But the objection of annum. Why has the honourable member changed present scheme is that it would give the his view? so. member must still think that we should return to the States"" at least .£9,000,000 are prepared to see tbe States fairly per annum."" Yet last night he objected treated are not ready to make the agreeto the proposal to return a little overment perpetual. The honourable member . £5,500,000, on the ground that it was too for Gippsland might be willing to pay to much. We should be able to claim his the States more than 25s. per capita, but vote in support of the scheme. The honornot under an arrangement which must able member for Gippsland also expressed endure for ever. . last night opinions contrary to those which he had formerly expressed. In 1907 the he wished the Braddon section to be conhonorable member for Flinders spoke on tinued indefinitely. the finances of Australia, and was followed by the honourable member for Gippsqualification in that regard. If the States land. I remember that the. latter then received from the Commonwealth threes stated that, in his view, the States should fourths of the Customs and Excise revenue receive, not only three-fourths of the Cusraised in 1907, plus £500,000, they would toms and Excise revenue, but £500,000 get £91356,905; whereas under the proin addition. I could not sleep until I had posed scheme, to which their Premiers have found the passage. The speech was deagreed, they would get only £5,600,000, livered on the 1 ith September, 1907, and a difference of £3,746,000. That repreis to be found in Hansard, vol. xxxviii., sents a saving which ought to convert even page 3120. He mentioned that the honourable member for Flinders had referred to the Braddon blot. The honourable member for Riverina interjected, "" The State Treasurers do not call it the Braddon blot now."" The honourable member for Gippsland then saidIt is to be regretted that Sir Edward Braddon is not alive to-day to receive the praises of the A people who, in the first instance, so loudly condemned his proposal. In regard to the formulation of a scheme in substitution for the Braddon section of the Constitution, I admit that I favour the suggestion of the honourable member for Flinders. He holds that we ought to guarantee the annual return to the States of a fixed sum such as he conceives was in the minds of the framers of the Constitution-a n amount equal to the interest payable upon the debts which were in existence at the time Federation was accomplished. Such amount represents about £500,000 in excess of their three-fourths of the present Customs revenue. I do not know how the honourable member proposes that the Commonwealth shall raise enough revenue to make such payments.. He went on to sayIn my judgment there is a great deal of merit in that proposal. It would permit of all the State Treasurers knowing exactly what they were to receive from the Commonwealth, and I think so still. it would render our finances independent of the finances of the States. l offer the States anything like so much. the honourable member for Gippsland to the States too much.

163,Mr Hedges,"Yes. He made nothe honourable mfember for Gippsland. According to the Year-Book, page .710, at the present rate of increase in our population, it will be 1950 before we shall, have to return to the States, under the proposed agreement, the amount which the honourable member was prepared to return to them last year. Our population by 1950 will be something less than 8,000,000. Even if our revenue from Customs and Excise declines considerably, as some of the critics of this scheme predict, that fact will not affect the value of the money that is in Australia. Further, if the money be not collected in the form of Customs and Excise, it must be in the pockets of the people. We should never collect more revenue than we require, because, if we do, we shall impoverish our people. In spite of the criticism which has been levelled against the proposed agreement, I consider that the best has been done in the interests of all. Under that agreement, the people will simply pay over a certain sum annually to themselves. If I were to pay money from one pocket into another, my financial position would not /be affected. It is verydifficult to get some persons to understand the true position. In this connection, I cannot do better than instance what happened to me when I paid a visit to Bendigo some four years ago. Having been accustomed to the labour-saving methods adopted in the Kalgoorlie mines, I was surprised to find that the fuel supplied, to the mines there was carted in. waggons which would 'not shoot up. As a result, a big able-bodied man had to be employed in putting the wood into stacks 10 feet high, and apparently his object was to see how little he could put into a stack When I observed this, I inquired of the manager: "" Why do you not weigh the wood, and shoot it up?"" He laughed; and replied: ""The carting of the wood makes no difference to us. The man who supplies it is paying for that."" I then asked: ""Who is paying him?"" The reply which I received was: "" You have me there. . I believe that we are paying him."" Similarly a lot of unnecessary fuss is being made in reference to the proposed agreement, but I think that, despite that fuss, the best has been done in the interests of the people of Australia. I trust that the motion will be agreed to, and that thc Bill will be introduced and passed. journed. House adjourned at 10.40 p.m. Mr Hedges.",62,Private Banks Depositor S Guaranteed
