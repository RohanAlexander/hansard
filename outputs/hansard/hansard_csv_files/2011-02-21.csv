As in mobile phone usage, and fewer conflicts, other areas of the aid portfolio, AusAID are working hard to ensure that the effectiveness of our aid to Africa is maximised. Under Bob McMullan, my predecessor as the member for Fraser, AusAID created the Office of Development Effectiveness to provide what it describes as a ‘health check of the Australian aid program’. ODE has not pulled its punches, with past reports suggesting that Australia might have been overinvesting in technical assistance. Discussing evaluation, ODE has in the past emphasised the importance of carrying out more impact evaluations, asking not only whether the program was properly administered but also whether it helped improve the lives of the poor. My personal view is that the Australian aid program should carry out more randomised trials-a rigorous evaluation tool that is becoming increasingly common in the developing world. Much as I admire the audacity of big push strategies such as the Millennium Villages project, I think we can learn more when programs can be rigorously evaluated. More recently, the Minister for Foreign Affairs has established an independent panel to undertake a review on the future direction of Australia’s aid program. The expert panel-Sandy Hollway, Stephen Howes, Margaret Reid, Bill Farmer and John Denton-are carefully scrutinising how we can improve the effectiveness of our aid program. This kind of analysis is critical if we are to maintain public support for the Australian aid program. I look forward to their report. pm, the debate is interrupted.

264,The Speaker,"Order! It being 10.30Monday, 21 February 2011 ----McMillan Electorate: Dairy Farmers very diverse customer base through exports and their local base. Having regard to what I said about the plight of dairy farmers last week, it is very important that we recognise that the farmers in Western Australia and perhaps some in South Australia, Victoria, Queensland and New South Wales are under direct threat from the price of milk being at $1. They are under direct threat because they do not have another market to sell into. They sell into the current milk market for consumption within Australia. Only a few years ago, the major supermarkets said to Murray Goulburn, ‘Your Devondale cheese only has 17 per cent of the market; you’re out of here.’ Murray Goulburn said: ‘Fine. We are big enough and diverse enough. We will take our product out of your supermarket and we will sell to the independents and we will export it.’ And that is exactly what they did. The problem is this: if you are a farmer who is not connected to a major exporter that has a diverse range of opportunities for supplying the world, you are probably already finished if we have regard to what the two major supermarkets have decided to do. I heard the Coles spokesman. I heard what he said about supplying the consumer with the best price, being competitive in the market and all of those sorts of things. But sometimes what we think is about to happen has actually already happened. What has already happened is that Coles have decided that milk in the litre line is going to be $1 in perpetuity. Therefore, they are condemning those farmers that now supply that milk market to oblivion. That has probably already happened. You are probably already gone if you are supplying that market and you are unable to diversify what you are selling. I think this is a tragedy. I think the family farm is very important. I think that supplying fresh milk to our families and our children is very important in those states. What will they be doing in future? They will probably be buying it from Murray Goulburn in great truckloads and carting it interstate as the base milk product. The only answer is us as a collegiate of parliamentarians addressing the major problem. And that is that we have two major supermarkets supplying the market. That is a much bigger issue than that of the plight of dairy farmers, who are caught in between. (Time expired) Greenway Electorate: Kellyville Ridge Ms ROWLAND (Greenway) (10.33 am)-I wish to raise some important issues currently being experienced by residents in the suburb of Kellyville Ridge in my electorate of Greenway. Kellyville Ridge forms part of the important growth area in the northern region of Greenway, a landscape which I grew up knowing as little more than farmland and bush, adjacent to other new and near-new suburbs of The Ponds and Stanhope Gardens. It now comprises nearly 2,000 households and over 4,000 residents and continues to expand, bringing with it an increasing emphasis on access to essential services.

266,Mr Broadbent (Mcmillan) (10.30 Am),"Murray Goulburn in my electorate have aHowever, as I listen to local residents, they consistently highlight their frustration at the inability to secure two basic yet vitally important services-a local high school for their children and high-speed broadband services. The latter I have raised many times in this place as a real-life case study for the benefit of the National Broadband Network. Only a few weeks ago I held a mobile office in Kellyville Ridge on a Friday afternoon and, despite temperatures of over 35 degrees, scores of local residents turned up to discuss these important issues with me. I share the concerns of Kellyville Ridge residents about the lack of a local high school. For many parents who settled in the suburbs 10 years ago, their children have now reached or are approaching high school age. The local primary schools-John Palmer Public School and Kellyville Ridge Public School-feed into Glenwood High School. This would not be a concern-it is an excellent high school-except for the fact that it has at least five other feeder primary schools. Last year over 1,300 students were enrolled at Glenwood High, and this number will only continue to grow as more children reach high school age and these suburbs expand. I also appreciate the grievances of local parents in Kellyville Ridge on another level. They recall that when the land was first released, and for many years thereafter, a parcel of land was set aside for a high school and was signposted as the future site of a Kellyville Ridge high school. The reality is that many residents moved into Kellyville Ridge and its surrounding suburbs expecting that a high school would be built locally. I have been contacted by a huge number of discouraged parents who have tried to enrol their children in several other high schools. However, they tell me they have not been successful because they live outside the catchment areas of these schools. That is why I will assist local residents to make the case for the New South Wales government to build a new high school in Kellyville Ridge. I believe it is a very strong case, as demonstrated by the degree of community support. It is not an issue that I am prepared to brush aside as purely a state government matter and therefore not my problem. That is because it goes to the heart of what residents in west and north-west Sydney expect and deserve-quality service delivery from their local representatives who put the needs of their constituents first. That is what I am committed to doing on this issue for the people of Kellyville Ridge. Forde Electorate: Australia Day Awards the Forde electorate receive recognition for their contribution to the community. I am very pleased to share with you the community spirit that was demonstrated on that day and the great contributors that keep our electorate on track. Australia Day awards honour the outstanding achievements of recipients and nominees, celebrating Australian excellence in our community. The Forde community was fortunate to celebrate the achievement and contribution of unique Australians who were recognised with a special award. I would like to take some time to name some of these exceptional community members and to sincerely congratulate them. A Neighbour of the Year Award and Centenary Medal were given to June Hintz, a wonderful artist who lives in the Forde electorate and co-runs Mothers Against Drugs, a much needed group that assists young carers in the community.

She supports many charities in the area and is always around to lend a hand when needed. Wendy’s community spirit and positive attitude truly embodies what it is to live in Logan and the Forde community. Also, Mr James Hall was nominated for a community service award for his services: volunteering for Meals on Wheels, mentoring students in Upper Coomera State College and various other community roles as a volunteer. The Forde community was also fortunate to have over 70 residents receive It’s An Honour awards including the Medal of the Order of Australia, Centenary Medal, Officer of the Order of Australia, Commendation for Brave Conduct, National Medal, Public Service Medal and the Australian Fire Service Medal.

I warmly congratulate them all and wish them all the best for their future endeavours. Corio Electorate: Surf Coast Knockout would like to talk this morning about golf, which is an auspicious thing to do this morning as a good Victorian boy, Aaron Baddeley, I hope as we speak, is closing out the Northern Trust Open and will be the first Australian to win on the US tour this year-touch wood. But the particular aspect of golf I would like to talk about is an international golfing event, the Surf Coast Knockout, which was held in my region earlier this year. This was an event which was remarkable for a number of reasons. Firstly, it was a revolutionary style of golf tournament devised by the PGA of Australia. The knockout format over six holes is a world first. It is, if you like, Twenty20 golf. That it was held on the Surf Coast made it all the more remarkable. This was a major coup for the Greater Geelong region. Many parts of Australia would have dearly loved to host this event. It is recognition of the great golf courses in our region as well as our capacity to host major events. The final day of play was broadcast live on Channel 10. Five hours of Sunday afternoon prime time free-to-air television provided a fantastic opportunity to showcase the best of our region. It was also more than double the national media coverage received by similar PGA events with around the same prize purse. The PGA is committed to its knockout format and was thrilled with the success of the Surf Coast tournament. More than 4,000 people attended the event, many non-traditional golf fans, which suggests that this type of event could entice a whole new audience to the sport. The PGA has since been contacted by both the European and US PGA tours. They like the concept and see opportunities to replicate the format internationally. Despite the success of this trailblazing tournament, I believe that for a number of people in Geelong the Surf Coast Knockout seemed to fly under the radar. This needs to change. We need to the see the City of Greater Geelong, Geelong Major Events and the Geelong business community really embrace this tournament. This event has the potential to showcase Geelong each and every year on a Sunday afternoon, free-to-air, prime time spot at the height of summer. The importance of that opportunity should not be underestimated. We all saw how well MAIN COMMITTEE",221,Constituency Statements
268,Mr Marles (Corio,"Parliamentary Secretary for Pacific Island Affairs) (10.38 am)-Iour city looked during last year’s telecast of the UCI Road Cycling World Championships, and that was a one-off event for Geelong. The Surf Coast Knockout is an annual event and could be annual event not just for the Surf Coast but for the entire Greater Geelong region. I congratulate Cotton On for their support of this year’s event. To have a successful Geelong business get on board was fantastic to see. It was also wonderful to see the Geelong Advertiser and K-Rock get behind this great event in the way that they did. I would like to thank the PGA for having faith in the Surf Coast Knockout and in particular Andrew LangfordJones, who was the inspiration for it. Now is the time for Geelong to embrace this. It is a fantastic opportunity for our city and for us to see our economy grow. Independent Youth Allowance youth allowance and to highlight a report called the Deferring a University Offer in Regional Victoria report of 2010. I also want to comment on Prime Minister Gillard’s humiliating back down on independent youth allowance today. The Deferring a University Offer in Regional Victoria report of 2010 shows that 30 per cent of those who defer do not take up their offer or remain in their course. More than 81 per cent of those who defer are in the two lowest quartiles of socioeconomic status. Only 7.8 per cent of city students deferred in 2010, compared with 15.2 per cent of regional students. As Toni Jenkins from the South West Local Learning and Employment Network highlights, other data indicates that the academic profile of students in our region is just as high as in metro areas. So it is clear that other factors, such as financial hardship are impacting on their outcomes. What this shows is that regional and rural students are at a disadvantage to their city cousins when it comes to accessing tertiary education. That is why the coalition took a policy to the last election to bring back the independent youth allowance as it was and not have zonal discrimination against inner regional students. Today it would seem that the Gillard government has finally got the message and will bring in the changes to the policy that saved the government $300 million for their budget bottom line but that, sadly, did so at the expense of regional and rural students. That it has taken this long for the government to make this humiliating back down is an absolute disgrace. Regional and rural students have suffered through missing out on accessing a tertiary education while Julia Gillard has over a period of 12 months failed to see the error of errors before reluctantly doing so today. As this report shows, as many as 15 per cent of those who wanted to access a tertiary education deferred doing their course because the government messed up the independent youth allowance. This back down today is a humiliating one for the Labor government. But it is a back down that was needed and that will benefit regional and rural students. would just gently remind the honourable member for Wannon that he ought to refer to the Prime Minister by her title and not by her actual name.

271,Mr Dreyfus (Isaacs,"Cabinet Secretary and Parliamentary Secretary for Climatechallenged the resolve of many communities throughout Australia with natural disasters of floods, cyclones and bushfires leaving a trail of devastation and a reconstruction bill which is likely to run into many billions. In Victoria, flooding has substantially impacted many communities in regional areas over the past few months, which was amplified at the beginning of February by a weather system attributed to the tail of Cyclone Yasi soaking the state. Our communities in south-east Melbourne did not escape, with suburban streets turned into rivers, properties and cars inundated in a matter of minutes, and roads and businesses closed for days after the initial deluge. While the damage was not on the devastating scale that was suffered in Queensland or northern Victoria, this was a very unusual event for south-east Melbourne. The suburbs in my electorate that experienced the worse effects of the flooding were Bangholme, Mentone and Mordialloc. As the clean-up effort continues, parts of Bangholme in particular are still underwater. A number of properties and local businesses remain underwater. Property owners are expecting a significant clean-up bill once the water is finally removed. On Friday, 11 FebruaryI visited properties and local businesses in Bangholme to see first hand the effects of the flooding and the problems Melbourne Water and the City of Greater Dandenong are currently working to rectify. I spoke with local residents, many of whom have lived in the area for decades, about the impact of the ferocious rainfall of 4 February on their homes and properties. Melbourne Water representatives advised that 175 to 200 millimetres of rain fell in a four-hour period and indicated that this rainfall event was in excess of a one in 500 year event. The days preceding my initial visit to Bangholme saw a coordinated effort by the City of Greater Dandenong and state government authorities to pump the enormous volume of water away from these properties and businesses. I would like to thank the workers from the City of Greater Dandenong and Melbourne Water for their continued efforts, and I commend the residents for their patience in this difficult situation. I am looking forward to the authorities continuing to work together to achieve a permanent solution to the drainage issues in this area to ensure that the problem does not occur again. It is a difficult coordination task. The Mordialloc Creek system is in two municipalities-those of Kingston and Greater Dandenong-and Melbourne Water and VicRoads both have responsibilities in the area. It will require the cooperation of all these authorities to resolve the drainage problems, but I am confident that this will occur. Road Safety continues. Ten years ago a school bus accident took the life of a 15-year-old local boy and a group of parents formed the Belt Up for Safety Action Group. Glenda Staniford was a major force in persuading the former Howard government to allocate $40 million to allow bus companies to fit seatbelts on school buses. But that is not the problem. The problem lies with getting the New South Wales state government to change the existing law and make it mandatory to fit seatbelts in school buses, especially on country rural roads. Coaches have compulsory seat belts. Cars have compulsory seat belts. Why are school children treated differently and their lives worth less? I would like to read an editorial from one of our journalists at the local paper, the Milton Ulladulla Times. It is by Katrina Condie and it says it all: MAIN COMMITTEE",223,Constituency Statements
272,Mrs Gash (Gilmore) (10.48 Am),"Ten years on and the fight to have seatbelts on busesdriveway and into the traffic. Next week, I’ll be placing my tiny five-year-old daughter on a bus with no seatbelts, that travels along a winding road, reaching speeds of up to 80 and 100 kilometres per hour. It makes me feel physically sick in the stomach to think about what could happen to her-and the other children-if that bus rolls or crashes head-on into another vehicle at high speed. Little people, school bags, books, lunchboxes thrown upside down, through windows and on top of each other. It would be horrific. It would be devastating. It would shatter our community. And, it would be totally unnecessary. This sort of catastrophe is preventable simply by the introduction of a law that states rural school buses must have seat belts. Other states have done it. Why can’t NSW? Our kids are brought up knowing the importance of belting up in the car. Suddenly they are put on a bus and are taught it’s OK to break that rule. Parents lose control. Governments are in control. Governments have a duty of care to look after our kids. They aren’t doing that. A team of dedicated and determined mothers, many of whom have children who have finished school and are now adults themselves, have spent 10 years fighting. Now it’s time for a new generation to join the fight. With my eldest daughter starting kinder this year, there’s a lot of challenges to deal with. But most important is her safety when she is out of my care. The Times has supported the BUS Action campaign for a decade and we will continue to do so. But now, it’s personal! As I put my little girl on the bus next week, and every day after that, I’ll be waving her off with a tear in my eye and hoping and praying that she makes it home safely. Come on, state candidates stand up, take action and keep our kids safe. It is your responsibility. And it is your opportunity to show every parent and child in this state that you do care. Ballarat Regional Integrated Cancer Centre Ms KING (Ballarat-Parliamentary Secretary for Health and Ageing and Parliamentary Secretary for Infrastructure and Transport) (10.50 am)-Last Monday, 14 February, I, alongside the new Victorian Minister for Health, turned the first sod of the Ballarat Regional Integrated Cancer Centre. Once this facility is completed, people across the Ballarat electorate and western Victoria will have access to a world-class cancer treatment centre. I was delighted to be at an event that will have significant, tangible benefits not only for my electorate but for the people of western Victoria. Cancer is Australia’s leading burden of disease. In 2007, there were more than 100,000 new cases of cancer diagnosed and almost 40,000 deaths from cancer. Particularly concerning is that, for the 30 per cent of Australians living in rural and remote areas, the outcomes are worse than for people living in cities. With some cancers, patients from rural and remote areas are up to three times more likely to die within five years of diagnosis than their urban counterparts. That is why the Labor government is investing $1.3 billion over six years in health MAIN COMMITTEE and hospitals funding for national cancer infrastructure projects. Of that amount, we have committed $560 million to build a national network of best-practice regional cancer centres and associated accommodation facilities to help close the gap in outcomes for cancer patients in rural and regional Australia. The regional cancer centres initiative will build a world-class cancer care system in Australia that will assist people living in rural, regional and remote areas to have better access to essential cancer services, deal more effectively with cancer treatment challenges and live longer, better-quality lives. In Ballarat, this initiative will result in a new, integrated regional radiation oncology service for the Grampians region, which extends from Bacchus Marsh to the South Australian border. The Australian government is providing more than $42 million for this project. When completed in 2013, the centre will consist of two linear accelerators, four radiation oncology bunkers, four new chemotherapy chairs and a computed tomography scanner. This new facility will take the pressure off facilities in Melbourne by reducing the need for many cancer patients to travel for essential treatment. The BRICC represents a joint effort from the entire region. The Ballarat community, Ballarat Health Services, Austin Health and St John of God Ballarat all worked hard to submit an extremely strong application for funding. The project also received strong support from the former state member for Ballarat West Karen Overington, whom I commend for her efforts. I would like to also recognise the strong contribution that the people of Ballarat and the surrounding areas have played in this project. Cancer is one of those diseases that tends to touch each of us, personally or through our families or our friends. I am pleased that Ballarat is part of the regional cancer centre initiative and will become an important part of our long-term goal to ensure that all Australians have access to a world-class cancer care system. (Time expired) National School Chaplaincy Program port for continued federal government funding of the National School Chaplaincy Program, a program which could be in jeopardy if the current case before the High Court challenging the federal funding of this important program is successful. Of course, it is not appropriate for me to talk about the matters in dispute before the High Court and I will not do so. However, I wish to place on record my support for the work that is undertaken through this program and the very real benefits that flow to our schools and to our communities. The National School Chaplaincy Program is not a religious program; it is a program based on supporting students and teachers in times of need and it is a program so many schools throughout the electorate of Ryan rely on. However, let us look at how this program actually works and what these school chaplains actually do for our children. I quote from an explanation of the work of school chaplains: School chaplains are in the prevention and rescue business: helping students find a better way to deal with issues ranging from family breakdown and loneliness to drug abuse, depression and suicide. They provide a listening ear and a caring presence for kids in crisis and those who just need a friend. Working alongside other caring professionals in state schools, chaplains care for young people through pastoral care, activity programs, community outreach and adventure-based learning. School chaplains help students to feel a sense of belonging in the school and help students deal with personal issues such as self-image, personal crises, loneliness, grief and loss. MAIN COMMITTEE",224,Constituency Statements
273,Mrs Prentice (Ryan) (10.53 Am),"I rise today to place on the record my strong supSchool chaplains provide encouragement and support for students who are struggling with a variety of issues, and offer a friendly listening ear for all students, staff and parents, in the good times as well as the bad. A recent article which wrote about a teacher named Andrea Eadie who quit teaching to become a school chaplain perfectly illustrates that this program is about helping children, not about religion. The teacher had kept a student in because he had not done his algebra homework, and all of a sudden he asked her if she had ever known anyone who committed suicide. She then learned that his uncle had killed himself the night before. Ms Eadie said that that was when she realised she wanted to help children with the deeper issues. She quit teaching, qualified as a counsellor and signed up to be a school chaplain. She now works three days a week at Patricks Road State School, in Brisbane’s northern suburbs, as a chaplain-and she said she takes her position of trust incredibly seriously, as I am sure all our chaplains do. As Ms. Eadie explained: We abide by a code of conduct as anyone else working in a school does, we certainly don’t take it upon ourselves to force religion on anyone. I have three children myself. My guiding question is always, ‘What would I want a person of another faith to say to my child?’ I always try to answer any questions in a respectful way. Those are the words of a chaplain and they highlight the program’s importance. It is far better and more effective to have resources in our schools to try to address youth issues when they are prevalent and to have programs in place to prevent larger problems and more serious ones from developing. Let us not be short-sighted: remember, the right help at a crucial moment in a child or teenager’s life can prevent a lifetime of problems, which can be much more costly to our society. The loss of a child’s life in any circumstances is a tragedy. It is a serious indictment of our society that suicide is a leading cause of death among young people, second only to motor vehicle accidents. Many of my school principals have said to me, ‘We don’t know what we’d do without our chaplain.’(Time expired) Chifley Electorate: Local Health Networks this federal government was the creation of local health networks, which are made up of small groups of hospitals working together to provide a range of hospital services and manage their own budgets. They will be run locally, funded nationally and accountable for performance against national standards. The electorate of Chifley will be served by the Western Sydney Local Health Network, chaired by Professor Stephen Leeder. Its CEO is Danny O’Connor. I look forward to meeting with these gentlemen in the near future to discuss the network’s strategic plans for the years ahead. I am particularly keen to talk with them both about how they plan to ensure that local residents in Chifley can access great support in the treatment of cancer, or to help parents who have problems obtaining affordable and timely assistance with early childhood speech pathology. The board is made up of a mix of medical and community representatives-and I wanted to congratulate the appointment of Deputy Mayor of Blacktown City Council, Councillor Kathleen Collins. I also note that the board is served well by the presence of Professor Peter Zelas, who has been associated with local health care for 30 years. Five hospitals will fall under the watch of this network: Auburn, Blacktown, Cumberland, Mount Druitt and Westmead.

274,Mr Husic (Chifley) (10.57 Am),"An important feature of the health reforms secured byone, but with different campuses. They also maintain different specialties, with Mount Druitt focused largely on elective surgery. While welcoming the creation of the local health network, because it provides a greater focus for the direction of resources and an opportunity for more attention on local communities, I have reservations about Westmead Hospital’s inclusion in the network. Westmead is a healthcare flagship within the Western Sydney region, without doubt. However, I am concerned its sheer size would see it dominate decisions about staffing and resource allocation-to the detriment of Mount Druitt and Blacktown hospitals. Additionally, the demographics of our area will fundamentally change over time, with greenfields residential development swelling the numbers of people living in Chifley and Greenway. This contrasts with the urban consolidation that largely surrounds Westmead. BothI and my colleague the member for Greenway, Michelle Rowland, were able to directly raise these matters with Minister Roxon. Our state colleague, the member for Mount Druitt, the Hon. Richard Amery, who shares these concerns, pursued the matter with New South Wales health minister, Carmel Tebbutt. I am pleased to say that a number of commitments have been provided to us to ensure that both Mount Druitt and Blacktown hospitals have critical input and security in the setting of their budgets and plans. In particular, I note the government has given special recognition for Blacktown and Mount Druitt hospitals. They will be established as a distinct sector within the network, they will have their own service agreement with government to ensure that local services have even stronger protection and they will have a protected budget as well as additional control over hospital resourcing and accountability. It is certainly my firm intention to closely follow the reporting of the network’s results, keeping a close eye on the operation of these special arrangements. I hope that for future years we could work towards a standalone network, maintaining a focus on meeting the needs of residents within Chifley and Greenway. Again, I welcome the establishment of the Western Sydney Local Health Network and look forward to working with the network for the common good of the residents of Chifley. der 193 the time for constituency statements has concluded. Gas Appliance Safety Debate resumed, on motion by Dr Stone: That this House: (1) mourns the tragic loss of young Chase and Tyler Robinson, who died at Mooroopna on 30 May 2010 in a recently rented home; (2) notes that Chase and Tyler Robinson were the victims of a faulty gas wall heater emitting carbon monoxide; and (3) calls upon the Australian government to work with the state and territory governments through the Council of Australian Governments to: (a) urgently introduce legislation that requires: (i) approved carbon monoxide detectors to be fitted in all homes that have gas appliances; and MAIN COMMITTEE",227,Everyday I Strap My Two Children Into Their Five Point Safety Harnesses Before We Drive Out The
275,The Deputy Speaker (Hon. Peter Slipper),"Order! In accordance with standing or(ii) landlords to arrange for suitably qualified contractors to biennially inspect all gas appliances and associated fittings in rental properties; and (b) institute a national safety awareness campaign alerting all Australians to the dangers and symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning and the need to regularly maintain gas appliances to ensure that they operate efficiently and safely. Dr STONE (Murray) (11.00 am)-As I speak to this motion I thank my electoral neighbour the member for Mallee for supporting me in this motion. He, too, is most concerned about this issue. On Sunday 30 May 2010, two young boys-nine-year-old Chase Robinson and seven-yearold Tyler Robinson-were found dead in their sleep in a rented family home in Mooroopna in Victoria, a tragedy that shocked that community. Their mother, Vanessa, the only other occupant in the house, was also very unwell. This motion also has a silent partner in the form of Vanessa Robinson, who is determined that the death of her two young sons not be in vain. She wishes to see something done seriously about the problem of carbon monoxide poisoning in Australia. Investigations into the boys’ deaths found that a faulty gas wall heater had been operating all night. The boys had died quietly from carbon monoxide poisoning. Because of the widespread ignorance surrounding carbon monoxide poisoning, the earliest media reports suggested that Vanessa was somehow involved in a terrible murder-suicide pact. A few days later, on 3 June, Vanessa’s parents, Sue and Les Rowney, issued a plea for understanding in a press release: At a time when our family has just lost two amazing and well loved boys, rather than be allowed to grieve in private and maintain a watch over our daughter in the Intensive Care Unit whilst she remained in an induced coma following the effects of the carbon monoxide, we have had to endure seeing the news and photos of our beloved Chase and Tyler splashed across the front pages of national and local newspapers and TV media with headlines linking their mother to their deaths. Her name, her identity, have been released and published (including photos), her reputation as a person and loving mother has been publicly and erroneously called into question. She had been reported as having been arrested when the truth was that she was too unwell to be interviewed by detectives let alone be arrested. This tragedy and its aftermath could have been avoided if the public were alive to the dangers of leaking gas; if police and emergency workers knew more about it-its symptoms and its consequences; and if gas appliances were regularly checked. There are currently no laws mandating regular safety checks for gas appliances fitted in homes, nor are gas detectors mandated. In the last 10 years there have been at least five deaths in Victoria caused by carbon monoxide poisoning. In fact, we are not sure how many there have been in Victoria or other states; too often deaths that occur in the very young or the very old go without a diagnosis that it was, in fact, carbon monoxide poisoning. Both natural gas and LPG can lead to carbon monoxide production where appliances are misused, incorrectly installed or poorly maintained. Very recently carbon monoxide killed a 23-year-old man when fumes built up from a generator he was using under a house while sheltering from Cyclone Yasi near Ingham. Just a day or so ago a tragedy was averted at Nathalia’s Bridge Hotel. On Saturday morning carbon dioxide was released when a post mix machine, which mixes soft drink, leaked into the hotel cellar. Fortunately, a call for assistance was made and the fire authority attended the scene, and so disaster was averted. MAIN COMMITTEE The symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning are often difficult for the public to detect. There is not sufficient public information or education about the dangers, and carbon monoxide is tasteless, colourless, odourless and invisible. The symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning vary, with tiredness, shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, vomiting and dizziness. The symptoms can easily be disregarded or misunderstood. In particular, the very young and the very old can be affected without anyone putting the gas wall furnace and the symptoms together. Carbon monoxide detectors can be purchased in Australia for as little as $40 each, but we do not have Australian standards for these detectors-unlike the situation with smoke detectors. In other countries these standards do exist, and they are regulated. This motion calls for all new residential properties with gas appliances to be fitted with approved carbon monoxide detectors, and for rental properties to have gas detectors installed and checked biennially. We also need nationally consistent legislation for safety checks on gas appliances in homes and the installation of detectors, and the implementation of a national safety awareness program highlighting the dangers and symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning. This motion is the first step in bringing about change which would need to come via the Australian Building Codes Board, ABCB. Template legislation or regulations need to be introduced in each state and territory. I acknowledge it may be a process best managed through COAG. The ABCB maintains and updates the Building Code of Australia. It provides the community with cost-effective and efficient regulations to aid the design, construction and use of buildings throughout Australia and it responds to government and industry calls for minimum necessary regulation to facilitate and not inhibit business. We are now making that call. I know that the member for Mallee and I will be following up on this motion to make sure that we see action to save lives. Beginning in 1994, legislation or regulations were introduced into each state and territory requiring that all homes be fitted with smoke alarms. An equivalent measure now needs to be implemented to deal with the equally deadly leaking of carbon monoxide from gas appliances which are found in most homes in Australia today. I want to return to the words of Vanessa Robinson’s family. As I said before, Vanessa is a silent partner in putting this motion today. Vanessa has already had fundraising efforts with the father of the boys, Scott. She has also done a great deal herself to try to raise awareness of this problem. I understand that with the Victorian government she is hoping to put some community advertising through television into the broader Australian population so that more people are aware of just what can happen if you do not have properly maintained or installed gas appliances. This was written by her parents: Throughout this and the ensuing backlash and animosity towards Vanessa in the local and national community the family has maintained a dignified silence whilst they assisted detectives with their enquiries and tried to make sense of what had happened. We wish the possibility of Carbon Monoxide poisoning had been investigated earlier and in parallel with the murder investigation, as we had raised concerns about this possibility with the police on Mondaythat was following the deaths. We have also been appalled by the lack of medical attention Vanessa received during the initial hours of her being taken by the Police. We are equally appalled by the lack of information afforded to us over our daughter’s condition especially during the time that her health began to rapidly deteriorate, forcing us to hire a lawyer in order to MAIN COMMITTEE be able to find out its severity and whether we needed to immediately travel to Melbourne to be by her side. For a mother and father that had just lost two grandchildren and who was not been allowed to see their daughter or be informed of the severity of her deteriorating condition it is just not right. … … … Finally we would like to urge all families to ensure their heaters are serviced and checked to ensure there are no Carbon Monoxide leaks as this gas cannot be seen, smelt or tasted but it can result in a tragic loss of life as it has for our family. As you can see, this is a matter which has led to the most sad and serious consequences for the Robinson family and it would have been totally avoidable if in fact that rented property had been inspected for gas leakage. We understand that the gas heater had been on the property for some seven years without any attention. Of course it is the case that we need to make sure that people who have gas appliances do not tamper with them themselves and always use qualified tradespeople when they are having their gas appliances examined, installed or in any way altered. As members of parliament we need to work to we do all we can through this national parliament to ensure tragedies like the deaths of Chase and Tyler Robinson never happen again. It is also important that we look at international best practice. We note that in the United Kingdom there has been concern about gas leakage and the consequences for many years. They have legislation which makes sure that people are aware of the problem and there are mandated requirements in relation to detectors. Given that detectors are quite a cheap piece of equipment, and given that retrofitting them in houses is not a difficult or expensive thing to do, I call upon this parliament to have a bilateral approach-as I am sure we will find in response to this motion today-to ensuring that one of these gaps that have occurred in our regulation of community safety is closed; that, as I said a minute ago, the deaths of young boys like Chase and Tyler Robinson have not been in vain; and that such tragedies never happen again. Murray has brought this resolution forward and has sought to put a spotlight on what would be a matter of concern to a large number of people. I was particularly moved by the points she raised in relation to Vanessa. It would be difficult not only to have to deal with that situation of the loss of two young lives but, on top of that, to have overlaid the suggestion of wrongdoing. I note that the member for Murray made reference to the fact that they maintained a dignified silence. I think many people in similar situations would be sorely tested to have to deal with two compounding and compelling issues: (1) the deaths and (2) the suggestion of something that was inappropriate. I was going to make reference to smoke detectors. In my home state of New South Wales it is now, as a result of state legislation, compulsory to fit homes with smoke detectors, because it has been the silent killer of many that they have been unaware that their homes have been on fire and, as a result of carbon monoxide, they have been unable to respond to that fatal incident occurring in their homes. It is interesting to note that there has not been any significant work done to study emissions that occur within homes and whether or not those homes are able to, through design, ensure adequate ventilation. I know that we are talking about detection and response, but another silent killer is the way in which homes have been constructed over the years and the way in MAIN COMMITTEE",228,Private Members Business
276,Mr Husic (Chifley) (11.10 Am),"At the outset, I welcome the fact that the member forwhich certain designs would, for example, encourage the retention of certain emissions that, of themselves, would cause harm over time. It has been brought to my attention that the CSIRO has been involved and that there has been a study conducted through the Centre for Australian Weather and Climate Research. It was probably the first study done in Australia-because there had been no extensive studies of indoor air quality-to look at typical dwellings in Australia and to determine whether or not those dwellings are having an impact on the retention of certain emissions within homes. In particular, they found that, in the construction of homes that have garages connected with indoor access, the emissions themselves are higher because of, basically, the movement and retention of those emissions within homes, particularly during the morning hours between seven and eight, when obviously you have people departing for work, school or other activities and the operation of vehicles so close to those premises ensures the retention of those emissions within indoor premises. It is worth noting as well that this study was conducted over the winter of 2008, and there was further follow-up with a number of homes-40, off the top of my head-in 2009. So it is a relatively recent study which it has been important to conduct. They observed a number of pollutants-not just carbon monoxide but formaldehyde amongst others. They said that the concentration of indoor air pollutants observed in the study is comparable with concentrations observed in previous studies in Australia. There were a number of purposes to the study. The first was to determine indoor air quality in typical dwellings. The second was to determine whether or not the proximity of dwellings to busy roads has an influence on indoor air quality. They selected two sets of dwellings‘near road’ and ‘far road’. A number of statistical analyses were carried out to determine whether that had an influence. It was found that the only pollutants were closer to busy roads, which resulted in enhanced concentrations. The third purpose of the study related to indoor quality, particularly with reference to the characteristics of the dwelling, the materials and indoor activities, with a particular focus on whether or not ventilation systems within homes were aiding by being able to get rid of those pollutants that were considered to have health impacts. It was noted-and obviously common sense would dictate this as well-that over the course of time, as architecture and home design have improved, with a focus on reducing the impact of heat and cold on homes, that has led to a focus on improving ventilation in homes. Over time, compared to older dwellings, there has been a propensity for newer homes to be able to expel those air pollutants, but it is still an issue. I think a lot of people would be motivated by the concerns that the member for Murray has brought forward. I acknowledge that in her contribution today she has seen that a lot of this is state based and that is where the focus will need to be. However, I also recognise that in the previous advice to us, Mr Deputy Speaker-there is a need to determine how we are able to encourage national cooperation on this. Certainly a way that we can move forward is through the auspices of COAG. I think the issue will be determining how-obviously, given the number of national-state issues that are being coordinated through that forum-we are able to best progress on that. However, I think it is important, and I certainly commend the fact, as I said at the beginning, that this has been brought forward. Frankly, with the construction of this new parliament MAIN COMMITTEE",231,Private Members Business
277,Mechanisms Put Forward By Dr Stone,"sorry, the member for Murray; taking on board yourand particularly with the changes to the standing orders, we need to take the opportunity to raise issues that, while they may be in local or state jurisdictions, have a national impact-and certainly this is one of those areas where that is the case-and then to determine the way in which we are able to progress on those issues. I am sure that in most households-and certainly in the electorate of Chifley, which I represent, where there are a blend of newer and older style premises-people would have concerns about whether or not indoor air pollutants are being trapped in this way. The other thing to note, too, is that there are variations across states in heating. For example-and I take it that this is the case in rural Victoria-it is certainly the case, as I know from my previous experience working with an energy distributor, that on the south coast of New South Wales they do not necessarily have reticulated gas but will rely on bottled gas. Having said that, the network itself is one thing; another-and this was raised by the member for Murray-is the connections in the home, whether or not they are up to standard and whether or not they have been checked. These things need to be followed up. There is definitely merit in following up the issue that was raised by the member for Murray about national awareness campaigns as well. It really comes down to how we progress this at a national level within COAG. The issue for us is seeing how we coordinate amongst states to deal with this issue, given that the relevant department at the federal level, the Department of Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities, does not have the statutory power in regard to fitting the detectors. The department has funded research in the past on the health effects of air quality in homes with unflued gas heaters. Those heaters-and it is acknowledged-pose a risk of elevated levels of indoor pollutants, including carbon monoxide. I think the challenge has been thrown out by the member for Murray: how do we coordinate national action on this and encourage states to move on this in the way that they have with the fitting of smoke detectors? I will limit my remarks to those. Certainly, as I said earlier, there is a challenge that needs to be met in this area and in seeing we respond to this resolution. close to his 10 minutes. There was a problem with the clock, so it did not start until a minute and a half into your speech. opportunity to support my geographic neighbour, the fine member for Murray, in this resolution. Carbon monoxide poisoning has been a priority of mine for a long time. This goes back to my former life as a consulting engineer involved in building design and some of the things that the member for Chifley referred to. All of us need to pause for a moment and realise that the member for Murray’s resolution starts with her point number one. Her resolve and her desire to have something done about this comes from the tragedy of the loss of the two young Robinson boys. Any death is completely unnecessary. But deaths are more unnecessary when they involve young people, the richest resource that the nation has. I am particularly interested in supporting the member for Murray because I am very concerned about the lack of awareness about carbon monoxide. I support the other points in her resolution about encouraging building control boards to look at this issue and encouraging the use of detectors. Carbon monoxide is a very insidious gas. We hear a lot about carbon dioxide, which is relevant to the discussion that occurs in regards to climate change. Carbon dioxide is the MAIN COMMITTEE",232,Private Members Business
278,The Deputy Speaker (Hon. Peter Slipper),The honourable member has had very,233,Private Members Business
279,Mr Forrest (Mallee) (11.19 Am),"I second the resolution. I am very pleased to have ancombination of a carbon atom and two oxygen atoms. It is detectable. The thing about carbon monoxide, which is a carbon atom and one oxygen atom, is that it is not detectable. That makes it very insidious. I encourage people when they are driving their motorcars, which I often do as I travel through my vast electorate late of night, to always drive with their window down, even if it is only an inch or two. You will notice if you are driving along, particularly in the winter and you are trying to keep the vehicle warm and you have the circulating air on warm, how drowsy one can become. That is the subtle, dangerous impact of carbon monoxide poisoning. If that feeling comes over you, you will be amazed when winding the window down and getting a sniff of good air how remarkably quickly one’s awareness returns. I am particularly anxious to support the member’s resolution. The reason that I am harping on so much about awareness is that it will take a long time to get the states together through COAG. I am sure that the member’s resolution will get some action. But in the meantime we need to promote awareness. We as members of this place have the opportunity to promote through media comments the dangers of carbon monoxide. Energy Safe Victoria have produced a brochure that is designed to make landlords aware of their responsibilities as lessors to vulnerable people who are not necessarily aware of this. They have made some very strong comments about carbon monoxide poisoning in this brochure. It says: Carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning is a threat where internal gas appliances are misused, incorrectly installed or poorly maintained. CO poisoning can have symptoms similar to flu and can be fatal. If people are not aware of what is happening to them, which is probably what happened with those two youngsters, fatality can be imminent. I am particularly concerned about the use of mobile caravans and cabins. If a person wants to use gas for heating, they should never go to sleep with the gas appliance operating-never. I have seen incidents of that. I saw it happening in campervans when I was a young person backpacking through Europe. People with gas appliances in their campervans kept them on at night because it was chilly or icy outside. That is an absolute no-no. Carbon monoxide poisoning is a threat because the symptoms of overindulgence are symptoms that we come across in other illnesses, like flu. These include headaches, dizziness and nausea, which we do not necessarily link with a high concentration of carbon monoxide. WhatI would like see in the meantime is that we encourage COAG and the states to see what they can do about appropriate detectors and ensuring that modern construction provides adequate warnings for gas appliances fitted to homes. We need to promote more and more of this style of brochure to every person who has a gas appliance in their home. I am supporting the member for Murray in that particular part of her initiative, because I just happen to know it will take some time to get the Australian Building Code changed. Despite the fact that there have been tragedies, it will take some time. I am hoping that other members will take up the cause here and warn people of the terrible dangers of carbon monoxide. It is insidious: you cannot smell it, and that makes it dangerous. I am pleased to have this opportunity to support a good resolution and to see the parliament operating in the way it should. I think the energy of a non-partisan approach on this will ensure we get an outcome. We just do not want the nation to be deprived of the resources of youngsters, young teenagers, whose only fault was that they were not made aware of the risk they were taking in keeping a gas appliance operating all night. MAIN COMMITTEE With those few words, I offer a message of condolence to the Robinson family, for whom, whilst this incidence occurred in May last year, time will not heal the wounds and grief they feel at the loss of two youngsters. I share that condolence with them and through the member for Murray. I commend her on the resolution she has put before the parliament. Murray for bringing this matter to the chamber. It is indeed both a tragedy and an opportunity, and I would like to add my voice to the sentiments that have been spoken before me by the member for Mallee and my colleague the member for Chifley. We join with all members of this place in mourning the tragic loss of Chase and Tyler Robinson, who died at Mooroopna on 30 May last year. It was a terrible tragedy for their parents, Vanessa and Scott Robinson. I take this opportunity to pass my condolences on to Scott and Vanessa, who I am sure are still grieving. We know that Energy Safe Victoria examined the house and that police believe a gas leak was directly responsible for the tragic deaths of these young boys. Indeed, inspections have revealed a faulty gas appliance, possibly a heater, was responsible for these deaths. It really is regrettable that carbon monoxide poisoning only comes to national attention following a tragedy like this. I guess I am like every other Australian who only focused their attention on this issue after this terrible tragedy. I am also a father of two young children, and we have an unflued gas heater in our house. So we really do hope that some good can come from this terrible incident. The problem with carbon monoxide is that you cannot see it and you cannot smell it, but at high levels it is deadly. We know that carbon monoxide is produced whenever any fuel such as gas, oil, kerosene, wood or even charcoal is burned. It is important to note that an appliance that is properly installed and maintained, as the member for Chifley outlined earlier, will not present a hazard. However, if an appliance is not working properly or is used incorrectly or if there is poor ventilation then dangerous levels of carbon monoxide will result. This points to the fact that it should be incumbent on all landlords everywhere, as the motion points out, to be aware of this and to properly maintain the heating equipment in their properties and have it inspected on a regular basis And, as tenants, when we enter into a lease arrangement, we should ensure that we check on the maintenance of appliances more vigilantly and do our part to insist that this maintenance takes place. Of course, it is not only here in Australia. We know that around the world each year hundreds of people die accidentally from carbon monoxide poisoning. Some more die from carbon monoxide poisoning outside the home and other buildings, such as in cars, as the member for Mallee has pointed out. Foetuses, infants, elderly people and people with asthma or a history of respiratory or heart disease are especially susceptible. Some of the risks for carbon monoxide poisoning arise from commonly occurring situations, such as a blocked flue or a faulty cowl, damaged or corroded fluepipes, sealing up a fixed fresh air ventilator or using camping appliances indoors or in an improperly ventilated space. We should also all be aware that the threat from carbon monoxide is much higher if the appliance is in a very small room such as a toilet or bathroom-surprisingly, many gas heaters are still fitted in confined spaces such as these-or if you are sleeping in the same room as the appliance, such as in a tent or a caravan. The threat is also increased if ventilation to the appliance is absent or restricted or if the flue is in poor condition. It has been argued that the MAIN COMMITTEE",233,Private Members Business
280,Mr Stephen Jones (Throsby) (11.26 Am),"CanI begin by thanking the member forcharcoal briquettes and portable barbecues should carry specific warnings about the dangers of burning charcoal in confined areas, and I agree that this is something that we should move on. These are risks that we should all be more aware of because of the everyday, commonly occurring situations where these risks arise. I believe that with the switch in consumption from electricity to gas heating in particular over recent years-a switch that I believe is only going to accelerate-this is a problem that we really do have to face as legislators. Raised levels of carbon monoxide can have significant impact on human health, and the Australian government has taken steps to manage and reduce the amount of carbon monoxide that is produced. These steps include implementing national fuel quality standards, promoting alternative fuels and supporting the implementation of tighter vehicle emission standards. However, more needs to be done. Through the National Environment Protection Council, the Australian state and territory governments have also agreed on a national environment protection measure for ambient air quality. The measure includes national standards for six key pollutants, including carbon monoxide. The Gillard government is committing to working through the COAG framework to progress national action on a number of fronts. There is no doubt that lives would be saved if carbon monoxide detectors were fitted in homes with gas appliances and if states regulated to ensure that landlords were obliged to have qualified contractors inspect all gas appliances in rental properties on a regular basis. With these observations in mind, I have no qualms at all about speaking in favour of the motion and commending it to the House. has expired. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. Murray-Darling Basin Debate resumed, on motion by Ms Rishworth: That this House: (1) notes that: (a) support for a solution to return the Murray-Darling river system to health is widespread across Australia; (b) a poll by the Australian Conservation Foundation found that 77 per cent of Australians agree that environmental degradation in the Murray-Darling Basin must be reversed; (c) the Government is working towards an effective strategy for the integrated and sustainable management of water resources in the Murray-Darling Basin; and (d) this strategy includes purchasing water for increased environmental flows, setting sustainable diversion limits on the quantity of water removed from the Basin, managing water quality and investing in water-saving infrastructure; and (2) recognises that the Government: (a) has already began the task of returning the Murray-Darling river system to health through the Water for the Future plan; (b) is working towards ensuring the long term viability of this river system for all those who rely on its precious water resources; and (c) will continue to consult openly with all stakeholders in the Murray-Darling Basin. MAIN COMMITTEE",235,Private Members Business
281,The Deputy Speaker (Hon. Peter Slipper),"Order! The time allotted for this debateMs RISHWORTH (Kingston) (11.33 am)-I am very pleased to rise today to move this motion that is of great importance to our nation. The Murray-Darling system is the most significant river system in our country. Spanning over four states, it is a critical freshwater system sustaining not only local communities along the river system but indeed many of our major cities. The recent floods and rains across the eastern seaboard have also seen a large increase in inflows into the Murray-Darling system-water that the system desperately needed after a decade of drought. But the recent increases in inflows should not be an excuse to walk away from long-term reform in managing this critical national asset. This Labor government takes reform of the Murray-Darling Basin seriously. Whilst it was the Howard government that introduced the Water Act, that government took no practical action to return any water to the system. It took this Labor government to start the heavy lifting on this important area of reform, negotiating with the states to get agreement on the management of the system by the Commonwealth, to establish the Murray-Darling Basin Authority, to buy back water and to invest in water-saving infrastructure. As a representative from South Australia, the state at the end of the river system, I have seen the impact a combination of drought and overallocation has had down at the end. The state of our river system has not been a result of neglect over the last two years but neglect over decades. In South Australia we have seen not only the vast destruction of our native environment along the river but also the destruction of our communities that rely on this water supply. In the Lower Lakes community situated at the very end of the Murray-Darling system we have seen the water quality deteriorate so much that it can no longer be used for drinking water or for irrigation. Dairy operations in the Lower Lakes region have been decimated, reducing from 23 to three. Other industries have also suffered, including the Lakes and Coorong fishing industry, who have reported a sharp decline in fish stock. This is one point that the opposition fail to understand. They try to paint the issue facing the Murray-Darling system as a choice between the environment and rural communities. You hear over and over again from those opposite-and I am sure we will hear it in this debatethat it is environment versus communities. But this argument is a false dichotomy. Reforming the Murray-Darling system is not a choice between the interests of primary producers and the environment. Reforming the Murray-Darling system is in the interests of everyone that relies on this vital system. The choice really is between a healthy system that can service the community for the long term and an unhealthy river system that can no longer be relied on or used by local communities. The opposition uses this false dichotomy as an excuse to do nothing and oppose everything when it comes to reforming the system. The health of the Murray-Darling system is of great importance to South Australians, so it is no wonder that during the election last year we saw the Leader of the Opposition fly in, trying to capitalise on this issue that is held dear by many South Australians. He said: Water is probably the most urgent environmental challenge facing our country. The Coalition will end Labor’s procrastination and fully and finally implement the … plan for the Murray Darling basin. I think at the same press conference he said he would implement the Basin Plan within two weeks after the election result. This same plan which he said he would implement he is now criticising and calling for it to be scrapped. Clearly the Leader of the Opposition has broken his promise to the people of Adelaide and the people of South Australia, paying lip-service with no real intention of doing anything. MAIN COMMITTEE The coalition’s lack of concern for the Murray-Darling River has only further been confirmed by the coalition announcing two weeks ago that if they were in government they would scrap the water buyback to improve the overall health of the system. This is a slap in the face for every South Australian who believed the Leader of the Opposition was serious about the issue of water reform during the election, only to find out now that he is full of hot air. Unfortunately, it seems Senator Joyce now has the numbers in the Liberal-National caucus and not Senator Birmingham. In fact, Senator Joyce has won the day opposing reform. But, in clear contrast to the opposition, this government is working in our national interest, working with the states to get outcomes that are in the long-term national interest. Since being elected, it has been this government that has committed $12 billion to Water for the Future. Under this initiative, we have commenced water buybacks which enable the government to purchase water from willing irrigators and deliver it to the rivers, wetlands and flood plains of the basin. At 31 January the Commonwealth had secured, through the exchange of contracts, entitlements with a long-term average annual yield of 690 gigalitres of water. This is a significant investment and a significant return of water to the basin. This government has also committed $5.8 billion of funding for water infrastructure and efficiency measures under the Sustainable Rural Water Use and Infrastructure Program. About $4.8 billion is currently committed. During the government’s ongoing consultations, the government and particularly the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities and the Minister for Regional Australia, Regional Development and Local Government have continued to listen to communities and take on suggestions. In addition, some very constructive suggestions have been made by the member for New England, in his capacity as the Chair of the Standing Committee on Regional Australia, currently inquiring into the impact of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan in regional Australia. The Hon. Tony Burke, Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities, has announced that the government will move to change taxation regulations so that irrigators who take up water efficiency investment grants will no longer be disadvantaged. This will encourage more investment in water-saving infrastructure. Furthermore, water buybacks will now be more strategic, with smaller payments being made available more frequently to introduce greater certainty into the market. The minister has made it clear that, while individual tenders will be smaller, the total amount allocated for buybacks will not be reduced. This is an important point. This way the market will not be distorted. We will have a modest presence in the market each month to generate greater confidence that water purchasing will be gradual and staggered. Irrigators who miss out on a round of water buybacks can be certain that another round will still be available. The government will continue to consult and speak with local communities, but it will not walk away from reform. The Murray-Darling Basin Authority will continue to work on the proposed plan for the Murray-Darling Basin to be presented to the states and Commonwealth for their consideration. The Standing Committee on Regional Australia, chaired by the member for New England, will continue to inquire and report on the impact of the Murray-Darling Basin in regional Australia. Reforming the basin will be no easy feat. Agreement about the Murray-Darling Basin has never been easy. The Barrier Miner, on 21 January 1911, reported on the Murray river waters conference: MAIN COMMITTEE The Murray river waters conference sat yesterday and the matters at issue were discussed all day by the various state representatives. No understanding was reached. The New South Wales ministers stated that their state would not be limited in any way in the use of the Murrumbidgee water for the large irrigation schemes. So we can see that in 1911 this was an issue. It continues to be an issue today, but after 100 years it has taken the election of a Commonwealth Labor government to finally make reform so that for the first time we can manage the Murray-Darling river system and have a plan for its long-term sustainability into the future. I call on the opposition, especially those members from South Australia, to stand up and act in the long-term interests of this important river system. We have heard the Leader of the Opposition come down and make some grand plans. We have heard members from South Australia say that they are committed to water reform. But we have seen absolutely no evidence on the ground that the coalition takes this seriously. SoI invite the coalition members to get on board for reform, to come and join us and to work constructively with us so that in 100 years time those communities along the river system-the large cities, the towns-will all still have a water system that is not degraded and unable to be used by anyone. This is not just an issue for today or for tomorrow; this is an issue for farming families for this generation and for the next generation. We need the Murray-Darling system to be in a state that allows for mixed use of it into the future. SoI call on the opposition to get on board, because the government is fully committed to reforming this system and ensuring that we get a long-term, viable outcome for our nation’s interests. all want the health of the Murray-Darling Basin to be the best it can be. No-one wants this more than the regional communities who are totally reliant on the rivers in this wonderful area of Australia. No-one wants this more than the family farmers, many of whom are thirdand fourth-generation irrigators whose ancestors were sent, coerced, encouraged-call it what you like-by the Commonwealth government of the day to turn dry, arid dust bowls into the lush, green food-producing areas that they are today. These rural oases came about only through hard, backbreaking work under a hot Australian sun. Living conditions were primitive but the early European settlers who went to forge a new existence in these windswept, largely waterless plains had a common desire: a desire to succeed, to make the best of the harsh conditions and times, to make a new life. Hope springs eternal. Through sheer determination and against all odds, they did succeed. Water was diverted to these once-dry districts in open channels and a remarkable transformation took place of ground described by explorer John Oxley in 1817 as ‘country which, for barrenness and desolation, can I think have no equal’. Making the landscape renovation from desert to paradise was all the more amazing considering these irrigation regions were largely established by migrants and soldier settlers. These irrigation communities have flourished over the decades and our nation and indeed the world have benefited as a result. I note the member for Kingston citing statistics in her speech from the Australian Conservation Foundation. Here is an interesting fact, and I have a few more to share with you as well, just so you are really in the picture of the true worth and value of our irrigation areas, two of which, Coleambally and Murrumbidgee, are in my Riverina electorate. The Australian Farm Institute says every Griffith farmer feeds 150 Australians and 450 foreigners each year. No doubt even MAIN COMMITTEE",236,Private Members Business
282,Mr Mccormack (Riverina) (11.44 Am),"Everyone wants a healthy river system. Wemembers of the ACF, who sometimes have a very different way of looking at the need for farming and just how we will grow produce into the future, have partaken of the fruits of the labour of those from the Coleambally and Murrumbidgee irrigation areas as many of us have done and hopefully will continue to do. What irrigation farmers after many months of angst and heartache need now most is certainty. The greatest threat hanging over their heads at present is uncertainty. As a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Regional Australia, which is conducting an inquiry into the impact of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan in regional Australia, the central theme coming from the many communities we have visited is uncertainty-uncertainty brought about by this Labor government, which took to six months to get to a water policy, 18 months to set up the Murray-Darling Basin Authority and 36 months to determine there needed to be a proper analysis of the social and economic effects, the human cost, of any water reform. ‘Whisky is for drinking, water is for fighting over.’ American author Mark Twain summed up one of the biggest issues facing Australia. The Nationals are all on the same page when it comes to putting the family farmers who grow the food to feed the nation first and foremost when it comes to the water debate. Another quotable quote in relation to water came at one of the Murray-Darling Basin Authority community information sessions and was uttered by Benerembah farmer John Bonetti, who spoke for many, if not all, when he told the MDBA: ‘If you think this is the end you’re wrong. The fight has only just begun.’ You can understand Mr Bonetti’s passion. At present the Riverina growers produce 28 per cent of the national citrus crop, 98 per cent of Australia’s rice, hay and forage crops, cut flowers, turf, vegetables, livestock and livestock products. The Murray-Darling Basin, specifically the Murrumbidgee River, is the lifeblood of the western half of the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area. The MIA is the food bowl of the Australian economy, the largest food-producing region in Australia. To be saddled with suggestions of water entitlement cuts as much as 43 per cent included as part of the MDBA’s guide to a draft to a plan and then to be told, again by the authority or representatives thereof, just recently that in real terms the cuts are more in the order of 55 per cent, it is little wonder the good folk in that good part of the world are not feeling very good at the moment. Cutbacks proposed will not decimate communities as everyone is saying; they will obliterate them. The Nationals, as I say, are all on the same page. Like all others in the MIA, Mr Bonetti is desperately worried about the future if cutbacks to water allocations in the order of up to 43 per cent proceed under the Basin Plan. He has been integral in the MIA’s strong, united voice against what federal Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities Tony Burke calls the guide to a draft to a plan. The guide is a Labor-Greens dagger to what the Mayor of Griffith, Councillor Mike Neville, often describes as the heart and lungs of the nation, the MIA, which contributes more than $2½ billion annually to the Australian economy. Labor has lost control of reform in the Murray-Darling Basin. The former chair of the Murray-Darling Basin Authority, Mike Taylor, had to resign because the minister was asking him to do things which were against the legal advice he had received on the Water Act. We now have a new chair, Mr Craig Knowles, who is an ex-New South Wales Labor minister. Mr Knowles has appointed a separate delivery board and an advisory board, plunging the entire MAIN COMMITTEE process into farce. Let us get the Basin Plan back on track. Labor has the Basin Plan process the wrong way around. When the coalition put up the 10-point Howard-Turnbull plan we prioritised investments in water efficiency so that we could return the water to the environment and to communities. Labor has spent only $437 million of the $5.8 billion allocated for infrastructure investments. They are already $700 million ahead on buybacks but $350 million behind on infrastructure investments compared to the original plan. In the midyear budget update the Labor Party decided to defer a further $450 million in infrastructure investments. The coalition have nothing to hide in regard to the Senate inquiry into the Water Act and if there are problems with the Water Act then we will stand and we will remedy them. The coalition succeeded in establishing this Senate inquiry into whether the Water Act can deliver an equally weighted consideration of the economic, social and environmental factors. Both the coalition and Labor have promised that they will deliver such a bottom line result. But Professor George Williams; Professor Judith Sloan; Professor John Briscoe; Josephine Kelly, who is a barrister; and the Productivity Commission have all argued that the act gives the environment ‘primacy’. What have Labor got to hide? Why won’t they even support an investigation and why won’t they release all the legal advice they have received on the act? A failure to deal with these ambiguities risks keeping the Basin Plan in court for the next decade. That is not a good outcome for the river or the communities who need the certainty to get on with their lives and businesses. The Water Act could not be the first act since Federation that may require amendment. Let us get on with the job and get it right the first time. The coalition have announced $600 million of deferrals in water buybacks to make way for spending on the recovery from flood and cyclone damage in Queensland and other parts of Australia. The water buyback scheme is already $700 million ahead of the original plan set in 2008. Labor has bought $1.4 billion in water buyback spending in the past two budgets. The recent floods give us some breathing space to actually develop an environmental water plan before we spend billions of dollars on water rights. Floods do not necessarily reduce the price of water licences, because the water does not increase the number of water licences. The price of water licences in the Murray-Darling Basin has been stable over the past year. We welcome the interim findings of the inquiry by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Regional Australia into the impact of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan on regional Australia, particularly the call for a more strategic approach to buybacks. The coalition proposed a more strategic approach at the last election, calling for an assessment of the full cost of water buybacks, including the cost of stranded assets. The coalition support improving the environmental health of the Murray-Darling Basinas we all do. That is why we set up a $10 billion National Plan for Water Security over four years ago. This motion notes that the government have already begun the task of returning the Murray-Darling River system to health. After four years, all Labor can claim is that they have begun the task. They took 18 months just to appoint the board of the MDBA. Now they are busily creating a second delivery board to sideline the first. Menindee Lakes was at the top of the list of actions Labor were going to take on the Murray-Darling Basin at the 2007 election. The coalition left Labor $400 million for that specific purpose. Over three years later, no work has actually been done on Menindee. Even God could not wait for Labor-the lakes have filled back up again and now the Minister Burke admits that further delays have been caused by the fact that so much of it is now under water. MAIN COMMITTEE Labor claimed that they are working toward ensuring the health of the basin, but they are actually doing it at the pace of a snail. The coalition put aside almost $6 billion to invest in improved water efficiency, which would deliver water for the environment and communities. The COAG Reform Council noted last year that 12 out of 17 of the projects had failed to make substantial progress. Labor have managed to spend only $437 million of this fund, to deliver a paltry 2.7 gigalitres of savings-an unbelievable $161,000 per megalitre. Labor are $350 million behind on the original time line for the infrastructure program. Labor’s changes to the buyback scheme that were announced recently are an admission that they have got it wrong. Labor accept that a more strategic approach to buybacks is now needed, in line with the coalition’s election policy on the Murray-Darling. commend the member for Kingston for bringing this matter to the House for debate. CanI say from the outset that nothing could have highlighted the significance and the importance of the Murray-Darling Basin more than the decade-long drought, when you consider that the Murray-Darling Basin is home to some two million Australians, provides essential water needs for almost three million Australians, has some 30,000 wetlands within it, 16 of which are Ramsar listed, and has a world listed site in it as well. It provides, on figures available, anything up to about 75 per cent of the irrigated land in Australia used for growing agricultural products and pastures. Depending on whose figures you want to listen to, figures on its worth to the Australian economy range up to about $40 billion. All of that was essentially highlighted after a decade of drought because all of those matters came to a head as a result of the basin being impacted by the drought. I will just respond very briefly to the member for Riverina, because five minutes does not give me a lot of time to speak on the matters I want to address. CanI say: it is as a result of a decade of neglect from the previous government when the signs were clearly on the board that we are in the situation that we are in right now. If there is criticism to be made with respect to the Water Act 2007, let me remind the member for Riverina that it was a previous coalition government that brought that act into this place, and it was supported by the Labor opposition at the time. We are dealing with an act brought in not by this government but by the previous government. Mr Deputy Speaker Sidebottom, I am a supplementary member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Regional Australia, of which you are the deputy chair. CanI say in that respect that I commend you on your commitment to getting the plan right. If it takes time to do so then so be it, but we need to get the plan right. I will come back to the issue of uncertainty in a moment as well. As a member of that committee I, along with the member for Riverina, have visited communities right throughout the basin. We still have some more places to go to, but at this stage we have visited communities in South Australia, in Victoria and in New South Wales. We have seen first hand the devastation caused to those communities as a result of the shortage of water and we have seen first hand the devastation caused to the environmental areas along the way as well. We know that we have to get the plan right. With respect to the work of that committee, having listened to the people in those communities and having seen first hand that devastation, I believe that there are a number of matters that the committee will be guided by. First and foremost, the communities within the basin all depend on the health of the Murray-Darling Basin river system for their survival, and every MAIN COMMITTEE",239,Private Members Business
283,Mr Zappia (Makin) (11.54 Am),"I welcome the opportunity to speak on this matter and Icommunity has been affected by the drought. Secondly, those same communities depend on a relatively stable water supply for their survival. Thirdly, uncertainty about water availability and water allocations, as the member for Riverina has quite rightly said, is as destructive as the water shortage itself. Uncertainty creates stress and insecurity. Fourthly, communities within the basin understand the social and environmental importance of having a sustainable system. In fact, it has been my observation that the majority of farmers have a deep commitment to protecting our environment. Fifthly, Murray-Darling Basin farmers and Murray-Darling Basin communities have in recent years made massive investments in irrigation efficiencies, and I acknowledge that. Lastly, it is my observation that communities within the Murray-Darling Basin well understand the importance of developing a sustainable water plan for the basin and that, now that a process has begun, we must see it through and get it right. I want to talk about getting it right, the uncertainty and why it is important that we continue with the process and not delay. It is clear to me that the opposition are now taking a strategy such that they would like to see the process delayed, because the Leader of the Opposition has indicated that they would defer the strategic water buybacks that we know are also essential as part of a plan of getting it right. It is essential that we get it right now because, if we do not, that uncertainty will continue. If we do not, we know that weather patterns will continue to be uncertain. And, if we do not, we know that it will not be long before we are back to where we started at the beginning of the inquiry-that is, going into another drought, possibly as bad as the last decade of drought. We have to get it right, and to do so we cannot afford to waste time on it and defer the water buybacks or defer the work of the committee. I commend this motion and I believe it is important that the House continues with the inquiry that is currently underway. agreement in relation to the future of the Murray-Darling Basin. The point of agreement, which provides some element for common ground in this motion, is that there was a $10 billion plan built upon a series of principles. That plan firstly allocated almost $6 billion towards a once in a century re-plumbing of the irrigation efficiencies, the lining of dams, the lining of channels, the movement from flood irrigation to either centre or inline pivot irrigation or even drip irrigation where appropriate. This once in a century re-plumbing of the basin has largely been stalled under the current government, mostly for ideological reasons. I know this because I have worked with the farmers of Coleambally and the Murray irrigation area up and down the river. They sought access to that funding for re-plumbing rural Australia to make real savings that could be shared between the farmers as a benefit for their investment and the river environment through an efficiency dividend for the public. For example, the Murray irrigation area offered a saving of 300 billion litres, which would have been of great assistance-real, tangible and ongoing on an annual basis-to the people of South Australia. This would have been a saving of approximately $3,000 per megalitre for permanent entitlements through upgrading their infrastructure and investing in on-farm and inter-farm savings. That was rejected out of hand by Senator Wong on the basis that she was not willing to have public money going to perceived private investment. In fact, the benefits would have been public. It was an ideological betrayal of the plan, with the net effect of preventing permanent water savings that could have benefited farmers, our food security and our food productivity. This water could have been of assistance to downstream communities for MAIN COMMITTEE",242,Private Members Business
284,Mr Hunt (Flinders) (11.59 Am),"There is much agreement and there are areas of distheir environment or other things in South Australia. But it was forgone. It is time that the government returned to this notion of a once in a century re-plumbing of rural Australia. The bulk of the funding-the $10 billion-was set aside. The second great point in this debate is in relation to the buybacks. What we did was set aside almost $6 billion for reinvestment in rural infrastructure and a once in a century replumbing of rural Australia, $1.5 billion for buybacks and $1.5 billion for structural adjustment. In addition, there was a billion dollars set aside for, among other things, upgrading the capacity of the Bureau of Meteorology in flood measurement. That amount has been distorted greatly, with all of the emphasis going onto buying out our food security and our farmers at a time of great vulnerability. What was have seem is that the project has been inverted. In particular, the Basin Plan, the direction of which we supported, proposed and created, was distorted when the minister of the day gave riding instructions to the committee of that day and when the authority produced a report in line with the riding instructions from the current Prime Minister and the previous minister. When rural Australia revolted, the government dropped the authority like a hot spud. That is the reality of what happened. That is exactly what happened. We know because we have dealt with the people involved. We know that they were acting on riding instructions. We know that the promise that Julia Gillard made to the people of Adelaide through the front page of the Adelaide Advertiser at the start of August during the election campaign to adopt holus bolus everything that the authority recommended was nothing more than a deception. Let me deal with the last point. The last point is that right now we are seeing a practical failure of policy. There is a flood pulse going past South Australian irrigators, who are on perhaps two-thirds of their allocation. I have discussed this with our agriculture spokesperson, with Senator Joyce and with Senator Birmingham. We hope that the South Australian members of this parliament, no matter their political persuasion, will agree that, where there is a flood pulse that will otherwise go out to sea and given that the Lower Lakes are full, that flood pulse should be harvestable by South Australian irrigators up to the full level of their entitlement. That is a statement that I am making before the parliament. That should be harvestable. It is something on which we seek bipartisan agreement. has expired. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. Foreign Ownership of Agricultural Land and Agribusiness Debate resumed, on motion by Mr John Cobb: That this House: (1) requires the responsible Minister to: (a) commission the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS), with the assistance of ABARE, to prepare an information database on the foreign ownership of agricultural land and agribusiness, which should: (i) show the level of foreign ownership for Australia as a whole, by state and for key regions, and for particular agribusinesses; (ii) include an annual formal statistical release; and MAIN COMMITTEE",243,Private Members Business
285,The Deputy Speaker ( Mr S Sidebottom),"Order! The time allotted for this debate(iii) recommend what steps need to be taken to establish and maintain a public register of foreign ownership of agricultural land and agribusiness; (b) task the Productivity Commission, on the receipt of the initial ABS data, to: (i) review foreign ownership of agricultural land and agribusiness, with an evaluation of its contribution to the national interest in terms of economic development, food and water security, and agricultural sustainability; and (ii) recommend how the foreign investment policy on agricultural land and agribusiness should be modified, if necessary, to ensure the optimum outcomes for economic development and the national interest, including whether the Government needs to: lower the threshold for notification to the Foreign Investment Review Board for rural land and agribusiness acquisitions; introduce a national interest test for food security; and ensure that foreign entities do not establish monopoly or near monopoly positions in key sectors. (2) commit to establishing a Joint Parliamentary Committee to consider the information provided by the ABS, ABARE and the, Productivity Commission, taking into account public concern in this area. in Australia and in Australian agriculture, that of foreign ownership of agribusiness and agricultural land. The debate very much centres on the fact that, in recent times, deregulation and other issues have meant that what used to be foreign investment-which has been very good for Australian agriculture both in land and in agribusiness-has become foreign takeover of agriculture and agribusiness in particular. While currently we export the majority of produce from broadacre agriculture, we are very much dependent on domestic production for much-in fact, most-of our food. For example, 98 per cent of fresh fruit and vegetables bought and eaten by Australian consumers are grown in our country. The fact that the world population will grow from around 6½ billion to nine billion by 2050 gives a different outlook on it. If you understand that other countries are already preparing for tighter food supply by strategically buying into agricultural supply chains around the world; and if you take into account the fact that the new giants of the economic world, India and China, and the sleeping giant, Brazil-which is no longer asleep-now have money to invest around the world, you start to realise that, over the past five years or so, food security has become an international issue. Global companies as well as nations themselves are very aware of the need to secure their supply lines. Today, countries that once did not have money for foreign investment now do. If you couple that with a tenfold increase in reported foreign investment in the agricultural sectors over the last three years or so since Labor have been government, you begin to see the nature of the problem. As I said, foreign investment has been good for agriculture. In fact, it has been great for building the industry that we now have. However, in recent times, Labor have continued to cut spending on agriculture, cutting R&D, biosecurity and other programs, giving Australian investors less confidence than they once had to invest in their own industry. In this environment, there has been a marked change in activity by foreign companies-from investment in agriculture to ownership and control of supply lines. Look at Viterra and Cargill in the grain industry, Swift in the meat industry and National Foods in the dairy industry. There has been MAIN COMMITTEE",244,Private Members Business
286,Mr John Cobb (Calare) (12.04 Pm),"I rise today to speak on an issue of major concernSingaporean investment in the timber industry. There is the proposed takeover of the rice industry in the member for Riverina’s electorate, in which it basically rests. Many farming industries-for example, dairy, with the buyout of cooperatives-have found out that the short-term financial gain to individual members is outweighed by long-term impacts such as reduced farm-gate prices through loss of market power and/or loss of competition. While the decision comes down to individual companies and their investors or grower shareholders, farmers should recognise that, once they lose majority control, the focus of these operations will shift to the interests of the overseas shareholders. With these factors as outlined, it is evident that we need to look at our food security in a way we have not done before. The current rules for foreign investment are outdated and do not address the issue of food security. The $231 million trigger for a review by the Foreign Investment Review Board for agricultural investments is almost never triggered because, obviously, there are almost no farms in Australia that make that much. If we do not put in place sensible safeguards, it will be difficult for governments to manage foreign ownership to ensure that our food security interests are looked after in the future. Even when it comes to agribusiness, the $231 million trigger is, most often, not activated. That is why the coalition has tabled a notice of motion outlining a comprehensive policy approach to the issue. The notice of motion will task the Australian Bureau of Statistics and the Australian Bureau of Resource Economics to gather and clarify information on foreign investment in agribusiness and agricultural land and then task the Productivity Commission with a review to recommend safeguards for national food security interests by evaluating not only individual investment but also the cumulative impact of foreign ownership-in other words, what do you put together to create a trigger mechanism of $231 million or whatever might be appropriate? A parliamentary committee could then consider the recommendations. The government has been asleep at the wheel on this issue. Now the Gillard government has released plans for yet another review of foreign ownership. But what the governmentand, I believe, the minister-is not looking at is the agribusiness side of this. Agricultural land is the land that pulls at the heartstrings of Australians. Australians do not want to see the farm being sold off. In actual fact, agribusiness is the much bigger issue at this time. You cannot take the farm overseas, or the water that it uses, but you can take the productivity overseas. We need better information on the levels of foreign ownership of agribusiness and agricultural land. We need a national test for food security on foreign investments examined by the Foreign Investment Review Board. We need to be aware that the level of investment examined by the review board nearly always allows agriculture to fall under the level. The board needs to be able to look at the cumulative impact, as I said earlier. It does not really matter whether or not you are in agribusiness or in agriculture. Think about the reason agribusiness is so important in this issue. Picture yourself as a foreign investor from a land that is probably nowhere near as tough as Australia is about what agriculture cannot do-what a farmer cannot do. If you come from China, India or Brazil and you have money to spend, are you going to buy 1,000, 2,000 or 3,000 farms to ensure your supply line, having to deal with the myriad regulations that Australia puts on farmers-what you can clear, what you can do with water, what you can do with chemicals and all those things we do in a very exacting degree? Are you going to live with that and try to run those 1,000, 2,000 or 3,000 farms? Almost certainly you will not. You will go and buy the agribusiness, like SunMAIN COMMITTEE Rice in the case of the rice industry and like the abattoirs who do the killing for meat, or like the grain trader. You will go and buy the trader, the processor or the wholesaler, because you still have your supply lines and you do not have to run the farm. Agribusiness is the real issue here. Yes, they can buy agriculture, and there is a limit to what we would want to see in foreign hands, but the much bigger issue here is the extent to which the businesses who actually process, who actually trade and who actually export are in foreign hands. As I said earlier, we have moved from foreign investment to the foreign takeover of Australian agribusiness. As time goes on this will become a bigger issue, because they do not only buy. Potentially, once a global company or a company with a national bent that wants to protect either its global supply lines or its national supply lines buys one of our companies with a history of selling around the world, it has bought not only the supply line but potentially the customers. If the company wants to switch the supply from an Australian farm to another farm somewhere around the world, it can do it. So it does not only affect what we own; it affects our ability to sell. Dr LEIGH (Fraser) (12.15 pm)-An iron law of populism is that, while Australian businesspeople investing abroad are portrayed as job-creating entrepreneurs, foreign investors in our country are depicted as rapacious robber barons. And so it is with the latest campaign against foreign investment. As sometimes happens, the campaign started in the tabloids. Under headlines such as ‘Chinese buying up our farms’, ‘It’s time to stop selling off the farm’, and ‘It’s time to save our farms from foreign investors’, News Ltd tabloids have recently embarked upon a fear campaign against foreign investment in Australian agriculture. With anecdotes taking the place of statistics, foreign investment has been described by the tabloids as ‘a dramatic global land grab’, fed by ‘a looming global food shortage’. Most ironic about the recent tabloid campaign against foreign ownership in agriculture is the fact that the newspapers responsible are themselves owned by US citizen Rupert Murdoch. Indeed, if a campaign were to be waged against foreign ownership in the media industry, you would expect these newspapers to be among the first to describe it as economic populism. It is funny what happens when the pitchfork is in the other hand. Now, the opposition appears to have decided to jump on the populist bandwagon. After a few months in which members of the frontbench have questioned the need for a floating exchange rate, an independent Reserve Bank and a migration policy that does not discriminate by religion, it is perhaps no surprise that the opposition is tempted to campaign against foreigners buying our farms-not surprising, but odd all the same. After all, Australia’s agricultural sector has benefited substantially from foreign investment. In 1855, British investors helped kick-start our local sugar production industry when they established CSR, originally Colonial Sugar Refinery. In 1877, American firm Schweppes opened its first Australian factory-as did Kraft and Kellogg’s in the 1920s. Japanese investment in Australia’s beef cattle sector has been important since the 1970s. Today, the largest foreign investors in Australia are still Britain and the United States. As a resource rich nation, Australia has traditionally looked abroad to fill the investment gap. On one estimate, one in eight workers is employed by a foreign owned firm. If we were to ban all foreign investment tomorrow, wages would fall and unemployment would rise. An Australia without foreign investment would also risk missing out on the latest overseas knowMAIN COMMITTEE how. From technology adoption to business practices, foreign firms can often help spur innovation by changing the way that things are done. In moving this motion, the member for Calare expresses concern over the risks to Australia of ‘foreign investment’. Yet he has previously spoken in favour of greater investment in Australian agriculture. On the floor of this parliament, he has repeatedly called for more investment in the forestry sector, more investment in farm productivity, more investment in agricultural research, more investment in new plant varieties, more investment in rural telecommunications and more investment in rural infrastructure. What he seems to fail to realise is that investment is not a magic pudding. Restricting foreign investment in agriculture will result in less investment in agriculture, and that is bad news for people who are employed by a foreign owned firm or who might have otherwise been employed by a foreign owned firm that is deterred from coming here. Of course, while Australian investors are playing a role in our economy, our agribusinesses are creating jobs in other countries too. In countries like New Zealand, Papua New Guinea and Singapore, Australian firms are helping to show local companies a new way of doing business. In the process, Australia’s overseas investors are helping to raise living standards in those countries. As the mover of the motion presumably knows, Australia has long had restrictions on foreign investment. Formalised by the Whitlam government in 1975, the national interest test applies to a wide range of investment classes across the economy. The Foreign Investment Review Board, or FIRB, must approve foreign investment that exceeds 15 per cent where the firm is worth $231 million or more. In the case of real estate, nonresidents cannot buy existing properties and FIRB must sign off any time a temporary resident wishes to buy property. Importantly, FIRB has had a veto right over any investment by a foreign government, including farms. In addition, banks, media outlets, airports, Qantas and Telstra are subject to special rules. FIRB can reject applications outright or provide an approval subject to particular conditions. In thinking about how strict our foreign investment review processes should be, it is useful to look at how other developed countries operate. While any such comparison is obviously limited, work by the OECD’s Takeshi Koyama and Stephen Golub suggests that Australia’s foreign investment review regime is at least as stringent as, perhaps more so than, the approach that prevails in the typical developed country. For decades Australia’s economic policymakers have recognised that our nation’s prosperity relies on being enmeshed with the world. Since the time of white settlement, immigration and trade have been a part of Australia’s social fabric. Australia has been engaged with our region and the globe and this engagement has helped to shape our society-a nation in which one-quarter of the population are born overseas and exports make up one-fifth of the economy. Integral to an outward-looking Australia must be an appreciation that well-regulated foreign investment brings significant benefits to Australia. Lastly, I cannot help mentioning the issue of food security. It is one of those slippery phrases that people seem to invoke when they do not want to say precisely what they mean. SinceI have not seen anyone, including the shadow minister for agriculture and food security, being clear about this, let me hazard a guess at two possible explanations. One possibility is that when people say that we need to ensure food security they mean we need to ensure that if MAIN COMMITTEE Australia were cut off from the rest of the world we would not starve. Given that Australia continued to trade with other countries even during the depths of World War II, this is a bit like worrying about whether Dubbo has a plan to protect against tidal waves. But, in case anyone is wondering, the answer is yes. Australia sells more food to the rest of the world than it buys from the rest of the world. So if we were to be cut off from the rest of the world we would not starve. The other possibility is that food security means we need to make sure that agricultural prices do not go up and down. It is certainly true that in recent years food prices have been unusually volatile. For example, since 2007 some world food commodity prices have doubled, halved and doubled again. Economists are not sure why, but possible explanations include climate change, increasing meat consumption throughout the world, biofuel subsidies and a reduction in food stockpiles. In some developing countries there is a real concern that changing food prices will push people into starvation. For Australia the effects are more modest, but you can still see them in the data. For example, in 2006 food prices grew about four per cent faster than the prices of other goods. In 2010 the reverse was true: food prices grew about one per cent slower than the prices for other goods. People sometimes make the mistake of thinking that if we imported no food this volatility in food prices would disappear. That is wrong. Australian food prices also move when world prices change because Australian farmers sell into the world market. So, to insulate ourselves from volatility in world food prices, we not only need to stop importing food; we need to stop exporting food. I do not hear anyone calling for that. My fear is that, for at least some people, food security is merely code for a return to protectionism, which would be a great mistake. By all means, let Australia produce the foodstuffs that suit our land and our skills. But it does entrepreneurs and workers no favours to encourage Australian agriculture to expand into areas that do not suit our geography and our talents. There are plenty of challenges facing Australian agriculture. But, while Labor are focusing on water reform in the Murray-Darling Basin and addressing climate change, the coalition’s plan is to defer water buybacks and pretend that climate change does not exist. At the same time, the shadow agriculture minister is moving a private member’s motion aimed at reducing investment in Australian agriculture. It might feel good to pander to populism, but let us not pretend that it is helping farmers. the parliament which they claim to be important but cannot organise speakers to speak on those motions. That shows the level of support they have in thinking about a vision for the future of agriculture in Australia, as my honourable friend the previous speaker has said. I hope the member for Calare has discovered who the responsible minister is that he is directing the motion to, because when I looked at his motion that seemed to be something else that he did not understand. I am aware there are some community concerns, as you would be, Mr Deputy Speaker Sidebottom, regarding foreign investment in Australian agricultural land and businesses. Australia has well-established arrangements under which foreign investments are examined. This is not something that just happens. The Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act 1975 empowers the Treasurer to examine all significant investment proposals in Australian businesses by foreign interests to ensure they are not contrary to the Australian national interest. Based on MAIN COMMITTEE",245,Private Members Business
287,Mr Adams (Lyons) (12.24 Pm),"The opposition are in disarray: they bring motions tothose examinations, the Treasurer can reject or impose conditions on proposals that are considered to be contrary to Australia’s national interests. That is as it should be. All foreign governments, their agencies or state owned enterprises must notify the Foreign Investment Review Board and receive an approval before making a direct investment in Australia, whether it is for $1 or $1 billion. The government has already made important improvements in the foreign investment framework that are very much in the national interest. When you look at the supply chain in agricultural industries you will see that there is a lot of foreign money in that supply chain. As you would be aware, Mr Deputy Speaker, National Foods had some difficulties with its suppliers in the milk industry in Tasmania a year or so ago. A Japanese company with Japanese capital took over that company, and they are going through other changes. I wish them well in that and I hope they continue to invest in our milk industry, in processing, in Tasmania because we need that capital. You cannot expand without capital in your supply chain. I do not know if Mr Cobb is saying that we do not need any foreign investment in any of our industries. Go and have a look at the car industry. Go and have a look at our mining industry. We raise capital from all over the world; that is how our systems work. So it is difficult to see where Mr Cobb is coming from, other than just trying to make a political point, I suppose, around National Party branch meetings and stirring up some of their members out in the bush to say that the country is going to be overrun by foreign money. Mr Simpkins interjecting Mr Simpkins interjectingto the chair. out without any vision, without looking to the future. I think we all realise on the government side that there are national interest principles to improve transparency around how the national interest test is applied and an easy-to-read version of the policy to further improve the transparency of the regime. I think that is important. Of course there will be concern. As I said when I started these words, of course there is concern. People do not want overseas capital coming in and buying great tracts of Australia. They need to know about that. We need to have a process that allows them to see that. That will occur under this Labor government. It did not occur under governments where the National Party held ministerial positions or the deputy prime ministership. I guess that is why they are getting a bit toey and why they have to try to justify their existence with motions like this one. The Australian government, like previous governments, is committed to a case-by-case approach to considering foreign investment proposals to maximise investment flows while protecting our core interests. Using the capital in the interests of the nation is what it is about, and we need to make sure that we do that. I was looking only recently in Tasmania at the irrigation schemes coming on board with state and federal money to help enhance our rural sector and to help us go in new directions and find new ways. But, in that sense, it takes opportunities to borrow money. I was looking at what the Tasmanian Institute of Agricultural Research had to MAIN COMMITTEE",249,Private Members Business
288,Mr Adams,Are you one of those who go around doing that?,250,Private Members Business
289,The Deputy Speaker ( Mr S Sidebottom),Order! I remind members that you speak,250,Private Members Business
290,Mr Adams,"He used to be the editor of a newspaper running the same line, churning itsay. It said that in Tasmania we grow around $1 billion of our current food, fibre and poppies. It says that for the industry to expand it will require financial resources. Of course it will. There are only two ways that that can occur. That is either by debt into the industry or equity through investment, houses and corporate agriculture. Some of that might be foreign money that comes into the agricultural sector like it comes into the processing sector or the mining industry. So to expand we will need money. We need money to do that. Those points are very good. Those points, when we talk about looking at a case-by-case approach to considering foreign investment proposals, are what it is all about. Investment flows need to be looked at and so does protecting our core interests. Given the long standing success of the foreign investment screening regime, we on this side of the House see no reason to change it by placing blanket bans or restrictions on particular types of investment. The government welcomes foreign investment. It has helped build the Australian economy and will continue to enhance the well-being of Australians by supporting economic growth and prosperity, as it has done in the honourable member for Riverina’s seat. I do not know who owns some of the production and supply chains within his electorate. It might be interesting for him to tell us. I am sure he is well aware of who they are. That economic growth and prosperity will continue with investment. We need to make sure that we look at it, that the general public can have a good understanding of how it operates and that we have transparency around that so that we do not have hysteria whipped up by the National Party for their own political interests. Thousands of rural and regional communities around Australia whose economies rely on agriculture and food production benefit greatly by foreign investment. I do not think we would want to see international sources of support for the bush discouraged or threatened. At times we need to have foreign capital to assist our industries to grow. As I said, in Tasmania we are certainly looking for new investment. We just lost McCain’s at a processing plant in the Smithton area. We are looking for the ways in which we will process our food into the future. We need to be sensible about this and go forward in a proper manner. (Time expired) breach in place of the member for Forrest, who was in the main chamber speaking about an issue very important to the coalition’s heart-the youth allowance and the Social Security Amendment (Income Support for Regional Students) Bill 2010 [2011]-which has been most unfairly dealt with by this Labor government, who do not have a great appreciation or respect for regional areas. Given the fact that she cannot be in two places at once, I am stepping in for the member for Forrest to give her speech on this motion about foreign ownership of land. The member for Forrest says that, in seconding this motion, she does not automatically oppose foreign ownership of agricultural land in Australia but she does oppose the foreign acquisition of Australian rural land in secret or by stealth. Her office has tried on numerous occasions to compile information on foreign ownership of agricultural land in Australia and has been continually told that that there is no comprehensive source of this information. The other problem that it has encountered is that agricultural land is not separately reported by the Foreign Investment Review Board, which classifies agriculture, forestry and fishing into one category. The member for Forrest notes with interest the 2010 announcement that the Australian Bureau of Statistics, in conjunction with the AustraMAIN COMMITTEE",250,Private Members Business
291,Mr Mccormack (Riverina) (12.35 Pm),"I thank the member for Lyons for filling thelian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics, ABARE, would survey the foreign ownership of agricultural land. As the ABS identifies in its explanatory document: Currently there is very little information available on the level of foreign ownership of agricultural businesses, land and water rights within Australia. Therefore the ABS proposes to collect data on the following: Direct foreign ownership of agricultural businesses in Australia Direct foreign ownership of agricultural land in Australia Direct foreign ownership of water rights (used for agricultural purposes) in Australia This proposal is to be commended. Under the current regime, a foreign purchase of agricultural land or business has to exceed a $231 million threshold before the Foreign Investment Review Board must be notified. The current debate on foreign ownership requires accurate data on foreign ownership of rural land and agribusiness. At a Senate Select Committee on Agricultural and Related Industries hearing last year, the Foreign Investment Review Board confirmed that it is possible that a foreign entity could go down to the Murrumbidgee River today and buy every property and not even trigger the interest of their board. That is a reflection on this parliament. The world population is expected to grow from around six billion today to over nine billion by 2050, with Australia alone set to increase its population by between 35 and 40 million by 2056. With this population growth, cities and urban development will continue to take up more and more of the prime agricultural land. This is of particular concern to the member for Forrest, as a food producer. Given the future challenges of feeding the world, it is vitally important for Australia to have accurate records of who is buying and acquiring our foodproducing agricultural land and precious water resources. This motion is necessary to guide the foreign affairs and trade negotiations of Australia’s future. One of the threats faced by our agricultural sector, if we get this policy wrong, is that of a worsening of an already uneven playing field in world trade. We must avoid situations where foreign owned farms are being granted access into markets that are denied to Australian producers or where Australian farmers and investors are being priced out of the market. We must also be aware of the closed loop-where a foreign entity or quasi government owned entity buys up tracts of food-producing land and water and restricts the sale or provision of that produce to their own market. There has been a change in focus from foreign investment to foreign ownership and, as a result, many farming industries-for example, dairy with the buy-out of cooperatives-have found that the short-term financial gain to individual members is outweighed by long-term impacts such as reduced farm gate prices though loss of market power. The Daily Telegraph reported in November last year that foreign investors have snapped up $10 billion of Australia’s prime agricultural land and rural enterprises ‘and no-one is keeping watch’. It also stated: Australia, with its rich and fertile land and sophisticated farming techniques, is a target for some of the world’s biggest agricultural enterprises. This is further reasoning that it is time to consider greater supervision of rural land and water sales to overseas interests. In conclusion, I repeat that this motion is not about banning foreign MAIN COMMITTEE ownership; it is about protecting Australia’s sovereignty and food security by including our agricultural and water resources on the radar of the Foreign Investment Review Board. has expired.

Violence in Western Sahara Debate resumed on motion by Ms Saffin: That the House: (1) notes that the Government: (a) deeply regrets recent reports of violence in Western Sahara, and allegations of human rights violations with respect to Western Sahara; (b) urges parties to uphold international human rights standards, and to maintain their resolve to work peacefully through these issues in the United Nations led process currently underway; (c) strongly supports the efforts of the United Nations to find an enduring and mutually acceptable settlement in relation to Western Sahara; (d) welcomes progress made during the third round of informal talks here on 8-9 November in New York between Morocco and the Polisario Front, facilitated by the United Nations Secretary General’s Personal Envoy Christopher Ross, including agreement to further informal talks later in 2010; (e) calls on the parties to continue to work through these issues in the United Nations process underway; and (f) hopes the next round of informal talks, scheduled for December 2010, will make further progress; and (2) fully supports: (a) the efforts of the United Nations Secretary General, his Special Envoy, and the United Nations to find an enduring settlement to the Western Sahara issue; and (b) these concerns, calls, hopes and actions. Ms SAFFIN (Page) (12.40 pm)-I rise to talk about an issue to do with Western Sahara. What preceded this motion was violence that took place towards the end of last year. In speaking to this motion, what I want to put on the record is the general issue of Western Sahara and the Saharawi people. It is a matter that the United Nations is seized with, through the Security Council-it is that serious-and the Fourth Committee of the United Nations General Assembly, which deals with decolonisation. The Western Sahara is Africa’s last colony. I have worked alongside the people of Western Sahara and their representatives, including Kamal Fadel, their representative since the late-nineties, to give support to their right to a selfdetermining process as supported through and by the United Nations through Security Council resolutions. When I was a young law student-it was quite some years ago-and I studied international law, I was first introduced to Western Sahara and studied the case that was brought before the International Court of Justice for an advisory opinion. It made it clear that the Moroccan occupation was illegal. There is further legal opinion from the United Nations Office of Legal Affairs that the exploitation of oil is also illegal, and it follows that the exploitation of any natural of any natural resource would be as well. MAIN COMMITTEE",251,Private Members Business
292,The Deputy Speaker ( Mr S Georganas),"Order! The time allotted for this debateThe Kingdom of Morocco’s occupation and behaviour has been described as obstructionist regarding the referendum. The UN has been trying to carry out a referendum for years, but it has still not happened. The Saharawi agreed, through their representative body, the Polisario, that they would have a referendum. It is unacceptable and unsustainable that this behaviour by Morocco continues. It would be better if it were done in an orderly way and in step with international law and the international community through the United Nations. With Morocco being in the occupying position, they can become the peacemakers and the ones that facilitate the prompt holding of a referendum of self-determination. WhatI would like to see is the immediate and unconditional release of all Saharawi political detainees and the accounting of the disappeared; the lifting of the blockade imposed on the territory to allow access to it by independent observers and media, ensuring their freedom of movement and communication with the Saharawi; respect of the basic human rights of the Saharawi people; and the immediate end of the plundering of natural resources in Western Sahara. To the United NationsI would like to say this: dispatch immediately an independent international mission to the territory to investigate the events that took place at the Izik camp and expand the mandate of the United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara-MINURSO-to include the protection, monitoring and reporting of human rights in Western Sahara. I visited the camps that people are talking about some years back. There are people who have been displaced out of the country of Western Sahara and they live in camps in Algeria. I went to Tindouf and travelled out to the camps, where a whole lot of people live. They are people in exile, people who are displaced from their homeland and want to go back-and, for people who are in exile, it can be very trying. I spent four days there. The Saharawi, through the Polisario and through their government, the SADR, are a member of the African Union. The matter is seized by the United Nations. There are over 80 countries that formally recognise and have relationships with Western Sahara. It is one of those matters that we can take quite a good stand on. partisan basis the motion presented by the member for Page. I have great respect for the member for Page, even though she may be misguided in her political orientation. I know that she has worked in the human rights field. I understand that in relation to Western Sahara in particular she has worked with my great friend Andrew MacLeod, now the director of the Committee for Melbourne. This is an important, real and profound issue. I want to address three elements in relation to this motion: firstly, the issue of the Universal Declaration on Human Rights and our abiding responsibilities; secondly, the course of history and the events that are currently sweeping North Africa and the Middle East; and, thirdly, the specifics about the action that is necessary to redress the wrongs that are currently occurring in Western Sahara. Dealing with the first issue, we on both sides of this chamber are subscribers to, believers in and passionate upholders of the Universal Declaration on Human Rights. It dates back to the immediate postwar period. The rights that are contained within that declaration include freedom of speech, freedom of association and freedom of worship. They are the great ‘freedoms of’. Then there are the ‘freedoms from’: freedom from oppression, freedom from arbitrary detention and freedom from having one’s life taken by a state authority. These are abidMAIN COMMITTEE",253,Private Members Business
293,Mr Hunt (Flinders) (12.45 Pm),"It gives me great pleasure to rise and support on a biing and universal and I stand clearly and absolutely by the view that they are hungered for by people of all origins, whatever their race, ethnicity or circumstance. What we are seeing in the Middle East now has risen out of a deep folly. It is a deep folly, generally used by oppressors rather than by those who are subjected to oppression, to say, ‘We have local norms that mean that people do not hunger for democracy, independence or the basic rights set out within the Universal Declaration on Human Rights. That brings me to the great and historic events which are presently happening at this moment right across the Middle East. What has occurred in the last few days in Libya is a crime against humanity. Let us be absolutely clear that these crimes against humanity are building upon the waves of repression that have been in place for decades now. In Bahrain, there are deep and powerful questions to address. Right across the Middle East and North Africa, people are seeking the capacity to shape and control their own destinies. There will be challenges. In some cases, it is not certain whether the future is a drift towards a Tehran-style regime or towards the great success of our nearby neighbour Indonesia, which broke down the strongman regime of Suharto and democratised in a very effective way. There is a journey still to take there, but what we see is real and profound. That is the context. Against that context, Western Sahara has been suffering significant human rights abuses. We could put it in the hypothetical, but it is real. We know this. The reports internally and externally make it absolutely clear. That abuse is accompanied by a desire for a negotiated independence. We must stand by our principles. There is no doubt about that. That is who we are as a country; that is what we believe in as a country; that is what we must stand for as a country. I think there are two significant steps which must be taken in Western Sahara. The first is to ensure that, in light of the abuses which have occurred from November last year, on top of historic injustice, there must be an independent UN verification mission. We are in agreement across the chamber on that point. This verification and monitoring mission must examine and, if necessary, compile reports which may lead to higher prosecutions through the international tribunals. That is the least that we can do. We must push for that. More generally, there must be an ongoing human rights international commission in place in Western Sahara. That will be the strongest bulwark against abuse whilst we seek a long-term resolution. I commend this motion to the House. Page for her motion on violence in Western Sahara. From my research on this, I know it is a very sad situation that has been going on for a number of years. It is very regrettable to hear of the recent reports of violence apparently conducted by the Moroccan security forces, who were supposed to be providing security and safe haven for people. It shows an astonishing lack of goodwill given the ongoing negotiations which are seeking to resolve this conflict. This conflict has been going on since 1975, when this former Spanish colony was annexed by Morocco, and it is now one of the longest running territorial disputes in Africa. It is apparent from the reports and pictures that have emerged that the residents were shocked at the excessive force used against them by the Moroccan security forces. The result of the chaos that ensued was an eruption of violent clashes in the streets of the capital of the region, between the outmanned residents and the disproportionate force of the Moroccan military forces.

294,Mr Van Manen (Forde) (12.50 Pm),"I would like to start by thanking the member forence movement, has been quoted as saying the security forces had used brutal force in trying to break up the camp. This motion rightly calls for all parties involved, in particular the Moroccan security forces-no doubt instructed by the Moroccan government-to show restraint and recognise and honour the inherent human rights of the citizens of this region and continue to work constructively and peacefully to a resolution that allows the citizens of the Western Sahara region to have a say in their future. Everyone in this region has a right to feel that their life is not at risk. They should have freedom of speech, of association and all the other freedoms that we enjoy. They also should not be subject to torture or to cruel, inhuman, degrading treatment or punishments. We call on the Moroccan security forces to ensure that they are respecting these rights and the UN and the international community to hold them to account if they are not. We encourage and continue to support the United Nations efforts to find an enduring and mutually acceptable settlement for this region. In order to achieve this, the views of all parties involved-the Moroccan government, Frente Polisario and others-need to be taken into account. In particular, the views of the citizens of this region need to be taken into account, as they are the ones who will need to live with whatever political outcome is negotiated. It is heartening to note that the fifth round of the United Nations backed informal talks between Morocco and the independence movement ended on 23 January 2011. The talks were conducted over three days and were also attended by delegations from various neighbouring states. The UN communique issued following the talks advised that the discussion had taken place in an atmosphere of ‘serious engagement, frankness and mutual respect’. However, disappointingly, each party continued to reject any proposals of the others as the sole basis for future negotiations. The parties have agreed to continue their discussions in March. It is heartening to note that there are recent reports that significant progress is being made by the UNHCR in their efforts to reunite separated families, some who have been separated for more than 35 years. This program has been run by the UNHCR for the past six years and has successfully reunited approximately 13,000 people out of a list of more than 40,000. We fully support the ongoing efforts of the United Nations and its agencies including Christopher Ross and urge all parties to continue the progress that is being made towards a positive resolution of this conflict. I commend the motion. It is a great first step in terms of getting an idea out there into the Australian community. Perhaps it could be a little strongly worded but it is a good first step. I also thank the members for Flinders and Forde for their contributions in the chamber. As I am sure you well know, Mr Deputy Speaker Georganas, Western Sahara is the size of Great Britain. It is rich in mineral resources including things like phosphates and iron ore and has rich fishing grounds off its coast. More importantly, it has great potential for oil and gas reserves, and there, I guess, lies one of its problems. It has great potential and, as we all know, when something has value people throughout history have tended to fight over those values, and we can trace its history back as a Spanish colony, to the time it was invaded by Morocco in 1975. MAIN COMMITTEE",255,Private Members Business
295,Mr Perrett (Moreton) (12.55 Pm),"I commend the member for Page for this motion.I started teaching geography back in 1986. Even then there were parts of the atlas that still had cross-hatching, showing that this was a non self-governing territory, and every year since 1975, I suppose, it has been discussed by the UN in terms of how the area could be decolonised. The Frente Polisario waged an independence war against the Moroccan invaders until the UN brokered a ceasefire in 1991. The truce included the promise of a referendum where there would be some self-direction, but that has not happened, unfortunately largely due to Morocco’s obstruction. The Sahrawi Republic declared by the Polisario in 1976 has been recognised, however, by over 80 governments and it is a full member of the African Union. Morocco and the Polisario held four rounds of formal UN sponsored peace talks in 2007 and 2008, but they broke down in acrimony, unfortunately, due to Morocco’s refusal to even discuss the option of independence as one of the alternatives to be put to the people. In my electorate we have a lot of Sudanese constituents so I have seen the joy that has come since the referendum where they had nearly 99 per cent support in one part of the Sudan for self-determination for an independent country. I look forward to 9 July when that new country will be formed, and so many of my Sudanese constituents will be so happy about that process. Unfortunately, it is not the case for Western Sahara. Since these discussions in 200708 there have been three rounds of informal talks, the last held in New York in November 2010. But still there has not been a great deal of movement on the 35-year-old dispute. There were further talks in January but we are yet to see a resolution. As one of the co-conveners of the Parliamentary Amnesty International Group, I am particularly concerned-and the matter was touched on by the members for Flinders, Forde, and Page, I think, in their speeches-about the call for investigations into the deaths in the Western Sahara protest camps. Obviously, it is time that we called on the Moroccan authorities and put a spotlight on their behaviours so that we have an independent, trusted investigation into the events that led to a number of deaths and injuries at Gdaim Izik, a protest camp in Western Sahara. There are reports that nine people were killed including people from the security forces, and Amnesty International has received reports that camp residents were seen lying injured on the ground and some were bleeding and others had been burned. This obviously needs to be investigated. There are also suggestions that Sahrawi people were forcibly removed from the protest camp by Moroccan security forces. I quote from Malcolm Smart, who is Amnesty International’s director for the Middle East and North Africa. He says: This was clearly a very serious incident and one that threatens to fuel further tension in Western Sahara. This is the last thing that we need. He goes on to say: The Moroccan authorities must launch an immediate, independent inquiry and get to the bottom of what occurred and consider asking the UN to assist. For too long the UN has not fully engaged itself with this region and I think that is something that the UN needs to step up and change as quickly as possible.

296,The Deputy Speaker ( Mr S Georganas),"The time allotted for this debate has exCoptic Orthodox Community of Egypt Debate resumed on motion by Ms Vamvakinou: That this House: (1) condemns the New Year’s Day attack on the Al-Qiddissin Church, the Church of the Two Saints, in Alexandria, Egypt; (2) acknowledges the historical role of the Coptic Orthodox community of Egypt; (3) expresses its condolences to all victims of violence and terrorism; (4) reaffirms the Australian Government’s call for fundamental political reform in Egypt and the protection of the rights of all Egyptian citizens; and (5) recognises: (a) the contributions made by the Coptic Orthodox community of Australia under the leadership of His Grace Bishop Suriel of the Coptic Orthodox Church Diocese of Melbourne and Affiliated Regions; (b) the value and role of interfaith dialogue in building a diverse and harmonious society; and (c) the value of democratic rights and the right to freedom of religion and culture. Ms VAMVAKINOU (Calwell) (1.01 pm)-I bring this private member’s motion to the House because it goes to an issue of great concern to the Coptic community in Australia but also to the broader community both here and overseas. The House would be aware of the most recent violence against the Coptic community in Egypt. During a New Year’s Eve service marking the beginning of 2011, innocent members of Egypt’s Coptic community, while observing mass at the Al-Qiddissin Church, the Church of the Two Saints, in Alexandria, were violently attacked by a series of bombings that killed 23 people and wounded 80 others. This unprovoked attack against Coptic Christians came after a series of ongoing threats from extremist groups who do not value freedom of religion or human life. The violence shocked the international community and deeply disturbed our local Coptic community. Of course, this incident was not the first attack on the Coptic community in Egypt but it was one of the most devastating and fatal. The Coptic community of Egypt is the largest Christian community in the Middle East. Copts are very much the indigenous people of Egypt that trace their lineage back to the ancient Egyptians and belong to one of the earliest Christian churches, but today theirs is a minority religion in Egypt. The Coptic community here in Australia is significant in size. It began its migration following Egypt’s independence in 1953 and has continued to migrate here ever since. Coptic migration was characterised by an urban and highly educated people with skills and qualifications that fare better than those of the average population in Australia. The Coptic community continues to adhere strongly to its faith organised largely around the Coptic Church and has about 80,000 followers here in Australia. This is a devout and highly successful community and is now in its second and third generations. Coolaroo in my electorate is home to St Mary’s Coptic Orthodox College, which was officially opened by His Holiness Pope Shenouda III, Pope of Alexandria and Patriarch of the See of St Mark, in 1991. The school’s director, Father Tadros Sharobeam, has overseen the development of a thriving school dedicated to academic excellence within the principles of the Coptic Orthodox faith. The attacks on Copts in Egypt have drawn strong condemnation here in Australia from faith leaders in particular. I want to join with the Australian government and other members in MAIN COMMITTEE this place in condemning the killing of innocent people, and to say that religious persecution is the single most virulent threat to humanity and to world peace. It is therefore heartening to see the Muslim community both in Egypt and beyond standing together with their Coptic compatriots against those who threaten our stability and our humanity. The Egyptian newspaper al-Ahram in January this year reported that ‘Muslims turned up in droves for the Coptic Christmas mass Thursday night, offering their bodies and lives as shields to Egypt’s threatened Christian community’. The values underpinning orthodox belief systems are shared by humanity at large, including their Muslim compatriots, which only exacerbates the impact of what has happened because we can all, regardless of the faith or the beliefs we hold, share and feel the injustice of what has occurred. In calling for religious tolerance I would like to commend the leadership displayed by His Holiness Pope Shenouda III of Alexandria, who issued public statements during the crisis. I would like to quote from Pope Shenouda. He says: ‘Problems can be solved with steady, calm representation and not with violent action. The unity of Muslims and Christians against the terrorist acts and the spirit that was created between both groups was admirable. The solidarity between Muslims and Christian citizens is certainly invaluable.’ Fortunately, we do not have such persecution and discrimination against people on the basis of faith or ethnicity in this country. Here in this country we have built strong interfaith networks that underpin our own unique brand of multiculturalism. Our tolerance and our overall democratic way of life are our greatest assets and we have built cohesion and unity. Indeed, the Coptic community, like other migrant communities, have thrived and are a significant part of the Australian community. As such, I would also like to take the opportunity to commend the leadership of His Grace Bishop Suriel of the Coptic Orthodox Diocese of Melbourne and Affiliated Regions, who has been a strong advocate of ecumenism and interfaith understanding, leading his community with strength and compassion. The plight of Coptic Christians in Egypt serves as a reminder of how important it is for all of us to rise to the challenge and help build bridges through interfaith and intercommunity dialogue. It reminds us how important it is to protect minority rights and hose down the flames of community division. Whether or not multiculturalism can be extrapolated to other national and social contexts, this violent form of sectarianism must be opposed, with an end to all forms of religious discrimination and the promotion of democratic rights for all. (Time expired) I thank Father Abdelmalek of the church of St Mark and St George in Wanneroo for his assistance and guidance. It is certainly the case that sharia law in any form has no place in a modern society. It is a leftover of mediaeval days. The only laws of the modern age are laws passed by a democratically elected government of the people. This motion is about the vicious and cowardly attack on the Coptic Orthodox church of St Paul and St Peter on New Year’s Day at 12.20 am. This motion is about the murder of 24 innocent and peace-loving worshippers who were targeted by Islamic extremists following months of incitement by Islamic scholars who were allowed to air their hatred on television and evilly inspire murder in their vicious protests against the Coptic Church and Coptic Pope, His Holiness Pope Shenouda III.

It is always the way that corrupt government and increasingly irrelevant ideologies seek to shore up their positions by identifying scapegoats on which they can lay the blame for a multitude of political, economic and even religious failures. Egypt is exactly such an example. On 12 FebruaryI attended the Coptic Orthodox Church’s ecumenical prayer service at the Roman Catholic cathedral in Perth, St Mary’s. It was on the day that the President of Egypt finally stood down, and it would be true to say that the church held some hope for a better future in Egypt. Tragically, I do not see much cause to be hopeful of a better future. I understand that article 2 of the Egyptian constitution will remain in the new constitution, and it reads: ‘Islam is the religion of the state and Arabic is its official language. The principles of Islamic law are the principal source of legislation.’ And herein is the problem. I believe that a change to this article is fundamental to any reform and to safeguarding rights and freedom of religious worship. But such a change seems to be out of the question now, because it seems that the Muslim Brotherhood have hijacked the revolution and that they will see that Egypt remains an Islamic state, based on Islamic sharia law and dominated by a Sunni Muslim government. I cannot see a better future ahead for Egypt, because the fundamental changes, the reforms and the democracy necessary remain elusive. I attended that prayer service on 12 February, a day of such hope for the future, but just four days later, on the 16th, the church of St George in Rafah was attacked, being torched and graffitied with sayings such as ‘No to Christians in Muslim land’. On the next day, the 17th, Muslims attacked Christians inside the church of St Georges in the village of el-Hathatah. It has been reported that the attack was prompted by the church building a roof over the courtyard between the church and its community services building, within the fenced church compound, in order to make more space for the congregation. Muslims surrounded the church and hurled stones. The armed forces were called out but without response-another example of security forces failing to do their duty and to protect all their citizens equally. Nothing has really changed since President Mubarak left office. Religious persecution and intolerance remain institutionalised in Egypt. We have seen it in the constitution. We have seen it in the actions, or rather the inactions, of security forces. We also see it in the form of Egyptian identity cards that require the holder’s religion to be printed on them. The lack of action in identifying and prosecuting those who incite violence and those who commit violence against the Copts is evidence of the real need for fundamental change. There are more than 10 million Copts in Egypt-10 million out of around 80 million, as much as 18 per cent. That is no small number, no tiny group. It is a huge number of people who are crying out for their rights as citizens to be protected and for fundamental change that will revolutionise the laws, institutions and behaviours of authorities in Egypt. This motion is about expressing our condolences regarding the brutality and the violence, but it is also about expressing our condemnation of those acts and the persecution that continues every day in Egypt. I condemn those responsible for orchestrating and committing those atrocities. I condemn them for their genocide and their spiritual corruption that encourages attacks on the defenceless, but I believe that those who stand and do nothing are also worthy of my condemnation. Everyone has a right to their own religious faith, but no-one has the right to impose their own faith on others or to persecute those who do not follow the same faith. I will finish by quoting a speech from 12 February 2011 by the Coptic Orthodox priest in Perth, Father MAIN COMMITTEE Abraam Abdelmalek. He said of Australian politicians: ‘Australians have elected you to protect this country and its culture, not to please or fear certain groups of people who have a loud voice and want to demolish our Christian heritage.’ I think that is a lesson that we should heed. sisting me to be able to make this speech today. We have all seen the events in Egypt over the last month unfold before our eyes and on our TVs. We saw the people power of many young people, it seems, standing up for what they believe is right. This is inspirational in some ways, in no small part because of the known risk that these protesters took in challenging the established authority, the risk of beatings, imprisonment and even torture and death if they did not succeed. We have heard accounts of the protesters who knew that, if their revolution did not succeed, their lives would be in peril. If the established order continued to rule as it had, those protesters knew to expect the police force to quietly round them up, tracking them down through their communities and by other means in the months following the protests. Life and liberty were truly in the balance. As it happened, the protesters were successful in removing the old order. Those who expressed their desire to live with dignity, with their voice being heard, without fear or reprisal; those who said that oppression could not last; those who said that the abuse of civil liberties was totally unacceptable-those people have much to look forward to. But hundreds of thousands of Coptic Orthodox Christian Egyptians who have similarly endured the absence of human rights, who have been intimidated, have been beaten, have had private property destroyed and have even been gunned down in public for no other reason than exercising their religion, may not be as optimistic as many others over the last few weeks. Those who have fought and won under the banner of democracy and human rights must honour their victory by acknowledging and actively supporting the most fundamental of modern democratic tenets, the equal status of all citizens under the law. I have spoken before in this place on this subject. I have spoken on behalf of the fears and outrage of the Coptic Orthodox Christians living in and around my electorate of Hindmarsh and those further afield who are concerned by the persecution of Coptic Christians that has taken place in Egypt. Father Philoppos Y Boghdadi of Adelaide’s St Mary and Anba Bishoy Coptic Orthodox Church, in my electorate, and his congregation have had their representations to me echoed by media reports of almost unbelievable acts of violence upon their fellow Coptic Christians in Egypt. Any of us has been able to read of whole congregations-as we have heard previous speakers speak about-being attacked while worshipping in their churches and being put under siege by criminals hell-bent on slaughtering as many Coptic Christian Egyptians as they can. We saw during Christmas time the events that took place in Alexandria. Just before the Egyptian protests, the trial of one such murderous person had come to its conclusion. The crime in question was one of the very, very few that have gone all the way through the criminal justice system to conviction. Usually there has been no justice, there has been no application of law and there has been an absolute dearth of order. SoI would like through this motion for the parliament to acknowledge the atrocities that have taken place in Egypt against the Coptic Orthodox Christians over the years.

298,Mr Georganas (Hindmarsh) (1.11 Pm),"Madam Deputy Speaker, I thank you for ashope this parliament, through this and subsequent discussions and communications, communicates its support for the democratic, peaceful change that has been instigated by protestors to continue and to apply for the benefit of all Egyptians irrespective of their ethnicity, their gender or, especially in this case, their religion. I too join with others in this House and with the government in condemning the killings that have taken place over Christmas and at other times against the Coptic Orthodox Christians in Egypt. We know that the Christian community in Egypt is one of the oldest Christian communities in the world. In fact, monastic life was first founded in Egypt, in St Anthony’s monastery-which still exists today. (Time expired) on this motion, firstly for supporting the Orthodox Coptic Christians of Egypt, who represent one of the great and abiding religious traditions in this world today, and secondly for drawing attention to the broader challenges in Egypt and across the Middle East more generally. I will proceed as I did earlier in addressing the Western Sahara issue: by looking at a framework for analysing this, firstly in terms of religious freedom, secondly in terms of the evolution of events in the Middle East and North Africa and thirdly in terms of the specific harm, damage and mistreatment of the Orthodox Coptic Christians of Egypt. Let me begin with religious freedom. We stand resolutely and firmly as a political movement on my side and as a parliament on both sides for religious freedom, for religious tolerance and for freedom of worship, both in Australia and across the globe. That is who we are, that is where we stand and that is where we will stand. In that context, one of the great challenges we have seen in the Middle East-whether in the treatment of the southern Sudanese, who had a mixture of animist and Christian beliefs in a more broadly Islamic society, whether through the confessional process of Lebanon or whether through the divides between Israeli citizens and those who live in Gaza or Palestine and in the West Bank-the lack of religious tolerance has been an extraordinary issue. Right now, as we see, there is a great movement in the Middle East. As I noted earlier today, it is a movement whose end will not be certain. WhatI do know is this: firstly, the era of the strongman, authoritarian leader will progressively crumble. It will not be universal. It will not be immediate. Some states may fall. It may be that we see the fall of a Gaddafi in coming weeks. It may be that he lasts a lot longer. It may be that we see transition towards some form of constitutional democracy in Bahrain. But what we will see is the progressive, albeit imperfect, transition of the Middle East away from the strongman leader. What is uncertain is whether this will then lead to an outbreak of religious extremism if certain parties or movements gain control in any of these countries or whether it will lead to the triumph of what you might call the Google generation. There is no doubt that whilst the Muslim Brotherhood was a factor on the streets in Egypt, the Google generation-the aspiration of young people, the aspiration of not just the educated groups but of many of those who have been denied access to education-was the paramount force. The form which this future government will take is unknown. The form which other future governments in the Middle East will take is also unknown. That is where this motion plays such an important part. It is about the notion that we have to foster and support plural society in terms of acceptance of different ethnicity, acceptance of different race and acceptance, in particular, of different religious groupings within the Middle East.

299,Mr Hunt (Flinders) (1.16 Pm),"Madam Deputy Speaker Vamvakinou, I congratulate youWe have a role, but let us not overstate our role and overreach, because we can do damage if we overreach. Our role, in my view, is to set the ground work-to be part of a broader international coalition which talks about religious freedom and accepting difference, accepting tolerance, accepting that there will be diversity within these states. The origins of many of these states date back to the decolonisation period post the First World War and, more generally, post the Second World War. In order to protect the Coptics in Egypt, we have to do all that we can to establish a climate, a culture, where there is an acceptance of diversity and difference and where there is, above all else, celebration of diversity and difference. The Egyptian Coptics have been treated badly, but they have hope under the new state and we must do all that we can through activities such as this to lend them and the new Middle East our support. has expired. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. Sitting suspended from 1.21 pm to 4.00 pm Consideration resumed from 10 February 2011. Ms MARINO (Forrest) (4.00 pm)-I rise to congratulate Corporal Ben Roberts-Smith on receiving our highest military honour, the Victoria Cross. This is Ben’s second award. He received a Medal for Gallantry in May 2006 while serving as a patrol sniper during one of his three tours of duty in Afghanistan. I understand that these two awards now make Corporal Roberts-Smith the most highly decorated member currently serving in the Australian Defence Force. As we all know, the SAS is based in Western Australia, something we are particularly proud of, and I know that Ben unquestionably is a very proud Western Australian. The Department of Defence records his citation this way, and I want to read this into the Hansard record: For the most conspicuous gallantry in action in circumstances of extreme peril as Patrol Second-inCommand, Special Operations Task Group on Operation SLIPPER. … … … On the 11th June 2010, a troop of the Special Operations Task Group conducted a helicopter assault into Tizak, Kandahar Province, in order to capture or kill a senior Taliban commander. Immediately upon the helicopter insertion, the troop was engaged by machine gun and rocket propelled grenade fire from multiple, dominating positions. Two soldiers were wounded in action and the troop was pinned down by fire from three machine guns in an elevated fortified position to the south of the village. Under the cover of close air support, suppressive small arms and machine gun fire, Corporal Roberts-Smith and his patrol manoeuvred to within 70 metres of the enemy position in order to neutralise the enemy machine gun positions and regain the initiative. Upon commencement of the assault, the patrol drew very heavy, intense, effective and sustained fire from the enemy position. Corporal Roberts-Smith and his patrol members fought towards the enemy position until, at a range of 40 metres, the weight of fire prevented further movement forward. At this point, he identified the opportunity to exploit some cover provided by a small structure. As he approached the structure, Corporal Roberts-Smith identified an insurgent grenadier in the throes of engaging his patrol. Corporal Roberts-Smith instinctively engaged the insurgent at point-blank range MAIN COMMITTEE",262,Private Members Business
300,The Deputy Speaker ( Mr S Georganas),"Order! The time allotted for this debateresulting in the death of the insurgent. With the members of his patrol still pinned down by the three enemy machine gun positions, he exposed his own position in order to draw fire away from his patrol, which enabled them to bring fire to bear against the enemy. His actions enabled his Patrol Commander to throw a grenade and silence one of the machine guns. Seizing the advantage, and demonstrating extreme devotion to duty and the most conspicuous gallantry, Corporal Roberts-Smith, with a total disregard for his own safety, stormed the enemy position killing the two remaining machine gunners. His act of valour enabled his patrol to break-in to the enemy position and to lift the weight of fire from the remainder of the troop who had been pinned down by the machine gun fire. On seizing the fortified gun position, Corporal Roberts-Smith then took the initiative again and continued to assault enemy positions in depth during which he and another patrol member engaged and killed further enemy. His acts of selfless valour directly enabled his troop to go on and clear the village of Tizak of Taliban. This decisive engagement subsequently caused the remainder of the Taliban in Shah Wali Kot District to retreat from the area. Corporal Roberts-Smith’s most conspicuous gallantry in a circumstance of extreme peril was instrumental to the seizure of the initiative and the success of the troop against a numerically superior enemy force. His valour was an inspiration to the soldiers with whom he fought alongside and is in keeping with the finest traditions of the Australian Army and the Australian Defence Force. And in Ben’s own words: I just looked across and saw my mates getting ripped up. I just decided to move forward because I wasn’t going to sit there and do nothing. I thought I’d have a crack, not to let my mates down. In so many ways Ben epitomises the many ADF men and women that I meet and I am sure all members of this parliament meet. He epitomises, like they do, the traditional ANZAC spirit. Ben also said, and I think this is particularly relevant: I do what I do because I believe in the country that we live in … He said: I believe that we are making a difference in stemming the flow of terrorism into Australia, and I want my children to be able to live as everyone does now without the fear of getting onto a bus and having it blow up. I congratulate Ben and offer my very best wishes to his wife, Emma, and their twins, Elizabeth and Eve, his family and friends and particularly his mates in the Australian Defence Force. Dr MIKE KELLY (Eden-Monaro-Parliamentary Secretary for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry) (4.05 pm)-On indulgence: it is wonderful to be able to be here in this chamber to talk about a positive story from Afghanistan, in the context of all of the times that we have been here talking about some of the tragedies that we have faced and also of the condolences this morning reflecting on our most recent loss, Sapper Larcombe. I would like to reiterate the comments that have just been made by the member for Forrest about the circumstances that Corporal Ben Roberts-Smith has highlighted in relation to our continuing commitment to Afghanistan. If there is one thing that has come out of all of the commentary and discussion about his actions and what took place, it is that focusing of the national attention on what this is actually all about: why he was prepared to make those sacrifices, why he was prepared to risk his life and why he is prepared to go back there and continue to risk his life. It is about those words, that it is for his children and that he wants his children not to have the fear of getting on a bus that might explode. It is about the rest of us with our fears for our children MAIN COMMITTEE travelling around a world that is fraught with risk from terrorists who know no bounds in their atrocities and their attacks on civilisation. That is really what it is all about. In the long history of the Victoria Cross, obviously this nation has an extremely proud record. It is a very significant part of our history, with 96 imperial Victoria Crosses and two Victoria Crosses for Australia. Victoria Crosses have become such a deep and abiding aspect of our culture and reference to our values as a nation that everybody knows many of the stories and understands how significant it is when one of these decorations is awarded. I remember talking to the Governor General, who had the honour of bestowing the decoration on Corporal Ben Roberts-Smith. She highlighted that there was a special thrill for her in just handling that decoration, knowing all of the associations for this country and its history and knowing that that medal itself has been struck from the gunmetal of the cannons that were captured in the Crimean campaign. It was an absolutely electrifying sensation for her. Now, of course, Mark Donaldson will have a companion in being a recent recipient of the VC. I am grateful for that on his behalf because now some of the attention and burden as a VC holder will be deflected and they can share some of the load of the attention that the nation focuses on the recipients of these awards. I know that Corporal Ben Roberts-Smith’s family is extremely proud of him-his wife, Emma, and their two girls, Eve and Elizabeth-but I am more aware of the special meaning this will have for his father, Len Roberts-Smith, whom I have known for a number of decades now, who also had a distinguished service in the Defence Force and has served this country in many ways. Len Roberts-Smith is an outstanding member of our community in his own right. He will be enormously proud of the achievements of his son. It was wonderful to see this family that has contributed so much to the nation being able to be acknowledged in that way on the day of the presentation of the decoration. In the days when the media could not cover conflicts, there was a bit of a Boys’ Own aspect to how people considered this decoration, but in modern times we have seen coverage of exactly what the nature of war is and the risks that people take. I think, though, that there is sometimes a tendency to garnish the language around these things and lose sight of what is actually involved in the circumstances that these men and women find themselves in. Ben Roberts-Smith has previously been awarded the Medal for Gallantry, too, for a particularly difficult action in which he had to insert into the area of operations through a 10-hour route march through mountainous terrain and then engage in combat activities. For a man like Ben Roberts-Smith, that initial step just to become a member of the SAS Regiment carried with it enormous burdens of training and stress. On top of that, to overlay the circumstances in which they find themselves in order to earn this decoration is something I do not think any member of the community could really appreciate unless they have been in those circumstances. We are not talking about a game of football here where there might be knee cartilage damage or a bit of grazing or a bit of concussion. We are talking about highvelocity military rounds of ammunition that can tear your limb off or rip holes in you. If they hit you, you will know all about it for a long, long time, if you are lucky enough to survive. These are pure life-and-death, adrenalin-pumping, fear-invoking situations. And what is most admirable about these people is that none of them is immune to the fear. Notwithstanding that fear, they go anyway, and they do that job. Certainly the motivation that Corporal RobertsSmith highlighted about standing up for his mates, standing up for his country and making his MAIN COMMITTEE world a safer place for all of us and all of our children is incredibly commendable and he deserves all the respect and honour that we pay to him. SoI salute Corporal Ben Roberts-Smith and all of his family. My special regards go to Len Roberts-Smith, his father. A grateful nation admires and respects the sacrifice that all these members are making. On this day when we acknowledge the loss of another member, it is bittersweet, but we dedicate ourselves with our resolve to carry through this mission, as was so eloquently outlined by Corporal Ben Roberts-Smith himself. Thank you. acknowledging the awarding of the Victoria Cross for Australia to Corporal Benjamin Roberts-Smith, VC, MG. In doing so, this is one of the bright moments in a difficult conflict, a fact brought home to us with the tragic death of 21-year-old Sapper Jamie Larcombe, who died in Afghanistan only days ago. The Victoria Cross is Australia’s highest military honour and its conferral on Corporal Roberts-Smith is a significant occasion for our country, for our military and for Corporal Roberts-Smith and his family. His act of courage in Afghanistan on 11 June 2010 is officially cited as follows: His act of valour enabled his patrol to break into the enemy position and lift the weight of fire from the remainder of the troop who had been pinned down by the machinegun fire. On seizing the fortified gun position, Corporal Roberts-Smith then took the initiative again and continued to assault enemy positions in depth during which he and another patrol member engaged and killed further enemy. His acts of selfless valour directly enabled his troop to go on and clear the village of Tizak of Taliban. The decisive engagement subsequently caused the remainder of the Taliban in Shah Wali Kot District to retreat from the area. In the words of the Chief of the Australian Defence Force, Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston: … we are honoured to call him one of our own … He placed his mates’ lives above his own. These words reflect the feelings of all Australians. This is not the first time this 32-year-old Western Australian has displayed remarkable acts of heroism while wearing the uniform. In 2006 he was awarded the Medal for Gallantry for his brave actions as a patrol scout and sniper in Afghanistan. In receiving the Victoria Cross, Corporal Roberts-Smith becomes the 98th Australian recipient, the first from Western Australia since 1945, and the third still living. He follows in the great tradition of Australian soldiers going back to the 19th century who received this honour. The conflicts in which Australians have been awarded the Victoria Cross include: six in the Boer War; 64 in the War I, of which nine were for Australians at Gallipoli; two in north Russia; 20 in World War II; and four in Vietnam. Prior to Corporal Roberts-Smith, the most recent recipient was Trooper Mark Donaldson, whose brave deeds to save an Afghan interpreter were recognised in 2009. To Corporal Roberts-Smith, his wife, Emma, and his twin baby girls, Eve and Elizabeth: you have the thanks of a grateful nation. for relieving me as Deputy Speaker in the main chamber to enable me to make this contribution in this very important debate.

302,Mr Slipper (Fisher) (4.15 Pm),"At the outset I thank the honourable member for PetrieCommand, Special Operations Task Force, on Operation Slipper. I am sure that the name of the operation is purely a coincidence! I think it really is vital that we as Australians be able to hold our role models up as examples for others. We are really fortunate that we have people like Corporal Benjamin RobertsSmith who have been prepared, in the heat of battle, to risk everything to make sure that we as a nation remain free. The actions of Corporal Benjamin Roberts-Smith, in the heat of a very intense battle in Afghanistan in June 2010, were incredibly courageous and heroic. They deem him an extremely worthy recipient of the Victoria Cross-which is, of course, as we all know, Australia’s highest military honour. He is very much a fine example of the men and women of the Australian defence forces and of the dedication and commitment each of them has to this great nation. When I read through what Corporal Roberts-Smith had achieved I felt enormously humbled. It is captivating and inspiring to read through the step-by-step description of the actions of Corporal Roberts-Smith in the heat of battle. Soon after the troop was dropped off by a helicopter, they were engaged in a fierce battle. Under attack from all sides, Corporal RobertsSmith realised that he and his fellow troop members were in an extremely precarious situation and faced serious injury and quite possibly death. He risked his own life to take out enemy machine gun and grenade strongholds. Corporal Roberts-Smith has lots to live for. He has a wonderful wife. He has twin children. Yet, as a professional soldier in the service of his nation, he was prepared to risk everything to make sure that his fellow soldiers were able to mount an effective counterattack. I think very few of us are really capable of such bravery. I am so pleased that he has been appropriately recognised with the Victoria Cross for Australia. In doing what he did, he enabled his troop to take back the initiative in the firefight and break through what had been a well-armed and active enemy stronghold, with the results of this day on the battlefields triggering a chain of victories that resulted in the troop being able to clear the nearby village of Tizak of Taliban and eventually clear the entire district-Shah Wali Kot District-of Taliban. On behalf of the nation, I join colleagues in congratulating Corporal Roberts-Smith on the receipt of this medal and also for his military skill, his quick mind in battle, his unquestioned dedication and commitment to his fellow soldiers and his clearly displayed extreme love of his country. He is a man who was so resolutely dedicated to the objectives of that day that he was prepared to do all that he could to help achieve that outcome. Frankly, I shudder to think what could have become of other troop members if Corporal Roberts-Smith had not taken the extremely risky but ultimately very effective actions that he took. These are actions that occur in the heat of battle and they attract the attention and admiration and wonder of the media, of ordinary Australians and of our leaders. But these actions also serve to remind us of the events and challenges encountered by our fighting men and women regularly as they carry out their duties for their country. We as elected representatives and the governments that govern Australia send young men and women, and sometimes not so young men and women, to fight abroad for freedom. What we ask them to do is a tough ask and yet I have always been impressed with the way that our serving men and women do what they do with pride and discipline. I would like to congratulate not just Corporal Benjamin Roberts-Smith but all other members of our military on their efforts on behalf of Australia, a nation which is relatively peaceful. We have a very sensible MAIN COMMITTEE and respected military. We as a country have a great understanding of our place in the world and the strong commitment and responsibility as a good international citizen towards doing what we can in international conflicts with the overall aim of, wherever possible, delivering peace and stability. Corporal Roberts-Smith is among those many individuals who carry with them those objectives. Not only is he big in physical stature but also he has a big heart for Australia. He is also now a role model for all other Australians, young and not so young. As the Leader of the Opposition mentioned when he spoke in this debate, Corporal Roberts-Smith and others who have received the Victoria Cross are heroes, but they are also humans. Through that they are an encouragement to the rest of us to strive to be the best that we can be in whatever fields and endeavours we pursue, whether it be in the military, as is Corporal Roberts-Smith, or as teachers, retailers, health workers, construction workers, stay-at-home parents or anything else. We all face challenges from time to time and, while they may not be the highly charged challenges of a battlefield in Afghanistan or elsewhere, we do all possess an ability on occasion to rise to those challenges and meet them head-on and get the best possible outcome. I am a great supporter of our military men and women who put up their hands and enlist as volunteers in what is truly the most challenging of vocations. All of our soldiers deserve praise for making the incredible sacrifices that are required and for having the discipline and determination that are so vital in the defence fields to serve their and our Australia in conflict. I have said so many times publicly and I will repeat it yet again: there is no duty more challenging yet more honourable than that of serving in the military and putting up your hand to go to war in defence of our country. Service people are a very special group of people, risking their lives for their country and fellow citizens, and so it means a lot to me to be able to speak on this topic. Australia has an honourable and dedicated heritage in many conflicts in our history, stretching from the Boer War and World WarsI and II through to Korea, Malaya, Vietnam, Iraq in various conflicts and now Afghanistan, as well as in many other battles in between. Our soldiers, sailors and air men and women have always been known for their loyalty, courage, skill, values, work ethic and penchant for teamwork. All these traits are reflected and demonstrated in the events of June 2010, involving Corporal Roberts-Smith and his fellow troop members. Along with those traits we cannot forget the endearing quality of a great sense of humour in the face of adversity, which is also an important weapon in the survival pack required in military operations and on the battlefield. All these traits are held so dear by our serving personnel and our ex-servicemen and ex-servicewomen and are now also widely understood and respected by those who are not soldiers-the rest of us-as is becoming more and more apparent with the ever-increasing numbers of people of all ages attending ANZAC Day dawn services, other services and marches. ANZAC Day is not far away. It is always a full day for all of us. I manage to attend numerous events on that day, as do other elected representatives and, more importantly, other members of the community. I believe it is vital that a wide cross-section of people of all ages are involved in these events to not only ensure that the diggers know that their efforts mean a lot to us but also entrench into the rest of us the value of standing up to be counted and also the achievements of those who face the enemy head-on. MAIN COMMITTEE I can imagine they may have asked themselves in the heat of battle: ‘What am I doing here?’ The truth is that what they are doing and what they have done there is help secure our nation and protect our people. Corporal Benjamin Roberts-Smith has shown us in an extremely practical and brave way the qualities that are carried by all of our fighting men and women. As a nation we have much to be proud of, and Corporal Roberts-Smith and others who have been recognised as he has been are people who are role models for all of us. They are icons of our society, and our community would be a much better place if more of us were able to show similar courage and quality.

It is a motion to commemorate the second anniversary of those tragic bushfires. It is a time to remember. It is a time to reflect. It is also a time to look forward now with the benefit of two years behind us. At the outset, I pay tribute to the minister for her words in the main chamber and to the shadow minister, the member for Menzies. I think both members encapsulated what occurred on that tragic day and what occurred in the hours and days afterwards and has occurred since. As I said, it is natural for us to remember and reflect. All of us-particularly Victorian members like you, Madam Deputy Speaker Vamvakinou; the member for McEwen, who is here; the member for Kooyong; and the member for Wannon, who has just joined us-remember that day-the heatwave, the weather and the wind. All of us had that fear that something terrible could happen, but I think all of us hoped and prayed that the day would just pass as the previous couple of days of the heatwave had. When the news that fires had broken out was heard on the radio and on our televisions, we as Melburnians instinctively thought the worse. When we thought the worse, we thought of Ash Wednesday, which was our previous reference point for the worse. I think intuitively none of us thought it could be worse than that because that was the boundary psychologically. As I have said before in the House, I remember opening the curtains of our house, which is just on the edge of the Yarra Valley near Lilydale, on that afternoon and seeing the mushroom clouds down the Melba Highway, which must have been at Kinglake and then approaching Yarra Glen. Of course all Melburnians know the Dandenong Ranges and the Yarra Valley. Pretty much wherever you are in suburban Melbourne you can see them. What unfolded over the next hours and the next days was truly tragic, and I think the minister and the shadow minister captured that. In remembering Black Saturday, we think of the families who lost loved ones. We remember the 173 who died, those who were injured and all the families who were affected. We think of the communities affected. Wherever those communities are, we Melburnians know them even if we do not live in them. We have been there on school camps as kids and on family outings.

To speak of those events two years on brings back memories of the many efforts at so many levels. We are right to feel sympathy for the heartbreak and heartache of those who we know are suffering so much at this time and simultaneously to feel pride in the community spirit and in those who helped so much. I say that because it has become fashionable at times for commentators to say that we have lost our sense of community spirit in the last 40 or 50 years. While that might be true at a superficial level, instinctively we suspected that was not the case and we know it is not the case from what we have seen. I cannot possibly mention everyone, but I do want to mention a couple of people. One of them is Lex de Man from the CFA-and I know the member for McEwen will have heard of Lex. A loyal senior officer for many years, he retired recently. to mention him. As I said, it is difficult to single out people, but I do want to mention Peter Montgomery from Yarra Glen as an example of some of the great work that was done. He instigated the Adopt a Container Project, which within a year saw 170 shipping containers provided to affected families to store their belongings and give a sense of belonging as they rebuilt. He was rightly chosen as the Shire of Yarra Ranges Citizen of the Year last year. That project is still going and still expanding. Of course, I want to mention the previous member for McEwen-and I know the current member will support this-Fran Bailey, who worked so tirelessly in those tragic days, weeks and months after the fires. The minister rightly mentioned Fran in her speech in the House. I also want to make mention of the former Prime Minister, the member for Griffith, Kevin Rudd. At that time of tragedy, he performed in an exemplary way. He was in constant contact with Fran Bailey, and his efforts and his dedication to every aspect where he could possibly make a difference were well known to those closely involved. I want to pay tribute to the former Leader of the Opposition, Malcolm Turnbull, who similarly spent every waking minute making sure that whatever needed to be done was done. I said it is a time to remember and a time to reflect. I also said it is a time to look forward. In doing so, it is a time also for some candour because, two years on, we can make a lot more sense of the tragedy. We know we will never stop bushfires, but in our hearts we want to know that we can always do better. Two years on, the words of the former member for McEwen, in her final speech to this House, bear repeating. She called for a program of sustained fuel reduction, a state-of-the-art early-warning system, safe shelters and better use of early fire detection technology. I want to see the new state government of Victoria working as hard as they can to make a real difference and, where we can, to leapfrog forward in those areas, particularly on early fire protection technology. Another former member of this place, the former Labor member and Hawke government minister Barry Cohen, has written passionately about the possibilities of some of the new early fire detection technologies. He has written in the Australian about the FireWatch technology, which can precisely detect the existence of smoke and its location before a bushfire has taken hold, enabling emergency services to deploy the resources to extinguish the fires.

I wantedThis technology consists of a camera unit with a sensor that can scan an area of 400 square kilometres and rotate automatically through 360 degrees every six minutes 24/7. It can detect the difference between smoke, cloud and mist. With recently added night vision, it can provide precise details of fires around the clock. This technology is being used in Germany. It was developed by the German aerospace industry and NASA as part of the Mars Pathfinder mission. There were some trials of this technology with funding from the federal government, but that appears to be somewhat caught in bureaucracy. But today is not the day to go through that in detail. Today is the day for me to say on behalf of those in the Yarra Valley that we want to see that technology thoroughly trialled and we want to see the best possible technology in use. The next time this sort of fire tragedy happens-and it might be the difference of time between Ash Wednesday and Black Saturday, but it could be next year-we want to know that when our emergency services confront it they will have better technology and better preparation and that we have done more because we have learnt more, so that we can make a difference on the ground for those communities affected. tion’s history that we shall never forget. Effectively, it was the day that hell visited Victoria and left a permanent scar on its departure. My community was ravaged by an inferno of flames faster and more powerful than anything we had ever seen before. Helen Kenny, the captain of the St Andrews CFA, said it was a day they had trained for but a day they had hoped would never happen. She said that, in the days leading up to it, they knew it would be bad, but they had never dreamed that they would face such a fire of fury. It was nightmare which left people dead, injured, homeless and hurt. Ordinary Australians defended their homes as best they could. Some were successful; others were not. Many were caught trying to escape the heat and ferocity of the flames as Mother Nature proved to be too fast, too strong and too vicious. Trapped and confused, some had no option but to sit and wait for the flames to engulf their homes and everything they owned. We lost 173 people on that day. They were family, they were friends and they were neighbours. But we must not forget those who died following the fires as a result of its impact, whether it be physical, psychological or emotional. There was eerie silence on the landscape after the fires. There were no birds and no animals, only the smell of destruction and carnage to fill your senses. In its wake, the fires left homes burnt out, schools destroyed and communities devastated. It looked like a war zone and it smelt like a war zone-because it was a war zone. John McCrohan, President of the Hurstbridge RSL, gave an address on ANZAC Day. He said: I would like everyone to remember soldiers of a different war. A war caused by man’s efficiency and nature’s wrath. Black Saturday. The soldiers of this war were CFA, the SES volunteers, police, ambulance and more importantly, bushfire victims who lost their homes and belongings. Even more importantly, those who lost their lives. Mums, dads, boys and girls. They should be remembered alongside our gallant diggers of past conflict.

People walked out of that death and destruction, proud and bewildered, with little more than the clothes on their backs and the thongs on their feet, but they were filled with a spirit that only Australians can muster. Looking back to the days following the fires, I can remember through the darkness and destruction of my community how the colour and strength of our national flag shone through. Through the wind, the Southern Cross was strongly waving throughout many homes and the townships across the scorched and blackened landscape. One flag I can recall was damaged by the fires, but it was still standing, waving proudly in the winds that followed Black Saturday and telling Mother Nature that despite her power we would not be beaten. To me, that flag symbolised the true Aussie spirit and resilience: we were wounded but not beaten. It showed that we would never give up hope. The people of McEwen are real fighters. In the days and the months and the two years since that terrible day, we have witnessed the best of human strength, spirit and resilience. Local halls, sporting clubs and community centres were turned into relief centres, which were quickly inundated with volunteers and goods. People from all walks of life and from all points of the state and the nation donated their goods, their time and their money to support those in their darkest hour. My sincere thanks go to the CFA, the Victoria Police, the State Emergency Service, the Department of Sustainability and Environment, the Department of Primary Industries, the paramedics, the Australian Defence Force, all the local clubs and auxiliaries, the Red Cross, St Vinnies, the Salvation Army and particularly the army of volunteers across the country who came and gave all. Selfless acts of heroism are what we saw consistently on that day and in the days that followed. There are probably no words big enough or strong enough to thank the CFA volunteers for what they went through. I also remember Danielle Green, the state member for Yan Yean, and Ben Hardman, the former member for Seymour. They were both on strike teams at the fire front from the moment it started and they continued until the fire had passed their areas. To try to put it into context, I think it is appropriate to use the words of Winston Churchill following the service of airmen during the Battle of Britain when he said: Never was so much owed by so many to so few. On behalf of all members of this place, I say thank you to the army of volunteers in my community. Thank you for everything you have done to support our communities. From the tragedy came opportunity-an opportunity to learn and an opportunity to share and understand that loss, grief and devastation are universal. Students and staff at the Diamond Valley College used the power of education to share their experience and to inspire others. Together with students from the International School of Kabul, in Afghanistan, they published a book titled 1000 Pencils. It is a journey of connectedness from Kinglake to Kabul. In his foreword, Principal Greg Williams wrote: In the post devastation silence they are the voices of promises and hope. The students who had lost so much wrote: MAIN COMMITTEE We know our disaster is nothing compared to 30 years of war in Afghanistan, but it has helped us to understand and care for others. They have now published a second book, titled From Kinglake to Kabul, which was launched on 13 February. I was proud to be there for the launch and I can say, after just reading the book, that the stories the children have written themselves-their own personal recollections-are very powerful, very raw and very honest. The book is worth reading and it was a pleasure to meet the students there, from Kabul and from Diamond Creek, who had put pen to paper. As I said, the book-the words of those students from year 8 and year 9-is very powerful. Many locals in our area have devoted themselves to the recovery of bushfire affected communities and the landscape, helping those around them, some of whom they have never me, despite having lost so much themselves. People like Alex and Julie Sutherland, with the VFF, have coordinated thousands of volunteers to the affected properties to help clean up fences and erect new ones. Julie and Alex made the decision to deploy me and a group of Young Labor volunteers to a property in St Andrews to help with rebuilding. The property was once a home to Felicity and Peter Wiltshire, volunteers from the St Andrews CFA, before it was burnt out by the fires. Peter had been a volunteer with the CFA for over 23 years and Felicity had established a local Fireguard group, a group of young people concerned about fire prevention, protection and management. As we put up the fences, I knew that we were helping people who had devoted their lives to helping others, although the hours that we spent there would never amount to the hours they had given in their time with the CFA. A division having been called in the House of RepresentativesSitting suspended from 4.47 pm to 5.04 pm the VFF to go out and help rebuild fences in bushfire affected areas. Peter has been a volunteer of the CFA in St Andrews for 23 years and Felicity established the local Fireguard group-a group of local people concerned about prevention, protection from and management of fires. We put up new fences and I knew that I was helping people who had devoted their lives to helping others. Although the hours we spent there would never amount to the hours they had given to the local CFA, we knew it was of some assistance. We knew that the fences were an everlasting reminder of our commitment and support, because we were united in the belief that we would rebuild. Although communities are starting to get back on their feet, there is still a long way to go and much more work to be done. TodayI would just like to remember some of the towns that were affected, such as Strathewen, St Andrews, Arthurs Creek, Kinglake, Kinglake West, Pheasant Creek, Whittlesea, Humevale, Marysville, Narbethong, Buxton, Taggerty, Flowerdale, Glenburn, Strath Creek, Upper Plenty, Clonbinane, Redesdale, Reedy Creek, Castella, Wondong, Heathcote Junction, Healesville, Chum Creek, Toolangi, Yarra Glen, Dixons Creek, Steeles Creek and Christmas Hills-and others that were affected as well. I am also reminded of what local resident Gary Hughes wrote, when he said: and years, but they do not record the passing of time. MAIN COMMITTEE",271,Ministerial Statements
307,Mr Mitchell,"As I was saying, we were deployed by Alex and Julie Sutherland andThat is why Black Saturday happened only yesterday, as far as survivors are concerned. And it will always be so, no matter how many weeks, months or years the calendar insists have passed since February 7, 2009. Black Saturday is a constant companion. It is there haunting your thoughts when you are awake. It is there stalking your dreams when you try to sleep. Like other survivors, we have tried to move on. Physically, we have partly succeeded. We have swapped our blackened 8ha hilltop at St Andrews for a charming 60-year-old renovated house with an equally charming, lush green garden in Melbourne’s inner northern suburbs. There are no gum trees. We decided we could not face those future summers, when the hot, dry northerlies inevitably reignited the fears and brought back the trauma of Black Saturday. We could no longer face that annual routine of bushfire preparations. And we were not prepared to live our lives as seasonal gypsies, packing boxes of important papers and precious possessions into cars and leaving home on every high-risk day. (After our experiences on Black Saturday, staying again to defend would never be an option.) We know we are lucky. He went on to say In some cases families have been torn apart over this decision. We are full of admiration for those determined to rebuild. But to us, that blackened and bare hilltop will never be the same. These personal stories are echoed right across the scarred landscape from Clonbinane to Marysville. From Flowerdale to St Andrews and all points in between ordinary Australians are wrestling with the demons that this fire brought upon them. It is important to recognise and acknowledge everyone’s individuality when facing the challenges of recovery. Surviving this traumatic experience has changed many lives in our communities forever, leaving many struggling to return to normality as they face the challenge of learning to live with what we call ‘the new normal’. This will not happen overnight. People will do it, but they will do it in their own time, at their own pace and in the their own way. Our obligation is to be there with them as they recover and rebuild. On the second anniversary, Cathy Soulsby from Clonbinane wrote a wonderful poem, Recovery Rainbow, that, with your indulgence, I would like to read. I think it goes a long way to describing the thoughts and feelings that people are having since this tragedy. In this summer of green and gold, Dark memories of that day we hold Deep within, for the scars remain Like a tattoo, a permanent stain. That day which threw our lives off track We went out of the red and into the black, We stood on the rim of a bottomless pit Then we climbed our mountains bit by bit. It’s hard to believe two years have passed, To me, at least, it’s travelled so fast, Now the bush rebounds with verdant passion In a kind of jungle fashion. MAIN COMMITTEE So as we journey into the pink It’s a time for reflection, a time to think, A time to rejoice in what we’ve achieved, A time to surrender all we have grieved. I think that is a beautiful poem that goes to the very heart of the things that people are facing. I could never name the volunteers and the people who have been so special to the community since that time, but I think it is important to thank the Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, for everything she has done following on from the work of the former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, and Bill Shorten as the Parliamentary Secretary for Victorian Bushfire Reconstruction. I know with Bill that just about every day I would get a phone call from him to say, ‘We are going to do this. Come and see what is going on.’ And we would sort of tick tack across the electorate to find ways that we could cover as much as we could to help as many people as we could who were recovering and were suffering during that time. Two years on, we have come a long way. We know there is a long way to go. I certainly hope for our Queensland friends and those affected by the floods that the lessons we learnt during Black Saturday and afterward will go a long way to helping their recovery, helping them get back to normal as quickly as possible knowing full well that ‘normal’ will never be normal again. tion. This week marks the second anniversary of the terrible natural disaster now forever known as the Black Saturday bushfires, an event more devastating than the tragedies of Ash Wednesday in 1983 and Black Friday in 1939. Between7 and 9 February 2009, under a combination of high temperatures, strong winds and tinder-dry forests, a series of devastating bushfires-more than 300 across the stateraged throughout Victoria, ravaging woodlands, tearing through towns and tragically taking 173 precious lives, including 23 children, and injuring more than 800 people, many suffering serious burns. The fires that started on that hot, 40-plus-degree day ended after consuming more than 2,000 properties and destroying 430,000 hectares. Hundreds of businesses were lost or damaged by the flames. Every Victorian has been affected by the fires of Black Saturday. I remember the day vividly: the intoxicating heat hitting one like a wall. One can only imagine the intensity of the heat in the fire zone and its thunderous roar. And every Australian has been shocked by the devastation caused by fire, created either by intent or by accident and assisted by the natural environment. It is difficult to comprehend the horror of the situation which so many Victorians, so many Australians, found themselves facing while the fires raged. Unfortunately the ferocity of the fires on Black Saturday was of such a nature that the best laid plans were just not enough. The rage of the fire caught people off guard and people perished in homes that they were unable to defend from oncoming flames and in cars while they were trying to escape. Over those terrible three days, locations such as Flowerdale, Kinglake, Kinglake West, Marysville, Narbethong and Strathewen were left unrecognisable. Around 78 Victorian townships were directly impacted in the consuming path forged by the fires. We will not forget the devastation caused to Bendigo, Buxton, Callignee, Churchill, Coleraine, Dixons Creek, MAIN COMMITTEE",273,Black Saturday Survivors Know Calendars Lie They Might Chart The Passage Of Days Weeks Months
308,Mr Frydenberg (Kooyong) (5.10 Pm),"I rise to support this motion of commemoraDrouin West, Heathcote Junction, Horsham, Humevale, Koornalla, Longwarry, Mittons Bridge, Mudgegonga, Narre Warren, Reedy Creek, Smiths Gully, St Andrews, Steels Creek, Strath Creek, Taggerty, Toolangi, Upper Plenty, Wandong, Whittlesea and Yarra Glen. The story told by survivors tells of a fire they barely saw coming, of a fire they never knew had arrived. They tell of a fire that moved at lightning speed and of a fire that leapt forward and soared high. And they tell of family, friends, neighbours and whole communities lost. But they also tell a tale of survival. I want to acknowledge the wonderful work of the SES and CFA volunteers, the police, the fire brigade and ambulance services, the Defence Force personnel, the Red Cross and thousands of other volunteers for their work in assisting those affected. I also want to acknowledge the leadership of the former member for McEwen, Fran Bailey, the current member for McEwen, Rob Mitchell, the member for Indi, the member for McMillan, the member for Casey and the member for Bendigo for the incredible work they did in assisting their local communities to rebuild. I also want to acknowledge our then Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, and our then opposition leader, Malcolm Turnbull, for their efforts. It is also heartening to hear of the progress made by the Victorian Bushfire Reconstruction and Recovery Authority. Over 700 building permits have been issued, over 90 per cent of fences have been repaired and direct financial assistance has been provided to nearly 60,000 families and individuals. And it is heartening to hear of the new initiatives announced by the Baillieu government, including the new Fire Recovery Unit located within Regional Development Victoria and the new Bushfire Communities Support Program with a personal support helpline and other services for those in need. With over 300 families continuing to access counselling and other related assistance, the importance of these services cannot be overstated. We must pay tribute to the strength of those who survived the fires of Black Saturday and continue to provide support to the very people and communities who lost so much, as they, now more than two years on, rebuild their lives and their homes and heal their souls. Their courage, the courage of all the communities affected by Black Saturday, continues to be a great inspiration to me and to all Australians. We have done and will continue to do all we can to assist them in their recovery. It is our duty. their contributions to this debate. The Australian government has joined with Victoria and the rest of Australia in marking the second anniversary of the devastating Black Saturday bushfires. Those bushfires were Australia’s worse fire disaster since Federation, claiming 173 lives, devastating entire towns and communities, destroying more than 2,000 homes and leaving thousands of residents homeless. Black Saturday, 7 February 2009, will be forever etched in the nation’s memory as a day of mourning but also one of tremendous spirit and inspiration. This has been commented on by former speakers. The tragedy brought out the best of the Australian character and inspired countless acts of bravery, heroism and generosity. It also brought to the forefront the courage of the Australian people, the local leadership and the spirit and resilience of local communities. Our thoughts are with the survivors of the bushfires as they remember the people they lost and they work to rebuild their lives and their towns. This anniversary reminds us all of how hard it is and how long it takes for individuals and communities to recover from devastating events such as Black Saturday.

309,Mr Mcclelland (Barton,"Attorney-General) (5.16 pm)-I commend all speakers onFirstly, I would like to acknowledge the tireless and selfless efforts of volunteers supporting affected communities. The strong local trait of independence, commitment and self determination has ensured the recovery of the communities of Victoria. I would also like to formally recognise volunteer employers and self-employed volunteers. Many employers of volunteers have contributed and continue to contribute direct and indirect time and also resources to emergency management and recovery organisations. As I mentioned during the motion of condolence in respect of the Queensland flood victims, no other country in the world has so much of its emergency management capability based on volunteerism. That is something that we should be proud of and that would not be possible without supportive employers. The Australian government has stood side by side with local communities, the Victorian and local governments, businesses and non-government organisations in the effort to rebuild bushfire affected communities. More than $468 million has been provided by the Commonwealth government to assist and support the reconstruction. On 31 July 2010 the Australian government welcomed the final report of the Victorian bushfire royal commission. The report contained 67 recommendations, of which five were primarily directed at the Commonwealth. These relate to bushfire awareness and research, Commonwealth firefighting resources, bushfire arson and environment protection legislation. The Commonwealth strongly supports each of these recommendations. The government has already implemented a number of recommendations from both the interim and final reports and is committed to continuing its cooperation with the Victorian government and the Victorian Bushfire Reconstruction and Recovery Authority to ensure the needs of local communities are met. More than $1 billion has been invested across bushfire affected areas under the Nation Building Economic Stimulus Plan, generating significant economic activity and employment opportunities for the community. The government remains dedicated to supporting those affected by this terrible disaster and working with the Victorian government to assist in the implementation of recommendations made by the commission. In cooperation with states and territories, the Australian government has supported a range of measures to ensure that Australians are better prepared for bushfires. This has included, for example, the provision of $26 million for the development of a national telephone based emergency warning system, Emergency Alert, and convening the inaugural bushfire preseason briefing for emergency management officials. I am informed that in excess of six million SMS messages have gone out on Emergency Alert to date. Today, in a country where extreme weather conditions and the continuing risk of bushfires are a reality, the tasks faced by our firefighters, volunteers, communities, government and industry are more challenging than ever. In the midst of the worse flooding and cyclone season that Australia has faced, the communities in Perth also faced extreme fire conditions, resulting in the destruction of a significant number of properties. In 2009, Victorian bushfires reinforced this message all too clearly. The devastation of this event was a reminder of the impact that fire can have on all of us regardless of where we live. As the Council of Australian Governments has recognised, climate change will increase the intensity and extent of many extreme weather events. Events such as the recent Queensland and Victorian floods and Tropical Cyclone Yasi are unavoidable and will be an inevitable part of our future. We also acknowledge that, in the face of a likely increase in the frequency and MAIN COMMITTEE impact of natural hazards, protecting communities from the impacts of these threats is a shared responsibility. It cannot be borne by a single agency, organisation or sector in isolation. Rather, an integrated approach to managing emergencies and disasters across all levels of government, the private sector and the community has been adopted. This ensures Australia is better able to withstand a crisis and have enhanced ability to recover from impacts-that is, to make a resilient community. The Council of Australian Governments has now adopted a National Disaster Resilience Strategy involving all arms of government and the private sector. The government is both strengthening national partnerships for emergency management and encouraging communities to take a more hands-on approach to developing self-reliance. The reality is that governments have finite resources to protect our country and its diverse and greatly dispersed population, so it is imperative that we work together in partnership to ensure everyone can be better prepared in times of these inevitable crises. Above all, the government remains firmly committed to assisting the states and territories to improve emergency management arrangements by enhancing Australia’s resilience to disasters. We aim to do that community to community. The recent natural disaster events in the states of Queensland, Victoria, Western Australia and New South Wales demonstrate that we have learned from Black Saturday and that the Australian spirit continues to shine. The anniversary of the Black Saturday bushfires represents an important opportunity to reflect on the terrible tragedy but also, as former speakers have acknowledged, to admire the courage and spirit of Australians and to acknowledge the critically important work of our emergency services and volunteers and the generous support of the Australian community in helping those in need. the bushfires of this period will go down in Australian history as a most tragic and heart breaking experience. Sadly, the death and injury toll will always remain as stark reminders of this. The fires were the worse that Victoria, and Australia, have ever seen. It is in recognition of this great tragedy and its immeasurable losses, as well as with a sense of pride in the community response, that I stand with the parliament today in support of this motion. My electorate of Wannon was touched by this tragedy. The people of Coleraine had reason to fear that lives may be lost when a fire ignited on a day when temperatures in excess of 40 degrees were recorded. Fortunately, this did not occur. It did, however, burn 800 hectares on the outskirts of Coleraine and 1,300 hectares in Camperdown. While arising out of the most dire circumstances, the example of resilience and the sense of camaraderie which Australians showed in response should not go unnoticed, nor should the severe injuries that were suffered by one Coleraine resident in defending against the fires. My predecessor, the Hon. David Hawker, spoke of the contribution of a family from the town of Heywood, in my electorate, not long after the fires took place. The family selflessly contributed $950, from the then recent economic stimulus package, to support the Red Cross bushfire appeal. Such generosity is a symbolic reminder of the goodwill which exists in the Australian nation. In addition to acts like these, we cannot forget the volunteer firefighters, the SES, the police and the Red Cross, who braved extremes of temperature for what they saw as being the right thing to do on that tragic day. This community spirit is still reinforced after two years by the actions of those in my electorate and others. It must have been difficult for Coleraine’s residents to handle the burning MAIN COMMITTEE",276,Black Saturday Survivors Know Calendars Lie They Might Chart The Passage Of Days Weeks Months
310,Mr Tehan (Wannon) (5.24 Pm),"No-one can deny that the events of Black Saturday anddown of its avenue of honour, erected in 1919 in commemoration of those who fought in the First World War. It is with great pride, though, that I can report on an event which took place in the town to commemorate what has happened. Two weeks ago the people of Coleraine unveiled a plaque and sign, as well as the replanted avenue, to commemorate not only those who suffered in the bushfires but also those lost in World WarI and all wars which have since taken place. I am told that this has been a whole-of-community effort-and I have witnessed that-led by the local RSL club and with input from the Coleraine community as a whole. It has involved schoolchildren in the planting-and I was fortunate enough to attend on the day when the plantings took place nearly a year ago today-as well as donations and support from the townspeople. Their effort and resilience is to be applauded. This is the stuff that makes you proud of the spirit of generosity that we have in this country. These examples make me, as a member of this place, profoundly humble. While this may show a most decent side to the responses of our community, it does not diminish the immense tragedy of Black Saturday, nor does it console those whose losses will be felt forever. It cannot. Electorates other than Wannon, most regrettably, were not so fortunate in the toll of people’s lives. AlthoughI cannot speak of the immense grief with which many have been so affected, I, like other members of this place, have met with family members of those lost. I sincerely feel for them and for others in those electorates who have been affected by this tragedy. It is with great sadness that I remember the funeral I attended of a Liberal Party member who lost his life in the Black Saturday tragedy. A mother, father and brother were lost, leaving surviving twins. As the three coffins were taken into the church that day, the grief knew no bounds. For me, this will always be a very, very sad and stark reminder of the toll that the fires took on Black Saturday. In remembering this, I particularly note the members of the electorates of Bendigo, Gippsland, Indi, Mallee, McEwen and McMillan. I would like to take this opportunity to remember the previous member for McEwen, Fran Bailey. I had the distinction and honour of being Fran’s chief of staff and I cannot speak highly enough of the way that she comforted and nurtured people and dealt with the tragedies that took place on that day and helped her community begin the process of recovery. I can say with great confidence that all of those electorates will be doing what they can and will have done what they can to commemorate and honour those who were affected at those times. Listening to the new member for McEwen in this House just before, I can see that that is taking place. The statistics from Black Saturday are staggering-173 lives lost, over 400 people injured and 450,000 hectares burnt. As I have said, the statistics almost beggar belief. But statistics cannot measure the loss experienced by those affected. One hundred and seventy-three people lost their lives in the fires, many more lost a member of their family and many more again lost a friend. Many lost more than one. These are not numbers but lives, not hectares but properties and livelihoods. The week before last I spoke in this parliament on the issues of the reconstruction of local roads and infrastructure following the recent floods, which also touched my electorate. As I said, the damage to property resulting from disasters such as these does not disappear overnight. After two years, the sense of deep loss cannot be underestimated. It is at this time that we need to pause to reflect and offer our sympathies to those whose loss cannot be regrown MAIN COMMITTEE and make it clear to them that they remain in our thoughts. It is for this reason that I stand in support of this motion, offering my condolences to all those affected by the events of Black Saturday. On this occasion I can only reflect on this great tragedy and say that I and the electors of Wannon have not forgotten those who suffered so tragically two years after the time that it passed. 2009 I paused to reflect on the devastation wrought by the Black Saturday fires on Victorian towns and on the collective heart of Australia. I promised then that those affected would not be alone, that they would not be forgotten and that we would rebuild. One year on in February 2010 as Prime MinisterI reflected on the magnitude of the loss. One hundred and seventythree Australians lost their lives and more than 800 others were injured, some with a horrific burns. More than 1,800 homes were destroyed and more than 15,000 people registered as affected by the fires at relief centres and other official areas in the days after the firestorm. Donations of clothes and food flooded in, driven by a truckies who simply got into their rigs and drove for hours and, in some cases, right across the country-I remember meeting one of them at the time who had driven all the way from Perth-with one simple thing in mind: to help their fellow Australians. As a Queenslander I have experienced a lot of that just recently. It is the same Australia, the same spirit of reaching out to one another when the elements turn against us. We did then and we will do so again. Let us not forget that $318 million was donated to the Red Cross Victorian bushfire recovery appeal. That was one year ago. Two years on, we reflect once again on that tragedy, the effects of which rippled through our nation and across the ocean. TodayI would like to reflect on some individuals. Stephen Lackas, self-employed stonemason, was the first fatality, I am advised, of the Black Saturday fires. When fire threatened Upper Plenty, Stephen sent his wife, Sandra, and son, Bailey, to safety while he remained to stand and fight. Like many, Stephen was not able to adequately assess the danger because of the thick smoke that shielded the flames. By the time he was ready to concede, the flames had surrounded him. Two years on, Sandra and Bailey are symbols of hope. They have rebuilt on their land a home that Stephen envisioned for the family. Their horses survived-they have even thrived-and Bailey takes great delight in caring for the new foals. He is a little boy but a very big hero in my books. Not content to rebuild their own lives, Bailey and his mum will travel to Queensland, my home state, to help in the wake of the devastating floods. Sandra was adamant that, to repay the goodwill that had supported them in their bleakest hours, it was right to pass it on to others. In the weeks immediately after the fires, I met Ziad Ghobril, a local sparky and a member of the recovery effort. Ziad and his team of 30 worked with the Army and other authorities to restore power, provide emergency generators and reconnect power lines to communities decimated by fire. Ziad exemplifies the Australian spirit. When the blaze was at its peak, Ziad rang his employee, Jason Lynn, and urged him to flee to safety. But Jason was not ready to abandon hope. Jason battled resolutely to save the handcrafted furniture and tools his late father had bequeathed him. Jason was also among the many who underestimated the ferocity of the fires that Black Saturday. After the flames consumed his home and his shed, Jason fled with his life, only to collapse on the outskirts of the property. Startled awake by the mobile phone, Jason took heed of Ziad’s advice to him to get to the dam. With Ziad’s voice to keep him company, Jason lay semiconscious in the shallows of the dam, the screaming of animals MAIN COMMITTEE",278,Black Saturday Survivors Know Calendars Lie They Might Chart The Passage Of Days Weeks Months
311,Mr Rudd (Griffith,"Minister for Foreign Affairs) (5.32 pm)-in reply-On 21 Februaryin nearby paddocks ringing in his ears. Ziad raised the alarm with Whittlesea fire station and a CFA team was dispatched. Jason was ferried to safety. In nearby Kinglake, as the flames licked the fringes of their property, a young couple bundled their two children into the car and attempted to negotiate a road blanketed by thick smoke. As the husband and father concentrated furiously on the white line dividing the road, cars on either side exploded in flames or careened into trees. The wing mirror liquefied in the heat of the encroaching flames and a burning man thumped wildly on the car window, begging for salvation. These are truly horrible scenes, not from an apocalyptic film but, rather, from what we saw on Black Saturday. This is the horrifying recollection of Darren Wakelin from the day the Black Saturday fires engulfed his property. Darren, his wife, Bronwyn, and their two children were lucky to survive. After a period of solemn reflection, they determined to rebuild in Kinglake. Their return was marked by a chorus of car horns from the close-knit community. Like many others, the support shown by local, national and international communities has given the Wakelin family the strength to rebuild. The Davey family were not so lucky. Rob and Natasha Davey were soul mates, with a relationship spanning almost 20 years. Rob was confident that the fire pumps, poses, mops and buckets on hand would be ample to save the family home on Bald Spur Road. But nothing could have prepared the young family for the onslaught on Black Saturday. Rob, Natasha and their infant daughters, Alexis and Jorja, perished in the ferocious fires that tore through Kinglake. Further up the hill on Bald Spur Road-renamed ‘Bald Spur cemetery’ by localsGraham McKee looks down on the ruination. The Davey home is marked by two dead flowers fastened to a post. Sixteen of Graham’s neighbours perished on a stretch of road he still cannot bring himself to traverse. A year after the fires, small shrines were erected outside flattened family homes, relatives unable to move forward. In other parts of the town, hammers and saws rent the air, signs that some folk were ready to move forward. Kinglake pumpman Ross Buchanan was ready to defend his home from the fires that threatened his town. He dropped his two kids Neeve and Mackenzie at the home of his in-laws for safety. With the support of his neighbours, both equipped with fire hose reels, Ross triumphed and his home was saved. He returned to find his mother-in-law in intensive care with severe burns and news that his children had perished. As a father I really cannot begin to fathom this pain; I do not dare to. One year on, with remarkable spirit and humanity, Ross orchestrated a thankyou concert to acknowledge the efforts of the millions who had helped devastated communities recover. That is very much the Australian way. It is good to see it at work today. Where ash covered the land, bright green shoots have pushed through the surface. Bright green moss has emerged and ferns have sprung to life. Eucalypts sport new growth to nourish their stricken communities. Folks have returned, businesses have reopened and families have rebuilt. Schools have reopened and the community has regained a routine and a semblance of normality in the wake of this most extraordinary of tragedies. With a long way to go, the healing process has begun. The fire ripped the guts out of these communities. For those of us who saw it at the time and for those who supported local families at the time it leaves an indelible impression on your mind, your heart and your memory. But that is for one who just visited, not for one who was among it. To be among it, I marvel at the courage of those who have come through. To MAIN COMMITTEE banish those memories from your mind is near impossible and to now fashion new hope and new life, particularly with little kids at stake, takes courage beyond all measure. So for all those good people of all those great towns which make up the fabric of rural Victoria and rural Australia: we remember you on today’s date. We remember you on this commemoration. We remember you because what you went through was just plain unfair and this is a time for remembrance. member for Griffith, in his contribution to this debate, particularly in the context of his role at the time as the Prime Minister. The member for Griffith called me on the phone the day after Black Saturday, as I was driving between Rosedale and Sale. He said, ‘It’s Kevin-Kevin Rudd.’ I said, Sure, Kev, how ya going?’ assuming it was one of my mates from the function I had been at the night before. He said, ‘No, Darren, it is Kevin.’ SoI pulled over to the side of the road, as I was having a bit of a panic attack, thinking, ‘What does the Prime Minister want with me?’ I thank you, Member for Griffith-when you were Prime Minister at the time-not only for the compassion you showed the people of Gippsland but also for the energy you had for the task in making people feel confident that the nation was behind them. I still remember your comment about rebuilding the community ‘brick by brick’. I think the people in the most adversely affected areas appreciated the support you gave them at that time. I certainly cannot find any fault with the way you conducted yourself as our national leader at that time. The parliament itself performed at its best in the aftermath of the bushfires. I had enormous support from not only my colleagues on this side of the House but also those on the other side. I greatly appreciated that at what was a very emotional time for many people. In joining the debate I want to commend all other members who have already spoken on their contributions. I thank them for making sure that the victims of the 2009 bushfires are not forgotten in this place. As the years pass and the memories for those of us who were not directly in the firestorm may fade, the recollections for many people in the community are as vivid as though it happened only yesterday. In my community it only takes a forecast of a hot northerly wind or a forecast of a summer day of 42 degrees to remind people of the pain and suffering that our community felt and then endured on Black Saturday. Many of the survivors I have spoken to over the past two years have told me that they just have to smell wood smoke and it is enough to spark some unwelcome memories for them and trigger a nervous reaction. But as the bushland is regenerating in Gippsland and as homes and public buildings have been constructed we need to remember that many people still face enormous personal battles as they rebuild their lives. As I said at the outset, we must never forget them and we must support them as they recover at their own pace from this disaster. As the member for Griffith indicated, this will be very much a defining moment in people’s lives. They will define their lives from what they did before the bushfires to what they have done after the bushfires. I think some people will not completely recover; others will recover at a different pace. But we need to be with them and support them in that process. The bushfires of 2009 claimed 173 lives across Victoria, including 11 Gippslanders in very small communities like Callignee, Koornalla, Traralgon South, Hazelwood and Jeeralang. These were small communities where a lot of people knew the victims very well, so it was a blow to their families, to their friends and to a much wider community of people who were directly affected by the personal losses. I do not want to dwell too much on the past today, but MAIN COMMITTEE",280,Black Saturday Survivors Know Calendars Lie They Might Chart The Passage Of Days Weeks Months
312,Mr Chester (Gippsland) (5.42 Pm),"I join with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, theit is important to remember the lives that we lost, the enormous destruction of homes and public facilities and just the sheer scope of the disaster as it spread right across Victoria. In addition to the Black Saturday fires, my community suffered the previous week with 30 homes and 79 sheds destroyed in the Boolarra fire, which is often forgotten about by people outside Gippsland. By any estimation, the Boolarra fire itself was a terrible event which struck right across that district, but the size and scope of the disaster which followed just seven days later dwarfed the tragedy in Boolarra. On this, the second anniversary of the bushfires, however, I can report plenty of positive news in my community. In Boolarra itself I recently attended the official opening of the new CFA sheds. It was a great tribute to the hard work of the local community and businesses which helped to sponsor the project. I wish we had the people of Boolarra building some of our other public projects throughout Victoria, because they achieved an enormous amount of value for money for their work. The way they pulled together and were able to build that facility is a real credit to the whole community. The official opening was a huge community occasion and a real celebration for the Boolarra district. That has probably been the biggest positive to arise from the ashes of Black Saturday in Gippsland. Our communities really have pulled together. We have seen an enormous unity of purpose and community spirit on display across our region. We have certainly been challenged by the fires, but by no means have we been beaten. I would like to reflect on the words of some of the local people who have been directly involved in the recovery from the disaster, in some quotes from them on the second anniversary of Black Saturday. Ange Gordon, who is the former Traralgon South and District Community Recovery Committee chair, told the local media: At the end of the day, you can reflect back (on the past two years) and say it has been long and hard but here we are and you can get bigger and stronger communities out of going through these adversities … In a similar theme, Tineke Westwood, from the Traralgon South area, whose home was actually destroyed by the fires, said: It’s not a fake positivity, I could be upset and cry and sulk, but what’s the point? She said: We’re a very lucky family because we’re alive, we got out on time. Finally, the eastern region task force leader, Anthony Matters, who is assisting with the flood recovery efforts in Queensland, said: It feels like we are part of a bigger community to lend a hand to those across the other side of the state … He said: Members came to our aid during the fires … it is fulfilling to be able to lend a hand. In the time. I have available I would also like to note the contribution by my state colleague the member for Morwell, Russell Northe. Russell’s efforts during the Black Saturday bushfires, the response phase and the long months of recovery have been quite extraordinary-an outstanding service to his electorate. I think that was reflected in the support he received at the recent state election. Often you do not know what to do as a local member in these situations. My heart goes out to the members from Queensland who experienced Cyclone Yasi and the flooding, along with the member for Mallee, in northern Victoria, and other members. MAIN COMMITTEE When you have these natural disasters you really do not know what to do as a local member. Russell Northe was able to just be there for his people. Morwell is quite a small electorate, but he was able to be there for the people and offer them support, follow up on their concerns and chase down any assistance that was required, perhaps when it was not provided quickly enough. He did a power of work for his community, and I commend him for that. Russell recently spoke also in state parliament on the anniversary of the bushfires, and I will just reflect for a moment on a couple of comments he made. He said: … I am absolutely filled with pride at the generosity and goodwill that has been displayed 1000 times over by so many wonderful people in the Gippsland community, to the extent that now many of those people are also extending their offer of support to those impacted by the floods in Queensland and Victoria. That is something that we are very proud of. The people of Gippsland, despite the adversity they have been through, are now actively participating in the disaster recovery efforts around the state. I would also like to commend the other members-the member for McEwen, who is in the chamber, and his predecessor, Fran Bailey, as well. I congratulate him, naturally, on winning the seat but I would also like to recognise the work that Fran did in probably one of the worse affected parts, if not the worse affected part, of the state. I know that a couple of times I had the opportunity to meet with Fran and other affected members, with the Prime Minister, and I can reassure the people of McEwen that they had a real champion in the room. She was very dogged in her pursuit of making sure that her community’s concerns were heard. I would also like to commend my neighbour in Gippsland, the member for McMillan. He is another man who was very dogged in his determination to make sure that the people of McMillan were never going to be forgotten in the aftermath of the bushfires. And in his presence, I note the member for Maribyrnong who had charge of the bushfire reconstruction in a ministerial capacity. He also did a very good job in presenting the views of the Victorian community to the federal parliament. In many ways the recovery effort has become a guidebook on how to go about some of these things. I think we learned a lot as a nation on how to go about a disaster of this scale. I know the member for Maribyrnong believes that it has probably assisted him in his current role of dealing with flood disasters. We have learnt a lot from that experience and I will talk little bit about that in a few moments time. I would also like to recognise the member for Indi and the member for Bendigo, whose electorates were also directly affected. I would also acknowledge the member for Wentworth, who at the time was the opposition leader, who came to Gippsland and spent several hours with me going around talking to people who were directly affected. There were no TV cameras or newspaper photographers there. It was just a matter of going out to meet with the affected communities and helping them gain some understanding. I know that he was struck by the ferocity of the fire. At one place, in Callignee, we came across a four-wheel drive where, on one side of the vehicle facing the fire front, the alloy wheels had melted and were lying on the ground in a pool of silver. On the other side of the car, not in the direct line of the fire front, there was still rubber on the tyres. It just goes to demonstrate that the radiant heat must have been extraordinary. Seeking any form of shelter for people caught in those fires would have been extremely difficult. I know the member for Wentworth was certainly struck by the extent of the damage and the ferocity of the blaze that had gone through the Callignee area. MAIN COMMITTEE I believe that the members of both sides of parliament were very strong in adversity but they only had to look at the communities across Victoria to draw inspiration. We had people who were doing such extraordinary things. The Minister for Foreign Affairs talked a moment ago about the number of people prepared to drive long distances just to be a part of it, just to provide some support to their fellow Australians in need. Everyone simply wanted to do their bit. This summer, we are again seeing people who are determined to assist the people across Queensland and northern Victoria who have been affected by flooding. I still believe we have a long way to go though. On the second anniversary the rebuilding of private homes is continuing, but many families have suffered relationship breakdowns in the aftermath of the tragedy. The social costs that we are starting to see in our communities is something that perhaps goes unnoticed in this place. You can see a house rebuilt, you can see a community hall rebuilt, but the lives of families that have been directly affected are very difficult to repair. Some families have been torn apart in the aftermath of the tragedy. We do live in a very fire prone environment in Victoria and there will always be days of high fire risk and summers which are hotter and drier than the one we are currently experiencing. But even during this comparatively mild summer there is a fire risk. Gippsland this year has experienced one major outbreak on 11,000 hectares, which burnt two houses and some sheds in the Tostaree region of East Gippsland. Thankfully though, there was no loss of life. I thank the firefighting personnel for their efforts in extremely difficult conditions on that day. We will continue to experience bushfires in the future and it is up to governments, I believe, to do everything in their power to help prevent outbreaks wherever possible, to minimise the impacts of fires when they occur and to assist the communities as they recover-as we have done over the past two years. We simply must learn the lessons of 2009. One lesson which is patently obvious to me is that there needs to be an increased focus on fuel reduction burning. I note the commitment of the new Victorian government to treble the amount of burning it undertakes across Victoria. Fuel reduction burning will not prevent fires but it will reduce their intensity. Some extreme elements of the Greens have in the past opposed fuel reduction burning and the tragedy of Black Saturday seems to have silenced a lot of them. We need to undertake an extensive program of burning right across regional Victoria and on the suburban interfaces to protect life and property and to sustain the environment-and that is a point that is well worth making. The bushfires which raged across Victoria in 2009 were extraordinarily hot. They scorched the earth and devastated the natural environment as well as man-made structures in their path. The impact on wildlife will be impossible to calculate. As an environmental measure and for the protection of life and property we must commit ourselves to delivering an extensive fuel reduction program across Victoria and across our nation. I am also concerned about the development of early warning systems. I believe we have to be very careful in the way that we portray these early warning systems to the broader public. We need to make sure that these systems, which have great merit, are not something that the public become dependent upon. They cannot be allowed to get to the situation where they believe they are going to get a warning of when to evacuate, that they are going to get some sort of message on their mobile phone telling them where the danger is and when they have to get out. It is simply not going to be achievable in much of the environment across Victoria. In many parts of Victoria we have mobile phone black spots where text messages, particularly in MAIN COMMITTEE the most fire prone areas, simply will not get through. So we need to be very careful in the expectation we raise in the community about early warning systems. I also think we need to make sure we do not scare people away from regional areas. Much of the commentary in the media in the aftermath of the bushfires was so extreme, warning of catastrophic days and extreme weather events as if you simply cannot visit parts of regional Victoria. I think that is a message that we need to be very careful about. We run the risk of destroying small business, destroying our tourism industry and scaring the tree changers-the people interested in moving to regional communities. We run the risk of scaring them away with some of these messages. You can live in regional Victoria. You can have a great life in regional Victoria. We need to make sure that people are well prepared for bushfire events, that they understand the risk but that we do not scare them away. I also think that we need to remain vigilant and impose some very severe penalties upon those who deliberately light fires on days of extreme danger. I do not believe we have gone far enough with our efforts to protect the community from arsonists. I have sought a national database of arsonists to ensure that people who have committed such crimes in the past are subjected to increased monitoring in the future. These particular individuals are known to wait for the right conditions to light fires. If they are caught, part of their punishment needs to be ongoing scrutiny. It may sound draconian to some, but I would have no hesitation in supporting the development of a national database of high-risk offenders, including monitoring and surveillance measures and the use of electronic devices to track their movements for the rest of their miserable lives. The pain and suffering caused by deliberately lit fires demands extreme action to help protect our community from such criminal acts in the future. I urge both state and federal governments to think very seriously about how we are going to make sure that people who have committed such crimes in the past are constantly monitored, particularly on days when extreme fire events are possible. As we reflect on the 2009 bushfires, we must commit ourselves in this place to learning from the experience and doing everything in our power to prevent such a tragic loss of life in the future. I believe we owe that much to 173 victims and their families. and Superannuation) (5.57 pm)-I would like to acknowledge the words of the member for Gippsland, who just spoke then, and put on record that he, along with other members of parliament, has worked continuously since the Black Saturday fires to help these communities reconstruct and recover. On 30 July 2009 I described Black Saturday in this place as without a doubt the greatest peacetime disaster in Australian history. So it remains. Today, with this muddy wretched summer of 2010-11 still fresh in so many of our minds, it would be more than understandable for many Australians to be focused almost entirely on the natural disasters which we are still only cleaning up from and rebuilding. While all of us in this place have spoken formally to the condolence motion and what we have seen in recent times across much of Australia, the profound and enduring view remains in our society that the Victorian bushfires and the destruction of two years ago still remain the greatest peacetime disaster in Australian history. It is fitting that parliament is formally remembering those whom we lost in the Victorian bushfires. I had the privilege to attend the second anniversary ceremony in Federation Square, and it was very well done. I believe that for many of the people who attended it was an opporMAIN COMMITTEE",282,Black Saturday Survivors Know Calendars Lie They Might Chart The Passage Of Days Weeks Months
313,Mr Shorten (Maribyrnong,"Assistant Treasurer and Minister for Financial Servicestunity to take another step on their personal paths to recovery. But in speaking here, and speaking softly, I am in firm admiration of the courage of the 33 distinct and very different Victorian communities representing 78 towns across Victoria who faced the wrath of Mother Nature as she tore through our beloved bushlands, towns and neighbourhoods. A melancholy lesson for me in all this black horror of the bushfire tragedy was that the concept of a community itself perhaps has never been stronger, more evident or more inspiring than when a group of good people face great trauma, emotional and physical loss and acute economic stress. I speak here of many communities, each of whom experienced this disaster in its own different way. In doing so, I think at this point I would also like to acknowledge other members of parliament I worked with directly: the member for Ballarat, the member for McMillan, the member for Mallee, the former member for La Trobe and the current member for La Trobe, the former member for McEwen and the current member for McEwen. There was also, of course, the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs; the former Prime Minister; and many at the state and local level who I will refer to later in my presentation. But the community I most recall in all of this is of course the community of the bereaved. No fewer than 173 of our fellow citizens died in these fires; 40 were very injured. But each of the 173 whose lives were lost left behind them families and friends, workplaces, sporting clubs, classrooms and community groups that they had belonged to. These loved ones and local brethren who were so abruptly left behind still mourn and ponder and recover as individuals. But they also do this today as a very special community in and of themselves, and I do respect and revere each of them for their enduring resilience. I said that there were 33 separate geographic communities. In their own distinguishing ways they comprise 78 towns that have had so many months and years of sifting through memories from ashes and recalling faces that are now gone. The towns and villages and many of the farms are still there, as are the roads and the yards and the hills and the creeks where people played and grew up, but there are things that are no longer there that are important too. It is not just the houses, but homes, and not just buildings, but livelihoods. These are now gone and these communities and their citizens are still finding their proper feet in so many different ways. The rebuilding and the getting on with it in so many of these places have been a great credit to these districts and I think it honours the pioneering history of so many of the region’s ancestors. Again, I want to record my respect for each of these communities for their strength in adversity in testing times. With all this, these towns have re-affirmed the meaning of community and what it is to be good neighbours and each of them has helped their friends get on and travel through the darkness of the last two years. There is another community which is central to this motion of condolence, and that is the volunteer community. It does not matter whether it was the SES or the CFA, the Lions and Rotary clubs or the other service groups, the Scouts, the Guides, the football and netball clubs, the various and vibrant people power of these Victorian communities has helped wage the battle and they helped pick up the pieces once the inferno passed. These volunteers have been great ambassadors for their communities and all together form a community of their own for which I have enormous admiration and gratitude. MAIN COMMITTEE While hearts and heroes of Black Saturday are the typical modest Australians too many to name, please let me also say that I believe that the leadership of Premier John Brumby in the aftermath of the event remains an example to all of us. I am pleased to have had the opportunity and the privilege in my former role as Parliamentary Secretary for Victorian Bushfire Reconstruction to help make a contribution in the communities to which I have spoken. Many have made this contribution and it would be remiss of me not to acknowledge Christine Nixon, who was the Chair of the Victorian Bushfire Reconstruction and Recovery Authority, and her husband, John, who was beside her throughout all the long kilometres travelled and the meetings held. I have referred to the bereaved community, but I should also acknowledge Carol Matthews’s leadership, and that along with her committee. There were over 30 community recovery committees established and all of them deserve recognition. I particularly recall some of the creative exchanges with people from Flowerdale and the people from Kinglake. I recall the hard work done at Callignee and at Traralgon South by those committees. I look at the work done at Marysville by Tony Thompson. I look at the work of David McGahy, the captain of the CFA brigade at St Andrews. I look at the work of Jenny Beale, who worked hard in the Kinglake community, and the work done by the community radio people and the Mountain Monthly. I would also like to acknowledge some individuals whom I had the chance to work with. Ian Archibald from Labertouche worked very hard, and he is still doing it hard, I might add. I look at the remarkable Val and Vern Brown. Val has passed away since the fires, but Val and Vern worked and organised, and the work continues, with their beautiful granddaughter Madison, who lost her parents and sister in these terrible fires. Madison is recovering well but she has a tremendous battle. I would also like to acknowledge Koula Alexiades and the team at the Victorian Bushfire Reconstruction Agency, who work so hard, and there were so many people there. So many of these people I have mentioned-and there are so many more I should have mentioned but have not yet mentioned because time does not permit-on this journey of reconstruction, I believe, help underline what it means to be Australian. Coincidentally, a person who shares the surname with what was left behind so universally after the firestorm, the late Arthur Ashe, the former tennis great and social advocate, once said: True heroism is remarkably sober, very undramatic. It is not the urge to surpass all others at whatever cost, but the urge to serve others at whatever cost. I think many of us would agree that two years on from that terrible and terrifying day the many communities of the 2009 Victorian bushfires have served each other remarkably well with significant courage and now have found hope in the future, from the work of the Red Cross and the appeal fund now chaired by Pat McNamara through to every individual who has tried to make recovery. As the phoenix continues to rise over the Yarra Valley, the Dandenongs, Gippsland, the Victorian Alps and so many of our plains and forests, let us never forget what happened. Let us learn from the experience to protect ourselves from the inevitable recurrence of bushfire. Let us honour the fallen as we embrace those who are still with us. Debate (on motion by Mr Craig Thomson) adjourned. MAIN COMMITTEE Second Reading Debate resumed from 17 November 2010, on motion by Mr Crean: That this bill be now read a second time. Ms ROWLAND (Greenway) (6.06 pm)-I am very pleased to rise and speak in support of the Screen Australia (Transfer of Assets) Bill 2010. The purpose of this bill is to amend the name of the National Film and Sound Archive to the National Film and Sound Archive of Australia. The bill also transfers part of Screen Australia’s film library and associated assets and liabilities to the National Film and Sound Archive of Australia. Following the establishment of Screen Australia and the National Film and Sound Archive in 2008, it has become clear that the functions associated with Screen Australia’s film library and related sales and digital learning functions are best placed with the National Film and Sound Archive. Whilst this may appear to be an administrative change, I believe this will have significant benefits for Australia’s film industry. It will enable the NFSA to be internationally recognised as Australia’s premier audiovisual collecting institution. Anything that enhances the image of Australia’s film industry I believe is worth pursuing. As the immediate past chair of Screen New South Wales, formerly the New South Wales Film and Television Office, I strongly believe the Australian film industry is deserving of government support through a variety of measures and represents a valuable investment in both monetary and nonquantifiable terms. It is useful to revisit first principles when we consider the role of government in the screen sector. A useful starting point is the statutory functions of Screen Australia. I refer to section 6 of the Screen Australia Act 2008, which includes amongst the functions of Screen Australia being to support and promote the development of a highly creative, innovative and commercially sustainable Australian screen production industry; to support or engage in the development, production, promotion and distribution of Australian programs and the provision of access to Australian programs; and to support and promote the development of screen culture in Australia. The charter and values of Screen New South Wales also neatly capture the contribution of the screen industry to both our culture and our economy. To paraphrase, the screen industry makes a significant contribution to our society socially, culturally and economically. Development and support of the screen industry is a necessary part of maintaining the vitality of our economy as a whole. Diversity in screen content, culture and creation is important. It is an important part of working towards creating opportunities for the widest possible diversity of people to participate in the making, viewing and appreciation of screen content. We live in the digital age. The world no longer sees screen as purely film or television. People now make, share and see moving images on digital formats and platforms at home, at work, at school, in the cinema and on the move in cars, planes and trains. We need to be flexible to adapt to the implications of the digital age. Our role is to stimulate compelling screen experiences and provide high-quality service to screen practitioners. The Australian government has a comprehensive package of measures aimed at boosting support for the Australian film and television industry, of which the Australian screen production incentive is its primary mechanism. This provides tax incentives for film, television and other screen production in Australia and is available in three streams: the producer offset, to MAIN COMMITTEE encourage the production of Australian film and television projects; the location offset, which is a 15 per cent rebate which supports the production of large-budget film and television projects shot in Australia; and the PDV offset, a 15 per cent rebate which supports work on post, digital and visual effects production, or PDV, in Australia regardless of where a project is shot. There were two important changes to the offsets contained in the 2010-11 budget, a reduction in the minimum qualifying expenditure threshold for the PDV offset from $5 million to $500,000 and the removal of the requirement for production spending between $15 million and $50 million in Australia to spend at least 70 per cent of the total production budget in Australia in order to qualify for the location offset. Like, I am sure, those speakers who will follow in this debate, I am passionate about Australian film. I am sure we all have our favourites. They have made an important contribution to our cultural identity, from Breaker Morant to Picnic at Hanging Rock to Gallipoli, to name a few. In recent years, during my role as the former chair of Screen New South Wales, there have been some of the most beautiful and moving pieces that I have seen, such as Ivan Sen’s Beneath Clouds, Blessed by Ana Kokkinos and, from the 2010 Sydney Film Festival, Wasted on the Young-which I thought was the standout film. Then there are documentaries, television series and features and the burgeoning digital effects sector, for which Australia has rightfully earned a reputation for excellence. A case in point is Animal Logic, the producers of the Oscar-winning Happy Feet. The 2009 case study of success, tracking its beginnings in advertising to attracting the best human capital, the necessary creativity and the right people of talent. It also discussed the issue of broadband. In the future directions paper’s interview with Greg Smith of Animal Smith, he said the following under the heading ‘how broadband changes the game’: The continued growth of broadband infrastructure complements and supports Animal Logic’s business growth. In its ongoing advertising work, broadband capability allows commercials at a higher resolution and quality, which facilitates greater creativity and production values. When online advertising was primarily banner advertisements there was less scope, but with broadband, advertising can be the same or close to broadcast quality, which increases the creative potential. This is important. He goes on to say: With the rollout of high-speed broadband as part of the National Broadband Network, the ability to improve content production quality will only increase. Bandwidth requirements always grow to fill the available capacity. It can also give the company greater flexibility in how it manages its production facilities. With high-speed broadband, Animal Logic’s work could, for example, be carried out seamlessly by pods working in different locations. It makes sense for Animal Logic to maintain its base in Fox Studios because it is convenient for the director and others shooting a movie nearby to quickly drop by and see how the visual effects are developing. However, allowing people to work in other locations around Sydney can increase the talent pool because it gives people greater choices in terms of cost of living, and travel time. Locating teams away from the inner-city of Sydney can also reduce business costs. I regularly engage with practitioners in film industry circles who are excited about what the NBN will do to envigorate the sector. The case study of Animal Logic encapsulates some of the very real benefits that will be derived from the NBN for the arts sector. As someone who remains passionate about the Australian film industry, it would be remiss of me not to take this opportunity to acknowledge the present challenges being faced by the MAIN COMMITTEE sector, particularly in the current climate of parity or near parity of the Australian dollar with the American dollar and the impact of that on the industry’s global competiveness. It is an unfortunate downside of the combination of our high dollar and our competitors matching or exceeding Australia’s production incentives. According to AusFilm, which commissioned an economic impact study of the Australian Screen Production Incentive program, $2.2 billion of inward investment has been generated in Australia under the scheme. Unfortunately however, today it is becoming, and in some cases it has become, financially unattractive for high-end international feature production in Australia. The result is a downsizing of the domestic industry, with wide-ranging negative impacts on everything from the skilled crew base to caterers to local impacts, particularly when you consider the boost that can be generated to local economies-particularly regional towns-by onsite filming. I look forward to what I understand will be a comprehensive review of the offset scheme to address these very real concerns. Indeed, I note the announcement by Minister Simon Crean of 17 February at which he released his review of the independent screen production sector. It found significant improvement in the Australian screen and television industry and a major lift in government investment-in fact, government support has trebled from $136.7 million to $412.1 million in three years since the introduction of the Australian Screen Production Incentive. However, the review also identifies several challenges and highlights that there are opportunities to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the screen tax offset in some areas. I also look forward to this review gathering as many submissions as possible from the sector and also from people like me who are passionate about film. Comments are invited until Friday, 11 March. One thing is also clear, and I get this a lot from industry: international production crews love coming to Australia. I want to stress that because it is unfortunate that when it comes down to it money is the bottom line, not the quality of our crews and not the quality of our industry in Australia. The second element of this legislation provides for the transfer of Screen Australia’s extensive archive of documentary films to the NFSA. Currently, Screen Australia’s film library includes over 5,000 films produced by its various predecessor agencies. The transfer of these assets is important because the NFSA has the professional archiving experience and facilities to preserve, curate and exhibit these films. It is useful to remind ourselves of what we are dealing with when we consider the NFSA. It has more than 1.6 million items-over 330,000 audio recordings, over 440,000 moving images and over 870,000 associated documents. Some of these are of priceless national and cultural significance, such as the earliest surviving footage of the Melbourne Cup from 1897 and The Story of the Kelly Gang from 1906, which was indeed the first acknowledged feature film in the world. There is also the Indigenous collection. One of the very important functions of the NFSA is to collect, preserve and effectively manage the diversity of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultures depicted through film and sound. I want to tell a particularly pertinent story about film archiving. It is the story of the classic 1971 film Wake in Fright, directed by Ted Kotcheff, and how it was rediscovered. This film is the story of schoolteacher John Grant, who has an alcohol fuelled descent into hell one weekend in an isolated outback town. By the late 1990s the original negatives were thought to be MAIN COMMITTEE lost. In 1996 the editor, Anthony Buckley, started searching for them. He located them in a bonded warehouse in London. But when he arrived to collect them he found that unfortunately the week before the canisters had been shipped to the US. He kept searching and eventually found the canisters of the original film in a set of dump bins, and 263 cans of film finally arrived at the NFSA from the US in two separate shipments in September 2004. A significant amount of work needed to be done on them to reconstruct and preserve the film. The NFSA did a fantastic job in undertaking this preservation work and in fact it was at the Sydney Film Festival in 2009, I believe, that it had a redigitised screening to a rapturous response. I was very fortunate to be there for that momentous occasion. A large proportion of the NFSA material is stored as online education resources, which are a very effective tool for use in classrooms across the country. One of the most exciting parts of being a member of parliament is the opportunity to visit schools across one’s electorate. I have been fortunate to experience the benefits of an interactive classroom. The use of audiovisual material is becoming an increasingly important feature of education in the 21st century and, for this reason, it is essential that the NFSA is given the resources it needs to archive and preserve audiovisual material. It is essential that appropriate recognition is afforded to the authority so that it can continue to preserve an audiovisual record of our past, be it in films, television, news stories or documentaries. This is why this is an important piece of legislation, and I commend it to the House. Assets) Bill 2010, which will transfer Screen Australia’s film library and related sales and digital learning functions to the National Film and Sound Archive, consolidating these collections. This bill deals with consequential and transitional matters relating to the transfer of staff, assets, liabilities and other matters to the NFSA. The bill also changes the name of the NFSA to the National Film and Sound Archive of Australia. As is well known, the Australian film and television industry has made an enormous contribution to the cultural life of our nation. The impact of quality cinema and television on the Australian community and the perceptions that the world has developed of our nation from exposure to this product cannot be overstated. Quality local television and film ensure that Australian children grow up watching local shows and films or at least have the opportunity to on our particularly good services such as ABC3. I recommend that all parents steer their children, if they watch TV, in that direction because there is a lot of Australian content there. I think a frustration of many parents is that their children too often watch on TV imported product. While some of that is good, I think it is also very important from a parent’s viewpoint that children are exposed to their own country’s output. Australian children’s TV and films, both short and long, are some of the best in the world. I think they compare more than favourably with any of the imported products that come along. The other thing of course is that local production means jobs for people in Australia. The more locally made films and TV shows are promoted and shown at cinemas or on TV, the better it will be for people in the industry. Films like Crocodile Dundee and television shows like Neighbours have made long-lasting impressions on the rest of the world of the Australian nature and character. Sometimes it is a little extrapolated but many times they get across the quirks that make our country the best in the world. Films that portray Paul Hogan as Crocodile Dundee live long in the memory.

314,Mr Symon (Deakin) (6.19 Pm),"I speak in support of the Screen Australia (Transfer ofhave been used to advertise Australia year after year. Although some people might say that they are not the bee’s knees in arts films, they are certainly culturally important to Australia. This bill is about the cultural heritage for current and future generations. Screen Australia and the National Film and Sound Archive were established as separate statutory authorities on 1 July 2008. The agencies have completed over two years of operation as separate statutory authorities and in that time it has become clear that certain functions associated with Screen Australia’s film library and related sales and digital learning functions would be best placed within the National Film and Sound Archive. The film library of Screen Australia contains substantial archival resources. The National Film and Sound Archive, as Australia’s premier collecting institution for audiovisual material, is the agency that would best preserve and support the development and exploitation of this fantastic resource. Screen Australia’s library has a collection of approximately 5,000 films and associated material produced by the former Film Australia Ltd and its predecessor agencies or acquired from third-party producers. I am sure we have all seen over the years many films that have been financed with the help of Film Australia. The library collection also has over 60,000 items on film, video, sound and digital file formats and 150,000 stills, which the Commonwealth owns the copyright of. Spanning a century of Australia’s history, it is one of the largest and most historically significant sources of archival, documentary and Indigenous footage and stills. Providing support to the independent documentary sector, Screen Australia offers a zero-fee licensing initiative, offering all media worldwide in perpetuity rights for up to 10 minutes of footage and 40 stills of Screen Australia’s copyright materials without fee. During 2009-10, 36 local documentaries accessed footage and stills under the zero-fee licensing scheme. This greatly assisted our local industry. This support to the local industry and the preservation of this cultural heritage will be continued at the NFSAA. The National Film and Sound Archive is the Australian government’s collecting institution for the nation’s audiovisual heritage. This national collection includes more than 1.6 million items. So, in addition to the disks, films, videos, audiotapes, phonograph cylinders and wire recordings, the collection includes supporting documents and artefacts such as photographic stills, transparencies, posters, lobby cards, publicity, scripts, costumes, props, memorabilia including sound memorabilia and video and film equipment. That is a very extensive collection, and of course no collection of that size can ever be totally put on public display. But it needs to be stored, it needs to be catalogued and it needs to be accessible one day so that Australian people can see it and see what our history actually contains. The NFSA provide their collection for loan and conduct a number of preservation projects, searching for lost films and preserving our film and sound heritage. Through cutting-edge research and preservation practices, the National Film and Sound Archive has become internationally recognised as a centre of excellence for restoration and preservation of audiovisual material. The National Film and Sound Archive has leading-edge technical facilities and teams of expert technicians skilled in handling all audiovisual media. Although in these days of digital production and digital storage it is far too easy to burn things onto your own computer and have a back-up file somewhere, in many cases the materials that our old films and images are stored on are quite volatile and must be stored with proper archival practices; otherwise they can be gone for good. MAIN COMMITTEE Screen Australia is the key federal government funding body for the Australian screen production industry. Its functions are to support and promote the development of a highly creative, innovative and commercially sustainable Australian screen production industry. Screen Australia and the industry I would say have been enjoying not only recent success but ongoing success. In 2009, 1.4 million more Australians went to the cinema to see Australian films than in 2008-a 45 per cent increase-and that momentum continues. Screen Australia invested in several distinctively Australian films that performed well at the box office-films such as Bran Nue Dae, The Kings of Mykonos, Beneath Hill 60 and Animal Kingdom. These successes reflect Screen Australia’s focus on audience engagement, creative storytelling and increased screen business viability. In the two years since its inception, Screen Australia should be proud of its impact on the Australian film and television industry. Noting the success of Screen Australia and its core duties, it has become apparent that the role of maintaining a film and sound collection does not appear to be a core activity of Screen Australia, so, by transferring its collection to the National Film and Sound Archive, Screen Australia will be contributing to the expansion of the NSFA’s collection and will retain its focus on supporting the Australian screen production industry. The 60,000 films, documentaries, stills and other shows currently held at Screen Australia will significantly add to the collection at the National Film and Sound Archive. The Screen Australia (Transfer of Assets) Bill 2010 also deals with staff and administrative matters related to the transfer of the collection to the NSFA. Any assets and liabilities specified by the minister at transition time will cease to be assets and liabilities of Screen Australia and will become assets and liabilities of the NFSA. The bill will ensure the transfer of relevant Screen Australia employees currently working in connection with the film library and will ensure that all their entitlements transfer over to the NFSA. It is very important that that is done properly when you are dealing with skilled people, especially in an area such as this, where there is a worldwide demand but not many opportunities for training to get new people into the industry. Current Screen Australia staff are non-APS employees engaged under the Screen Australia Act 2008. They will be transferred to the NFSA, subject to the Public Service Act 1999, all accrued staff entitlements to annual leave, personal leave and carers leave will be transferred to the NFSA, and staff will retain continuity of service. In addition to moving the cultural collections to the NFSA, this bill will have the effect of changing the name of the NFSA by adding ‘of Australia’ to the end of it. The resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting and the member may seek to continue his remarks at that time. Australian Arts Community Debate resumed, on motion by Mr Perrett: That this House: (1) recognises the conclusion of a great television police drama, The Bill, and thanks the ABC for its long standing commitment to the program; (2) acknowledges that since 1983, The Bill, has kept many of us from fully engaging with the broader Australian arts community on a Saturday night; MAIN COMMITTEE",292,Dbcde Paper Australia S Digital Economy Future Directions Discussed Animal Logic As A

Disposable Heroes of Hiphoprisy sang: ‘Television, the drug of the nation. Breeding ignorance and feeding radiation.’ I will give you the drum on this concept later in my speech. It is not news to people who know me-and my neighbours-but I am a strong supporter of the arts, especially writing and music. I am co-convenor, with Julie Owens, of the Labor Friends of the Arts. My bookshelves are packed to the rafters and my iPod has music from the four corners of the globe and includes all types except house. I say this to explain some of the history behind this motion. For many years my good wife and I were addicted to a television police show from the United Kingdom, shown on ABC1 on Saturday nights. The show stretched right back to 1983. We have been clean for a while now. In fact, we went cold turkey on 16 October 2010. Our modern family is using my rehab journey to avoid all television and to rush out to engage with our local performers, our local artists and our local writers. Consequently, I encourage all Australians to turn off their TVs, to turn off Iron Chef or The Simpsons or Spicks and Specks or RocKwiz or MasterChef or Top Gear-whatever you are watching-to get off the couch and get closer to your local live performers. Do it today, tonight, tomorrow. See a play. School ruined drama for many, but live theatre is well worth the effort, I am assured by the member for Braddon. So you think you can dance? Well, there is good live music just waiting for you to rage to right now at the end of your street. You will be the biggest loser if you do not act. Madam Deputy Speaker, I am not just talking about your generation; I am also talking about all ages. We should all get immersed in the arts and tell our offspring, our brothers and our sisters that from sunrise to Sunday night there is something for everyone. The Australia Council for the Arts published a report last year called More than bums on seats: Australian participation in the arts. This report gave a good insight into the level of our engagement with the arts. It found that in 2009 nine out of 10 Australians had participated in the arts-either by creating the arts, like the member for Braddon, or appreciating them. Literature is the most popular, with 84 per cent of Australians reading novels or poetry, but fewer Australians are familiar with the performance arts. About 16 per cent of Australians participate in creative writing, seven per cent in writing a novel or short story and five per cent in writing poetry. Thankfully, more than half of all Australians attend live music performances. About 22 per cent attend musical theatre. Thirteen per cent attend classical musical performances and eight per cent attend the opera. About one in four Australians attend theatre, with 19 per cent attending contemporary theatre and 10 per cent physical theatre or circus. Sixteen per cent attend ballet or classical dance. Smart insiders know that we need to increase these percentages. This is not just about keeping up with the Kardashians. Rather, it is about valuing the contribution of the arts and how they help to shape our nation.

Make no bones about it, through the arts, and particularly the performance arts, we are challenged, entertained and inspired, and we value this gift to the nation. British arts administrator Sir John Tusa said it best: The arts matter because they embrace, express and define the soul of a civilisation. A nation without arts would be a nation that had stopped talking to itself, stopped dreaming, had lost interest in the past and lacked curiosity about the future. Australia’s got talent out there. You only have to go down to your local pub or theatre and you will find people who have put in the hard yards and are able to make a contribution, and they need an audience. We should all get away and enjoy these people’s performances. Last week James Jeffrey, a writer from the Australian, poked fun at part of this motion in the Australian newspaper. Hopefully, if he now sees the full context of the motion, he will agree that it totally fits the bill. of us called to the television. The familiar sounds of sirens, flashing blue lights, theme music and the iconic pictures of two police officers walking towards the screen could only mean one thing: The Bill was starting. The Bill, an English police drama which ran for 27 years, was once Australia’s most watched television drama. It stood the test of time as great shows before it slowly lost against the more popular reality TV. However, sadly in July last year England’s ITV announced that Sun Hill police station would be emptying their cells, removing their police uniforms and shutting their doors permanently. There was no fire, no terrorist attacks and no mass murder. The show, as simply as it started, ended. During the eighties and nineties, when The Bill was in its heyday, it became a real family affair. Children were allowed to stay up longer, dessert was allowed in front of the TV and even the family pet was sneaked in to sit around and watch the latest events occurring in and around the fictional suburb of Sun Hill, set in the rather realistic backdrop of east London. The Bill started at a time when television drama was at its peak, competing with great Australian shows such as A Country Practice and The Sullivans and following on from great British comedies such as Are You Being Served? and Some Mothers Do ’Ave ’Em. The British writers went out on a limb to provide a different type of drama. Thus The Bill was born-a bird’s eye view into the goings-on of a busy London police station. The Bill was not an obvious hit. It was decidedly unglamorous, featuring leaden skies and dingy council estates. It was only signed on to 12 episodes, as the BBC was unsure that the audience would take to seeing the happenings inside a police station. But fans were gripped by the lives and exploits of the officers of Sun Hill police station and the series drew praise for its suspense filled story-lines and tight scriptwriting. Unlike many TV shows today, the story-lines had depth and feeling and the puzzle was not solved in an instant. The characters built relationships with the audience, and many of the names and faces of The Bill’s past will be embedded in the minds of many Australians. Names such as PC Tony Stamp, Sergeant June Ackland, DC Tosh Lines, DS Jim Carver and DC Mickey Webb entered our living rooms so often and for so many years they became a part of the family’s Saturday night rituals. I always used to know that The Bill was starting because my mother-in-law would cut short teatime to go home and watch The Bill in the comfort of her own lounge room, and now I am MAIN COMMITTEE",295,Private Members Business
319,Mr Mccormack (Riverina) (6.35 Pm),"For decades, Saturday nights have found manygoing to have to endure my mother-in-law for longer, God love her, because there is no excuse to go home anymore. The Bill served as a starting point for many English actors, as Neighbours and Home and Away do for Australians. However, for an Australian to portray a character in this drama was a rare yet significant move, and it is worth mentioning here one Australian actor, City Homicide’s Daniel MacPherson. The axing of The Bill is the final nail in the coffin for shows which do not have to run off short, quick story-lines to grab the audience’s attention. Two one-hour episodes per week was a sufficient amount of time to watch the Sun Hill crew work their way through a kidnapping, a murder or a drug charge in the Canley borough operational command unit in east London. Had they been solved in the mere half-hour that most dramas are allowed today, the depth of story would be lost. Saying goodbye to The Bill for many Australians was like saying goodbye to an old friend. It was a poignant television show which became the mother of all police dramas, both Australian and English, that have branched from its concept. It seems that none that tried following in its footsteps did quite as well. Twenty-seven years for one show is no mean feat. I would like to see if any of the reality TV shows that we have to endure today will do nearly half as well. Riverina for their contributions. To be able to talk about the arts is a fantastic thing. We do not do enough of it in this parliament. I say to the Member for Moreton, to be criticised by some journalist for appearing to be flippant with this motion totally misses the point. I love the arts. I think if I had my life again, if I had enough talent, I would devote it to the arts. I might not be very rich in terms of money but I would certainly be very rich in terms of the spirit. In fact, I am currently directing my 16th musical, and I look forward to that going on in budget week whilst trying to match all the other responsibilities I have. I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate Tasmanian Regional Arts. It plays an important role in supporting both regional and community based arts practices in my home state of Tasmania. The organisation is unique in that it is the only state-wide arts service organisation in Australia funded by the Australian government’s Australia Council that is located in a regional centre-indeed, in the historic township of Latrobe, in my electorate of Braddon. As a membership driven organisation, Tasmanian Regional Arts aims to excite and inspire regional communities through its work. The Tasmanian Regional Arts program of activities in 2011 is significant for what it does with limited resources. For example, the organisation provides information and advocacy support services; delivers an access and touring program to a wide variety of non-managed community run venues throughout Tassie; provides information and community arts support staff in our three major locations throughout Tasmania; and administers the important Commonwealth Regional Arts Fund. In 2010 TRA brilliantly proved it could also produce significant arts products when it staged the seventh Regional Arts Australia national conference in Launceston. This conference, the largest arts conference in Australia, also played host to the Junction Arts Festival, where more than 47 major exhibitions, performances and activities engaged the host community and visitor alike and provided an economic boost of nearly $3 million to Tasmania’s regional economy. MAIN COMMITTEE",296,Private Members Business
320,Mr Sidebottom (Braddon) (6.38 Pm),"I congratulate the members for Moreton andTasmanian Regional Arts intends to continue to develop on the Junction 2010 legacy in the state’s north through future participatory arts festivals of the highest calibre. Tasmanian Regional Arts plays a key role in the delivery of Commonwealth support to the regions through its management of the Regional Arts Fund. Indeed, this program supports local and regional artists to access resources through a three-tiered program of assistance that is both relevant and cost-effective in its delivery. I have been advised through representations from Tasmania Regional Arts that through its national agency, Regional Arts Australia, the organisation believes the current delivery mechanisms for the fund through the state agencies is a preferred delivery model for the fund and that the Regional Arts Fund, along with other programs such as Playing Australia and Festivals Australia continue to be delivered under current arrangements. Tasmanian Regional Arts recognises the need to diversify and expand its income and revenue streams in response to the limitations facing all levels of government in supporting the arts. I strongly commend TRA for its success in securing a broad range of state and local government partnerships, as well as significant philanthropic support and sponsorship for its program of activities. Through the delivery of initiatives such as the Regional Arts Fund, ongoing festival and event developments, a strong and creative touring program and the provision of the regional arts development offices, Tasmanian Regional Arts has played and continues to play a significant role in arts and cultural development across my state. I thank TRA for the excellent work it does on what is a limited budget. Finally, I would like to thank all of those artists in Australia who provide entertainment and their skills for us. Indeed, they are a conscience and a mirror of what makes Australia what it is. I would like to thank in particular all those artists who live in regional Australia and provide their services and their skills to those of us in regional Australia. I know regional Australia is very much like where I live: very talented people enjoying their lifestyle and supporting their communities. We, as the government, should do all we can to support them and to make their job a lot easier. I thank them for their contribution. on a subject that I am extremely passionate about-that is, the promotion of the arts. It takes me back to my childhood days, in particular some of the first television shows that I recall on Australian television.

The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. Tourism Funding Debate resumed, on motion by Mr Baldwin: That the House: (1) condemns the Rudd-Gillard Government for: (a) reducing funding for Tourism Australia at a time when the high Australian dollar is putting pressure on local tourism operators; and (b) increasing business costs for local tourism operators through: (i) higher tourism taxes; (ii) the bungled award modernisation; and (iii) additional superannuation guarantee payments which will be entirely funded by employers; and (2) calls on the Rudd-Gillard Government to match the Coalition’s commitment to increase tourism funding by $100 million to: (a) focus on high-yielding business events tourists; (b) build stronger research foundations; (c) encourage tourism infrastructure and product development; and (d) boost domestic tourism marketing. that the shadow minister for tourism, Mr Baldwin, has moved that this House, among a number of other things, essentially condemns the Gillard Labor government for its refusal to take Australia’s tourism industry seriously and, worse than that, for the fact that the Australian tourism industry under the four years that the Labor Party has been in power has suffered as poor policy decision after poor policy decision has taken effect. In the previous parliament I had the unique privilege of being the shadow tourism minister. I have the genuine privilege of representing the part of Australia that is referred to as Australia’s premier holiday playground-that, of course, being Australia’s Gold Coast, a city of around 500,000 people. My electorate of Moncrieff has one of the highest percentages of population reliant on the tourism industry as their principal source of employment in the country. Tourism drives hundreds of millions of dollars, indeed billions of dollars, of investment in my city. Australia’s tourism industry is one of the nation’s great employers. It employs nearly 500,000 Australians, it is an industry worth around $86 billion and it generates around $24 billion of exports. It is the very kind of industry that we as a nation should be embracing, fostering and nurturing to ensure that it continues to drive export income for this nation, continues to create employment pathways for young Australians and continues to showcase Australia to the world. MAIN COMMITTEE",299,Private Members Business

340,Mr Ciobo (Moncrieff) (6.49 Pm),"I am certainly pleased to rise to speak to the motionThat is the aspiration. It comes off a long period of great success by the former coalition government when we invested, after a number of policy decisions and a number of budgets, large amounts of funding and provided support and incentives to and nurturing of the Australian tourism industry to help it achieve great outcomes. It was the previous coalition government that brought about, in large measure, one the greatest outcomes for the tourism industry: the development and implementation of a tourism white paper. That white paper, under the former Minister for Small Business and Tourism, Joe Hockey, provided the opportunity for Australia’s tourism industry to capitalise on its potential. It saw investment by government into all manner of new product, into new pathways for the commercialisation of product and, in addition to that, into real opportunities to increase Australia’s tourism marketing spend, domestically and globally, to capitalise on the huge demand that exists to understand Australia and Australians. That is where we have come from, but in the four short years that the Labor Party has been in power it has turned its back on Australia’s tourism industry. There is no doubt that for all the talk-and the Labor Party is big on talk-about tourism being a vital industry to country the Australian Labor Party has done nothing except put roadblocks in the way of Australia’s tourism industry. I know members opposite like to claim they support Australia’s tourism industry, but if that is truly the case why was it that in its first budget the Australian Labor Party took a number of policy positions that not only made it substantially more difficult for Australia’s tourism industry to prosper but in fact, as a direct consequence, deteriorated its position? In particular, it was under the former Rudd government, now the Gillard Labor government, that a host of new taxes and tax increases were imposed on the tourism industry. Let me put this in the context of the global downturn. We know that the Australian dollar is basically at parity with the US dollar and that the Australian dollar has been rising consistently for a number of years. Despite the fact that for every cent the Australian dollar rises Australia’s tourism industry, when it comes to the export of tourism, is less competitive, the government have done nothing to assist the tourism industry. In fact, they have done worse than nothing. In a previous budget, the Labor government cut funding for Australia’s principal tourism marketing body, Tourism Australia, by some $13½ million in real terms. They have actually cut the amount of money made available to the national tourism body to market Australia abroad. In addition, the Labor government introduced a host of industrial relations reforms that have made it more expensive for young Aussies to get a start in the tourism industry and for employers to take the risk of employing new staff. Under the award modernisation process that this government put in place, as a direct consequence of what is effectively ridiculous award processes, there is a requirement to pay penalty rates. Under this government’s regime, in its first iteration, that would have seen penalty rates applying after 7 pm for restaurant workers. This government has made Australia’s tourism industry less competitive. The people who pay the price are the young Australians who, ordinarily, would get a job in the tourism industry. The people who pay a price are those employers who would risk their capitalquite pathetic to hear Labor Party members yelling out: ‘Work Choices, Work Choices.’ The truth is that, with respect to Australia’s tourism industry, Work Choices never did to the potenMAIN COMMITTEE",300,Private Members Business

342,Mr Ciobo,"those people who would take the opportunity to actually employ staff. It istial of young Australians what the Labor Party is doing to them now. To all of those businesses that no longer open on a Sunday, to all those businesses that now close their doors early during the week, to all those businesses that have fewer staff on the books because of the penalty rates they have to pay, sure, the Labor Party can say to those who still have a job: ‘We’ve looked after you.’ But there are now so many more people who simply do not have a job. I have someone in my own electorate who is part of the tourism industry. He is a cafe owner-he is actually an immigrant-who used to open seven days a week, but who now closes on Sundays because, as he said to me, it is simply uneconomic for him to open as a direct consequence of the new penalty rates. In that one cafe, in my electorate, six staff have lost their employment on a Sunday as a direct consequence of the new penalty rates. That is but one example. What is clear, though, is that this is a government which, when it comes to tourism policy, is just like a cork on the ocean, bobbing and blowing in each and every direction. It is not really the focus of the Minister for Tourism. He has been completely preoccupied for a number of years with the Resources and Energy portfolio. Perhaps that lay behind the decision of the current Gillard Labor government to have a quasi tourism minister in the form of the new outer ministry tourism minister. In addition to this lack of actual policy direction when it comes to the tourism industry, we on this side of the House recognise a missed opportunity-a massive missed opportunity to invest more money into developing Australia’s tourism industry. The coalition took to the last election a tourism policy that actually would have seen the investment of an additional $100 million in Australia’s tourism industry, with a specific focus on business events tourism. That is the highest yielding part of the Australian tourism industry-a real job creator, a real export earner and a part of the tourism industry that Australia has a huge competitive advantage in. With the creation of the policy that we took to the last election and with the actual application of that policy, had we been in government, I have no doubt that we would have created thousands of jobs, created incentives for tens of thousands of additional tourists to come to this country and created a very high-yielding, generally longer term stay Australian tourism industry. The simple inescapable reality is that members opposite are unable to actually stand and enunciate what Labor’s tourism policy is. For all intents and purposes, it has only been status quo. For a brief moment we had a lot of focus coming from the Labor Party about their long term tourism strategy but, apart from the creation of a few interdepartmental committees and a couple of new committees that have been appointed by the minister, not a single dollar of funding has flowed as a result of the long-term tourism strategy. There have been no new initiatives with respect to the rollout beyond, as I said, the creation of some bodies and, as a consequence, the Australian tourism industry is poorer. This has been, unfortunately, a very sad chapter of lost opportunity. It has been a sad chapter of a government that refuses to invest in one of the largest job creators and one of the principal export industries that our nation has. And, above all, this has been four long years of massive missed opportunity for Australia’s tourism industry to rise up, create employment, create export income and, for that reason, I support the motion.

343,Mr Georganas (Hindmarsh) (6.59 Pm),"I rise to speak against the motion, moved bystrong support from this government. The tourism industry is a significant part of the Australian economy. It provides jobs in metropolitan areas, regional areas, remote areas and places where people live, including in the Hindmarsh electorate, which I represent. Many visitors to SA arrive first in my electorate-almost 550,000 domestic and 44,000 international passengers a month pass through Adelaide airport, which is smack bang in the middle of my electorate of Hindmarsh. Visitors to South Australia support 77,000 jobs and contribute $2.3 billion to the South Australian economy. Glenelg and the coastline from Somerton Park right through to Semaphore South, Tennyson, West Beach and Grange-all those beachside suburbs-all form part of my electorate. Of course, they are Adelaide’s iconic tourism destinations, with visitors making big contributions to the local community. Glenelg, one particular suburb, is just one example of a number of tourism regions across Australia which are marketed not just by the local businesses but by the local councils, the state tourism organisations and Tourism Australia. It is a region that is supported by the Gillard government’s implementation of the National Long Term Tourism Strategy. This strategy builds on stronger research foundations and it encourages further tourism investment in infrastructure and new products. communities like Glenelg can continue to benefit from the tourism dollar. The Labor government has done its bit by retaining tourism marketing and funding for tourism across Australia across the forward estimates. But that is not the half of it. Australian governments, excluding local councils, spend more than $500 million annually on tourism marketing. This directly contributes to the strength of our tourism industry, an industry which grew by 3.2 per cent in 2010 to contribute an extra $34 billion to Australia’s GDP. The tourism industry has received direct relief and recovery support as a result of the Queensland floods and cyclone, including an exclusive sectorspecific $10 million tourism support package-$5 million has been provided by the federal government and $5 million by the Queensland government. The majority of the funds will be used to support immediate marketing initiatives to reinforce the message that the majority of Queensland’s iconic tourism destinations are open for business, and to counter negative perceptions resulting from that extensive national and international reporting of the floods and Cyclone Yasi. A proportion will also be spent on industry development measures. And let us not forget that industry benefits from the extensive Commonwealth government support provided beyond Tourism Australia. This government has committed $660 million to improve workforce skills, education and training. This is an area that was absolutely neglected by the previous government, and this will benefit the 500,500 people directly employed in tourism. The employers in the sector have also benefited from improvements to workplace relations laws. After over 100 years of fragmented workplace relations laws this government has delivered a single national system for around 96 per cent of the private sector, and that includes tourism. That was done by reducing almost 4,000 complex outdated awards into 122 MAIN COMMITTEE",302,Private Members Business
344,Mr Ciobo,How?,303,Private Members Business
345,Mr Georganas,"The member opposite asks, ‘How?’ and we will come to that. Localmodern instruments. We have provided a net benefit to Australian businesses of around $4.83 billion over the 10 years. Through our $660 million investment, the Gillard government recognises the tourism industry’s need for a highly skilled and educated workforce. Developing the workforce is at the very heart of this government’s plan to build an economy that will meet the challenges of the future. Skilling the nation’s workforce and addressing any emerging skill shortages are critical to Australia’s prosperity in the long term. That is why this government is boosting the skills of Australians and has embarked on one of the most ambitious reform agendas to reshape the apprentice and training sector. Perhaps we would not be in this position had the former government actually done something about skilling Australia’s workforce. To achieve this, the government is investing heavily in the skills of the current and future workforce by providing practical helpmorrow. Our investment will underwrite our future prosperity as a nation and provide individual Australians with the opportunities to realise their very full potential. This is in stark contrast to the coalition, who for a decade, as I said earlier, failed to invest in the skills that our nation needed. This government is getting on with the job. I certainly am. We do not have the skilled workforce to fill positions in those jobs where skills are in short supply because of the neglect of the coalition government over 10 years. The tourism industry also has benefited from the $8.5 billion we have committed for nationally significant transport infrastructure, which feeds into tourism, and the $355 million in funding for rural and remote councils through the Roads to Recovery program, which helps, for example, the 47 million domestic visitors travelling by car and the grey nomads, who spend anywhere between six days and 73 days on the road. By providing this critical infrastructure, which was so neglected by the previous government, we are helping businesses to grow and to recover. The tourism industry is resilient. Businesses have a profit motive to recover quickly from the likes of floods, cyclones and a whole range of other disasters. So certain business people in the industry are saying that, despite a number of hotels in Brisbane closing following the floods, they expect the market to recover well. The casino in Cairns, restaurants in Townsville and airports and attractions are now open and trading. Figures released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics on 8 February show that 2010 was a good year for Australia’s international tourism. The international tourism industry grew, with arrivals growing by 5.4 per cent on the previous year, to a total of 5.9 million in 2010. This positive full-year result was assisted by strong growth in arrivals in December 2010, up 4.4 per cent on the same period in 2009. In 2010 arrivals from China, South Korea and Japan were particularly strong-up 20 per cent from China, up 18.2 per cent from South Korea and up 12 per cent from Japan. So they are all good figures. Continuing to appeal to our international visitors will be particularly important for Australia’s $34 billion tourism industry in 2011, following the negative perceptions created by the floods and Cyclone Yasi.

350,Mr Georganas,"The member opposite asks if I am talking about the tourism industry.It is the support for tourism by this Gillard government which delivered Australia the successful Oprah Winfrey visit. By bringing 302 of her audience members to Australia for a week, Oprah Winfrey lifted the profile of Australia in ways that we have not seen before. Audience members visited every state and territory and more than 700 hours of footage was taken to produce four hours of prime time TV. The Oprah show is viewed by 40 million US viewers a week and is broadcast into 145 countries around the world. Before the show was even aired, it had paid for itself many times over, with international coverage from the time the trip was announced totalling more than 3,000 stories, having an equivalent advertising value of just over $20 million, and domestic coverage in Australia exceeding 70,000 stories, valued at more than $140 million. The Gillard government has provided strong support towards the growth of the Australian tourism industry. It will continue to provide the support the industry needs to remain globally competitive. My electorate, which has suburbs like Glenelg and the beachside suburbs, will benefit greatly from this government’s support of tourism. support the private members’ bill that was put forward today by the shadow minister for regional development and the shadow minister for tourism. The first thing I would like to bring to the attention of this chamber is the fact that when the member made the very valid point that, with the Gillard government’s spending skyrocketing from $272 billion of taxpayers’ money to $352 billion of taxpayers’ money, at the same time the funding for Australian tourism has been reduced, effectively, by $13.5 million. So let us not have any question raised as to whether or not or who is doing what. This government has reduced its support for one of the most important industries in Australia. The industry is earning export dollars every day for real Australians. The member for Capricornia, in an endeavour to take the mud off the face of the government, suggested that this government was doing wonderful things for tourism. In fact, she was able to cite an institution in her electorate-namely, the Henderson Park part of the Hedlow Lodge group-and informed the chamber that they had done so well under this government that they had received a grant of $100,000. CanI bring the truth to this chamber by pointing out that the $100,000 that was granted to that establishment in fact was granted under the Australian Tourism Development Program, in round 5, in 2007, before the election. That program, of course, was put together by the hard working members of the then Howard government. So let us not have any doubt as to whether or not this current government is reducing funding for the Australian tourism industry. It certainly is, at a time when the Australian tourism industry needs as much help as it can get. Apart from the natural disasters down the eastern seaboard of Australia, tourism is being hit with an Australian dollar that is also on parity with the US. That makes it very difficult for potential overseas visitors to make a decision to come to Australia. They could just as easily decide to go to America now because the dollar value is about the same. It is a long way to come, Down Under, albeit that the rewards are fantastic. Those who are really, really brave will even go to Tasmania occasionally. There is a lot to see down there, but you only need a very short period of time. However, what is important is that we understand the hurdles that have to be jumped by the tourism industry here in Australia. We have had the global financial crisis.

We have an approvals process in this country today that is almost insurmountable. Members of the tourism industry who have in the past been at the forefront of the industry in making investment in this country are now saying to me, ‘Anywhere but Australia.’ In a fraction of the time, anywhere in Asia, on the Indian subcontinent, in parts of Africa and South America, they can put their applications in for development and in half the time have that institution up and running. It is a sad indictment of Australian departments that we have placed such onerous restrictions on developers in this country. We do need the product. The government are doing nothing to promote the construction of product. They have cut the Australian Tourism Development Program. Why, I do not know, when we all know that we need those facilities constructed to encourage tourism to this country. It has already been mentioned in this debate that some of the international media has cast a very dark shadow on tourism to Australia. I can tell you, Madam Deputy Speaker, that Carnarvon, badly hit by floods, is up and running. Doors are open and they are extending a warm welcome to visitors from anywhere, especially domestic tourists. That is what we need in Australia right now-Australians to take their holiday in Australia. Forget about the overseas holiday now. Holiday in Australia.

That is a reality and we are not going to go back and fix it at the cabinet table. The dollar is the dollar and we have to deal with it, the tourism industry has to deal with it, and we have to be able to attract people with the price of the dollar as it is. I think the honourable member said he was going to come to Tasmania for a holiday, and I commend him for that; it is a great opportunity for him. We heard the contribution from the former shadow minister for tourism, the member for Moncrieff, who has now landed on the back bench. He was sacked from that position. Back in the Howard days, we had ‘Where the bloody hell are you?’, the greatest failure in the history of tourism campaigns in this country. It was a dismal failure. Where would we be if we had that sort of approach today? With regard to the training issue, Mr Ciobo, the member for the Gold Coasthis answer to the tourism industry. This is Liberal policy: to sort out the price of the dollar, the answer is to cut wages and conditions in the tourism sector-or continue to bring people into Australia so they can pay them less instead of providing training. This government is training people in the tourism sector. We want to give any Australian who wants to work in tourism the chance to get a start, get some training, work and have the opportunity of a career in that industry. That is what we should be doing, and that is what this government is doing, something that was totally neglected by the last coalition government. We need to think about what tourism brings to this country. I understand the value of the industry is about $42 billion per year. This government is giving great support to the industry, and the Minister for Tourism, Martin Ferguson, has come to the electorate of Lyons on many occasions. He is a very great minister. He understands local tourism, not just the big end of the industry, and that it is something you need to build up. The honourable member for MAIN COMMITTEE",305,Private Members Business

I wanted to address some of the issues raised by the member for the Gold Coast. Tourism funding in Australia has not been cut by the Gillard government. That was a total misrepresentation. The budget for Tourism Australia has been retained right across the forward estimates. That can be looked at; it is all there. We are continuing to provide the full support. We provided support during the global financial crisis. We took a decision to bring forward $9 million in Tourism Australia’s budget, which was more than matched by their commercial partners: that $9 million was turned into $20 million to assist the tourism sector. This government is doing what it has to do to support this sector. I am very disappointed by the member for Paterson’s motion before us today. That decision really gave a boost to the domestic business and leisure travel markets in Australia. During the global financial crisis, when global travel declined by four per cent internationally, Australia’s market remained steady, supported by this government-a remarkable result. So this motion is really off the mark. It does not add up, and nothing that has been said by members on the other side comes together at all. This government supports a strong tourism sector, with good training so that the sector has good, skilled people. (Time expired) pired.

357,The Deputy Speaker (Ms S Bird),"Order! The time allotted for this debate has exLiverpool City Council made a decision to close down or relocate public libraries in Miller, Green Valley, Moorebank and Casula. I am happy to inform members of the House that those very same councillors have now backflipped and have used the first council meeting of the year to reverse their plan. It took months of campaigning by local residents, with the support of Labor councillors and the state member for Liverpool, Mr Paul Lynch, for the individuals in question to realise that they simply cannot take away such valuable resources from the community. What particularly ignited the local residents to fight was the fact that their views and needs were not being taken into account as there was no community consultation prior to the original decision being taken. The result of this ballot is a true victory for local people, a triumph for common sense and, importantly, a demonstration of what a community can do through commitment and conviction. The message from local residents was clear from the very beginning: libraries are so important to local residents that they are worth fighting for. Most of us think of a library as a quiet and peaceful environment in which to study, conduct research or attend various classes and workshops. But for some people a library is a place to have access to resources, particularly computer technology that is necessary to complete school work and other tasks such as accessing online job applications. The fact is that some parents do not have the financial capacity to provide their kids with the resources to give them the best opportunity to learn and so their best chance for the future. Unfortunately, this is a reality for many parents in some of the less privileged areas of Western Sydney. Local libraries by their very nature are particularly significant to students, most importantly those in their final years of schooling. Allowing each student the best possible opportunity to reach their potential is a social responsibility. In some cases, providing resources in public areas such as libraries is simply essential. In areas with high levels of community housing, where most people have limited access to personal space for study, the local library takes on an even more significance. Clearly, local libraries are an invaluable space for individuals to study, to undertake tutoring and to complete work tasks in a quiet and peaceful environment with fewer distractions. The battle to keep libraries in the Liverpool area open brought to light a number of stories from individuals whose views were clearly not taken into account by the councillors who made the decision in the first place. One particular story was highlighted by a letter from a 10year-old girl, Zeinab Afiouni, who wrote to a colleague of mine, the Mayor of Liverpool City Council, Wendy Waller, pleading for her library not to be closed as she said it was ‘her favourite place in the world’. She said reading was her favourite activity, and closing the library would make her very ‘sad and angry’. And that was a fact for a lot of young people. I commend the Labor councillors of Liverpool City Council and the state member, Mr Paul Lynch, for standing up for their community and assisting local residents to win a battle that was all about their kids’ future. However, I strongly believe it should not have taken many months of community backlash, media pressure and, I might add, the onset of a state election campaign to overturn the closing of local libraries. Such an anti-community initiative should never, ever have been contemplated in the first place. It was taking away something of such value to the community, particularly a community that in many instances has not been dealt the best hand in life. Local libraries are significant for everyone from preschoolers through to MAIN COMMITTEE",307,Private Members Business

To take them away goes against common sense and any commitment to advancing the real needs of local communities. I am extremely proud of local members for what they have been able to achieve and I am extremely proud of my community for standing up for what they regard as significance community values. tion to the role of public libraries in Australia, without having the specific knowledge to comment on the matters within the city of Liverpool. I thank the member for Fowler for his contribution to that broad space. I want to make two points in relation to libraries in Australia. The first is about the role of the library in the modern age. The traditional role as simply a conservator and lender of books remains, but in the digital age there is a dramatically different role, task, function and facility. I know this first hand, having witnessed my young daughter at the library. She is now a prep year student, having begun primary school this year, but she had a lot of education, along with children throughout the Mornington Peninsula, in early reading and gaining a love for reading in the local library. This is not something that you would imagine or expect as a nonparent. It is something that is exceptionally important and of real value. It is about creating a culture and an environment in which children can learn to love books, to love reading and to love the world of imagination and ideas. That is fundamental to a lifetime of literacy, which is undoubtedly an almost indispensable prerequisite for comfort and achievement in modern society. Many people have overcome the barrier of illiteracy, but it is a huge barrier. It is one of the great untold barriers. Libraries are bulwarks against illiteracy. They are a safe place where many of those who are underprivileged have a real chance to learn in an environment which is not going to be judgmental. The workplace can be frightening for people who get to adulthood and do not have literacy skills. It remains an ongoing challenge. One of the great roles of public libraries going forward is not just as a place for young people, although that is indispensable, not just as a repository for books but as a front line in the war against illiteracy for adults. It is a great social challenge. The second element of public libraries which I want to address is in relation to one very specific issue, and that is autism. Over the course of the last few years, through people such as Helen Lloyd, a mother in my electorate who worked to provide services and raise funds for her son Jordan, I have become more engaged-as every member in this place would-with the problem of autism. I have increasingly become engaged with Autism Victoria. They service over 30,000 Victorians. There are many more whom they do not service. We know that, depending on where the definition of autism starts and ends, around 200,000 people in Australia suffer from autism. It can be deeply debilitating or it can be something that can be addressed at an early age through very targeted early intervention. Last week, late in the week, I went to Abacus Learning Centre in Hastings, in my electorate. I worked with Michael Moore and others who are part of Abacus. They are part of the process of providing early literacy skills, early adaptation skills for preschool children with autism spectrum disorder. Part of the challenge is to ensure that there is adequate literature tailored specifically to these children and to the parents of these children. In that respect, Autism Victoria is putting together the 1000 Books Campaign. It is a campaign which I have become involved in in a very modest way. There are many others who are doing much more. This campaign is about a recognition that parents of children with autism are hungry for MAIN COMMITTEE",308,Private Members Business
359,Mr Hunt (Flinders) (7.24 Pm),"I rise to support the general tenor of this motion in relaknowledge about something which is confronting and challenging. It can cause them to doubt their skills as parents. It can cause them to worry about the future facing their children. The 1000 Books Campaign is not about a mass of money. It is about developing a resource. We will work with the Victorian government and also with the Commonwealth government. It will be one of the two destinations for any funds that we raise in a 500-kilometre walk for autism that I am doing around the electorate later this year. Abacus will be the other recipient. Public libraries are vital in the battle against illiteracy, but the specific public library campaign in relation to autism, the 1000 Books Campaign, will be fundamental going forward. and Settlement Services) (7.30 pm)-As a representative of part of the Liverpool municipality-and the son of the man who left school at 13 years of age and who educated himself through school of arts libraries, which preceded public libraries, and left state parliament widely regarded as the best-read person in the New South Wales parliament-I very much congratulate my colleague for bringing this resolution forward. The Australian Library and Information Association has heralded next year as the year of public libraries so it is ironic that this year Liverpool Council-an organisation with 6,000 members which acknowledges that in this country we have 183 million library items, 10 million inquiries a year and 8½ thousand personal computers with internet access at 7,000 libraries-a Liberal controlled council, has moved in this fashion. Like my colleague, I am pleased that they are retracting their position. But it has not been without a very significant public campaign by the minority Labor councillors in that organisation and by the state member for Liverpool, Paul Lynch. Libraries are indeed of great value to society. The Australian Library and Information Association has cited an international survey of over 27 countries which says that where there is a book in the home there is improved educational outcomes for children, especially among disadvantaged families. As the member for Fowler said, this is an area that does have a degree of public deprivation because of public housing. It is also a high-migration area and these books are not in many homes. People depend, more than in any other area, on access to public libraries. Libraries are also an outing for many people. They are an area where people can socially interface. They are available for family history searches and for book clubs. On a broader front, they are certainly at the cutting edge, in this day and age, of skills acquisition. They work closely with schools and they are crucial-and this is going to be a focus of next year’s year of public libraries-for family literacy and encouraging entire families to access these facilities. They are also about public spaces-meeting places where organisations that cannot afford to elsewhere can actually get rooms at cheap prices. They are also a refuge from stress for many people. It is alright for the Liverpool city councillors, driving in their cars, to say that you can have a centralised institution which might be slightly larger, or whatever, than these four public libraries they threaten. But many people in this area do not have car transport and do not have access to public transport. There was an example given of one person who would have to use three forms of public transport to get to this megalith they were going to construct as the municipality’s loan library. MAIN COMMITTEE",309,Private Members Business
360,Mr Laurie Ferguson (Werriwa,"Parliamentary Secretary for Multicultural AffairsIn Britain there has also been a debate about public libraries. There was a threat to 450 of them. The Guardian, the British daily paper, on 11 February this year said, about libraries: In short, they are civilised, unlike the people who are deciding their fate. Quite frankly, that is very true of the Liverpool councillors. There is no other place in this country where a council would sit around and come up with this kind of concept. It is the same council, which, alone in this country when everyone else was getting behind the flood effort in Queensland, wanted to play partisan politics about the raising of flood money. It was the only place I know which refused to contribute to the Queensland Premier’s flood appeal because it did not trust the Queensland government. That is the kind of mentality that we have in this council. SoI am pleased that the member for Fowler has brought this forward. It is crucial that libraries are available. I saw a figure quoted by the member for Fowler-other figures have quoted an even higher usage rate-that libraries have 10 million members in this country. Ten million Australians are members of public libraries. It is crucial that the councillors of Liverpool are held to this defeat, this backdown. I understand that they are making it slightly conditional to save themselves some face. They are placing certain conditions-that they will keep these libraries as long as this or that happens. The public has spoken. There has been a broad coalition of people throughout the municipality who have seen a very stark need for this library system and the council must be held to their word in the months ahead. I firmly believe in the importance of public libraries for communities across Australia. Again, I do not know about the Liverpool situation, but it is good to see that our members in New South Wales are supporting public libraries. My older sister, Lucy Irons, is a librarian and I know that the Speaker, the Deputy Speaker and I have been advocating the importance of teachers and librarians in schools. Lucy is currently employed with Vision Australia and her role as a librarian is very important to her. I remember growing up reading books around the family house because we had no television as youngsters, but our hallway was lined with bookshelves and my memory tells me that the first serious novel I read was Beau Geste. My parents joined the family up as a member of Box Hill Library and many books were borrowed in the early years of my life. I am happy to say that we also returned those books. There are 36 public libraries in my electorate of Swan. These consist of school, university and community libraries that cater for all residents of Swan. The valuable services they offer include books for recreation and information, newspapers and magazines, reference resources including encyclopaedias and directories, access to the state library website and a range of online databases, internet facilities, large print books, books and other resources in 50 community languages other than English, resources for learning a language, community and local history information and photocopying facilities. There are resources and services for all age groups. These are all things that we find as standard that we should have access to, but a lot of people in lower socioeconomic areas just do not have the facilities or the resources to get that information. Last year I was invited to attend the Belmont public library along with local residents on a night that was designed to promote reading and the benefits of doing so to young boys. It was good to be involved with and also witness such a worthwhile event. I, together with Sally Carbon-the well-known sportswoman, author and World Cup and Olympic gold medallist MAIN COMMITTEE",310,Private Members Business

It was a fantastic night and it was finished off with pizza and sandwiches which the attending young boys and parents enjoyed. I would now like to talk about a project in my electorate at the WA Association for the Blind called Beyond Books, Beyond Barriers. The Beyond Books, Beyond Barriers library project will transform the way the association store and supply their library’s audio resources. Their current collection of books on cassette will be changed into a collection of digital, downloadable audio book files. This means that they will no longer have rows of shelving holding hundreds of different talking book containers that are ready for posting throughout WA. Instead, their books will all be saved on a large computer server. Any of their borrowers who have access to the internet and the right assistive technology will be able to search their user-friendly catalogue and select and download the books they want. For those people without access to the internet, the library will download digital books onto a cartridge and post those to their borrowers for use on a dedicated talking book player. Their books will be totally accessible for use on any mainstream MP3 player, including devices such as mobile phones and personal digital assistants. In addition, these books will be produced according to a special MP3 file format known as DAISY, which is a worldwide standard developed specifically for people who have a print disability. The advantage of this format is that, if the books are played using DAISY software on a computer or using a specialised DAISY player, added features can be used, such as the ability to insert bookmarks or to easily move around within chapters or sections of a book. Another exciting aspect of the project is the development of a production on demand service. This service has the potential to make thousands of titles available that would otherwise be inaccessible to people who are unable to read printed materials. The service will take an etext document from within the public domain and convert it into an alternative format of choice, including Braille, large print and audio.

On the question of funding of public libraries, in October 2010 the Western Australian Liberal minister for culture and the arts, John Day, announced that the WA Liberal government would allow the State Library to use a new more equitable funding model for determining the allocation for each local government to purchase materials for their local public libraries. This change in policy will result in an efficient allocation of public funds and more transparency in their approach and process.

362,The Deputy Speaker (Ms S Bird),"Order! The time allotted for this debate has exDefence Housing as an Immigration Detention Facility Debate resumed, on motion by Mr Robert: That this House: (1) notes that: (a) Defence Housing Australia (DHA) is the professional manager of Defence houses; (b) the Department of Defence still retains over 1,650 homes that have not been handed over to DHA; and (c) the Government is using some of these 1,650 homes, notably over 50 at Inverbrackie, as a detention facility to house Irregular Maritime Arrivals (IMA), rather than Defence families; and (2) calls on the Government to: (a) cease using Defence housing as an immigration detention facility; (b) hand over all houses managed by the Department of Defence to DHA; and (c) categorically state that it will not acquire the homes of Defence families for the purpose of housing the ever increasing number of IMA arriving in Australia as a result of the Government’s soft border protection policies. lies right now-15,770 of them are owned or leased by the Defence Housing Authority or DHA, and 2,383 were owned by the Department of Defence as at Halloween last year, 31 October. Of the 2,383 houses owned by the department, 20 per cent or 446 are not being used to house Defence families. They are either vacant, being renovated or being used for other purposes. It may come as a surprise to the people of this nation but those purposes now include housing irregular maritime arrivals-boat people, those seeking refugee status. Indeed, 81 of the Defence houses in Inverbrackie in South Australia are being used for this purpose. This motion therefore calls on the government now, today, to cease using Defence houses as an immigration detention facility, to hand over all house management to the Defence Housing Authority and to state categorically, without equivocation, that Defence houses will be used for Defence personnel, their spouses, families and children and not as detention facilities for the ever increasing number of IMAs. By way of history, it is a statement of fact that during the 2010 federal election a ministerial submission from the Department of Defence to the then Minister for Defence outlined plans to shift Defence families from their homes in order to house those seeking asylum, or IMAs. The letter was obtained by the Australian newspaper. The submission went into significant detail about how this might be accomplished and included time lines, costs and the proposal to transfer Defence land to the Department of Immigration and Citizenship. Reports suggested that 162 Defence members and their families would have to move to inferior housing to make way for those seeking asylum at Darwin’s Berrimah Defence establishment. Clearly, and as was to be expected, this was later refuted by the government. The government, in shock and denial, said the proposal came from the Department of Defence. It is clearly obvious to even the most casual observer of such matters that the Department of Defence would be the last to propose such an idea without ministerial authority. It is ludicrous and indeed misleading to suggest otherwise. Many have tried in the past to persuade Defence to give up or otherwise sell off surplus land or assets, and those people will testify quite clearly that it is like pushing a very large rock uphill. To think for one moment that DeMAIN COMMITTEE",312,Private Members Business
363,Mr Robert (Fadden) (7.40 Pm),"There are 18,153 houses available for Defence famifence would voluntarily suggest that it would give up its land to another department is simply fooling ourselves and treating the Australian people like mugs. The Labor government’s defence on the matter during the election campaign was similarly weak. It failed to categorically rule out the prospect of ever using any more Defence housing for accommodating asylum seekers. I could go on, but let me put on the record, clearly and unequivocally, for the Australian people: the coalition will not move Defence families from their homes in order to house those seeking asylum. I cannot think of anything worse for Defence families and members, their children and their spouses-having already given so much to serve our land and its uniformthan having, in effect, to pay for the Labor government’s failed border protection policy by having to leave their homes. The coalition will not put up with it. We will not stand for it. We will fight assiduously against it. It has long been said, with regard to managing our borders, that the coalition had a problem and created a solution-to the point where, on 24 November 2007, only four children were in detention. That number is now over 600. Whereas the current government abandoned the solution and created a massive problem-pull factors that have now pulled over 200 boats and nearly 8,000 people to our shores seeking asylum. The problem is getting bigger, and there is no solution. In the words of the Prime Minister, in a different life, maybe: ‘Another boat, another policy failure.’ Every day we hear that the Christmas Island detention facility is at or over capacity. Thousands more people seeking asylum are moved onshore and housed in motels, all at taxpayer expense. It was only a week ago that the Gillard Labor government said that an additional $290 million would be needed to fund its failed border protection policy, in addition to the $470 million already budgetedalmost $¾ billion for a problem they created. Can you imagine what $¾ billion could actually fund? It could almost fund half the levy this government is going to foist on the Australian population. By comparison, the coalition, in its last year of government, spent less than $100 million. This is a failure of this government of the most categorical terms. Defence families, defence land and defence housing are now paying the price for that failure. Given that the Gillard Labor government seems quite unwilling to adopt the coalition’s highly successful border protection policies, measures now need to be taken to ensure that defence families are not left to pay for the failures of this government. Ms Saffin-Like Tampa. ately provide a guarantee-immediately, member for Page-in this parliament to the people of this nation, to all defence personnel and to their families that they will not be required to move from their homes for the purposes of the accommodating those seeking asylum. Members of the ADF and their families need that level of categorical assurance. They deserve that assurance from this government. After all, we do not know whether or not this policy is still being kicked around in the back halls of Russell Hill and in the Department of Immigration and Citizenship. MAIN COMMITTEE",313,Private Members Business
364,Mr Robert,"It is for this reason that I call on the Gillard Labor government to immediIn the middle of last year, when the issue hit the radio waves, the ministerial submission went as far as to list possible sites in Western Australia and Victoria that may be suitable. In fact, none of them are suitable, but the plans were well developed. In July last year it was reported by senior Defence sources that plans were well advanced for Maygar Barracks in Broadmeadow, outside Melbourne, to accept irregular maritime arrivals. At that time a Defence spokesman said: The government has repeatedly acknowledged that as part of its routine and prudent contingency planning, the Department of Immigration and Citizenship has for some time been exploring additional temporary accommodation options to house families and vulnerable asylum-seekers. If we cut through all the spin it is quite clear that the Department of Immigration and Citizenship, and, indeed, this government, knows it is running out of space to house those seeking asylum. They desperately need additional accommodation for the thousands and thousands now being brought to the mainland. If the boats keep coming-and I guarantee you they will, because there is no deterrent; only a massive policy framework that is acting as a magnet to pull them here-there is a very real prospect that this government will run out of options and will seek further defence houses to house those seeking asylum. That is why this motion calls on the Gillard Labor government to transfer all defence housing stock management to Defence Housing Australia-transfer it all-because this government cannot be trusted to have over 2,300 defence houses that the minister can grab at will, whereas he cannot grab those houses that are currently being owned and run by DHA. The temptation must be removed from this bad government: 2,383 houses owned by Defence, 1,937 occupied, leaving 446 right now-20 per cent-that I am sure this government is eyeing warily and greedily to try to deal with the problem of those seeking asylum, which is getting out of control. Currently 81 houses in Inverbrackie, South Australia, are being used for this purposedefence houses being used as a detention centre. Clearly this is the thin end of the wedge. In a question on notice to the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel on 17 November 2010, the minister was asked why the housing stock was not transferred from Defence to DHA. The answer was that ‘commercial arrangements did not allow for it’. The real answer, of courseand we all know it-is that if you hand it over to DHA, the Gillard government cannot get its grubby paws on it to use it for ulterior motives other than housing defence families. It is that simple. The Department of Defence, the Minister for Defence and the Minister for Defence Materiel have recently been in the spotlight over a growing list of scandalous equipment problems that have developed on their watch. Most notable and most parlous is the state of the Royal Australian Navy, where there is no amphibious capability available right now. Can you imagine if Cyclone Yasi had struck Townsville or Cairns and an amphibious ship could not be launched? There would be no hospital facilities offshore, no helicopter facility offshore and no mass movement of transport and goods offshore. This is the state Defence has got into because of what this government has done to it. The last thing we need to do is compound the problems the department is dealing with because this government cannot continue to control its borders. Ms BRODTMANN (Canberra) (7.50 pm)-I am pleased to rise tonight to speak against this motion by the member for Fadden because, text aside, this motion is not really about deMAIN COMMITTEE fence housing. It is a proxy debate. It is a base attempt by the opposition to play wedge politics and pit one section of the community against another. It is a continuation of the strategy we have seen from the coalition that has seen them propose stripping millions of dollars in funding to schools in Indonesia, which is against our national and economic security interests, against the future interests of thousands of Indonesian children and against the right thing to do. This short-sighted approach to foreign aid and defence policy is truly gobsmacking because it overlooks the fact that we are a wealthy nation. It overlooks the fact that, as a wealthy nation, we can support those in need in Australia and we can support those in need in our region. It also overlooks the fact that poverty breeds terrorism. And what is the best way of eliminating poverty and the cycle of disadvantage? It is education. Education is the great empowerer. It opens up opportunities like nothing else. It builds self-esteem and it provides choice-not that this message is particularly dear to the coalition’s heart given its track record in education when it was in government. Mr Robert interjectingfact that this government has made the biggest investment in education in this country ever. I would also like to use this opportunity to congratulate the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship for last week’s release of The people of Australia: Australia’s multicultural policy. The policy includes the following four key principles: that we as Australians will celebrate and value Australia’s cultural diversity within the broader aims of national unity; that we will strengthen the government’s commitment to social inclusion, social cohesion and responsive government services; that we welcome the trade and investment benefits of diversity, and these have been significant over the years and will be significant in the future; and that we promote the understanding and acceptance of cultural diversity while responding to attitudes and actions of intolerance and discrimination with strength. The policy also outlines rights and responsibilities that are enshrined in our citizenship pledge-loyalty to Australia and its people; the need to uphold our laws and democracy; and the need to respect our rights and liberties. Tonight when I was on ABC24 I was asked by a journalist if we should have a debate about multiculturalism in this country. I believe we should have a debate and in the process celebrate the fact that we have been a great success in national cohesion. You only need to look at what is happening in Europe to compare how we have gone on multiculturalism. I think that is because most Australians are tolerant, and that is because we have managed our migration policy very carefully. We have not ghettoised populations. We have social cohesion and national cohesion. That is because it has been very carefully managed and because Australians are tolerant. It is also, most importantly, because leadership has been shown on this issue over many years and by successive Liberal and Labor governments. The Prime Minister was today lauding the achievements of the Menzies government and also the Fraser government in showing leadership on this issue. MAIN COMMITTEE",314,Private Members Business

My father’s family came out from China and Germany in the 1850s and my mother’s family came out from Ireland and Scotland in the late 1800s. However, if members of the opposition had their way the debate would focus on the most base of propositions. Some have stated that Islam is a problem and, if reports out of shadow cabinet are to be believed, there is a genuine strategy and a genuine attempt to play to Islamophobia. I am glad that some in the opposition have the moral strength to stand against this and I would be keen to know the member’s thoughts on this matter. This is an attempt to play a very nasty game of politics in this House. It has nothing to do with Defence housing. It is not an attempt to show genuine leadership or to deal with genuine concerns. I refuse to play this game. I do not agree that moving families to more appropriate accommodation is a soft option. I do not agree that showing compassion is the same as showing weakness. This is pure rhetoric. This is the most base of politics. No member of the Defence Force is without a home because of the decision to use some sites to accommodate asylum seekers. The Gillard government has a deep commitment to those men and women who serve in the Defence Force and it will not overlook the need for homes for defence personnel and their families. It is a government priority to house members of the Defence Force, and I have just been advised that we are building more Defence housing throughout the nation. It is coming on at a great speed, isn’t it? Ms Saffin-Yes. cated manager of housing for Defence Force personnel and their families. It is also important to note that they provide homes for the members and families of the Customs service office as well as for employees of the Maritime Safety Authority. However, the Department of Defence retains ownership of houses on military bases or in remote locations. Those houses intended for Defence Force personnel and their families are all managed by DHA. Defence Housing has a very high standard for homes intended for defence families and it has come a long way since the days when my husband was an Army brat and his dad was in the Army in the sixties, seventies and early eighties. In the sixties things were pretty basic, and his family of eight-six kids, a mum and a dad-were often crammed into small houses with just a few rooms. I have seen some of those that still exist. They have now been extended and renovated and are up to scratch. Things are very different today. We have a number of friends in defence. Their housing has been incredibly comfortable and it gradually improves as they work their way up the ranks. They do not have any complaints about it except the usual complaints about bits and pieces here and there. Generally it is comfortable and decent. It is like an average suburban home. The places that do not meet this standard are handed back to Defence and those surplus to requirement are also handed back and are then refurbished or demolished. The houses in Inverbrackie were found not to be suitable for DHA purposes; that is why they went back into the system. In the first instance, the houses were used for a community group and then, late last year, the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship announced that MAIN COMMITTEE",316,Private Members Business

368,Ms Brodtmann,"As the member has noted, Defence Housing Australia is the dedithe housing would be used to accommodate up to 400 low-risk asylum seeker family members. This announcement was in the context of the government expanding its residence determination program to move significant numbers of children and vulnerable family groups out of immigration detention facilities and into community based accommodation. I want to commend the government and the minister for this decision. I understand that by June-July this year the bulk of the 1,000 or so unaccompanied minors and vulnerable families will be moved out of detention. In making the decision on housing, the government made sure there would be no impact on defence families. Not one member of the Defence Force missed out on a home because of this decision-not one. All this information would have been available; it is easy to find out. SoI return to my original point: what is this motion actually about? I ask the member to come clean on what he really wants to do with this motion, because it is not about a lack of housing for defence personnel, it is not about a concern that Defence cannot manage housing or a challenge to the DHA over its management and it is not about any actual attempt to take a home from a defence family. This is absolutely about wedge politics. This is absolutely about lowest common denominator politics. I would love to live in a world where these sorts of measures were not needed; however, we do not live in such a world. Therefore, we must have an approach to this matter that protects our national sovereignty and meets our obligations to the international community. I believe that we as a nation are capable of showing compassion without showing weakness. This motion is just glib. It does not address any actual problem, nor does it show leadership on this issue. I call upon the opposition to stop playing these games. I urge them to treat asylum seekers with some degree of compassion and not to look to score political points on what is a difficult and complex policy issue. That is why I am speaking against this motion. fine motion before the chamber. Having served a short 15 years in the Australian ArmyI am most familiar with Defence housing. There have always been issues with regard to Defence housing, and there have always been shortages at various times, which saw the temporary rental allowance come into it. That is something that has not been broached by the other side in the very limited and inexperienced way that their argument has been put. A division having been called in the House of RepresentativesSitting suspended from 8.01 pm to 8.16 pm rounding this motion. Whilst the government has told us that the 81 houses in Inverbrackie are surplus to requirements, we know that there are 490-odd houses around the country that are not currently being occupied. I wonder about the temporary rental allowance situation in these places. Are the people who could be in these Defence houses merely being pushed over to continue on the Defence budget bottom line by being given TRA when this Defence controlled housing is just being pushed over to the department of immigration? I wonder whether that is the case, because that certainly has not been made clear by the government at all. Obviously a big part of the need for this motion comes from the pressure on Defence housing as a consequence of the government’s failed border protection policies. It only stands to reason that, when you break a working system of border control which then has the effect of MAIN COMMITTEE",317,Private Members Business
369,Mr Simpkins (Cowan) (8.00 Pm),I welcome this opportunity to comment on the very,318,Private Members Business
370,Mr Simpkins,"As I was saying before the suspension, there are a great many issues surencouraging more people to make a perilous journey by boat to Australia, you are then going to be faced with the question of what you are going to do with these people. More people come by boat and more people move to Christmas Island. When Christmas Island is overflowing in the manner it has been, what is the next step? Clearly this is the next step. We need to look beyond Inverbrackie and ask: what is the government going to do with those 492 Defence houses that are unoccupied? The question I posed before is: what is the situation regarding TRA? Have Defence Force members been forced to go and look for their own housing using temporary rental allowance because houses that were available are just being shifted over to immigration, saving a bit on the immigration department’s bottom line and lifting a bit on the Defence bottom line? I know and we all know that housing affordability in this country remains a concern for many of our citizens. I think a lot of people would be saying that, if there are Defence houses around, what is the government’s plan and why is the government not thinking about making them available to current Australian citizens? I know my colleague the member for Solomon has made this point on a number of occasions. What about the 400 houses in Darwin that are in this Defence owned category? Wouldn’t the right thing be to hand them over for rental to Australian citizens who are already doing it tough? I wonder if this is a matter of priorities. I wonder how much of the additional cost of the government’s failed border protection and immigration policies is being disguised in costs under the Defence portfolio by using the houses in Inverbrackie. What is the future for Defence owned houses? Defence Housing Authority stock cannot be touched by government but Defence housing is fully controlled by the department and can be diverted to other causes. We know that there are an ever-increasing number of illegal boat arrivals and that Christmas Island has become massively overcrowded. The facility was originally designed to accommodate 750 people at most, but it has expanded and is currently housing around 2,700. The government, to try to cover its embarrassment and deal with the consequences of this failure, is looking to book out maybe some more entire hotels in various locations around the country to house people arriving illegally. We have even heard of people being housed in shipping containers in Darwin. In Western Australia we know the government has been forced to shell out an estimated $5 million per year to house illegal arrivals at the former mining camp in Leonora. Of course, it needed to be upgraded-since the time it was occupied by miners-to make sure it was up to the relevant standard. When we look at the 1,500-person detention facility at Northam-a plan about which the government remained silent before the election in August last yearthere was no consultation whatsoever before the decision was made. We understand that ABC radio reports in Western Australia last week suggested work at Northam is running behind schedule and it looks like-even in this epitome of the government’s failure to control our borders-the government will not even be able to bring this in under budget or at least on time. However, the boats keep coming and the costs keep mounting. In 2010-11 the government will spend more than $760 million on people arriving illegally to Australia. We recall that in 2007, at the time of the last government, the cost was about $100 million. It is estimated that every person who arrives illegally to this country by boat costs taxpayers around $150,000. None of that will be helped by the ‘East Timor solution’. MAIN COMMITTEE That dead duck is not going to fly any time soon-it has certainly been roundly dismissed by the elected representatives of East Timor. It would probably be as successful as the citizens’ assembly that the former Deputy Prime Minister raised. We had the opportunity back in 2007 when the detention system-the immigration and the border patrol system-was working. The boats had slowed to just about nothing. We had a functioning facility on Nauru that could have been used. This need by the government to coopt defence housing for immigration is a demonstration of the failure of the border control system. Then there was the refusal to use Nauru, and it has been compounded the whole way along. The East Timorese Council of Ministers has rejected the plan for a regional detention centre and, whilst the government has allegedly drawn up a document for ongoing discussions, it really does not look like going anywhere. What a shame that is, given that we had Nauru as an option. There are so many opportunities that this government has dismissed for political expediency’s sake. The sorts of problems we face now and the waste of money that has epitomised the failure of border control have been so pointless. If the government had just left things as they were, none of this would have been required. I recall that the previous speaker spoke about compassion. WhatI would say about compassion is this: when you take people coming off the boats and the priority begins to be those people, what about all the other people who are stuck in refugee camps who just have to wait a little longer or delay for another year, or maybe not even come at all? What about the people who do not have the money to pay the people-smugglers or to fly on commercial airlines to Malaysia and then see the people-smugglers? What about the people stuck behind the wire in refugee camps somewhere who do not have the money to jump the queue and come here illegally? They wait. That is not compassion; that is a disgrace. That is the problem with what the government has done over the last three years. (Time expired) Dr LEIGH (Fraser) (8.25 pm)-To help those in need, to extend compassion, and to be concerned for the unfortunate is what being a ‘mate’ is all about. But, in recent weeks, I fear that those opposite have stepped away from this. They have stepped away from a recognition that our nation is strongest when we help those in need. From Simpson and his donkey to the willingness of Queenslanders to help one another in the recent floods, there is nothing more Australian than helping someone in need. We can have strong border security while showing compassion for those who seek to claim refuge in our great nation. Those opposite, for the sake of political gain, would have us believe that is not true. They seek to gain advantage from the misfortune of others. As Mike Carlton, writing in the Sydney Morning Herald and summing up a grubby week for the opposition, put it, ‘This is One Nation stuff with a Liberal Party blue ribbon wrapped around it.’ Let us make clear that the motion as moved by the member for Fadden is not about concern for the great men and women of the Australian Defence Force. As my colleague the member for Canberra has already made clear, Defence families are not worse off because of a decision to use some Defence properties to house asylum seekers, to allow children to gain an education while their families’ claim for refugee status is being assessed. Instead, this motion is about tapping the same vein that the shadow minister for immigration wanted his cabinet to tap: ‘Let’s make political capital from Muslim migrants,’ he told his colleagues. Those opposite would well remember from their days on the Treasury benches that Defence Housing Australia hands back houses to the Department of Defence all the time. An MAIN COMMITTEE assessment is regularly made to ensure that all homes available for Defence families meet the high standards set. If a DHA house does not meet that standard or is no longer needed, it is given back to Defence. That is exactly what happened with the 50 or so houses used to house asylum seekers at Inverbrackie: 50 houses deemed unsuitable for Defence were put to use housing people seeking refuge in Australia. Those opposite would have us believe that no house owned either by Defence or by DHA should be put to a use other than to house Defence families. They take a very purist line on that in this motion. But they forget that, when they were in government, they rented DHA homes to non-Defence families. In 2003, the then minister responsible, in answer to a question on notice from the former Labor member for Cowan, Mr Graham Edwards, a man greatly missed in this place, informed the House that up to 862 DHA houses were being leased to private individuals-that is, 862 houses that one presumes met the high standard required by DHA for Defence family homes-yet those in the Liberal Party and the National Party voiced no objection at the time. I do not recall the mover of this motion stepping forward or his political forebears stepping forward to say that it was inappropriate then. But it is inappropriate now. Perhaps the rule is that it is okay to use DHA homes for non-defence personnel as long as they are Christian. Those opposite well know that Defence families are not being disadvantaged by this decision. Indeed, they could learn a thing or two from the children at Inverbrackie, and perhaps those local children at Inverbrackie might help those in the Liberal and National parties find their compassion gene again. Jasmin Gallagher-Bohn, an 11 year-old living in Inverbrackie, was quoted in the local Hills and Valley Messenger on 16 November 2010 as wanting to help the refugees who would be settling in Inverbrackie. She told the Messenger: ‘It made me think about what happens to themthe refugeesand how lucky we are.’ A story from Adelaide Now on 20 December 2010 recorded that schoolchildren in Inverbrackie were getting on well with their new classmates. Immigration officials were quoted as saying there were no major problems with resettlement in Inverbrackie. The director of Catholic welfare group Centacare Adelaide, Dale West, said: “Once these people actually move in, they become human faces.” He went on to say: “Not many people can look at an 11-year-old girl whose got one arm because she’s had the other one ripped off in Sri Lanka and say: ‘Go away, we don’t want you’.” A story from Adelaide Now on 28 January this year headlined ‘Hills school welcomes asylum seeker children’ said the following: Woodside Primary principal John Balnaves said the school was excited to welcome its newest additions. “The students here are really great, fantastic and caring kids,” Mr Balnaves said. “The Inverbrackie children will find they’re coming in to a good environment with people watching out for them.” He said the existing students were looking forward to meeting their new classmates, with some already interacting with the Inverbrackie children when they delivered shoebox care packages to their peers for Christmas. MAIN COMMITTEE But what we saw from the opposition in relation to Inverbrackie and the announcement by the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship that those facilities would be used and families released into community detention was hysteria and the glorification of policies that the Australian people know have long failed. The shadow immigration minister wants to return to the Howard government’s policy of detaining asylum seekers in high-security detention centres, as occurred at Port Hedland or Curtin immigration detention facilities in the earlier part of this decade. Under the Howard government, one child was held in a Port Hedland immigration detention centre for five years, five months and 20 days. As the father of a boy who turned four on the weekend, I struggle to imagine the notion of a child incarcerated in a Hedland detention centre for more than five years. This is the legacy that even Prime Minister John Howard walked away from in 2005, but it is a legacy that those opposite would have us return to. Indeed, only late last year the shadow immigration minister was trumpeting the Howard government’s record of moving children from behind razor wire-even if it did come after nine years in government-and yet now he is suggesting that families and children should be placed back into high-security facilities. I cannot let this issue pass without noting the comments of the Leader of the Opposition on Inverbrackie. His clear insinuation last year after speaking to a community forum in the Adelaide Hills was that asylum seekers who do manage to make it to our shores should be placed in very uncomfortable conditions-the better to send a message to people smugglers. Australia is a bigger and more gracious nation than that. The shadow immigration minister, for his part, said on refugees to Sky News on 4 November last year: … whether they’re at Curtin or Christmas Island or Scherger or any of the other places that I’ve seen, the Northern Detention Centre in Darwin or so on; the type of accommodation there I think is entirely appropriate, we would have similar type of accommodation at Nauru. That is his solution, apparently-leave those unused DHA houses to the vandals so that the government can kick asylum seekers a little harder when they get here. Finally, I want to note that none of this should be taken as a reflection on the terrific work of DHA. I had the pleasure of visiting some new DHA homes in my own electorate of Fraser with the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel last year. I would like to use this chance to congratulate DHA on the excellent job they are doing and tell of the admiration I have for those new houses in Crace and elsewhere in Australia. As of the middle of last year, DHA managed over 18,000 properties in all states and territories, a portfolio valued at $8.6 billion. That involves a large development construction acquisition program. For example, in the 2009-10 fiscal year over 1,000 properties were built or acquired by DHA. DHA has also put in place an internet based HomeFind tool, making sure that properties are available to families before they move. DHA does great work for defence personnel, and they do not deserve to be treated as a political football in the immigration debate. and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting.

At the outset, I would like to thank Mark Clarke from the Office for Justice and Peace in the Catholic Archdiocese of Melbourne, who first brought this issue to my attention. Mark has been working with the Melbourne Congolese community to bring attention to the humanitarian disaster occurring in their country of birth, a disaster that is being driven by the incredible wealth derived from the mineral resources of that country. Mark is a persistent individual. I first put this motion on the books in 2009, so I am finally thanking the House for getting it up and thanking Mark for not getting off my back to see that it finally happened. I would like to have been thanking Clovis Mwamba from the Congolese community of Melbourne for being present. Sadly, Clovis is still in the air because his plane has been delayed, but the Congolese community of Melbourne is very thankful that people within the Australian parliament have finally heard their pleas, and this will be getting wide coverage within the community. Since 1996 the Democratic Republic of the Congo has been embroiled in the deadliest conflict since World War II. It has been devastated by various wars, which have resulted in widespread humanitarian rights violations and the intervention of multiple armed forces and armed non-state actors from other countries in the region. It is estimated some 5.4 million people have died from the ravaging effects of the war and its aftermath, with 45,000 perishing each month, mainly from hunger and disease, in a country that has incredible wealth. Furthermore, more than one million people have been displaced. Worse still, armed groups routinely commit acts of rape and violence against Congolese women and girls. While we have seen in recent days some progress in this area, there is still much to do. While we have seen issues being taken up in recent times, and some legal proceedings, it is still true that the quelling of mass rapes by armed combatants in Congo needs to be dealt with. The UN have noted that their peacekeeping mission is still absolutely essential, and deep conMAIN COMMITTEE cerns remain about the insecurity, violence and humanitarian rights violations taking place in the DRC. The mismanagement and illicit trade of extractive resources from the country has been a prime cause of the atrocities and conflict. International companies investing in the Congo are interested in the resource extraction sector. Indirectly, this investment is fuelling competition and conflict between armed groups, which has been the driving force behind the atrocities and conflict which has marred the DRC throughout its history. The Congo’s vast natural recourses are financing multiple armed groups that target the local population, particularly in the eastern Congo. These groups operate with different agendas. Some are purely criminal while others have political foundations. The one thing they have in common is the atrocities they commit against Congolese civilians, with rape and other forms of violence used to suppress the local population. As the UN has noted, continual vigilance is required to ensure that individuals and entities buying minerals from eastern Congo establish whether or not the minerals are controlled or taxed by illegal armed groups. It is ethically and legally imperative that minerals known to originate-or suspected to originate-from illegal armed groups are denied trade or purchase. Any trade involving the Congo’s natural resources which empowers the militias must be condemned and those responsible for engaging in such behaviour must be held accountable. Mass rape is deployed as a deliberate strategy by armed militias to intimidate and control Congolese communities, as the militia groups profit from the illicit trade in these minerals. Eastern Congo is frequently referred to as the most dangerous place in the world to be a woman or a girl. In 2008 Major General Patrick Cammaert, former UN deputy force commander, described the situation for women in the DRC: ‘It is more dangerous to be a woman than to be a solider right now.’ Rape is used as a form of intimidation in these areas. Once a woman has been raped, generally her husband disowns her and she is left to indelible poverty. It is a tool to intimidate, control, terrorise and humiliate communities. Furthermore, the few women and girls who have had the courage to identify their rapists rarely see prosecutions. To quote Anneke Van Woudenberg from Human Rights Watch: In Congo, if someone starts an armed group or kills people, they have a better chance of becoming a senior minister or a general than being put behind bars. Perpetrators of rape and sexual violence must be held accountable and punished for their horrific crimes. The first round of presidential and parliamentary elections in the DRC will be held in November this year. There are already reports of oppression of human rights activists, including illegal arrests and the death of a prominent activist in highly suspicious circumstances. We need to keep an eye on these atrocities. Keep in mind that this is a country in need of our protection; we cannot leave it off the radar. have spent some time researching this issue and it is certainly a terrible situation. It was not something I was aware of, and I am sure a lot of other people I have spoken to are not. The Democratic Republic of Congo is a vast country with immense natural resources, yet its development is retarded by corruption and a war that is referred to by some as Africa’s ‘world war’. As this motion correctly points out, this conflict has left the country in the grip of a humanitarian crisis. MAIN COMMITTEE",322,Private Members Business
372,Mr Van Manen (Forde) (8.40 Pm),"I thank the member for Chisholm for her motion. IThe crisis in the eastern region of the DRC dates from August 1998 when rebel forces, backed by Rwanda and Uganda, launched a drive to overthrow the government, resulting in the instalment of Laurent Kabila as President. In 2001 he was assassinated, only to be succeeded by his son Joseph Kabila. This episode is but a sad reflection of the history of the Democratic Republic of Congo, a history of mutiny, attempted succession, assassinations, civil war and corruption. A peace deal, a transitional government in 2003 and elections in 2006 served to bring some respite. News of elections later this year is also good news. However, in 2008 a series of coup attempts and sporadic violence heralded renewed fighting in the eastern part of the country. Rwandan Hutu militias clashed with government forces-displacing thousands of civilians and leaving people in the east of the country in terror of marauding militia-and this has lead to the deaths of an estimated 5.4 million people since 1998 and continues to cause untold death and suffering today. It is a sad fact that these atrocities are carried out by all sides as they knowingly target civilians, who are killed, raped, arbitrarily arrested, pressed into forced labour and their possessions looted. According to Human Rights Watch there are currently more than two million people internally displaced and a further 145,000 refugees in neighbouring countries. The war has an economic as well as a political side. Fighting is fuelled by the country’s vast mineral wealth, with all sides taking advantage of the anarchy to plunder natural resources at the expense of the country’s future. The United Nations have had a peacekeeping mission in Congo since 1999. This mission was renamed the UN Organisation Stabilisation Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo-MONUSCO for short. Its brief has been to work with and assist the Congolese army. However, their record has also been mixed. Human Rights Watch reports in their January 2011 report that while MONUSCO has sought to improve its organisational and operational process, the actual implementation has proved difficult and consequently known perpetrators of human rights abuses continue to be supported in the Congolese military. I note that the Congolese government has requested the withdrawal of MONUSCO. At this date no time frame has been agreed on. Everyone in this region has the right to feel safe and that their life is not at risk. They have the right to enjoy the freedom to go about their daily lives. They also should not be subject to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. The UN special representative Margot Wallstrom visited the Democratic Republic of the Congo in April 2010 and described the vast African nation as ‘the rape capital of the world’. This is a sad indictment on the Congolese government, particularly when some of these rapes are being carried out by its own military personnel. We call on the Congolese government to urgently deal with the corruption within their own military forces and the government to ensure that these basic human rights are respected, that abuses of any kind are not tolerated and to ensure that perpetrators are brought to justice. The Congolese government needs to recognise that if it does not bring its own house into order it is going to be very difficult to ask others to do so. We also call on those neighbouring countries that are either actively or tacitly supporting these rebel elements to withdraw all support for these groups and work with the Congolese government to bring an end to this conflict. and Settlement Services) (8.45 pm)-In common with my colleague the member for Chisholm, the mover of this motion, I have a close affinity with the Congolese community.

373,Mr Laurie Ferguson (Werriwa,"Parliamentary Secretary for Multicultural Affairs2009 I took the opportunity to bring a number of Sydney representatives to this parliament to inform members about conditions in the Congo and to get their views on movement towards solutions. It is no accident indeed that, whilst we had approximately 200 Congolese in this country at the time of the 2001 census, over 3,000 Congolese have entered the country in the 10 years since then. An important challenge to our settlement processes is that 44 per cent of those predominantly refugee newcomers are under 15 years of age, and they often come from very dislocated families. The Congo has 80 per cent of the world’s coaltan and is strong in diamonds, zinc, copper, cobalt, tantalum and, very importantly, hydroelectricity. Despite that wealth of opportunity and resources, it has a per capita income of only $342 a year. A variety of issues have contributed to the situation which exists in the Congo, including the previous government, which was described as a kleptocracy; the fall of that government; and the intrusion of a number of foreign powers-Namibia, Angola, Rwanda, Zimbabwe and Uganda-who were helping those internal Congolese with whom they had some tribal affinity but, more importantly, were exploiting resources. Often, whether a group is supporting Hutus or Tutsis or other groups in the country, it is essentially an excuse to seize resources, and in many cases to enslave local Congolese to exploit those resources. This is not a new phenomenon, as people have indicated. Human Rights Watch noted that all sides targeted civilians, who were killed, raped, arbitrarily arrested, pressed into forced labour and looted. In 2009 the United Nations Special Rapporteur Philip Alston spoke of sexual violence causing death, vigilante groups, the murder of human rights defenders, a campaign against alleged witches and a situation where many hundreds of people were killed by the FDLR and the FARDC, which are both, in some manner, related to previous developments in Rwanda. He called for the indictment of senior commanders; the integration of forces into the national army; a budget for prisons, which were severely overcrowded and basically run by the prisoners; and better monitoring by the United Nations, the organisation he represented. In the last week we have read in the newspapers about a roving court which has indicted some people for rape. Previous Vice-President Jean-Pierre Bemba Gombo has been sent to trial for his crimes. But, overall, we can have no optimism about the current situation. In another recent development, the Lord’s Resistance Army, which has caused so many internal problems in Uganda over the last few decades, has moved into the Congo and late last year bludgeoned to death 345 civilians. Another problem in the country is the failure of the Congo to ever move away from hostility towards what are, at times, very long standing migrant groups. Groups that arrived in the country before its independence from Belgium have been denied citizenship. They have tribal and ethnic confreres across national boundaries who tend to intervene for them. There has been a failure by the administration to tackle localised native tribal power and to give the country a sense of national identity. I do congratulate the member for Chisholm for bringing forward this motion relating to a country in which at any one stage-there are various figures-two million people are either internally displaced or in exile. It is a serious situation: 5½ million people are dead. It is well past due that we in this house take the opportunity to speak on this matter. Ms GAMBARO (Brisbane) (8.50 pm)-I also rise tonight to speak to this motion on security in the Democratic Republic of Congo. I thank the member for Chisholm for putting the MAIN COMMITTEE motion forward. I also thank the previous speakers, the member for Forde and the member for Werriwa. There is a dire humanitarian situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The Congolese are very, very poor people who have suffered for a very long time and for many reasons that are beyond natural comprehension. Ever since decolonisation from the Belgian empire, the Congolese have been subject to catastrophe after catastrophe, which has resulted in suffering seen nowhere else in the world. Similarly with other conflict zones, such as Afghanistan, there is no central working government. As is the case with all countries in this situation, regional warlords and a fractured army control vast areas of land, exploit local inhabitants and trade illegally in extractive and contraband resources. Unfortunately, women and children are often the ones who suffer the most and the most heinous crimes, which are often rewarded and seldom brought to justice. In the Democratic Republic of Congo, the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda, the FDLR, have moved across the porous land border in the east and are committing the same crimes that they committed in the 1994 Rwandan genocide. Despite the army trying to integrate some of the militant units under the peace accord in March 2009, a number of the armed groups dropped out. This resulted in hundreds if not thousands of people being killed and gang raped as each warring party accused the local populations of supporting its enemies. One of these groups that splintered was the National Congress for the Defence of the People, the CNDP. An example of this was when at least 105 civilians were killed in the western Masisi territory, where former CNDP troops conducted operations against the FDLR and their allies. Another incident was in the Walikale territory in early August. FDLR troops and a local armed group, the Mai Mai Cheka, systematically gang raped at least 303 civilians in 13 villages. The perpetrators accused the villagers of supporting the CNDP. These people are using rape and HIV-AIDS against entire villages. They not only are destroying the population now but also are ensuring that these villages will never, ever recover into the future. In a completely separate case the Lord’s Resistance Army, which is a Ugandan rebel group, spilled into the Democratic Republic of Congo from the north, where they now continue their brutal and inhumane campaign. An example of just one of the atrocities committed by the LRA was in 2009, when the LRA combatants clubbed to death at least 645 civilians and abducted 250 others in the remote Makombo area. The LRA have also carried out operations in the Bas-Uele district, where children were deliberately targeted in widespread abductions and forced by the militant group to serve as child soldiers. The rate of sexual violence in the DRC is one of the highest in the world. Over 15,000 cases of sexual violence were reported in 2009 and over 7,500 cases in the first six months of 2010. What is really tragic is that most of the victims were under the age of 18 years. But however bleak and heart wrenching this outlook is, there is always a glimpse of hope. In 2009 the FDLR president and his deputies were arrested in Germany on a warrant by the International Criminal Court for war crimes committed by FDLR troops under their command. There were similar arrests in France. These are very sad stories. There is no sign of improvement on the horizon for the Congolese, who have been suffering for a very long time. Nevertheless, we need to have hope. We need to have faith that there is good in people and that it will triumph over the evil that compels wicked people to commit such horrific acts. My thoughts and prayers go out to those people in the Democratic Republic of Congo who are now suffering. May they find peace. MAIN COMMITTEE has expired. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. Family Law Act 1975 Debate resumed, on motion by Mr Neumann: That this House: (1) notes that in 2006, the Howard Government made sweeping changes to the Family Law Act 1975 in parenting matters, and that these changes: (a) elevated the rights of parents above the need to protect children; and (b) have been analysed and criticised in the following reports: (i) Family Courts violence review by Professor Richard Chisholm, former Justice of the Family Court; (ii) Evaluation of the family law reforms by the Australian Institute of Family Studies; and (iii) Improving responses to family violence in the family law system by the Family Law Council; (2) acknowledges that on 11 November 2010, the Hon. Robert McClelland, Attorney-General, released a draft bill Family Law Amendment (Family Violence) Bill 2010 (the bill) for public consultation open to 14 January 2011, proposing amendments to the Family Law Act 1975 to provide better protection for children and families at risk of violence; (3) supports the Federal Labor Government in taking steps to protect children from abuse, neglect and family violence; and (4) urges the Federal Labor Government to proceed with the bill to ensure that the best interest of the child is the paramount consideration in all court proceedings in relation to children. shared parenting and the protection of children. In 2006, without any social research and in a knee-jerk reaction to the urging of vocal minority groups such as men’s rights groups, the Howard government made sweeping changes to the Family Law Act in parenting matters. By elevating the rights of parents above the need to protect children, the Howard government fettered judicial discretion and created legislative pathways fixated on shared parenting. These changes have been much criticised in three reports: the Family courts violence review by Professor Richard Chisholm AM, Evaluation of the 2006 family law reforms by the Australian Institute of Family Studies and Improving responses to family violence in the family law system by the Family Law Council. A culture of expectation developed and it was considered worthwhile for children to continue to have regular contact with a parent, even if it meant exposing that child to abuse, neglect and family violence. Time and again parents felt compelled to agree to contact arrangements for fear of running foul of the friendly parent provisions created by the 2006 changes. The ramifications of terminating all contact between a parent and child can be long term and many, and the task is daunting for any court. But the balance needs to be restored in favour of the protection of children and it will be restored by amendments to the Family Law Act contained in the proposed Family Law Amendment (Family Violence) Bill 2010. The bill was released by the Attorney-General, the Hon. Robert McClelland, on 11 November 2010 and public consultation closed on 14 January 2011. MAIN COMMITTEE",325,Private Members Business

375,Mr Neumann (Blair) (8.55 Pm),"The Howard government got it wrong on the issue ofI am pleased to say that 73 per cent of all submissions supported the bill. Seventeen per cent did not support the bill and 10 per cent made no specific comment on the bill but offered information about personal experiences. So the level of interest in this area is significant in the Australian community. The bill incorporates for the first time the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, compelling the court to consider the convention in deciding matters concerning children. It elevates the primary consideration of protecting a child from abuse, neglect and family violence over the benefit of having a meaningful relationship with a parent where there is an inconsistency between those aspirations. It broadens the definition of family violence in tune with community perceptions and understanding to include not just actual or threatened physical or sexual assault but also harassment; emotional manipulation; financial abuse; cultural, familial and friendship isolation; and a range of dominating and controlling behaviours. It expands the protection of children by expanding the definition of abuse and improving obligations on court personnel. ‘Abuse’ now includes for the first time serious psychological harm. The bill imposes obligations on those in family law disputes to give advice to parents in relation to the best interests of the child being the paramount consideration. The friendly parent provisions are revoked, which is a good thing. It means that children will be less exposed to abuse, neglect and family violence. Mandatory cost orders, which in certain circumstances have been a disincentive to the reporting of family violence and child abuse, are removed and immunity from cost orders is afforded to those state and territory child protection authorities which intervene in parenting proceedings. The reforms will make a difference. Family violence and child abuse are unacceptable and cannot be tolerated. Protection of children should be front and centre in all proceedings in the family law jurisdiction. The balance will be back with this bill. Once again, the best interests of the child are the paramount consideration. That will be the focus of the law.

When the Australian government decided to deliver the new Joint Strike Fighter to RAAF Williamtown, planning was started to test the impact on nearby residents and the Australian Noise Exposure Forecast 2025 was promulgated. This noise map had major implications for residents of Port Stephens who live within proximity of the air base. Not only did it show that noise levels would increase, it placed many properties within restrictive zones that would affect their ability to build. Because of the ANEF 2025, many people will not be able to build on their own blocks without insulation, which costs tens of thousands of dollars. Many will not be able to extend. Some will not be able to build at all, which means that if their house burns down they will be left MAIN COMMITTEE",328,Private Members Business

377,The Deputy Speaker (Hon. Peter Slipper),The question is:,329,Grievance Debate
378,Mr Baldwin (Paterson) (9.00 Pm),"TonightI raise a grievance on behalf of the peoplewith a property they can never live on again. So when I talk about the impact of the ANEF I am talking about people’s livelihoods. A house is the most valuable asset most people own. To have its value stripped is devastating. It is even more devastating when the government just does not seem to care that there are other options available. This currently seems to be the case with Gillard Labor. I do not say this without just cause. In fact, the Gillard Labor government has such a long list of failures on this issue that it would be laughable if it were not so tragic for those affected. Allow me to illustrate. Firstly, the ANEF 2025 was released. This is a binding document used for planning decisions, which means it is affecting people’s properties now even though the Joint Strike Fighter will not be delivered for at least three years. Soon after, the 2010 federal election campaign began. Jim Arneman, Labor candidate for Paterson, issued a joint press release on 2 August with then Parliamentary Secretary for Defence Support, Dr Mike Kelly. It pledged that a re-elected Gillard government would ‘review and replace the current 2025 ANEF with a new ANEF to be issued before the end of the year’. Julia Gillard stood on the floor of parliament and recommitted to that promise on 24 November, saying, ‘I am very happy to stand by local promises we made.’ The Prime Minister also visited Lakeside Tavern in my electorate and told journalists she would honour her promises for Paterson. She enjoyed a beer at the tavern with the defence minister himself, while close to a thousand people gathered at the Raymond Terrace Bowling Club for a public meeting on this issue literally down the street. That meeting and many before it was attended by hundreds of people, and I thank Paul LeMottee and the SAFE-EARS group for organising the forum. Despite repeated assurances from the endorsed Labor candidate, the parliamentary secretary and the Prime Minister herself, the ANEF 2025 has not been lifted to this day. That means that, not only has Labor misled my constituents, it has misled the parliament. That is broken promise number one. I will move on to number two. In early October we were advised that a new Australian Noise Exposure Concept had been generated. The new ANEC took into account more flights over the ocean rather than homes, as a direct result of a different instrument landing system. Labor had not even suggested that Defence examine the viability of such an ILS before I suggested it to them after consultation with local experts. I was advised at the Williamtown Consultative Forum that the ANEC would be released by 15 October, but when October came and went, Labor still had not released the map. It sat on someone’s desk until the 12 November. But that is not even the worse part. Next, Senator David Feeney, who has been placed in charge of this issue, told media that the release of the ANEC fulfilled Labor’s pre-election promise to replace the ANEF. The Newcastle Herald reported on 1 January: A spokeswoman for the Parliamentary Secretary for Defence, Senator David Feeney, said the concept map fulfilled the Prime Minister’s promise. That is simply not the case. To clarify: the crucial difference between an ANEC and an ANEF is that an ANEC is a scenario based concept draft, while an ANEF is an official forecast of noise exposure patterns on which planning authorities base their controls. An ANEF also affects things such as property valuations and 149 certificates. Therefore, an ANEC is never a suitable substitute for an ANEF. The fact that Senator Feeney thinks so shows that he does not understand the issue at all. Either he cannot understand or he cannot be bothered to understand. MAIN COMMITTEE Now to broken promise No. 3. I have been contacted by thousands of constituents over this issue. I have spent countless hours researching, reading, talking to people, making maps, hosting meetings, discussing solutions, making representations and generally doing everything I can to understand the issues. That includes understanding the intricate differences between the impact on Oyster Cove, Medowie, Medowie East, Medowie West, Lakeside, Riverview Ridge, Raymond Terrace, Brandy Hill, Grahamstown and Salt Ash. I believe that is nothing more than my responsibility as the member for Paterson. As a result, I arranged to meet with Senator Feeney to explain the myriad different issues. At that meeting Senator Feeney pledged to work with me. He has spoken many times since about working in a bipartisan manner to achieve a solution. Yet it is now clear that was another commitment Labor never intended to keep. When Senator Feeney visited my electorate last Thursday, 17 February, to talk about this issue he never even advised me of the meeting, let alone invited me along to the meetings with my constituents. If the senator had contacted me, I would have been able to explain to him the difference between an ANEC and an ANEF and their effect on my constituents. I would also have been able to explain the latest crucial need of my constituents, which is an extended consultation period for the Williamtown RAAF Base environmental impact statement. The EIS affects the future introduction of the JSF and it is therefore crucial that locals get the chance to comment, yet many people found out about it just days before the consultation period was due to close. It was not even advertised in local media. Senator Feeney came, he talked and he left. He did not use the visit to lift the ANEF as promised, nor did he use the visit to extend the EIS consultation period. So much for working together to do what is in the best interests for local people. Labor is fantastic at saying what it thinks people want to hear. Unfortunately, it is not so good at achieving outcomes. Sadly, this is not unique to federal Labor. The Labor candidate for the state seat of Port Stephens also seems intent on talking up the issue, without actually taking any action. Kate Washington has repeatedly promised to do whatever she can to alleviate the effects of the Joint Strike Fighter. Yet not only has she supported the Kings Hill development, which jeopardises future changes to the flight path, she has also failed to do anything to pressure her own colleagues who are in the government in New South Wales. Those colleagues have the power to change state planning laws to allow grandfathering. The grandfathering rule would allow current property standards to remain in place, even after the introduction of the Joint Strike Fighter. It is heavily supported by my constituents. I have seen many press releases from Ms Washington’s camp, based on council issues which she has absolutely no control over whatsoever. YetI have not seen one in which she asks her own state colleagues to examine planning laws. Clearly, Kate Washington is following the line of her federal colleagues, saying what is popular but not doing anything to actually help people. She is not part of the solution; she is part of the problem. My intention today is to hold Labor to account and to call on it to take some much-needed action. The people of Port Stephens deserve much more than is currently being offered. Those who have worked tirelessly on this issue also deserve better. In particular, I thank Andrea Pitt of Save our Castle; Paul LeMottee of SAFE-EARS; Scott Broadhead and Sue Hirsh of the West Medowie group; and members of Save Oyster Cove, including Brian Coleman. It is important to note that the overwhelming majority of people in Port Stephens do not want Williamtown RAAF Base moved and they know how important it is to our local econMAIN COMMITTEE omy. They simply want what is fair. After all the hours they have put in on behalf of their neighbours, after hundreds of representations made to the Minister for Defence, they deserve nothing but full commitment from those elected to represent them. At the very least, they deserve to be able to trust their state and federal governments-trust that, when they make a promise, they will follow through on it. During the first sitting of this parliament, after Julia Gillard was elected Prime Minister, I hand-delivered to her office a letter detailing my four-point plan on aircraft noise. I remain committed to that plan and, despite everything that has happened, I am still more than happy to put politics aside and help resolve this issue that is important to my constituents. Senator Feeney, you are welcome in my office at any time. I look forward to your visit. If that is too much trouble, I am happy to meet with you in your Senate office to resolve this issue for my constituents of Paterson. for Paterson, but I draw his attention to standing order 64 and the fact that he ought to refer to the Prime Minister by her title and not by her name. Climate Change bate about climate change. Thanks to the efforts of the deniers of climate change, public confusion still surrounds the origins of what has become a destructive national and international crisis of catastrophic floods, storms, heatwaves, fires and cyclones. Evidence is now strong that global warming is producing these record-breaking disasters and that these events are what climate scientists earlier warned will be the consequence of massive burning of fossil fuels and land clearing. However, the climate change deniers resident in the opposition, and others who are exploiting scientific ignorance for their own gain, claim that these events are just an extreme manifestation of variations in the weather of Australia. By their dishonest and misleading campaign, the deniers have succeeded in confusing some members of the public into believing claims that the science of climate change is as yet unproven. They have even managed to fool the Leader of the Opposition into believing that climate change science is some sort of conspiracy or communist plot, as Lord Monckton, 3rd Viscount of Brenchley, has claimed. Fortunately, there is an objective answer to the question of climate change and it resides in the statistical methods that were developed in the early 19th century by mathematicians, principally Carl Friedrich Gauss. Gauss, who was regarded as a genius by his contemporaries and by subsequent generations, developed a method of statistical analysis that showed that randomly occurring events that cluster around a mean or average value fit a bell-shaped curve, more formally known as a normal distribution. His work is very useful in understanding the causes of current climatic events. Since the occurrence of many natural phenomena, including rainfall and floods, are randomly distributed, we can for example use Gauss’s statistical methods to make predictions as to the probable volume of rainfall or height of floods expected in any one year at a location with reasonable records. As a demonstration of this method I have an analysis of rainfall figures from Pomeroy, near Goulburn, in New South Wales, since 1901. When the recorded range of annual rainfall totals are plotted against the frequency of those annual rainfall totals we find that the curve approximates a normal distribution, with a mean or average rainfall of 708 millimetres per annum. Furthermore-and this is really the importance of the methodMAIN COMMITTEE",329,Grievance Debate
379,The Deputy Speaker (Hon. Peter Slipper),I was reluctant to interrupt the member,332,Grievance Debate
380,Mr Murphy (Reid) (9.09 Pm),"I again wish to speak in this place on the grievance dewe can objectively predict from this chart that the probability of an annual rainfall of 227 millimetres at Pomeroy is around one in 100 and that an annual fall of 1,188 millimetres is also around one in 100, even though these exact figures may never have been recorded. This is the scientific basis of the announcements we hear, for instance, of a one in a 100 year flood in areas for which long-term records are not available. So when we discover that records for floods or temperatures or fires have been repeatedly broken, we can estimate the probability of those events based on an objective statistical analysis, rather than on guesswork or the memories of older residents. If the figures indicate that the probabilities of many of these events are remote, we have to ask: what is behind these changes? I want to make it clear tonight that climatologists and other scientists are not saying that global warming is directly driving events, in particular Cyclone Yasi or the floods in South East Queensland and north-west Victoria, nor the recent disastrous Victorian and Western Australian bushfires or the other climate calamities in other parts of the world. Rather climatologists and other scientists are warning that the probability of these sorts of events is increased by rising air and sea temperatures and that these increasing temperatures are being driven by the trapping of heat by rising atmospheric carbon dioxide levels. An examination of the occurrence of tropical cyclones will illustrate this situation. Tropical cyclones-or hurricanes or typhoons, as they are called in various parts of the world-are large-scale weather systems that commonly form over tropical waters. A recent report by scientists from University College London has quantified the effect of increasing sea surface temperatures on the formation of these monstrous storms. The study was conducted by Professor Mark Saunders and Dr Adam Lea of the Benfield University College London Hazard Research Centre and the University College London tropical storm risk forecasting venture. Their report, published in Nature, found that sea surface warming was responsible for a 40 per cent increase in Atlantic hurricane activity over the period 1995 to 2005 relative to the average incidence reported between 1950 and 2000. Furthermore, these investigators found that the sensitivity of tropical Atlantic hurricane activity to sea surface warming is large, with an increase of 0.5 degrees being associated with an approximately 40 per cent increase in Atlantic hurricane activity and frequency. So there is now strong evidence that links global warming to Atlantic hurricanes. If, in light of these reports, anybody in the opposition still thinks that the major economies of the world will do nothing to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by cutting the use of fossil fuels such as coal then they must be completely out of touch. While one could suspect the same sorts of changes as experienced in the Atlantic may be occurring in the tropical seas to Australia’s north, in fact recent research published by Dr Scott Power of the Centre for Australian Weather and Climate Research, a partnership between the CSIRO and the Bureau of Meteorology, has shown that the incidence of tropical cyclones affecting Northern Australia has actually declined since records were first made in the 1880s. Further, Dr Power and his colleagues have shown that these changes are linked to the weakening by global warming of the Walker circulation, the weather system that drives the trade winds and that varies in concert with the La Nina and El Nino oscillations. In fact, the trend in figures recently published by Dr Power shows that fortunately the number of tropical cyclones that have crossed the Australian coast has approximately halved between 1880 and 2010, which is a very significant decline. While these figures may not give much relief to people presently recovering from the effects of Cyclone Yasi, at least there is now good eviMAIN COMMITTEE dence that global warming is not driving an increase in the frequency of cyclonic activity in waters near Australia, although the size and strength of the cyclones that do occur may be greater thanks to measurably warmer sea water. While Northern Australia may be experiencing fewer cyclones, other less desirable changes in the weather also appear to be occurring, with a high probability that they too are being driven by global warming. The Annual Australian climate statement 2010 produced by the Bureau of Meteorology reported that: spring 2010 had the warmest northern tropical sea surface temperatures on record; New South Wales, Queensland and the Northern Territory had the wettest spring on record; the Murray-Darling Basin had the wettest year on record; south-west Western Australia had the driest year on record; and, overall, the 10 years ending in 2010 were Australia’s warmest decade on record. The wet La Nina phase of the Southern Oscillation appears to be becoming more intense and so too is the hot and dry El Nino phase, leading, as we have recently experienced, to more intense and prolonged droughts and extreme hot, dry weather conditions in Australia. Although 2010 and now 2011 were La Nina years that produced records for rainfall, 2009, an El Nino year, produced records in the opposite direction. As we recall, extreme hot weather conditions occurred throughout that year as follows. A new maximum temperature of 48.8 degrees was recorded at Hopetoun in Victoria during the heatwave in January to early February. In Tasmania at the same time a new maximum of 42.2 degrees was recorded at Scamander. These conditions contributed greatly to the disastrous Black Saturday bushfires that we have been reminded about today in this place. Further, an unprecedented wintertime heatwave occurred across large parts of inland Australia, resulting in the warmest August on record. Finally, a third heatwave occurred in November that led to a record eight consecutive days above 35 degrees in Adelaide. Although the finer details of the mechanism of the El Nino-La Nina cycle remain to be worked out, evidence is growing that these record-breaking weather conditions are being driven by the effects of global warming that all the evidence shows is the consequence of increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide levels. So, while the deniers in the opposition continue their campaign of obstruction against the very necessary measures that the government is introducing to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, the evidence for the effects of global warming, now in the form of extreme weather events, grows even stronger. In conclusion, I ask: how much worse does the weather have to get before the informed members of the opposition stand up for the climate change action that we so desperately need? Queensland Floods torate of Bonner and also those in greater Brisbane. I am speaking today in support of Lord Mayor Campbell Newman and his request for the Gillard government to provide assurances about what is considered to be essential public infrastructure under the Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements. I join the lord mayor in urging the federal government to provide certainty to Brisbane City Council and the residents of Brisbane about exactly what assets will be covered by the Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements. Immediately following the recent flood that devastated so many communities in Brisbane, Brisbane City Council has been trying to establish whether Brisbane’s much-valued ferry terminals, river walk and sewerage plants are eliMAIN COMMITTEE",332,Grievance Debate
381,Mr Vasta (Bonner) (9.20 Pm),"I rise today to speak on behalf of the people in my elecgible for funding for repairs, costing tens of millions of dollars, under the Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements. It is now almost six weeks since the peak of the flood and many communities are trying, as much as possible, to return to normal. The Brisbane City Council is well underway with its flood recovery work almost six weeks since the flood, but this federal government will still not provide the certainty that is so desperately required for the Brisbane City Council to fully move forward with the reconstruction process, a process that I am sure a lot of my colleagues on both sides of this chamber will agree is a top priority. It is not as though the Brisbane City Council is not prepared to make the hard decisions-it certainly is. Two weeks ago the lord mayor, together with the council’s Chairman for Finance and Economic Development, Councillor Adrian Schrinner, announced the redirection of $380 million, over three years, into the flood recovery effort. That was by no means an easy process, but it was made even harder because of the lack of certainty provided by the federal government about what it will and will not fund. Unlike this federal government, the Brisbane City Council knows that residents have already been hit hard enough and it is taking all measures possible not to pass on the cost of this reconstruction to residents through higher rates, particularly at a time when the federal government wants to impose an additional tax on all Australians, including on those in Queensland who have already donated so much of their time in volunteering their services as well as their money. Unlike this federal government, the Brisbane City Council practises responsible financial management and is not prepared to run-up budget deficits. Running the budget into deficit is not an option, but the council cannot delay the flood recovery while it waits for the federal government to confirm its financial support. Instead, it has to make some very tough decisions and defer projects in some areas and make cuts in others. I take this opportunity to commend Lord Mayor Campbell Newman on his outstanding leadership in making these tough decisions and I applaud him and his team on their commitment to prudent financial management. I salute the determination of the lord mayor and his council to get the city’s vital infrastructure up and running again at the earliest possible time. Last week, the lord mayor revealed how Brisbane City Council would maintain a balanced budget, while covering the cost of the council’s damage bill following the impact of last month’s flood. The lord mayor said the council had put all projects and expenditure under the microscope to find ways to budget for the $440 million damage bill without putting pressure on ratepayers. Deferring projects rather than hitting ratepayers with large rate rises is certainly the right thing to do. The lord mayor has acknowledged that, as soon as confirmation is received from the state and federal governments about what will and will not be covered under the disaster relief arrangements, some of these projects can begin to be put back on the table. The good news for Brisbane ratepayers, thanks to the prudent financial decisions made by the lord mayor and his team, is that they will not have to fund the flood bill via a flood levy or surcharge on their rates. Introducing a flood levy at a time like this would be nothing short of poor and reckless financial management. Instead, a financial plan has been put in place to get the budget in the black and get Brisbane back on track. Brisbane’s clean-up and recovery will be a marathon, not a sprint. Once again, I commend the lord mayor for balancing the council budget to cover the damage bill and for ensuring ratepayers do not suffer expense through extra rate rises and levies-all of which was achieved without any confirmation of support or funding from the state and federal governments. MAIN COMMITTEE Unlike the Labor state government in Queensland, Brisbane City Council have also been very prudent in their risk management policies and have taken out storm and flood insurance policies wherever possible. In fact, they pay over $1 million each year in insurance premiums. This will go some way towards rebuilding Brisbane but, as I mentioned earlier, the fact remains that there will still be a significant shortfall over the next three years. Make no mistake: every dollar of financial assistance the federal government refuses to provide is a dollar that Brisbane City Council will need to find by cutting projects in the city. It was not that long ago that the Prime Minister was in Queensland, promising to do everything in her power to help rebuild Queensland. I ask the Prime Minister: what has changed now that you are back in Canberra? Again, I urge the federal government to provide certainty to Brisbane City Council and all other councils in Queensland that have similar concerns. I read an editorial in the Courier Mail last week that expressed the sentiment eloquently. It said: No one is asking for a blank cheque. They just want the disaster recovery arrangements honoured in the spirit in which they were intended, an end to the tawdry politics, and enough surety so that we can rebuild our communities. That is not a lot to ask. I know that a lot of my colleagues in this chamber will agree with me when I say no, it certainly is not a lot to ask. Behind all this bureaucracy, endless red tape and posturing, I do not know what has happened to influential Queenslanders, like the members for Lilley and Griffith. They seem to be more concerned about Canberra than Queensland, and I join the Lord Mayor of Brisbane in calling for them to stand up for their home state and honour the Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements in their entirety and to provide certainty for Brisbane and the rest of Queensland, who have already suffered so much. I call on the Prime Minister to outline Brisbane’s position as well as give all Queensland councils some certainty on what will and will not be eligible for funding as soon as possible. It is quite simple really. All they have to do is say, ‘Yes, vital infrastructure will be funded,’ and, ‘Yes, water and sewerage infrastructure will be funded’-whether it applies to Brisbane or across the state. In conclusion, over the last six weeks we have all heard a lot about the need to give assistance and demonstrate compassion to the victims of this terrible natural disaster. Indeed, the Prime Minister has spoken many times of this herself. I say to this House: if the Prime Minister really wants to show some heart and some compassion, she can do this by giving certainty. Howes, Mr Paul Ms O’DWYER (Higgins) (9.28 pm)-After a spray last week that would have been laughable if it were not so serious, the Secretary of the Australian Workers Union, Paul Howes, attacked the CEO of one of Australia’s largest employers, Rio Tinto. Paul Howes used his union’s recent national conference, attended by the Prime Minister and the Treasurer, as an opportunity to make personal attacks on business executives. Coming to his defence today, Ged Kearney, President of the ACTU, writes in the Punch, under the headline ‘You call ‘em thugs, I call ‘em foot soldiers of democracy’, that she does not really understand what all the fuss is about. She says she is surprised that the comments have made front-page news. Ms Kearney goes on to say: A bit of argy-bargy between union leaders, politicians and bosses is fairly standard practice in Australia. And some colourful language in the mix is nothing new. MAIN COMMITTEE Really? Let me remind Ms Kearney as to just what was said. Mr Howes denounced chief executive Tom Albanese as: … sucking out the blood, sweat and tears of blue-collar workers. He said that ‘monkeys could do a better job’ of managing Rio. Strangely, of all the industries he could have targeted, Howes chose the mining sector, where workers are paid more in wages than in any other industry-which tells you really all you need to know about this attack. It is about power. It is about membership. It is about money. It is about control. It is a fight for union domination of one of Australia’s biggest employers. He went on to say: I’ve got a message for Rio Tinto: you don’t own this government, you don’t own this country any more. Your workforce has the right to be represented. You cannot hide behind the law. You cannot hide behind the lawyers. You cannot hide behind your slimy, grubby mates in the coalition, because we’re coming after you. We are going to take Rio Tinto on, and we are going to make sure that they pay a liveable wage to the workers who make the wealth that these shiny arses sitting in the boardroom in London enjoy. The Hon. Craig Emerson, Minister for Trade, was called a ‘dishonourable rat’ by Howes and AWU President Bill Ludwig for daring to suggest that the unions were undermining constructive relations between employers and employees. Former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd denounced them as factional thugs. Prime Minister Julia Gillard though was far more sanguine and circumspect in her response, suggesting that everybody simply take Bex and have a good lie down. Treasurer Wayne Swan, responsible for the economic stewardship of this country, went missing in action. When he finally did respond, he could only make a very weak plea for cooperation between employers and employees. He said, ‘I don’t referee fights between unions or employers.’ For a Treasurer and a Prime Minister who claim to be economic conservatives, who want to return the budget to surplus, who want to increase productivity, it is hard to see how the return to class warfare and protracted disputes helps. Paul Howes challenged Rio Tinto in his speech by saying, and I quote it again: You don’t own this government. He is right on at least that one thing. His statement reveals his view that the union is the only organisation that can claim ownership of the government and he is not about to let Prime Minister Julia Gillard forget it. As Howes himself attests in his book, it was he and his former AWU colleague the Assistant Treasurer, Bill Shorten, who put the Prime Minister in power by knifing former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd during a midnight coup. The AWU is so confident of unconditional support from the government that it has continued to revel in its controversy over the past few days. It knows that neither the Prime Minister nor the Treasurer are in a position to state definitively that what the unions are saying is wrong and is damaging to industrial relations in Australia. But this is not an industrial dispute between employers and employees; this is a blatant provocation by the AWU to flex their muscles. The unions know that these sorts of tactics do nothing for their members or for employees more generally, but they do it anyway because it makes headlines and forces the government to adopt their agenda. And it seems that, no matter how much Labor gives to the unions, they are never satisfied. The Prime Minister, when she was the minister for workplace relations in the now-forgotten Rudd government, was responsible for redefining industrial relations in Australia. She took employment law in this MAIN COMMITTEE country back to a pre-Hawke-and-Keating state, with enterprise bargaining usurped by union control. This is hardly surprising when you have Paul Howes describing freedom of contract as ‘the freedom to enslave’, taking a phrase from Abraham Lincoln. When you have union leaders equating employment contracts with the forced servitude that existed in certain parts of America during the 19th century, it makes negotiation all the more difficult. Paul Howes called for something else in the speech that he delivered to the AWU conference. He wanted to see the abolition of the Australian Building and Construction Commission. He said he believes : ... the job is not yet finished-there is more to do. There is nothing more urgent than “shutting down the evil Australian Building and Construction Commission, the ABCC”. He goes on to say he does not want: ... the evil of the ABCC hanging, menacingly, over their heads.Every second of the day the ABCC is a threat to their basic working rights-their human rights. The ABCC can only undermine the reconstruction effort. He says: Now is the time for Labor to remove the last remnant of John Howard’s union busting Government instrumentalities.The ABCC must be abolished. Shame! Of all the policies and issues facing Australia at this time, of all the political dilemmas that the government has forced upon itself, this is the issue that Howes says is the most important. The outgoing Commissioner of the ABCC, John Lloyd, warned last year that ‘any watering down of the circumstances of the ABCC would see the bad practices of the past return’. This would be damaging to the industry and the Australian economy. The union’s obsession with the ABCC is ideological and extreme. The unions are not concerned about a fair and productive construction industry. The ABCC was established after an extensive and independent inquiry conducted by the Cole commission into an industry that had exhibited very different behaviours from those of other industries, including violence, threats and corruption. Commissioner Cole said ‘at the heart of these findings is lawlessness’. And what is the justification for the abolition of the ABCC? Is it that the problem is fixed? No. It is that the union movement does not like the scrutiny. Why would you abolish the ABCC when you consider the facts? Research undertaken by KPMG Econtech shows that the ABCC has delivered wide-ranging economic benefits since it was established, including a 10 per cent rise in industry productivity, an annual economic welfare gain of $5.5 billion a year, a drop in the CPI of 1.2 per cent, an increase in GDP of 1.5 per cent and a significant reduction in days lost through industrial action. These are not the sorts of developments that Paul Howes and his union are interested in. They do not care about the enhanced productivity, welfare gains throughout the economy or safer and more harmonious workplaces. Instead they carry on an ideological campaign against a body that has performed its role well and which, sadly, still has a role to perform. It is very hard for any person who opposes the ABCC to articulate a reason why it should be disbanded given the well-documented violence, disruptions and corrupt dealings in the industry. Howes’s latest effort is to try and argue the ABCC will slow down the reconstruction effort in Queensland after the floods and Cyclone Yasi. This, of course, is a ridiculous claim. I want to touch on one final point before my time concludes, which is that Labor’s review into the federal election results of last year reveals a political party that is heavily reliant on MAIN COMMITTEE the union movement in terms of both membership and financial support. For this reason, the report, conducted by former premiers Steve Bracks and Bob Carr, as well as one of Labor’s elder statesmen, John Faulkner, recommended even closer ties to the unions. Well, Julia Gillard has a real choice to make. Is she going to deliver real action in 2011? Is she going to deliver real leadership? Is she a real leader? The test is out there: she should retain the ABCC. son I would remind the member for Higgins that she ought not to refer to the Prime Minister by her name. She should use ‘Prime Minister’ or even ‘Prime Minister Julia Gillard’. Robertson Electorate: Education Ms O’NEILL (Robertson) (9.39 pm)-I rise today on a matter that is close to my heart and important to the region I represent. I will speak on the structural change necessary to advance the interests of students, teachers, the community and employers on the Central Coast. With regard to the development of education initiatives on the Central Coast, we have reached a historic moment. I want to put on the record what I believe is a pressing need for change to the governance structure of school and vocational education in my region. At present, Central Coast schools and TAFES are part of the New South Wales Department of Education and Training’s Hunter-Central Coast region. As a teacher and lecturer with 25 years experience on the Central Coast, I would like to say emphatically that the time has come for us to have an education region of our own. There are a number of reasons for this, on which I will shortly expand, but first let me establish the context in which I make this claim. In June last year the NSW Minister for Planning, Tony Kelly, announced that the Central Coast was, for the first time, being recognised as a region under state environmental-planning legislation. By the end of June this year, thanks to federal Labor, we will have a Central Coast Local Health Network. We have our own A-League team, the Central Coast Mariners, who played such a brilliant first half last Saturday evening at Bluetongue Stadium in Gosford. Although we lost the match, the Mariners are winning the hearts of the people of the Central Coast and confirming the reality that we exist as an autonomous region. I will take this opportunity to wish the Mariners success in their attempt to reverse that result in the second leg of their tussle with Brisbane on Saturday night. If our local team can stand on the national stage at a sporting level, we can and we should stand on our own two feet when it comes to education. Now our growing region of 300,000-plus people needs the agency and the autonomy to allocate and prioritise our education resources. The population of the Central Coast region on the night of the census in 1996 was 263,000. By 2006 that number had increased to 297,000. The results of this year’s census will confirm for us next year that we are still growing. Once it was a natural fit for us to look to Newcastle as an older and more established region with a large population to offer some support to our fledgling community. That is no longer the case. While we certainly need to work with our neighbours, we need to do so as ultimate decision makers keenly attuned to and responsible for our area. In times of competitive grant applications and decision making about what is advanced by each region, it is no longer in our interests to be subsumed by a region that is geographically, demographically and sociologically quite different from the more recently established Central Coast. It is not in the interests of the educational participants on the Central Coast to be voiceless. We need our own voice, our own narrative and our own accountability to our own comMAIN COMMITTEE",334,Grievance Debate
382,The Deputy Speaker (Hon. Peter Slipper),"Before calling the member for Robertmunity. Without our own educational regional identity, we are at the whim of education bureaucrats in Newcastle, Sydney or Canberra. Recognition of our education region is a natural progression from recognition of our health region and our recognition as a region for planning purposes. Engagement of our youth in schooling is a critical challenge for our area. Our retention rates are less than desirable, with the last figure I saw from the Hunter-Central Coast region resting at about 60 per cent. We know that failure to engage young people in education has long-term impacts on their life outcomes across a range of metrics including health, employment, income levels and general well-being. If we want to reach our goal of raising school retention rates to 90 per cent by 2020, something needs to change. Certainly we need to develop innovative and locally relevant programs, responses and community partnerships with social, health and other local agencies as well as local businesses to find ways of connecting our kids with school and with our very particular community. I have certainly come to the view that an educational region of our own is a critical element in us advancing towards better retention and happier educational outcomes for all. So there is a lot of work to do. We can pause for a reflection here on the failure to localise programs. The remains of the Howard government’s misguided attempt to impose its extremist ideology on the Australian vocational education sector can still be seen in the main street of Gosford. The ‘For Lease’ sign still hangs in the window on the former shopfront of the Australian technical college in Mann Street. The very concept that there should be competition in the vocational sector was one of the more febrile ideas in the overheated free-market craziness of the Howard government. Naturally all those who taught there had to sign AWAs. The real agenda of the Australian technical college, as many noted at the time, was to transplant a conservative industrial relations agenda into the schooling sector. This kind of scenario might not have eventuated had there been more robust local autonomy. In the year 2011, following many discussions with educators and parents, I have come to the opinion that it is not possible for a governance framework centred on Greater Newcastle to effectively represent our interests. Autonomy for the region is an agenda I will do my best to advance with my Labor colleagues on the Central Coast. I do not put this argument for a separate Central Coast educational region lightly. I have made a number of claims already about a rationale for advancing this idea to reality. To this argument I want to add the weight of dozens of private conversations that teachers and other school staff have had with me about their experiences under the current structure. Their stories of the marginalisation of their voice are such that I feel impelled to put their reality on the record in this place. Teachers, parents and friends of learning on the Central Coast are experts in our area. They understand from their everyday encounters with students, parents, community members and employers the very particular needs and strengths of education in our region. We have our own community, rich in insights into the strengths and deficits of the Central Coast. What we need is our own region, to localise the national, to engage with one another and to invite those around us to share perspectives at our request rather than to deliver decisions without sufficient attention to our distinct and pressing realities. As time permits, I will also touch on a second grievance, and that is the abysmal failure by the New South Wales Liberal Party to consider the infrastructure needs of the Central Coastin particular, New South Wales opposition leader, Barry O’Farrell, and his cowardly failure to MAIN COMMITTEE go into next month’s New South Wales election with the kind of infrastructure policies that will make a difference to the lives of people on the Central Coast. I am very proud that today the Gillard government and the Keneally government have signed an intergovernmental agreement for the Parramatta to Epping rail link. This rail project is part of the Gillard Labor government’s plan to build a modern economy and match government services with population growth. We are putting $2.1 billion towards the construction of this project, with the New South Wales government raising $520 million to finalise planning and early construction work. The Parramatta to Epping rail link would cut travel time between Chatswood and Parramatta by an amazing 25 minutes. Given the chance, it would open up the huge expanse of Greater Western Sydney to Central Coast commuters. It would provide a subset of commuters with the option of rail rather than Pennant Hills Road. Planning in this important project is already underway, with preconstruction activities starting this year. The acid test is now on Mr O’Farrell. If, as everyone seems to think, it is a foregone conclusion that he will be the next Premier of New South Wales, will he become the man who denies people of the Central Coast the hope of better public transport infrastructure? In this House, how will the members for Bennelong, for Berowra and for Mitchell face their constituents and explain why they will not stand up for this important piece of infrastructure? If they had the guts they would pull Mr O’Farrell into line and tell him that he has to deliver the Parramatta to Epping rail link. The Liberal candidates on the Central Coast are in the same boat: not one nation builder among them. Actually, there is one nation builder. He is the Liberal candidate for The Entrance, who, as members would know, has an extensive history with the One Nation Party. As we have all seen over the past week, the poisonous ideas of One Nation live on in the Liberal Party. A long-term media observer of local politics told me the other day that the Liberal candidates on the Central Coast at this election are the worse bunch of misfits, failures and reprobates he has seen present themselves for election. Our residents and our businesses deserve better. They deserve better than retrograde, knee-jerk politics that will alienate and disable the people of the Central Coast who commute to Sydney on the Northern Line. Petrie Electorate: Infrastructure Mrs D’ATH (Petrie) (9.48 pm)-BeforeI begin, I acknowledge the statement by the member for Robertson and her absolute passion and commitment to education, one that I share deeply. I thank her for her words this evening. But education is not the issue that I am speaking about tonight. The issue I am speaking about tonight came about 114 years ago in the electorate of Petrie, when the people of Petrie, particularly the Redcliffe Peninsula, wanted improved public transport for their area. They knew that the outer northern suburbs of Brisbane needed a connection to broader south-east Queensland. They wanted a rail line, and for 114 years they lobbied for a rail line. Many governments, particularly at a state level, have promised a rail line and led people in my electorate to believe that it would eventually be built. However, money was never put on the table. In 1978 the then Nationals Premier Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen actually set aside a corridor for the current rail line to Petrie through to the suburb of Kippa-Ring. This corridor has been set aside ever since then. Despite this corridor being set aside, not one dollar has been committed to this important infrastructure. This electorate is some 40 kilometres outside the CBD. It is very important for these people to get access to Brisbane Airport, the Sunshine MAIN COMMITTEE Coast and Caboolture for work opportunities and also, importantly, access to the city. People who want a sea change, and people who grew up on the Redcliffe peninsula and wanted to stay there and grow up around their parents and their schoolfriends, have limited opportunities as far as public transport is concerned. Yes, we have a bus system that takes people to Sandgate train station, but by 6 pm each night the bus has stopped running. People who work in the city have to get off the bus at an earlier station and spend another one to 1½ hours travelling the long way, the scenic route, up the Bruce Highway to the Redcliffe peninsula to get home from work. Considering the improvements to the Gateway Motorway and the fact that it now takes 15 minutes to get from the Redcliffe peninsula to the airport, which is a fantastic achievement and a wonderful improvement to our infrastructure, the fact that people still cannot get public transport to work is a real shame for all levels of government. My predecessor spoke many times in this parliament about the need for this rail line, and I support that view. The disappointing fact is that calls were always made for the state government to fund it and there was never a commitment at a federal level for rail infrastructure. I am very proud of the fact that, when Labor came to government in 2007, we stood up and said we were about national infrastructure. But that also includes domestic rail across the country because it improves our local economies, it improves the opportunity for employment, it improves local businesses and it brings people to the area. It was a great honour for me on 26 July 2010 to stand beside the Prime Minister of Australia, the Hon. Julia Gillard; the Premier of Queensland, the Hon. Anna Bligh; and the Mayor of the Moreton Bay Regional Council, Allan Sutherland, to announce the Moreton Bay rail link, a 12.6 kilometre rail line from Petrie to Kippa-Ring that will deliver six stations-at Kallangur, Murrumba Downs, Mango Hill, Kinsellas Road, Rothwell and Kippa-Ring. These are much-needed stations. The line will run along not only communities and suburbs but also schools and businesses. It will create great economic opportunities for our local area. In 2009 I personally put in a submission to Infrastructure Australia for this rail line, but it was an isolated submission and it did not have the background material that is needed to support this sort of infrastructure. But in 2010 the Moreton Bay Regional Council and the Queensland government for the first time ever put money on the table and developed a business plan. It was the first time this had ever been done. This business plan allowed for a detailed application to go to Infrastructure Australia, which saw us go on the list of the top five priorities for projects across this country. It was this priority list that led the Gillard Labor government to say, ‘This is an important project for the outer northern suburbs of Brisbane.’ I thank the Hon. Julia Gillard and particularly the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government, the Hon. Anthony Albanese, for committing to this project and understanding the importance of infrastructure in our local community. As we have talked about for 114 years on the Redcliffe Peninsula, this will not just take people off the peninsula into other areas. It will not just take people into the city. We have growing areas like Murrumba Downs in the electorate of Dickson, in which two of the stations will be. The starting point, the station of Petrie, is also in the electorate of Dickson. It will bring people from the electorate of Dickson into the electorate of Petrie. There are more families moving into Murrumba Downs. They are working and they are shopping in North MAIN COMMITTEE Lakes. Importantly, their kids are going to schools in North Lakes-Bounty Boulevard, Lakes College, North Lakes State College and St Benedict’s. They are going to Mueller College, Southern Cross Catholic College, Grace Lutheran College, Hercules Road State School and many of the other great state schools that we have on the Redcliffe Peninsula. So it will bring people into our local area and that will help local businesses. It will help with sales of real estate. It will help with the property values of the local area. This is a fantastic initiative. I would like to end with this. This dream has become a reality. Not only did we announce this in July 2010 as part of an election commitment, but we have started work. In 2016 we will see six stations up and operational in the electorate of Petrie. But we do not have to wait six years to see the work happening. The survey work has started. Consultation across my electorate is happening. There are Saturday forums. The Department of Transport and Main Roads have been fantastic in getting out there and holding public transport consultations with households in our libraries and in our shopping centres. Knowing that many people have commitments on Saturdays-they work, their children play sport-we asked for evening consultations, so they have gone into the shopping centres on Thursday nights and they are holding more consultations. The department came just last week with me to the Mango Hill Progress Association and talked about the new stations at Mango Hill and Kinsellas Road. This is important consultation. It needs to happen. We understand there are environmental issues. We know we have Moreton Bay and Hays Inlet-a Ramsar site which runs along the corridor. This is extremely important. But our local environmental groups put forward a proposal to hold a full-day workshop to put together a joint submission, a consistent submission from the relevant interest groups across the area. The department has supported that and is helping to fund that workshop. That is happening in a couple of weeks time. We are bringing everyone on board. We are interested in the environmental issues. We are interested in concerned households but, importantly, this is necessary for my community. We have waited 114 years. We are not going to wait any longer. Work has started. Construction will start in 2012, and in 2016 I look forward to standing up here as the federal member for Petrie and saying how proud I am that these six stations are now up and operational. Superannuation superannuation system. Although it is widely regarded as one of the best superannuation systems in the world, there is still more to be done with it. In particular, it comes to the point of workers actually receiving their superannuation. Although amounts may be shown on pay slips, there is no guarantee that the amount shown on a pay slip is actually deposited into a worker’s superannuation account. This is not a new problem. This has been around since superannuation was brought in as a general entitlement. Although in many cases it is fixed at a later date, there are certainly many examples where that is not the case. Money is shown as being credited to working people’s accounts but is actually never paid and they do not, of course, receive the benefit. Sometimes it may be claimed back through the tax office; many times they lose out. Sometimes it may not just be a week or a month’s pay; it might be a whole quarter or, many times, a year or more, especially when companies go into liquidation. bate has expired.
