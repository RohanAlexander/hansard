It is a speech the Minister for Defence said that this reflection, Sir, and I object to it. was a small procedural Bill which seeks to suggestion made. Perhaps we should consider going to say that this is a Bill which has somethis Bill within that very limited framework and thing to do with air but I suggest to the honourshould restrict the debate simply to the alteration able member for Denison that he is a little overof the wording to avoid a confusion in relasensitive.

The point I am making firstly is that this is has 3 main components. Firstly, it deals with an a small Bill. Secondly, it is a procedural Bill but extremely important aspect of the morale and that does not derogate from the fact that it is a efficiency of the defence forces. It is a tribute to procedural Bill with considerable implications. It the Minister for Defence( Mr Killen) not only in seeks to avoid confusion between the Air Force relation to the efficient running of the forces but and civil aviation in the minds of persons dealing to his meticulous attention throughout the past with either the Air Force or the Department of year to matters of morale. The morale of the Transport. It is important to outline the history of forces is the most important initial task of the the confusion for the House to understand fully Government in the reconstitution of a proper dethe purport of the Bill and its implications.

As I underarisen not only in respect of persons believing stand it, that is one of the implications of this Bill that the air regulations apply to civil aviation but although it does not appear on the face of the also in respect of the content of some of the Bill. instructions. Although it is not expressly stated in the second reading speech, it can be clearly seen In removing such confusion the Minister has that one of the areas of concern must have been produced not only more efficiency but a much the area of defence procurement. Obviously, as greater boost to the morale of the defence forces, we have at present a fairly complicated system of in particular the Air Force, so that people know defence procurement it is important to avoid with whom they are dealing.
