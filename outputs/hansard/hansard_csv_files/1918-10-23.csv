Can the Minister for Price Fixing inform the House where those cattle Avere three weeks ago, when there was such a shortage in the market ? to the effect that there was a shortage of fat cattle in Australia three weeks ago. the Minister in charge of Price Fixing what is the wholesale selling price now fixed for butter, and what is the price at which the Commonwealth surplus butter has been sold to the Imperial Government ? butter throughout Australia is 149s. 4d. per cwt. The Government 'has taken into consideration the circumstances of the land Minister is mistaken as to the conrecent sales to the British Government, tents of our B ill ; indeed, I do not think and has decided to make the difference -that he has had an opportunity of going between the local price and the export through it yet. It is very difficult to see price the same this year as it was last year, and, as a consequence, the local price will be raised ^d. per lb., or 154s. per cwt. The price per cwt. to the I m perial Government is 175s. . for the year on which they resume duty on returning from the war, returned soldiers who are employed in the Department of the Postmaster-General lose the recreation leave which is given to officers who have remained at home.

In view of the fact that this Government is pledged to bring about such uniformity, if possible, will the honourable gentleman forward such facts to the Queensland Cabinet as will make it impossible for them to be without the knowledge that this Government is anxious to bring about uniformity?

If he will give notice of it, I shall give him a considered answer. ister informed me a few days ago that . arrangements had been made to ship hides only in equal proportion with leather. I have to-day received a telegram from Geelong stating that the steamer Karatta had left that port with 7,000 hides and no leather. Will the Acting Prime Minister inquire into that statement? this matter. Of course, it may be that the vessel loaded hides at one port and will load leather at another. directed the Secretary of the Prime Minister's Department to ascertain, as early as he can, the exact position of the leather trade in Australia. I wish to ascertain what quantity of finished leather is awaiting shipment, and I will see that the new arrangement in regard .to shipping is operated as early as possible. master-General a question, which is explained by the following newspaper paragraph, for the accuracy of which I can personally vouch:I wish to draw attention to the poor provision made at the Norwood Post Office for the payment of pensions to old people and invalids. All day long there is a stream patiently awaiting their turn. As the room holds only about a dozen, the rest have to stand outside in all sorts of weather, as there is not the slightest shelter of any description. It is a shame to keep old people, invalids (including soldiers who have ""done their h it "" ) , and women with children in arms, waiting so long under such trying circumstances No matter at what time one goes, the result is the same. As many business people collect for invalids, this loss of time means a lot to them. The two officials are in no way to blame, as they are working at high pressure all the time; and, with invalid soldiers returning every week, their duties become heavier. One way out of the difficulty would be to make a separate day-old-ag e pensions one day and soldiers and invalids another. Will the Minister take steps to give effect to the suggestion to have two pay days for pensions, in order to relieve the congestion, and will hp also invite the honourable the Treasurer to co-operate with him in providing some shelter for these unfortunate people while waiting thsir turn? matter, and, if possible, grant the relief that is desired.

80,Mr Watt,"Generally speaking, the1916, a resolution was passed expressing the desirableness of the amalgamation of the Statistical Bureaux of the States and Commonwealth, and inviting each State to give consideration to this subject. In J u l j of this year I received a letter from the Premier of New South ""Wales, stating that, after consultation with the States, it was proposed not to take any further steps to give effect to the resolution. It had previously been pointed out that the Commonwealth could do the whole of the statistical work for Australia and effect a considerable saving, as it would mean that the whole information could be obtained in ten publications instead of fifty-six. This in itself clearly indicates a large saving in printing alone. There is no foundation whatever for the statement that the Federal Government, in anticipation of the change, placed £19,000 for New South Wales on the Estimates for 1917-18 (while under State control the Department cost £8,000). No provision of that nature has been made in recent Commonwealth Estimates. (6) With regard to the cost of the collection of income tax, Mr Holman is reported ments should be made comparing the to have said"" Thus the income tax of. the relative costs of the Electoral Office under State is collected for just over 1 per cent, the State and the Commonwealth. (actual cost one guinea per cent.). The income tax of the Commonwealth is collected at the rate of 2$ per cent., which is £2 10s. per £100 collected."" It is misleading to compare the cost of collection of income tax on the basis of the amount collected, for the reason that Federal assessments are more complicated knitting and expensive than those of the States, owing to various causes, among which may be stated the following:1. The Commonwealth law provides for societies notifying their requirements. the collection of tax on dividends The Department is now in communicaand interest in the hands of shareholders and depositors respectively, tion with the various patriotic societies while the State collects at the throughout the Commonwealth in the source. It is necessary, also, to make matter. rebates in respect to the proportion of dividends which is attributable to sources outside of Australia, and on account of War Loan interest. 2. The method of assessing composite inMinister for Defence, upon noticecomes under Commonwealth law. 3. The receipt of income from more than one State. 4. The lowest rate under the State law is adviser to the Defence Department? l i d . in the £1, whilst the rate of 05 per cent, of the assessments issued if so, how much, or was he promoted in the by the Commonwealth in New South Public Service in consideration of this transWales, is l i d . or under. 5. Numerous reassessments under retrospective amendments of the law. While the figures quoted by Mr Holman are approximately correct, the true basis of comparison between the two offices is the ""Cost per assessment,"" which, in the case of the Commonwealth, is 8s. 9d., covering 129,000 assessments, and in the case of the State of New South Wales about 14s., covering about 45,000 assessments. (c) Mr Holman is reported to have said that the work of the Electoral Office also costs the Commonwealth nearly three times aa much as it costs the State. Not only does a mere statement of that character give a false impression, but it is impracticable to make a comparison which would not mislead, inasmuch as the Commonwealth and State systems differ radically. Moreover, the State Government has not brought its rolls up to date during the last year, and, having in view the fact that the Commonwealth rolls have been kept up to date according to law, it is improper that such stateMinister for Trade and Customs, upon noticeWhether provision has been made to provide wool for Red Cross and Comforts Funds at or near the cost of manufacture? decided to import supplies of knitting wool in the event of any of the patriotic MR.

93,Mr Wise,"On the 18th inst. the honorable member for Wentworth ( Mr major, and is at present doing full-time duty Kelly) asked the following question:In view of the possibilities of an early peace and the known want of certain commodities in Australia, has the Government taken any steps to ascertain our needs and their respective urgency, with a view to replenishing the stocks of commodities from British sources as soon as the declaration of peace will allow? A reply was made that if notice were given of the question the matter would be considered. I desire now to inform the honourable member that definite action has already been taken in the direction indicated by him. MR. E. W. GREENWOOD, M.L.A. Gregory) asked the following questions, upon notice:1. Isi t a fact that the usual procedure with regard to men seeking to enlist was departed from in the case of Mr E. W. Greenwood, M.L.A.? 2. Isi t true-(a ) that a special Medical Board was appointed to deal with this application; (6) that the usual preliminaries of answering questions prior to medical examination and signing attestation form were dispensed with? 3. Were certificates of unfitness from civilian doctors produced by the applicant? A reply was made that inquiries of the authorities concerned were not complete. I have now 'been supplied with the following answers to the questions:1, 2 and 3. The Commandant, 3rd Military District, has furnished the Minister with, the following report in this matter:-The procedure adopted was to have Mr Greenwood examined by a Medical Board at No. 5 Australian General Hospital, at the instigation of the Deputy Director-General Australian Army Medical Service. This procedure is not a routine one, but is frequently carried out. A special Medical Board was not appointed. The personnel of the Board was as follows:Lt -Colonel S. G. L. Catchlove, Captain H. E. Featherstonc, Captain H. M. James, and was appointed by tlie officer commanding No. 5 Australian General Hospital. The finding of tlie Board, dated 30th September, 1018, after consideration of Mr Greenwood's past medical history, was that he was medically unlit for service' in the Australian Imperial Force permanently. The usual preliminaries of answering questions prior to medical examination and signing attestation form are not carried out by any Medical Board at No. 5 Australian General Hospital. Certificates of medical unfitness were produced from Dr. J. F. Wilkinson and Dr. Kitchen. Dr. J. F.

Instances have been furnished to us where a Minister has incurred expenditure either without reference or in opposition to tbe Naval Board. Who is that Minister, and what were the instances in which he incurred expenditure without reference to the Naval Board, or in spite of the opposition of that Board1 McBeath, Chalmers, and Verco will admit the reasonableness of the demand that they should furnish the people of Australia with the name or names of the Minister or Ministers who were guilty of such irregularities. The Commission proceedsThis would not occur under a proper scheme of control. partment .to be managid efficiently when a Minister ignores the decisions and opinions of experts in matters not involving questions of policy. In paragraph 6 of their report the statement is made:In addition to the primary reason referred to above, for the non-success of the Naval Board in its administration, the then Minister supplied a further contributory factor by issumember endeavouring to make an affirmaing the following instruction on the 7th April, 1915:-""Each member of the Naval Board will have the right to bring matters for which he is primarily responsible direct to the Minister, or he may send routine matters to the Minister through the Secretary. bringing any matter forward shall make his recommendation in writing thereon, and may ask, in addition, that the opinion of pome other member of the Board be obtained, or that the recommendation and subject-matter be referred to the whole Board. The Minister will either approve or not approve of recommendations, or defer consideration, refer to other. member of the Board, or refer to meeting of whole Board.""

In reply to this statement, Mr Thomas Brentnall, the advisory accountant to the Royal Commission, saidMr Poynton's comments do not impeach in the slightestdegree the absolute and literal correctness of the paragraph in the Commission's report. Indeed, the Department's records tell their own story in almost precisely the same language. It could not possibly be inferred from the report that the £7,000 was a "" final"" payment. On the Department's own admission it was anticipated that deductions of £15,000 might have to be made from a claim of £27,688, so that at the time when the £7,000 was paid tlie Department itself thought it was liable for at least £12,6S8. The reference to the total claim of the contractors, viz., £177,330, has no bearing on the point at issue. It was never suggested that the sum mentioned in the Commission's report represented the full amount of the contract for fitting up transports. part of the differences between the Department and the contractors must have accrued during the earlier stages. It is impossible to imagine that such a serious discrepancy could have arisen in connection with the last transactions only of a contract which involved payments of £177,330. The gravamen of the Commission's report is that there must have been '* lack of method and system in dealing with claims for services rendered,"" and the Ministerial statements have furnished no evidence to refute that charge. It is useless, therefore, for the Acting Prime speeches to the effect that' the Government are exercising a wise economy when they are allowing this kind of thing to be carried on.

Its whole history is most unfortunate. The New South Wales Government passed over to the Federal Government a worn-out article, and then created a first-class article to compete with it at less than half what they got from us. I am not blaming the New South Wales Government so much for what they did as I blame those who were responsible for advising the Federal Government of the day that the amount should be paid. what Government was in office at the time.

The House is asked session after session to pass enormous sums to try to patch up this incompetent, machine. It is time we took a stand, and said, "" It is better to dismantle the whole thing, start afresh, and get a new up-to-date dock yard where we can do our work."" No one will be bold enough to say that that dockyard can ever be made a thoroughly good one. possible place that could have been chosen for the purpose. the New South Wales Government sold it because they knew that. this House has to share the responsibility for the purchase. in this House who tried to stop the deal coming off until more inquiries were made, but the majority decided to take the dock over. this? much a question of what Government it was.

My point is that we are throwing huge sums of money year after year into this financial sink, when every member knows it is quite impossible to get a return for the money we are spending on it. In regard to Naval Bases, every one knows that the whole system of warfare is in the melting pot, and these works should be hung up, because no member of the House, and no adviser of the Government can say, with any degree of confidence, that, if we build the docks on existing plans, they will not be found quite obsolete by any up-to-date man who may be brought out to report on the new systems of warfare engendered by the present war. Yet we are passing hundreds of thousands of pounds for the construction of Bases which a good many believe will be obsolete and useless when we have finished them. Exactly the same applies to the Arsenal. I do not want to repeat what has often been said here about the rifles we are turning out at Lithgow. Even before useless, worn-out the war they were costing more than twice as much as similar articles were being made for in America with exactly similar machines. Mr J. H .

In a statement read by the Acting Prime Minister( Mr Watt) at the beginning of the present series of sittings, we were told that .the Government intended to introduce a Bill to deal with the labour problem connected with its shipbuilding enterprise. The Acting Minister for the Navy had said previously that it was the intention 'd the Government to contract itself out of the Arbitration Act so far as shipbuilding was concerned. . If that is done, Ministers will be looking for trouble. Complaints about conditions are now being, made by the Australian Society of Engineers, and workmen belonging to other unions are complaining of certain statements of the Minister,, which, he says, can be explained. He is alleged to have declared that shipbuilding is not going, on well because the employees are raw at the work. Shipbuilding has not been done in Australia to any great extent. We have heard of ""building castles in the air,"" and we seem to be largely building ships in. that way; at any rate, there is a lot of talk and very little being donewell at Walsh Island. well everywhere in Australia, where natural facilities for shipbuilding exist.

A retrograde step will be taken by Ministers if they contract themselves out of the Arbitration Act. declared that every person shall have the right to appeal to the Arbitration Court, and the Government should make access to that Court more easy. Industrial turmoil and trouble arises because of the difficulty of approaching the Court. If the Government is doing right in contracting itself out of the Arbitration Act in respect of shipbuilding, it should logically contract itself out of the Act in respect of all enterprises connected with the defence of the country. Do Ministers intend to set up one rule for themselves and another for private employers? If they do, they are looking for trouble. I trust that wiser counsels may prevail, that access to the Court may be made easier, and that the machinery of arbitration may be simplified. There is great room for improvement. The honourable member for Capricornia ( Mr Higgs) has spoken of the need for closer supervision of expenditure. _ The Budget and Estimates of expenditure were put before us about a month ago. passed several pages of ""Works and Buildings Estimates, the expenditure provided for amounting to £454,951, and we are asked now to deal with several more pages on which the expenditure provided for is £1,242,194, and between these two sections of the Estimates is another section, in which the expenditure of £78,914,809 is provided for. Probably a little before Christmas, at the tail end of the present series of sittings, and at an the work. early hour in the morning, when few members are present, we shall be asked sence of all the Ministers, I ask that a to deal with these proposals in half-anquorum .be formed. hour or so. The question may be stated from the Chair ""that the remaining sent. pages of the Estimates be passed."" it .is a rotten one. The responsibility is on all of us, Ministers and members alike, to see that absent while his Department Is being disthere is fair and free discussion of procussed. posals for expenditure.

Sufficient time should be allotted for the discussion of the Budget to enable the expenditure proposals of the Government to be fairly considered. The honourable member for Capricornia has suggested that the Auditor-General, because of his age, may not be strong enough to stand up to Ministers. the honourable member for Grampians on the point? -for Grampians is the last man whose opinion I would ask, because he has interjected respecting every man whose Since that time we have name has been mentioned in the House, "" He is a good man."" the Auditor-Generali f it be true that he has asked for additional assistance, and cannot get it ? is useless to have an Auditor-General's Department if it is denied an efficient staff.

Probably the Auditor General has not been strong enough to stand up to the Government, an:l insist on getting the assistance which he says is absolutely necessary. Some honcrable members have suggested that the amounts in the schedule of this B ill should be subdivided in order that they may be dealt with separately. honourable members in every effort that will permit of a fuller and fairer discussion of the various items. There are some items in the B ill to which I strongty object, and I am sorry that the Government have not acted ' with more consideration and foresight in regard to the Arsenal. They are proceeding in the same old unbusinesslike and slipshod style. A small amount for the Arsenal is placed on the Estimates, but the Government have no idea of what the ultimate scheme is to be. We had the same experience with the Small Arms Factory, and a dozen other Government undertakings. I am not opposed to the Arsenal; on the contrary, I am very earnest in regard to it , and all other matters of defence. But I am anxious that these works should be started properly in the interests of efficient defence, investigation will insure that we get a and in the interests of the taxpayers. I know the history of some defence works, and I am of opinion that if they had been carried out as an ordinary business company would carry out any big undertaking, we should have got much better value for our money, and the factories would be in a far more efficient state than they are to-day. The Small Arms Factory is an instance. Money was placed on the Estimates for the Factory, and Parliament was given certain information. The so-called experts of the Defence Department submitted reports as to what the plant should be, and what the rifles would cost. plied to the Factoryi n accordance with those reports, and to-day it is being operated by about twice as many hands as the American contractors said it would need. Moreover, the rifles being produced at Lithgow are not being used by our troops abroad. There may be a good reason for that, because I understand that, since the war broke out, the I m perial authorities have adopted an i m We proved pattern of rifle. A t the same time, the Factory is not producing anything like the number of rifles it should be producing, and, generally, the establishment is not coming up to expectations. In every instance, the buildings cost more than we were led to expect. able member not to go into the details of that matter. I shall support the Small Arms Factory merely as an illustration of what may happen in connection with the Arsenal. Millions of pounds will be involved in the housing scheme, and in the erection and equipment of the Arsenal; and we are starting in the same old piece-meal, slip-shod fashion. There has never been a proper business investigation of that proposition, and the Government cannot tell the Committee where we shall be ultimately landed. I intend to oppose the item for the Arsenal, on the ground that there is no need to proceed with the work u n t i l the war is over. Whether there will be a need for the Arsenal after the war is a question that should be determined by the best military authorities in the Empire. We can well afford the expenditure of a few thousand pounds on preliminary investigations in connection with a project of such magnitude, if such proper scheme. Honourable members can see, at Newcastle, what the BrokenH ill Proprietary Company have been able to do in two years. It took the company a long time to get the scheme under way, b u t ' they engaged the best experts in the world, and investigated the proposition in a thoroughly business-like way. When at last a commencement was made with the work, they knew exactly what they would get for their expenditure. There is no reason why a Government undertaking should not be carried out in the same way.

Instead of chipping off a littleexpenditure here and there, and obtaining a surplus by saving money in a piece-meal fashion, the Postmaster-General would do better, in the interests of the country, and would meet with the approval of Parliament and the people, if he were to adopt a .policy that would give the requisite facilities to the producers. What matters it where the money goes, so long as production is increased, and the back-blocks are settled and developed? Unfortunately, the Postmaster General looks at every proposal from the pounds, shillings, and pence point of view. He calculates the expenditure and the receipts, and insists upon having a surplus. Let us by all means have business methods in the Postal Department, but these country services constitute a special case. found somehow; and if the Minister cannot get it otherwise, he must cut down some of the facilities which the cities now enjoy.

I hope the Government w ill set an example in economy; if they do not, they must be prepared for some very drastic criticism. reading the proof of the remarks which I made on Friday, more particularly in regard to Naval Bases, I found that it might possibly be inferred that I included the present Director of Naval Construction in the general condemnation which I applied to the state of affairs that has prevailed in the matter of Naval works for some years past. So far as I know, this gentleman is in every respect a capable and conscientious officer who has undoubtedly effected a considerable improvement on the condition of affairs that he inherited when he took over the position, but he is heavily handicapped in endeavouring to obtain efficiency and good work in the Departments under his charge. The lesser positions have been filled in many cases as a matter of Ministerial patronage. There are men still in the department who owe their billets entirely to their association with Ministers.

Before we adjourned on the last occasion, there was a very strong feeling, particularly on this side of the House, that, at the present juncture, when, as we hoped, we were approaching the end of a war which has capsized military and naval theories in almost every direction, it might be inadvisable to undertake the construction of an Arsenal. by the present Treasurer that, before any money would be spent on an Arsenal, there would be a ful l discussion in the all right.

The Minister for Works and Railways( Mr Groom) has not assured me that all public works which should properly be carried out by contract will at least be submitted to the test of public tender. The history of the work of this Parliament during the last ten years shows that in connection with Commonwealth expenditure day labour has had a fairly good trial, and has cost the country from 20 per cent, to 50 per cent, more than the contract system would have done.

If we had had a Supply and Tender Board, some of the misappropriations that have occurred, and much of the want of method shown in connection with our various Departments would not have happened.

Lt -Colonel ABBOTT (New England) [5.53] It is proposed to spend £1,242,000, largely for naval and military defence purposes, and I am not here to criticise expenditure on such defence works, seeing that we are now in the midst of a war. I assume that the Government are carrying out those works in accordance with expert advice and opinions received some time ago-that the Minister for Defence would not have the audacity to go on with such works in the absence of advice from military authorities. in anticipation of the war, with the object of having things ready before the war broke out. Lt -Colonel ABBOTT -We have had about four years of war, and I take it that the Minister for Defence has been in close touch with the Imperial authorities as to the necessity for any changes necessary in the altered circumstances. recently in connection with the different items before the Committee-that is, as to the Naval Bases. honourable members privately the text of the advice given? for Defence could.

Lt -Colonel ABBOTT -The honourable gentleman refers to the scheme in accordance with Admiral Henderson's report. came out, he submitted the scheme known as No. 1 Scheme, involving an expenditure of between £5,000,000 and £6,000,000. Lt -Colonel ABBOTT -As the Minister for Works and Railways( Mr Groom) has referred to the Naval Bases, I direct attention to the expenditure upon the Flinders also called Port Western -Nava l sub-Base, which, from the point of view of our naval protection, is in exactly the same category as the proposed sub-Base at Port Stephens, in New [258] South Wales. If honourable members will consult the Budget-papers, they will find that,, already, no less than £471,000 has been spent on the Victorian sub-Base at Flinders. It is proposed, under this measure, to provide an additional amount of £190,000; and assuming that this vote be passed, and the money spent, there will at the close of this year have been no less than £661,519 expended on the Flinders Naval Base. In exactly the same category, and intended to serve identically the same naval purpose, the establishment of a Naval sub-Base at Port Stephens was recommended by Admiral Henderson. It is recognised by all unbiased authorities that, as a harbour, Port Stephens is equal to, if not better than, Port Jackson; and it will be admitted that that is saying a good deal. If the honourable member for Hunter( Mr Charlton) were not at present temporarily in the Chair, he could substantiate what I am saying with regard to the harbour facilities afforded by Port Stephens. There is a depth of 42 feet of water there right up to the foreshore, and 60 feet in the basin, and no dredging would be required there at all. The facilities afforded there are greatly superior to those of Newcastle Harbor. Here we have a natural port recommended by Admiral Henderson as a sub-Base, and yet whilst, up to the end of the present financial year, no less than £661,519 will have been provided for the Flinders Naval Base, the total amount expended so far at Port Stephens is £41,000. There is a vote of £25,000 provided in this schedule for the purchase of land at Port Stephens, and, assuming that it is agreed to and expended, there will then have been spent on this subBase only £66,236. I ask honourable members why, if Admiral Henderson's report is to be relied upon, the Naval Base at Port Stephens is neglected, in order that the money available may be spent upon other sub-Bases. Lt -ColoneI ABBOTT -Ne w South Wales may have been given a fair deal in connection with other expenditure; but I am considering this matter broadly, from the point of view of our naval requirements, and Port Stephens is required as a sub-Naval Base in connection with naval operations.

It seems to me that at the present time the Postmaster-General* is spending practically the whole of the amount allotted to his Department in the cities, and is not giving the country districts their due share of expenditure. I have travelled, not only through my own, but also through other electorates in the past six months, and in all the country centres I have visited, I have found that discontent exists amongst postal officials and residents because of the inadequate telephonic and telegraphic facilities provided. In many farming centres there are no such facilities provided. In others one may find a little wayside office erected at a cost of 10s. or 15s., with in sufficient accommodation for two persons. When applications are made to the Postmaster-General to have these offices remodelled, the reply given is that the revenue derived from these particular centres does not warrant the expenditure. T25812 Some time ago, I brought this question up in connection with a notice received not quote the by two country postal officials that they would be required to find fresh premises I understood the for the post-office, as the Postmaster General's Department had decided to hand over the buildings they occupied to the Home and Territories Department. This occurred in two mining centres I where a large amount of money goes through the post-office. I sent two petitions' into the Postmaster-General's DeThey have been altered conpartment on the matter, and while my communications were formally acknowledged, I have had no definite reply, and do not know whether these matters are under consideration or not. I have careThe increase in the output of f u l l y noted the employees in some of the post-offices in country centres, and have come to the conclusion that some of the larger country post-offices are practically baby farms I noticed that in many cases the great majority of the employees were boys of from thirteen to fifteen years of age. They are doing what I term men's work, and are paid at the rate of about 15s. per week. If you require to send a telegram from one of these offices, you will have two OT three little boys surrounding you, and making all sorts of busy inquiries. It appears to me I ask the honorthat postal affairs should not be committed to the care of these young lads.

In both those cases the first buildings which the authorities set out to erect were the last which were required for actual occupation! Similarly, the money provided on these Estimates includes an appropriation for the erection of "" residential quarters."" I well remember my first visit to the Military College at Duntroon, when I found the landscape considerably added to by a number of very fine residences that had been erected for various officers. These residences were constructed of solid brick and concrete, and possessed elaborate fronts. They were not too good for the officers who ultimately occupied them, but tlie money expended upon them might, at that stage, have been much more profitably devoted to the organization of the housing of the cadets at the College, and to providing the general utilities connected with that institution. In the same way, at Jervis Bay, the energies and genius of the Department now so appropriately presided over by the Minister at present representing the Government in the Chamber( Mr Groom), set themselves to the erection of residences for sary further to elaborate the .point; but, the Commandant of the College and for the various other officers-al l before arrangements had heen completed for the accommodation of the boys, or for the general requirements of the College itself.

The report of the Defence Department Royal Commission, composed of the very best men obtainable on the business side, was also referred back to the ""brass hats/' who are still there, to say what they thought of the Royal Commission! What happened, also, in connection with the report on the Navy Department? My honourable friend, the Acting Minister for the Navy( Mr tions of parliamentary and Ministerial Poynton) cannot be held responsible^ for what has happened in the past; but'the report of that Royal Commission is hardly flattering either to the Minister of State or. the Department. Cabinet sat on its recommendations with all the affection of a hen sitting on a nest of eggs, from which she hopes to obtain something creditable to herself.

The gentleman who, according to the ordinary tenets of parliamentary government, is responsible for what happened in that Department, is still there, offering us advice as to what we should do in connection with these naval works! I can only say that this policy of deliberating about the report of a Royal Commission when it does not suit the Government, and clamoring about it when it does, is a fraud upon the Australian public. far as I am concerned, I will always hold that when a report is brought in absolutely condemnatory of the whole administration of a Department, it is the duty of the Minister responsible for that Department to retire from the Government. This is what Ministerial responsibility means. I should imagine that in wartime we would endeavour to secure greater efficiency than at any other time, but the morale of this House has fallen so low that> not overridden his experts,'we would not have had the Allied victory to-day. -and I think we all ought to take off fore, and I have no doubt the Minister our hats to him for it-wa s that he inbelieves what he is saying; but I believe, dorsed the opinion of the greatest milialso, that if the Admiralty authorities tary expert in the world, General Foch, were approached at a time when they are as against the separatist views of his own not harassed with the pressing and immemilitary authorities.

If the land has been already resumed, there is nothing further So to be said on that subject. I do, however, make a final protest against proceeding with certain of these defence propositions, because the necessity for them is being decided at the present time upon the battlefields of Europe. Especially is this so with our Naval Bases. If this European war removes the Germanic Power from the list of our enemies, the only Naval Base3 that we could possibly require after the war would be those further north, somewhere upon an enemy's lines of comacting upon the advice of the Admiralty.",54,Foster The Y Get On The Right Track Until We Resort To

338,Mr Kelly,"I have heard that bebe able to study local problems, and give a different answer. It seems to me that we do not realize that the British Admiralty are at the present time bearing a strain to the limit of their endurance. At the outbreak of war, and when the Imperial authorities were organizing makeshift factories for the manufacture of shells, we asked England to send out a whole establishment for the making of shells here. We estimated that we would be able to make 200 shells a week, and I point out that this output could be fired by any one of the field guns in ten minutes! Is it any wonder, therefore, that the British authorities did not provide the establishment? the men employed on such a work would be of more value in England, engaged in the oversight of the makeshift factories which were then being organized. Even if we' could have turned out 20,000 or' 200,000 shells a week, we could not have given equal service to Great Britain at that time. I think it is absurd to expect the Admiralty authorities to turn aside from the ' problems now confronting them to tell us whether or not we should go ahead with Westernport or the other Naval Bases, because the necessity for them is being decided in Europe. Whatever Bases we want in Australia will not be of that kind and for that purpose. Of that I am as satisfied as that I stand here, and it is for that reason alone that I oppose these items in the schedule. I strongly support the arguments of the honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr Australia to any serious extent. After Kelly) as to the need of going slow in the construction of Naval Bases. Of the total amount of £2,175,633 covered by the schedule, the Navy Department wants £770,500, and the Military £276,500, leaving a balance of £1,128,633. Thus the Naval and Military Departments alone require nearly half the total amount."" The Murray waters scheme, a most important developmental undertaking, takes £99,000, the east-west railway £300,000, redemption of Northern Territory loans £339,000, and the Postal Department £220,000, or a total of £958,000, leaving less than £200,000 for such important matters as the construction of railways in various parts, the acquisition of post-office tainly Japan has. She is the only nation sites and wireless stations, and the erection of lighthouses on the Australian coast, one of the most urgently important works imaginable. Is there any real justification for the proposed new expenditure on naval and military works? We are asked to vote under this Bill for naval purposes £770,500, and a number of additional items under war loan expenditure, including £500,000 towards the construction of the Fleet, are required by the same Department. The defence of Australia is near and dear to the heart of every member of the community. There is no party and no politics about that matter. It is a national and patriotic duty that appeals to every Australian. But we have already Every one of expended millions, and propose to continue to spend millions, and one wonders what for. Against whom are we preparing for defence? Which nation is likely to invade us and threaten our security? Prior to the war it is well understood that we were in imminent danger from Germany, but if our anticipations about the end of the war are realized, the danger of invasion by Germany will have disappeared. I canBot believe that at the end of this war we shall leave Germany in such a position that, even if her fleet is intact, she will be a menace to the security of any part of the British Empire. Tbe"" naval bases and wireless stations on which Germany had to rely if she had designs against Australia previous to the war have gone, and no European nation is to-day in a position, either in connection with the trade routes, or coaling stations, or refitting stations, or naval bases in any part of the southern seas, to threaten this war I do not think any European Power will be in a position to threaten Australia. to be confined to a European Power? justification for the proposed expenditure on naval works, it must be against other Powers. Who are they? Until very recently we may have had a feeling of insecurity in regard to our eastern Ally, but we may, to some extent, at any rate, consider ourselves fairly immune from invasion by that nation. If any people have the facilities for invasion, cerpossessing bases in the Pacific that might possibly threaten Australia, but I am. not",55,Foster The Y Get On The Right Track Until We Resort To

The war will so exhaust the nations financially and otherwise that there will not be much likelihood of a recurrence of war for the next ten or twenty years. war ends. much doubt in honourable members' minds as to how the war will end. I can put up a good case to show that no danger .need be apprehended by Australia, and that the expenditure of this money as a precaution against invasion is a precaution against something which is not likely to happen, or, at any rate, is not in sight for the next ten years at least. Are we, then, to go on with this expenditure of £1,000,000 per year at the very least? In this Bill we are to spend £770,500 for naval works, and another £500,000 is required for the Fleet, making £1,270,500 in all. This expenditure is more likely to increase than decrease, because naval and military items have a particularly bad habit of continually increasing, as the following figures show:-In Germany in 1.905, the army expenditure was £35,000,000, and in 1914 it was £68,000,000. from £13,000,000 to £24,000,000; in Russia from £39,000,000 to £66,000,000; in £48,000,000; and in Great Britain it stood at £28,000,000. expenditure increased from £11,300,000 in 1905 to £23,000,000 in 1914. In Austria the increase was from £4,000,000 to £7,500,000; in Russia from £12,000,000 to £12,000,000 to £25,000,000; and in Great Britain from £33,000,000 to £49,000,000. We were told that that increased expenditure was necessary to preserve peace. One We of the absurd arguments that this war has exploded, I hope once and for all, is that to be prepared for war is the surest guarantee of peace. Surely with all those increasing armaments, and that increasing expenditure, peace should have been so absolutely certain that nothing could disturb it. Yet Ave know in our hearts that the very fact that this continual preparation of one nation against -the other was going on was the one thing which brought about the terrible calamity There is no other nation from that afflicts the world to-day. We were continually reminded that these huge accounts for naval and military expenditure were necessary to establish our security as a nation. The argument is put forward on behalf of this Bill that the security of Australia demands this expenditure. I do not believe the security -of Australia is threatened, or that it will be seriously threatened at the conclusion of the war. In fact, our danger will be less at the conclusion of the war than it was at the beginning. I believe our security will be established for the next ten or twenty years because of the exhaustion of the nations, and the fact that no nation can lightly enteT again upon a war such as the invasion of Australia would lead to, because of the protection afforded us by the British Navy. We can, therefore, fairly look to at least ten years of security ahead-whic h is putting it within very narrow limits. Before the war the national debt of Australia, which was then considered enormous, was about £290,000,000. It is estimated that by the time the war is concluded it will have increased to at least £800,000,000, .and I have heard £900,000,000 mentioned. That to a popu' lation of 5,000,000, with the enormous amount of developmental work ahead of In Austria it increased us, is simply staggering. At5 per cent, it will mean an annual interest bill alone of £45,000,000. Is it possible for France from £27,000,000 to 5,000,000 people to meet such a charge, and go on expending huge sums for purGermany's naval poses of which the necessity is not apparent, and for a defence that is not immediately necessary? It means that for .every man, woman, and .child in the community £9 per year has to be found £26,000,000; in France from for interest alone. It means, therefore, that every productive unit in the community will have to produce £45 per year to pay our interest bill,",56,Foster The Y Get On The Right Track Until We Resort To

It is too much to ask tlie people of Australia to bear this huge financial burden and also to provide moneyfor development. If during the next five years we could divert into reproductive channels the £1,000,000 that it is proposed to spend annually on naval work, what a difference it would make to this country! If , instead of sending a stream of golden sovereigns across the sea each year, we spent the money in developing our territory and securing its f u l l benefits, the results would be wonderful to contemplate. stead £1,000,000 a year on naval works, we used the money to build railways and to open up the land in other ways, we should reduce our financial burden, and at the same time increase our ability to bear it. The military expenditure is almost as serious as the naval expenditure. I feel that we cannot allow our defence system to crumble to pieces, even though our position may seem fairly safe; but it seems to me unnecessary and unwise, in face of the burdens that we have to bear, to spend money on new naval establishments, arsenals, depots, and the like. The two Departments in regard to which we can and ought to save are the Military and the Naval Departments. In every country the expenditure on the army and navy is notoriously large and wasteful, and, to a great extent, the result, not of necessity, but of scares and panics, deliberately engineered by certain persons for their own purposes. of the British Navy? proved over and over again that diplomatic difficulties have been artificially created to secure orders for ships and guns. that? that it should be disputed. apply to Bussia and to Germany, but not to Great Britain. statement to be incontrovertible. I have gained my knowledge of the facts from information which is available to other honourable members. I believe that every armament firm has been, at some time or another, involved in deliberate attempts to create international difficulties to serve its own purposes. of the facts leads me to think that, if British, German, French or American firms could secure orders for ships or guns, they did not care who paid for them.

My honourable friend's education seems in some directions to require attention. I do not ask him to accept my word in these matters, but I hope to direct his thoughts into a line of investigation that will show him that the armament firms of different countries are associated-British shareholders being interested in French and German firms, German shareholders in French and British firms, and French shareholders in British and German firms. If in the next ten years the money Who believes which it is now proposed to spend on naval works were diverted into reproductive channels, the effect would be marvellous. The chief objection to the The statement may proposed expenditure is that it is unproductive. The money for which we are now asked is for wholly new works. In addition, there is the money that is required for the upkeep of the Fleet and of the ordinary naval establishments.",57,Foster The Y Get On The Right Track Until We Resort To

It will to ten or twenty years, and, should some of those opposite have their way, 100 years, before Australia gets rid of its present financial burden. But were the money spent ou railways and in opening up the country, how different would our position be! The Northern Territory is regarded as a huge burden, but it is a land of great possibilities, and requires only the building of railways and the providing of transport services by sea to become reproductive. I believe that the expenditure of £2,000,000 or £3.000,000 in the Federal Capital Territory would be a good investment from, a commercial point of. view. We cannot develop that Territory now, because of the shortage of money. Honourable members on both sides advocate the stoppage of expenditure in the Federal Capital Territory because of the shortage of money. We can ease our people of aheavy financial weight without danger to Australia, and secure tremendous advantages by the development of the' interior if we divert this money from naval works to useful purposes.

It is not a logical measure to charge those who are least able to pay for amusements who can afford to pay for the higherpriced seats about a quarter of that percentage.

I have pointed out a way in which the situation can be met, and I hope that the Government w ill act either on that suggestion, or on some other that w ill have a like effect. A fte r this little by-play, we ought to get down to serious business. The suggestion just made, coming from the quarter it does, has already had its proper value placed upon it . I shall not reclause, but simply say that I am with In the principal Act , parathose who are against taxing the children. Without dealing with the amendment that has been ruled out of order, I may point out that the method suggested would only partially relieve the situation, and create a .bigger anomaly than there entertainment is intended would be if we l e f t the B ill as it is.

The proposal that has been made It will not in its would benefit only a certain section, and, while I would not oppose that section having a benefit, there is an element of unfairness to which I object. To confine this relief to Saturday afternoon entertainments would not relieve the children of the poor, because these matinees are mostly in places which the children of the poor never reach. The benefit would A few clowns from the simply extend to those who can afford to pay, and be at the expense of those who I suggest that if those would still have to pay the higher pTice under the amendment. We are informed that a considerable revenue w ill be lost if this clause be omitted altogether, and that very omission shows the inequity of taxing 3d. tickets. I hope that the Government, in their desire to afford relief, -will act in such a way as to benefit not only one section, but all sections of the community. is with a good deal of regret that I rise My friends opposite to address myself to this question, because I feel it very keenly that in this JSTational Parliament we have not a Government better able to manage the finances of the country. I made some remarks about "" financial muddlers,"" and those remarks are more than justified by the exhibition of this evening. The honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr. K e l l y) has told us that we ought to deal with the. matter in a straightforward manner, and I agree with him. But why have not the Government and their experts-wh y has not the Government Caucus-deal t w i th it in a straightforward manner?

425,Mr West (East Sydney) [9.26],"I tproposal was considered. Prime Minister( Mr Watt) has put himself in a very humiliating position, and one not worthy of the Government which he leads. Government give mature consideration to all taxation proposals before they are submitted, and yet Ave have now an attempt to justify the Government's position by a proposal to give the children an advantage of a two hours' entertainment on the Saturday afternoon. It is quite evident that this is a class tax, and it is in an endeavour to remove the stigma which must attach to a Government proposing a measure of the kind that we have this amendment suggested by the Leader of the House. As a matter of fact, the action of the Chairman of Committees in ruling the amendment out of order is a perfect god-send to the Government, seeing that it has saved them from further humiliation, and from making themselves a laughing-stock. It is pitiable to find the head of the Government, and the Government itself, so devoid of financial ability. Why did the Government not come down, first of all, with other proposals on the business-paper, such as the land tax and the income tax. No. They prefer to test the House on a proposal to tax the children of the poor to the extent of 33-J per cent. When I find the Government' of a Democracy submitting a taxation proposal to penalize the children, I begin to ask myself AvhetherI did not make a mistake when, in the early days, I strove to secure the reform of one man one vote. We know that the children have no votes; but I believe that the impression which this legislation will have upon the adults of Australia will be such that, at tlie next vernment are still asking for more loan election, the Government responsible foT it. will be sent into the cola shades of Opposition. I am not anxious to secure a seat in this House as the result of the faults of the Government; but I am anxious that the little children, Avho receive .so much instruction from these picture shows, shall not be deprived of the opportunity to attend them. I am anxious that our children, in the coming generation, shall maintain the high standard set up by our Australian troops abroad, which has made Australia a model for other countries to follow. I desire that my grandThe Acting children shall have better opportunities than I had, and I certainly never thought that it would be necessary for me to stand up in the National Parliament of this We always suppose that the country to protest against the imposition of a 33-J per cent, tax on children's entertainment tickets. The supporters of the Government have, during the last four years, had quite unusual opportunities to secure a due contribution to the revenue of the country from those who possess wealth. It is the persons who have made phenomenal profits during the war who should be called upon to bear the bulk of the taxation which the war has rendered necessary. There is not a Government in any other country in the world that has left undone those things which ought to be done in the way that this Government has. I said some time ago that the time has arrived in Australia for the adoption of a systematic method of dealing with our finances. The Treasurer ( Mr Watt) seemed to agree Avith my statement, and the honourable member for Parkes( Mr Bruce Smith) .said he Avas glad to find that there Avere honourable members on this side who believed in such a thing as systematic financing. We have muddled through with quite unimportant things in this House, and have not given the finance question, which is the greatest of all questions in government, the attention it deserves. The press organs supporting the party opposite, and especially the Melbourne newspapers, have been hammering at the Government day after day in the endeavour to induce them to adopt scientific methods of finance. We have piled up a loan indebtedness of £600,000,000, and the Gomoney; and now they propose, in order to raise the revenue necessary to pay the interest on our loans, that there shall be a 33-J per cent, tax upon little children's tickets. This proposal is on a par with that submitted by the Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Jensen) to deal with the tobacco industry by the imposition of an additional licence-fee. It has been pointed out by the honorthat much of this taxation will have to -be paid by the children of our soldiers. It may be said that the bulk of the taxation proposed by the Government will",65,Pairs
426,Able Member For Ballarat ( Mr Mcgrath),"have to be bonne by our soldiers. If they are prejiared to go on with this measure, they will be only putting another nail in their political coffins, and perhaps I should rejoice at that. At the last elections no honourable member on the Government side would have dared to say from a public platform that if the party he supported got into power, they would impose a tax on the entertainment tickets of little children. This is a proposal for which the Government has received no mandate from the electors, and it is really an evasion of their election pledges which, in my opinion, constitutes a serious crime. I am convinced that the stand I am taking in opposition to this Bill will meet with the approbation of the people. The Government may, in this matter, hope that something will be done in another ' place to save the situation. am one of those who helieve that the Senate is not entitled to interfere with taxation. In the New South Wales Constitution, which is the oldest Constitution of any British Dominion Outside that of the United Kingdom, and which was framed at a time when there was a property qualification, when the principle of one man one vote had not been adopted, and there was no Labour party, it was laid down that the Legislative Assembly should alone have the power to tax the people. Although provision was made for a second Chamber under that Constitution, care was taken that it should not have the power to interfere with taxation. The power of the Senate is limited in the same way, and the Government cannot transfer their responsibility to that Chamber. It may happen that, having the next elections in view, the Government majority in the iSenate may deal with this measure in such a way as to preserve the existence of the Government. I believe that honourable members on this side are justified in interposing every possible obstacle to the passing of this measure. It is quite true that we may be ""gagged"" if we attempt to do so; but we should stand up against this proposal. The price of .wool has gone up from 6£d. to 15d. per lb.; our flocks have risen in value by from 50 per cent, to 100 per cent.; farmers, who, at one time, were glad to get 2s. per bushel for their Mr West. wheat, are now receiving 4s. 9d. per bushel. The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN ( Mr Bamford) -Order! The honourable member is going wide of the question. show that this is a quite unnecessary tax. If the Government were able to say that they had exhausted every other means of raising revenue, and were, therefore, compelled to tax the children, there might be some justification for this measure; hut we know well that they have not exhausted other means of taxation. In Great Britain it was found that the taxation of luxuries was a mistake, and that the proper course to adopt was to tax incomes, so that people would not have money to spend upon luxuries. That is the scientific way of dealing with the I matter. It is certainly more scientific than this proposal to tax children, and the increased postage rate which has been adopted. These miserable attempts to deal with the finances of Australia make me shudder. The Treasury bench is occupied by men who have no true conception of sound principles of taxation. They are satisfied to tax the poor man's tobacco and his beer. I hold that the Government have unexampled opportunities for levying taxation at the present time, and that it is nothing short of folly to delay effective action in this regard until the-incomes of the people have been materially reduced, as they will be, after the termination of the war. Whatever may be the opinion of honourable members opposite regarding my utterances, I have expressed my views on this Bill with the utmost candour, in the hope that I shall rouse them to a full sense of their responsibilities, and cause them to devote greater attention in the future to economic questions. Not only in Australia, but in every part of the Empire, an attempt is being made to devise a more scientific method of taxation. orable member call "" scientific ""? will see me outside the chamber I am prepared to give him a lecture upon scientific methods of taxation.

One does not endeavour to block a measure if one wishes to get it through. concession is not worth consideration. Buti f the Government desired to amend their own Bill, surely they should have been satisfied, before submitting the amendment, that it was perfectly in order.

The, CHAIRMAN -Probably the honourable member was not present when I gave the ruling which I did a few minutes ago.

Buti f the honourable gentleman is in earnest in his proposal to exempt children who are apparently under twelve years of age, he can withdraw this Bill and submit a fresh measure within the course of a few minutes. We all know perfectly well that in connection with almost every taxation measure it is customary to appoint a Committee of two Ministers to prepare and bring in a Bill giving effect to the resolution of this Chamber. No difficulty need be experienced in that connection, but from the expressions of honourable members opposite one can gather how"" afraid they are of meeting the mothers of the children whose picture-show tickets they aTe prepared to tax.

This may prove highly inconvenient, as he may desire to remove his goods to some port where the purchaser will pay duty on the goods as landed at the ship's side, thus obviating the expense of transfer to a licensed Customs warehouse. The amendment proposed will make this possible.

' SPIRITS BILL. Trade and Customs) [10.26] I move That this Bill be now read a second time. Two important amendments only are contained in this Bill. The first relates to the improper use of methylated spirits. Apart from its use for human consumption, in the form of potable spirits and alcoholic beverages, and in medicines, &c, alcohol is used very largely in the arts and manufactures. Whilst the use of alcohol for human consumption is a proper subject for taxation, and is so dealt with in the Customs and Excise Tariffs, it is necessary for the welfare of industry that alcohol for industrial purposes shall, subject to a proper safeguarding of the revenue, be made available as freely and cheaply as possible. For the protection of the revenue, therefore, spirit for industrial and scientific purposes is made available free of Excise duty when denatured by admixture with certain nauseous and poisonous substances, which render it unfit for drinking or internal use. Whilst the spirit so denatured (or methylated, as it is commonly called) is free of Excise duty, the untreated spirit is subject to an Excise duty of 16s. per proof gallon. It will be apparent, therefore, that the substitution of the methylated for the untreated spirit would be a highly profitable transaction for any dishonest person. The denaturing substance mostly used is wood naphtha, the principal active constituent of which is methyl alcohol. . IJhe presence of methyl alcohol in any substances can be readily detected by chemical analysis, and is primd facie evidence of the use of methylated spirits. In a recent prosecution brought by the Department in connection with the use of methylated spirits in the preparation of a medicine for human use, the evidence submitted to the Court showed the presence of methyl alcohol, the chief constituent of wood The opportunity has been naphtha. The Court ruled, however, that as methyl aleohol, though the. chief, was only one of the constituent parts of wood naphtha, and that as wood naphtha was the methylating substance mentioned in the regulations, the evidence showed only that part of a methylating substance was present, and for this reason the prosecution failed. As this decision breaks down the main defence of the revenue against the improper use of methylated spirits for purposes for which exciseable spirits should properly be used, the Act is being amended by altering the definition of "" methylating substanceto include not -only any principal substance specified in a regulation as a methylating material, but also any fractional part or ingredient of any such substance. The amendments relating to this matter are contained in clauses 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7. The other amendment is concerned with the safeguarding of the standard and reputation of Australian brandy. The Spirits Act provides that any spirit described as brandy must have been distilled wholly from grape wine. In the ordinary acceptation of the.term, grape wine is regarded as wine obtained by the fermentation of the juice of crushed grapes. It has been",70,Distillati On Bill Second Beading

I understand that the State Government have nominated two members to the CommitteeMr Solly and Mr Norman Bayles, and that the latter has declined to act. Mr Solly is the only representative of the party I belong to on the Committee, although there should, of course, be no parties in this matter. I mention it merely to show that the people in whom I have the most confidence have been nominated by the Federal and State Governments. will be made public. I do not want to take the platform on the matter, for fear of in j u r in g a good cause, but I am' not content with the Committee as elected. I call it a fake Committee, elected in a faked way. I am not saying anything against the present Lord Mayor of Melbourne, in whom I have f u l l confidence. did they adopt,? any one who could explain how it was done. Why should the ladies and young girls who stood in the wind and rain through all seasons to do this good work be asked just at the time of the election, in order to put a certain party into power, to pay 5s. each to secure the right to vote? Surely after giving their services day after day they should have been entitled to a vote! The Federal franchise system could have been adopted, if necessary. The gentleman I indicated previously is Mr Theodore Fink. in-the-pound Fink? never yet heard that he has tried to pay his past debts, and I do not think he is a' fit person to be at the head of that Fund. I am sorry to have to speak in this way, but I have had many complaints about the matter. If I had to weigh Mr Fink and Mrs. Woolcott in the balance, there could be no doubt as to my decision. The one is dross, and the other is pure gold, as is shown by the work she has done. The following letter, which appeared in the Aqe of 12th October, 1918, ought also to be p ut on recordWe, the undersigned, Wootton, Fuller and King, of Elizabeth-street, Melbourne, Public Accountants, hereby certify that we have been the honorary auditors of the Commonwealth Button Fund from its inception up to the present time, our Mr King having personally conducted the audit; that we have made a continuous audit of the receipts and expenditure in connection with the said fund; that all moneys received as per receipt blocks produced and verified by us have been forthwith banked with the bankers to the fund (the Bank of Victoria Limited) by the secretary and accountant to the fund, who is the only person who receives and deals with the cash receipts; that all receipts have been duly accounted for, and that all expenditure has been duly passed for payment by the Finance Committee of the Fund, and vouchers for all accounts so passed have been produced to us. We further confidently nssert, in view of the unfounded rumours current concerning moneys I hope what I am saying now alleged to have been taken from the fund"" and afterwards made good, that such rumours are absolutely without foundation, and that no moneys have been taken and no moneys made good, and that the accounts (which we have had continuously under our professional oversigH, demonstrating the falsity of these statements) are well and faithfully kept. And we further certify that from the inception of the Fund Mrs. Arthur S. Woolcott has received no salary, allowance, or honorarium of any kind, and further that she has charged no outof-pocket expenses of any description against the fund in connection with her duties as honorary organizer thereof. I intend to have action taken in the State Parliament about this matter, and in the meantime I should be glad if the Minister for Works and Railways( Mr Groom) would ask the Acting Prime Minister to insist, for the sake of the public outside, and the proper management of the large sums collected by the f u n d , that the two nominees of the Government on the Committee shall be members of the Executive Committee, so that they may know everyI s that the farthingthing that is going on. No j but I have W ill the Ministerf o r Works and Railways( Mr Groom) arrange for all the papers concerning the matter raised by the honourable member for Echuca( Mr. Palmer), about the free passage to Australia on transports of certain Anglican and Roman Catholic parsons in the guise of chaplains, to be' made available for the inspection of honourable members? It is not clear from the Minister's answer tvhether either of those faiths has been responsible for the practice of any deceit to evade the payment of passage money. We are entitled to know the facts, because if there has been any deceit or f r a u d practised, no matter what church is concerned, the persons responsible should be severely punished.",72,Master Sergeant Ozanne Citizens Hewison I Understand That Afterwards
