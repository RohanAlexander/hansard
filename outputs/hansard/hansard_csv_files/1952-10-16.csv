Thursday, 16 October, 1968. took the chair at 10.30 a.m., and read prayers. tbe precedents for the inclusion in Hansard of matter not actually spoken in the House. I believe that Hansard should be a fair record of the words actually spoken in debate. The facts shown in the photostats that the honourable member for Eden-Monaro .submitted last Wednesday for inclusion in Hansard, -have been recorded more than once. The publication of the photostats would not add to the knowledge held by honourable members of the matters in dispute. The photostats deal with matters beyond the competence of this House to settle or resolve. At the time that leave to insert them in Hansard was .granted, neither the House nor I knew of the forms of the photostats, nor had I had an opportunity to consider the matters ofprinciple that would arise from the use of them. I am not prepared to .create two new precedents-first , the insertion of photostats in Hansard; and, second, thc insertion of documents that have nothing whatever to do with this House. I rule accordingly. Speaker, to state whether your ruling means that the material that is included in those photostats, and which the House agreed .should be incorporated in Hansard, is not now to be inserted in Hansard? I may have an. opportunity next week to challenge your ruling, or whether it must be challenged immediately. Orders provide that it must be .challenged immediately, but I am in the hands of the House. If the Houses wishes to defer the matter until next week, it is quite immaterial to me. in that direction? member may submit a motion now, and then if, next week, he docs not wish to go on with it, he could' withdraw it. Mr 'CAIAVSJLI, -TheT e is a matteT of principle involved in this mattei"", as far as the House is concerned. The House gave leave to insert the documents in Hansard, and, with all duo deference to you, Mr Speaker, the Opposition does not believe that the Standing Orders eontain any provision that would empower your present action. The veto principle belongs in the United Nations, and not here. I should like to raise the matter next week. I could submit a motion now",8,Setup

38,Mr Calwell,"I rise to order. You,with his version of history. Now the Vice-President of the Executive Council, who is less an historian than the honourable member for Mackellar, is giving honourable members an even worse interpretation of history. that I know of to prevent a Minister from answering in his own way a question directed to him. All that I ask, and I think that it is a desirable practice, is that Ministers should direct their answers to the point of the question. I believe that brevity is a desirable consideration. endeavour to be brief because, as I have said, the blueprint plan appears to be taking some shape. W it h regard to the appointment of a weak Labour government as a caretaker government, may I direct the attention of the House and the country to an article that appeared in the Communist Review of last October. It was written by Mr Dixon, of the central committee of the Communist party. The article readsIn the elections at all times our aim is to build a firm united front with the Labor Party workers. We will, therefore, continue to give our preference to the ALP candidates. At the same time, we believe that there should be a definite agreement between the Communist Party and thc ALP for an exchange of preferences, and urge Labor Party workers and all other sections of the Labor movement to insist upon this that the Vice-President of the Executive Council is straying fro m the point of the honourable member's question. He is now dealing with a matter that is rather the subject for a debate. He is introducing debatable matters. attempting to draw attention to the fact that a plan has been laid down by the Communists whereby, for an exchange of preferences at a general election, they will attempt to put in office a weak Labour government as a government. Mr E. order, Mr Speaker. You have ruled on numerous occasions that only one question at a time shall be asked. The question asked by the honourable member for Mackellar is whether or not the Vice-President of the Executive Council will give effect to a policy which w ill provide for time in this House for honourable members to ventilate matters of public interest. The Minister has not said one word in answer to that question. point of order has been well taken. Standing Order 107 provides for a sixhour debate on matters of urgent public importance to be initiated by a Minister. I understood that that was the subject matter of the question of the honourable member for Mackellar, and I I shall see that he assents to what I have said by nodding his head. The Minister may care to answer the honourable member's question. stood that the core of the question of the honourable member for Mackellar related to Standing Order 107. H is question was prefaced by reasons why he should ask the question, and he asked if my attention had been drawn to a certain matter. I was saying that my attention had been drawn to it , and I gave my reason why I intended to answer the core of his question, which had reference to Standing Order 107. I was pointing out that because of the implementation or the partial implementation of the blueprint plan, I intended to give serious consideration do it . able member for East Sydney must not interject. pointing out that I would give serious consideration to Standing Order 107, which provides for a debate to discuss a special matter, because this matter is reaching a pitch where some attention must be given by the legislature to the blueprint drawn up by a. subversive organization which blueprint, it would seem, needed the co-operation with a weak caretaker Opposition.

49,Mr Kekwick,"W ill the ViceSydney Communist publication about wbicb a judge of the Supreme Court of New South Wales made serious allegations this week? Have the Commonwealth Crown law officers investigated the judge's charge that the September issue of the publication contained a ""gross incitement to the crime of subversion of the Federal Government"" ? What action is to be taken against the publisher? stand that the publicatL? to which the honourable member has referred is the Communist Review. I do not know whether the Crown law officers have investigated the charge that was made by the judge, but I have no doubt that, if they believe the publication contained a seditious statement, they will consider what action can be taken against thc publisher. Commerce and Agriculture seek to ascertain, during the Empire talks in London, the reasons for the refusal of the United Kingdom Government to waive its preference rights in respect of high horse-power crawler tractors, which Australia is importing from the United States of America under the first dollar loan programme? I ask this question because supplies of such types of tractor from the United Kingdom are very limited and can provide only a small percentage of Australia's total requirements. The imposition of duty on such tractors is unjust to the purchasers, many of whom require the machines for land clearance, irrigation and food production. as the Ottawa Agreement, the United Kingdom enjoys certain preferences in the Australian market. Reciprocally, Australian products are given protection in the United Kingdom market. Under this system of preferences, certain British products, such as tractors of the type that lent suggestion. I am not in a position the honourable member has mentioned, enjoy free entry into Australia, and, in the interests of United Kingdom manufacturers, we impose a protective duty on foreign tractors. The Australian Go^ vernment is bound by the terms of the treaty to which it is a party, and, thereask the Vice-President of the Executive fore, it is not able to remit the duty on Council concerns the management of foreign tractors. However, I agree with the honourable member that the United Kingdom at present is able to supply only a very small percentage of Australia's requirements of high horse-power crawler tractors, and I shall bring to the notice of the Minister for Trade and Customs the suggestion that he has made with a view to determining whether negotiation with the United Kingdom Government can lead to a remission of the duty on foreign tractors until the United Kingdom is able to supply all our requirements of these machines. Defence whether the Government proposes to send an Australian contingent, composed of representatives of the Navy, the Army and the Air Force, to the coronation next year? If so, is the Minister able to advise the House of the composition of the contingent? intends to send a contingent representative of the three armed services to the coronation next year. The services are at present in the process of deciding the composition of the contingent, which is expected to consist of representatives of the various arms of the three services, including the Citizen Military Forces. At present, I cannot inform the House of the exact composition of the contingent. ance that the Minister for Defence has given that a contingent, representative of the Navy, the Army and the Air Force will be sent to Great Britain to attend the coronation, does the Government intend to send a delegation of members of the Parliament to represent Australia at this supremely important ceremony? honourable member has made an excelto say whether it will be possible for the Government to act upon it.

However, if the honorahle memher knows of any case that calls for complaint, I shall be glad if he would supply the details to me. They will be fully investigated. Labour and National Service, in reply to a question asked by the honourable member for Blaxland, stated that in New South Wales, which is controlled by a Labour government, there is more unemployment than there is in any other State. Is the Minister aware that the present degree of unemployment in New South Wales has been caused by this Government's policy of the restriction of loan money? Will he endeavour to convince his colleagues in Cabinet that it is necessary for the Government to make more loan money available to the States, to enable them to provide employment for unemployed people? the honourable member means by "" restriction of loan money "". This Government has agreed that the State governments shall have all the money that can be raised on the loan market. In addition, it has, to a degree hitherto unprecedented in peace-time, made other moneys available to the States from funds under its control. for Commerce and Agriculture received a request from the Victorian Wheat and Wool Growers Association that he convene a meeting of the Australian Agricultural Council for the purpose of further discussing the future of wheat marketing? If so, does he intend to call a meeting of the council for that purpose? If he intends to do so, can he indicate, approximately, the date on which it will be held? reached me personally. A letter to that effect may have reached my department but, if so, I am not aware of it. I can give consideration to the proposal only on the basis of the substantive issue that may be raised in the request. However, I should like the Victorian Wheat and Wool growers Association to understand that I cannot do business with each of five or six State organizations. In respect of the wheat industry, I can do business on behalf of the Government only with the federal body, the Australian Wheat growers Federation. the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture. Is it not a fact that Australia has a preferential tariff which applies to goods imported from Great Britain? Is that arrangement reciprocated by Great Britain in view of the fact that it has put a heavy tariff upon wines from Australia? Is there any possibility of persuading Great Britain to l if t that tariff so that the Australian wine export trade to that country can he maintained? have the benefit of a preferential tariff for wines entering the United Kingdom. That is part of the general structure of the Ottawa Agreement, When the duty was originally imposed by the United Kingdom Government, the protection that was given to Australian wines was really effective. However, the United Kingdom Government has raised the duty on all wines very substantially for internal reasons of policy that are related both to the raising of revenue and the increasing of cost to consumers of certain non-essential requirements. The objective i? to reduce consumption and, to that degree, to save foreign exchange. The effect of the policy is that the preferential margin that is granted to Australian wines at a lower rate of duty to-day is no longer really effective. We have joined with South Africa, which has a common interest with us in this matter, in making the strongest representations to the United Kingdom Government that the preference to Australian and South African wines should be made effective.

When MrThere is no standing order and no form of procedure to compel a Minister to answer any question in this House, and the honourable member for East Sydney, who was a Minister of State for years, should be aware of that fact from his own experience. Motion (by Mr Enic J. HAEBISOK) proposedThat tlie House, at its rising, adjourn to Tuesday next, at 2.30 p.m. The Vice-President of the Executive -Council( Mr Eric J. Harrison) was much more brief in moving this motion than he was in answering a question a short time ago. He has given the House no reason why discussion of the important business now listed on the notice paper should be suspended until Tuesday next, and no reason why the House shotild not meet to-morrow. I understand that the business of this House is to be suspended because a meeting of the Australian Loan Council will take place in this chamber to-morrow, in order to discuss an increase of interest rates. I see no reason why this House should adjourn merely because the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) and the Treasurer ( Sir Arthur Fadden) have some extraparliamentary duties to perform that they could well perform while the House continued its sittings. There is plenty of room in the vaults for a meeting of the Australian Loan Council, and the vaults would provide a proper setting for a conspiracy to increase interest rates. The Premiers, the Prime Minister and the Treasurer could go down there to work out their planned attack on the people. Mi-. SPEAKER -Order!

I think that it would be far better for the nation for the business of this House to be transacted and broadcast, rather than for a body, whose deliberations we are continually told are confidential, to meet in camera in this chamber. If the Vice-President of the Executive Council would agree that on Tuesday next the House would be given a full report of the proceedings of the Australian Loan Council we could grant the concession that he asks, but if the Government insists that the deliberations of the council are to remain confidential I see no reason why the House should voluntarily agree to adjourn until Tuesday next and neglect the business of the nation. We wish to know what happens at the meeting of the Australian Loan Council, and at the same time we wish to continue to transact the business before the House. The electors of Flinders will also want to know what happens at the meeting of that council. I wish to join with the honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell) in protesting against this strange action of tha Vice-President of the Executive Council( Mr Eric J.

Now we have the strange experience, with very little notice having been given, of the Government, for some reason as yet undisclosed, wishing to close this Parliament at a time when honourable members are being continually foiled in their efforts to bring matters of national importance to the notice of the Parliament and the public generally.

I shall briefly mention one such important matter. people who have been brought here from overseas able gentleman cannot enter into a discussion of other subjects. The question before the House is whether or not the House sball meet to-morrow. I am mentioning this matter. If the House were meeting to-morrow I should seek to raise with the Minister for Immigration ( MrH o l t ) the attention he has given to the employment of Japanese whom he has brought into this country at a time when he is failin g to provide employment for Australian workers and other people who have been brought from overseas under the immigration programme. able gentleman may not proceed on those lines. with that line of argument, except to say that it is an important matter which should be discussed. I say that the Government's proposal to close the Parliament to-morrow is an attempt to stifle the voice of democracy in this country, because Ministers are afraid of the criticism Opposition. Immigration and Ministerf or Labour and National Service) [11.14] I consider that if anything was required to demonstrate the spurious character of the Opposition's protest in this matter, it was the speech of the honourable member for East Sydney( MrW a r d ) , who had the effrontery to rise in his place and say that honourable members, presumably referring to himself, had been frustrated in their efforts to bring major matters of public importance before this Parliament. I have sat in my place here throughout question time, and also at other times, during the last week, and I doubt whether there has ever been an honourable member in the history of this Parliament who has been able to put There are important more questions to Ministers in the course of one week than the honourable member for East Sydney has put in the last week. have not been answered. the Opposition had no matters on which they desired to direct questions to Ministers, the honourable member for East Sydney was up and down like a Jack-in the-box, and repeatedly received answers to his questions. I invite him to check through the pages of Hansard with a view to ascertaining the number of opportunities he has had to ask questions recently. I doubt whether he has missed an opportunity to take part in a debate on the motion for the adjournment of the House at the end of a day's proceedings. Certainly, he has not lacked any opportunity to raise the important matters to which he has referred, and, indeed, he has reiterated them ad nauseam. You, Mr Speaker, did not permit h i m to elaborate his reference that I was giving employment in this country to Japanese, and, therefore, I shall not ask your indulgence to deal with that matter in detail, but I point out that I do not know of any Japanese who have come here for employment.

In those circumstances, the programme will not be fully debated by the House, because honourable members will not be mentally and physically fit that the honourable member is completely off the beam, if I may use that expression. Standmg Order 104 provides that no new business shall be taken after 11 p.m. unless the House otherwise orders. The suspension of that rule will simply mean that new business may be introduced after 11 p.m. The motion, has nothing to do with the hours of sitting. technical objection on your part, Mr passed between 4 o'clock and 7 o'clock Speaker. of this proposal is that, when the 11 o'clock rule has been suspended by a vote of the House, the Government will be able to introduce new business at any time during the sittings of the House. The Opposition is not numerous enough to outvote the Government at the moment, although it will be fairly soon. Therefore, we shall be obliged to sit here and deal with bill after bill. All-night sittings probably would not take place if the Government did not suspend the standing order. The purpose of suspending it, as the Vice-President of the Executive Council knows-and doubtless he is truthful enough to admit the factis to enable all-night sittings to be held if necessary. The Government and its supporters apparently want to push business through the House as quickly as possible and then go home. There is no necessity for the suspension of the 11 o'clock rule at this stage. There is no reason why the Parliament should not continue to meet throughout November and December, if necessary, in order to deal effectively with its business. The French Parliament remained continuously in session during the French Revolution, and this Parliament to-day, when unemployed men are tramping the streets, might well find it advisable to do likewise. The Opposition objects to the proposal to suspend the 11 o'clock rule at this stage. The Minister at least might have been explicit. He has merely moved that the standing order be suspended, and we are expected to vote upon the motion. We are not accustomed to New Guard tactics and we will not tolerate As honourable members who have been in this Parliament for some years will know, the motion proposed by the Vice President of the Executive Council( Mr Eric J. Harrison) is in accordance with the procedure that has been followed in this House for a long time. When the Labour party was in power, bills that provided for the expenditure of many millions of pounds were often in the morning. You will remember, Mr Speaker, that we returned to the Hotel Kurrajong just in time for breakfast. Now, the honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell), who had some power in the Labour Government, argues that such a procedure should not be adopted. He has said that the House should meet to-morrow, but he well knows that an important meeting must be held in this chamber to-morrow. The opinions of honourable members opposite seem to have changed remarkably since they were put out of office. An astonishing change has taken place in their demeanour, their professed ideals, and their actions. I think you will agree, Mr Speaker, that the proposal to suspend the 11 o'clock rule is a matter of ordinary procedure. The Government is eager to complete the transaction of its business by a certain date. The House has been in session since the 6th August. This will probably be almost a record sessional period for the number of sitting days. We are now in the eleventh week of the period, and we have been sitting on four days a week for some time past. The frequency of meetings of the House, and the length of the sessional period, are due to the wish of the Government to provide members of the Opposition as well as",25,Newand Opposed Busines S After 11 P M

I remind the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward) that thatera ended with a military dictatorship. that the honourable member for East Sydney will take your remarks to heart, Mr Speaker. I do not wish to comment on your rulings, Mr Speaker, but J remind the honourable member for Melbourne that you have chided this House repeatedly for tedious repetition and the delaying tactics of the Opposition when Government measures have been under discussion. never heard you rule, Mr Speaker, that the Opposition alone was guilty of tedious repetition. Is the Vice-President of the Executive Councili n order in using The opinions of yours to attack the Opposition ? time mentioned any of the parties when I have commented upon tedious repetition.

Sitting continuously in the Chair, as I do, I think that I am a better judge thqn any other honourable member on that point. I object to and ask for mission of a motion of this kind is purely procedural; and the implementation of it , if it is carried, rests entirely with the Opposition. If honourable members opposite w ill be prepared, more than they have been up to date, to deal expeditiously with the business of the House, it w ill not be necessary for the Government to introduce new business after eleven o'clock. However, should the occasion arise to do so, the Government will certainly take that course. Members of the Opposition have suggested that such a procedure is simply terrible. I point out that repeatedly on the motion for the adjournment, after general business has been concluded at 10.30 p.m., honourable members opposite All dictators object to keep the House in session up t ill midnight speaking on matters which they consider to be of importance to their constituents. Therefore, what is all this pother about? It reveals the stark insincerity of honourable members opposite in this matter. They are engaging in delaying tactics. They wish to prevent the Government from dealing expeditiously with the busiI hope ness of the House.

136,Luck. A. W. G. Mr Eric J. Harrison (Wentworth,"Honourable members will recall that the Government appointed a committee consisting of Mr Justice Owen, of the New Soutb Wales Supreme Court, , Sir Stanley Savige and Dr. W. E. Fisher, to consider certain proposals which were advanced for the payment of a subsistence allowance to former prisoners of war. This committee found that there had been a general failure by Japan to treat Australian prisoners of war in accordance with the provisions of the International Convention of 1929 to which that power had pledged itself, and that, as a result, the great majority of prisoners suffered undue hardships and privations. The Owen committee further observed that capture was one of the hazards servicemen must face, and that a claim for hardship money under these conditions was without a just or logical basis. The committee pointed out that the responsibility for failing to observe international law governing the treatment of prisoners of war rested upon the captor power. Following the report of this committee, their health was impaired and they were the Government established the Prisoners left with much less capacity to restore of War Trust Fund, and an amount of their fortunes. The Government felt in £250,000 was appropriated from Consolithe circumstances that it was fitting that dated Revenue and made available to responsibility for compensation for these trustees, under the chairmanship of disabilities, many of which will only beBrigadier Blackburn, V.C, for the benefit come apparent as the years go by, should of formers prisoners of war of both Japan rightly rest with the Japanese, and conand Germany who suffered mental or sequently the Government decided to disphysical hardship which is directly tribute these assets amongst those referable to their captivity. In the negoaffected. These assets represent the tiations leading up to the peace treaty whole of the Japanese assets in Auswith Japan, the Australian Government tralia. used its best endeavours to secure general acceptance of a provision in that treaty for compensation to those who had between prisoners of war and Australian suffered at the hands of the Japanese. It civilians who were pursuing their lawful was not practicable, however, to reach business in territory overrun by the any general agreement among our Allies Japanese, and who thus became interon the. question of monetary reparations, nees. It was considered that these because the extent of the prior claims of civilians should receive some compensacountries which had assisted Japan to tion from the funds available. The Goobtain some stability after the cessation vernment therefore decided that the proof hostilities were such that if all claims ceeds of the sale of Japanese assets in were accepted, Japan could not possibly Australia should be distributed as have regained economic stability. was possible, however, to make provision in the treaty for the handing over by Japan of its assets in neutral and exenemy countries, and, as honourable members are aware, these assets will be Mr Brie J. Harrison. assembled by the International Committee of the Red Cross, and the proceeds will be made available to the respective countries concerned for distribution for the benefit of former prisoners of war and their families. I point out that by virtue of this provision, which was inserted in the treaty largely owing to persistent efforts by Australia, the whole of Japan's external assets will become available for the benefit of former prisoners of war. In addition, under the terms of the Japanese peace treaty, the Japanese assets in Australia become the property of the Australian Government. These assets have an estimated value of £770,000. The total of the fund to be distributed uuder this bill will be in the vicinity of that sum of £770,000. In considering the disposal of these assets, the Government had in mind that the prisoners of war and civilian internees had been captured and interned by an enemy who did not observe the rules of international law. As a consequence, It was found difficult to differentiate It follows:(a) An amount of £25,000 will he allocated from the proceeds to the trustees of a civilian internees fund to be used to afford a measure of compensation to bona fide Australian civilians who suffered personal hardship at Japanese hands, and whose claims fall within the following categories:-(1 ) Loss of life where the deceased was a family breadwinner; and (2) Loss of limb or lasting injury to the health of an individual. (h) The balance of the funds available (estimated at £745,000) will be distributed equally amongst former prisoners of war of the Japanese without regard to the term of imprisonment. In cases where a prisoner died whilst captive, or since his reperson or persons who stood to the tense, the amount to which he would otherwise have become entitled will be paid to his dependants. Members of orgauizatious (e.g. the Young Men's Christian Association and the Eed Cross)'who were in uniform and attached to the Australian forces, and who were captured by the Japanese and held as prisoners of war, will be treated on the same footing as prisoners of war as regard participating in the distribution of the fund. The Government is anxious that the distribution of these funds' should be made as soon as possible. Hence the bill gives authority to the Attorney General to move the High Court to make available the moneys, investments, books or accounts which are held by that court. These moneys and investments, together with moneys and investments already held by the Controller of Enemy Property, will be realized, and, subject to the payment of the necessary expenses of the Controller of Enemy Property in the administration of the National Security (Enemy Property) Eegulations, and such other claims as may be made on the funds, and the payment of £25,000 to the trustees of the Civilian Internees Trust Fund, the halance will be transferred to a distributing authority who will then make it available as directed by the Prime Minister. Action has already been taken to complete the rolls covering those entitled to participate iu the distribution. It should be possible, therefore, for the distribution to proceed at an early date, and no doubt a public announcement will be made by the distributing authority in due course if it should be necessary for ex-prisoners of war to make an application for payment of the money. With regard to payments to be made to the dependants of deceased prisoners of war, the term ""dependants"" will be interpreted liberally and the prescribed authority will be given discretionary power, should circumstances so warrant it, to make payment to such other person or persons and under any conditions as he sees fit. In the first instance, however, payment would be made to such deceased in the relationship of wife, child, parent, step-parent or fosterparent, or persons who were actually dependent on the deceased at the time of his death. The distributing authority proposes to make an initial payment of £32 per head to each ex-prisoner of war or dependant as the case may be, and I trust that it will he possible to make this payment with a minimum of delay. I commend the bill to honourable members. adjourned. That leave hc given to bring in a bill for an act to amend the Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Aet 1048-01, amd for other purposes.

138,Motion (By Mr Mcbride) Agreed To,,30,Second Reading
139,Mr Mcbride (Wakefield,"MinisterAs honourable members are aware, the Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Act, wbich was brought into operation in J uly, 1948, is the basis of a scheme of retirement benefits for members of the permanent defence forces, and provides for pensions or lump-sum payments to members on their retirement from the services, for cover in respect of invalidity during service, and for an appropriate pension entitlement for the widows and children of members who die during service or after retirement on pension. Certain increases of the rates of pensions were made by amending legislation in 1950 and 1951. In the light of the increases of pensions for which provision was made recently in the Eepatriation Act 1952, the Government considers that a further adjustment should be made of payments under the Defence Forces Eetirement Benefits Act to pensioners who are retired on reaching their retiring ages prior to the age of 60 years, or are retired prior to that age with an incapacity that does not attract a full "" age sixty pension"". The bill provides for increases of pensions ranging from £32 10s. to £102 per annum for officers, according to rank, and from £17 5s. to £24 per annum for ranks other than that of officer, with higher rates of increment of pension for members in the latter class who serve 26 years or more after attaining the age of twenty years. Members of the nursing services will benefit also, by increases of pensions ranging from £24 10s. per annum for a nursing sister to £69 10s. per annum for the rank of matron-in-chief. Thc new rates of pension for each rank are shown in the third and fifth schedules to the bill. The increased rates of pensions will be payable on and from the 2nd October, 1952-that is the date upon which increases under the Repatriation Act will become payable-and will apply to existing pensioners under the Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Act, as well as to those who become pensionable after that date. Other provisions of the bill concern the rights of certain pensioners who, having served and retired on pension, re-enlist and again become contributors to thc fund. The broad basis of entitlement of Jfr. jlfcBrtdc. those members will be that they will receive credit for the aggregate of complete years served prior, and subsequent to, re-entry resulting in a higher entitlement on ultimate retirement. That provision will act as an inducement to trained personnel to re-enter the service and will assist us to overcome any short age of instructors caused by greater numbers of men. serving in the permanent defence forces, or by the requirements of national service training. The bill provides also that when a member of the forces is appointed to an office in the Public Service he may hecome a contributor to the Commonwealth Superannuation Fund at the rate of contribution previously paid by him to the Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Fund, and to receive a pension on the basis of units so contributed for when he ultimately retires at the age of 60 or 65 years. A further provision of tbe measure is designed to correct an anomaly that affects a small group of officers of the Royal Australian Air Force who contributed formerly to the superannuation fund for death and invalidity during their service. TJnder the original act, the maximum rate of pension was that provided under the Superannuation Act 1947, that is, £32 10s. for each unit. That rate, however, was increased by the Superannuation Acts of 1950 and 1951 to £39 for each unit. Clause 13 will result in this class of pensioner receiving, with retrospective effect, the rate of pension already provided for similar pensioners who retired under the Superannuation Act and received the increased benefits for which the Superannuation Acts of 1950 and 1951 made provision. The remaining clauses relate to matters of administration, including the rectification of minor anomalies that have become apparent during the four years that the scheme has been in operation. As I have already stated, the main purpose of the bill is to provide increased pensions for members of the forces who retire at an earlier age than sixty years., or to persons who, being incapacitated, are entitled to pensions based on rank. The amendments envisaged by the bill are a further indication of the Government's concern for the welfare of the defence forces, and its recognition of the services that are being rendered to this country by those who liave adopted a service career as their vocation. The Defence Forces Retirement Benefits scheme ensures for them a measure of security. They know that, upon their retirement, either upon completion of their service or through invalidity, they, by the benefits accruing to them under this scheme, w ill be able to enjoy a reasonable standard of living, and that, in the event of their death before or following retirement as pensioners, those dependent upon them will be reasonably provided for . I commend this bill to honourable members. adjourned. That leave be given to bring in a bill for an act to amend the Canned Fruits Export Control Act 15)26-50. B ill presented, and read a first time. Commerce and Agriculture) [12.13] by leave I move That the bill be now read a second time. The main purpose of this bill is to give effect to the request of Queensland pineapple canners that the Canned Fruits Export Control Act 1926-50 be so amended as to bring within the jurisdiction of the Australian Canned Fruits Board canned tropical f r u it salad and canned pineapple juice for export from Australia. authority responsible for the supervision and regulation of our export trade in specified varieties of canned fruits. A t the present time, it has a charter to ensure orderly overseas marketing arrangements for canned apricots, peaches, pears, pineapples and f r u it salad, consisting in the main of any one or more of those varieties of canning fruits. The bill seeks to add canned tropical f r u it salad and canned pineapple juice to tbe list of canned f r u it products which come within the control of the board. When submitting the proposal on behalf of, and at the request of, Queensland pineapple-canners the Committee of Direction of F r u it Marketing, a Queensland Statu instrumentality, pointed out that the processing of canned pineapple juice and canned tropical f r u it salad, the largest ingredient of which is pineapple, forms an integral part of the operations of canners in Queensland and that au extensive overseas market is being developed for both of these products. Statistics reveal that there has been a very substantial expansion in both the produetion and export of those lines in the post-war years, and that the trade continues to develop. Canners consider that it would strengthen the position of the industry if these products could be handled by the board on a similar basis to that adopted in respect of canned apricots, peaches, pears and pineapples over a long period of years. The board has indicated that, in the interests of orderly marketing of canned f r u it products generally, it favours their inclusion within its sphere of activity. The opportunity has been taken in the bill to bring some of the general machinery provisions of the Canned Fruits Export Control Act up to date by making some drafting alterations and also by adjusting an existing anomaly in the act. The act provides for the appointment of a member of the board to represent Statecontrolled canneries engaged in the production of canned fruits other than canned pineapples. For many years the position has been that, with the exception of a very small quantity of apricots, peaches and pears, mostly bought interstate and canned in Brisbane by the Committee of Direction of F r u it MarketThe board is a statutory ing, there is no State-owned or controlled cannery in Australia that processes these varieties of fruits. The section of the act which provides for a representative on t.he board of State-controlled canneries that process canned fruits, other than canned pineapples, is therefore superfluous, and thc bill therefore provides for the repeal of that section. The board will then consist of four members, to comprise a Commonwealth representative, one representative of proprietary and privately owned canneries engaged in the production of canned apricots, peaches and pears, one representative of co-operative canneries engaged in the productior. of canned apricots, peaches and pears,",30,Second Reading

151,Mr Calwell,"I was coming to theMareeba-Dimbulah district, in the electorate of Leichhardt, have suggested that Australian tobacco manufacturers should be compelled to meet 10 per cent, of their requirements with Australian leaf. That request seems very modest. I do not smoke; I have never smoked in my life and I am no connoisseur of tobacco; but I. am told that the Australian leaf is as good as the imported leaf. In my opinion, vve cannot afford the luxury of using dollars for the purchase of Virginian leaf. If we cannot get within Australia all the leaf that we require, we should approach some of the countries' in the sterling area for additional supplies. Greece is experiencing difficulty in exporting its tobacco leaf. That is one reason why it is in such an awful financial position, and almost overrun by the Communists. The Government should give serious consideration to the very modest request of Australian tobacco-growers, whether they are in Queensland, Victoria, or any other part of the Commonwealth, that manufacturers of tobacco in Australia should be required to meet 10 per cent, of their requirements with Australian leaf. Division V. of the proposals relates to textiles, felts and furs and manufactures thereof, and attire. ""We have much unemployment in the textile brought about, in part, by the flood of imports which were encouraged last year by the Government. It believed that, by using our overseas balances in London as it did. an anti-inflationary effect would be produced. The more goods we bought for the Australian market, the sooner would costs be reduced. I do not think that the economists who recommended that course to the Government were justified by the events. We got a flood of imports that used up a big proportion of the £596,000,000 of our 'balances in London, which was expended last year, and to-day Australians are out of work in many parts of the country because the warehouses are flooded with imported textiles, clothing, and even boots and shoes. I am told that almost every mercer in Australia has the equivalent of about three suits of clothes for every customer. If that is so, it will be a long time Before many Australian workers will be employed in supplying the clothing requirements of our people. ifr. Cnlwell. The tariff proposals in relation tometals and machinery also affect Australian manufacturers. Some of the duties are low. Some items are admitted free under the British preferential tariff seek your guidance, Mr Deputy Chairman, on a matter of procedure. The lionorable member for Melbourne is not discussing the tariff proposals item by item, but has spoken on DivisionI . and Division II . and Division V., and is now beginning to make some remarks about Division VI . I think that we should endeavour to facilitate the debate on these matters, because, obviously, only DivisionI . is before the Chair at the present time. I suggest to the honourable member for Melbourne that we either consider the schedules as a whole, so that we may indulge in a rambling debate on them, or discuss and theh dispose of each division in turn. There has been no opposition from outside to these proposals. The DEPUTY CHAIEMAN ( Mr Bowden) -The honourable member for Melbourne asked, at the beginning of his remarks, whether we would deal with the industry, proposals separately. He was assured that we would, and he is now addressing himself to the various divisions. were considering Customs Tariff Proposals No. 6. The Opposition does not desire that the proposals be considered division by division. We are prepared to have a debate on the whole schedule. I think that is what the Vice-President of the Executive Council( Mr Eric J. Harrison) means, and I agree with him completely, except in one respect. He suggested that we might indulge in a rambling debate. I consider that he should amend that observation, and say that we should have an intelligent discussion covering the whole of the proposals. I should not like the people of Australia to think that honourable members would ramble in any circumstances. AVe are quite orderly in our method of procedure, and any contributions which honourable members will make on these matters will be well worth hearing.",34,Tarif F Proposals 1952 Customs Tariff Amendment No 6

153,Mr Calwell,"I thought that we;after I had been listening to the honorable gentleman's speech that I made reference to a rambling debate. Mr CA LWE'LL -The right honourable .gentleman has a guilty conscience. He makes a rambling speech on every subject that he discusses. However, I thank him for his intervention. Now that the position is clear, I shall continue my remarks about the duties, on metals and machinery. Many of the items in D i v i sion VI . are admitted free of duty under the British preferential tariff. few items are admitted free of duty under the intermediate tariff which ,gives the favoured nation treatment, or under the general tariff. Despite the views of the T a r i ff Board, some of these items could possibly be manufactured in Australia. I believe that the Tariff Board does a good job in maintaining .a constant supervision over all our tariff items. me, the board allowed a. number -of Australian industries to shelter too long behind the tariff wall to the point .at which they become inefficient. Managements take it for granted that the industries concerned do not have to compete with imported goods, and do not keep up to date in their methods of manufacture and the control of their industries, and do not maintain their general efficiency. However, I have a feeling that some tariff items might be increased somewhat in order to encourage Australians to become more self-sufficient. The DEPUTYCHAIRMAN The honourable gentleman's time has -expired. able member has risen, I shall take my second period now. The remarks that I have been making are also applicable to Division VII varnishes. It is strange how Australian industry in this particular line of business has developed since the last war. Big manufacturers, such as British Australian Lead Manufacturers, Lewis Berger and Sons (Australia) Proprietary Limited Limited, were established in Sydney before the last war, but big paint works have since been established in Melbourne, It was only and both the Sydney and the Melbourne manufacturers are spreading their operations into each other's territory. They are also establishing factories in other parts of Australia. I am glad to know, from my reading of various trade journals, that some of these concerns are establishing works in Brisbane and even further north of that city, and in Western Australia. That is all to the good. Division VIII . relates to earthenware, cement, china, glass and stone. It is true Very that a number of industries are starting in Australia to make those goods which are so necessary to our well-being as a community. Probably we are not able to manufacture all the wood, wicker and cane goods that we should like to make. However, the revenue that is redeived from the duties on those goods is not particularly great. Division XII . relates to hides, leather and rubber. We export hides, and it is rather anomalous that we At times, it seems to should receive revenue from duties imposed on imported hides and leather. Unfortunately, we are not yet growing rubber in Australia, although we have commenced to do so in New Guinea. As a defence measure, we should encourage, by subsidy, the growing of rubber in the Northern Territory, New Guinea and Papua. When the time comes that we can supply ourselves we may have to increase the duty on rubber imported from Malaya and elsewhere. Anything that can help Australia to get its own industries established should be clone. I do not think that any honourable Order ! member on either side of the chamber would disagree with that statement, because the more we develop our industries, the sooner we shall people Australia; and the sooner we people Australia, the easier it will be for us to defend it. The honourable member for Deakin( Mr Davis) and a number of his O i l s , paints and colleagues, in company with some Opposition members, were in Darwin recently, and I had the pleasure of meeting them there. When we get nearer the gateway of invasion to this country, we tend to take a. more Australian outlook in regard to our problems than we do when we are and Taubmans Proprietary in the more settled districts in the south.

I do not desire to say any more about these customs tariff proposals other than to commend the Tariff Board for the work that it continues to do. Whoever devised the idea of having the Tariff Board to save the time of the Parliament, and to give it information so that there would not be those long and untrammelled debates that there used to be on tariff items, deserves a commemoration.

160,Mr Eric J. Harris On,"Not that we ane producing sufficient beer for our own requirements demonstrates quite clearly that we can restrict the importation of beer, although this measure is not so designed, and we are not setting ourselves against any particular article. In answer to the criticism of the honourable member for Melbourne, we may say that we have this matter under control. The honourable member also mentioned tobacco, and stated that it was necessary for us to encourage the Australian tobacco industry. He then suggested that certain higher percentages of Australian leaf should be used in the tobacco sold in Australia. This Government intends to increase the percentage of Australian leaf used in the manufacture of tobacco. Indeed, the Government is encouraging tobacco-growing in a way as it has not been encouraged by any other government. The Curtin government, in 1942, increased the excise on cigarette tobacco by Ss. per lb. This Government increased it this year by 6s. per lb. Therefore, hongeneral observations about our secondary orable members will perceive that even in this matter we are not restricting the manufacture of Australian tobacco to the same degree as the Curtin Government did. That is, of course, if imposing excesg-eneral policy of Australian governsive excise will result in a restriction of production. I do not want to be controversial about the matter. I merely give that as an example of how the subject can be thrown out of perspective. In common with the Labour party, this Government would like to see a tremendous increase in fhe production of Australian tobacco. We believe that while the Australian taste has not yet been completely won over for Australian tobacco, as has the American taste for Virginian tobacco, the South African taste for Rhodesian tobacco and the English taste for Virginian and Rhodesian tobacco, in time Australians will prefer their home-grown tobacco. As our production increases we shall certainly develop a taste for Australian tobacco. At SarinaI have seen fine lemon-coloured Australian tobacco leaf sold for a price equal to the highest price paid for similar Virginian tobacco. I suggest that that furnishes a proof that there is a possibility of great development in the tobacco industry of Australia. We shall develop that industry in time, because the ability to do so is only a matter of knowing how to cure tobacco leaf and cultivating the palate of the Australian consumer. Cigarettes are uow being manufactured at Mareeba. I remember when Mareeba cigarettes were almost unsmoke^ able, because I tried to smoke some of them but could not do so. The cigarette now being produced from Mareeba tobacco is quite smokeable. In fact it is quite good. I think that Mareeba tobacco will become increasingly popular on the Australian market. I have made these observations to indicate that the Government is not trying to restrict production, but is carefully watching the tobacco industry and the tobacco market so that we may be in a position to produce greater quantities of leaf, and to change the preference of the Australian consumer from overseas tobacco to Australian tobacco. The honourable member for Melbourne has mentioned textiles, and made some indtistries. I was rather worried about his statements because they do not square with other statements of very recent date that I have been made aware of. The ments is to en-courage secondary industry production. We believe that without secondary industry production, Australia will never be able to reach its great destiny. Australia has all the natural advantages of a primary producing country, but there should be a good balance between primary and secondary production. No modern country can hope to succeed, or discharge its obligations to the world, unless there is a good balance between its primary and secondary industries. HoweveT, there is a grave danger of over-production of certain lines. I am talking about the production of secondary industries now, as compared with that of primary industries. For example, we have more man-power employed in secondary industries a head of our population than has the United States of America. Such a state of affairs is bad for a country with a relatively small population, like Australia. There should be a balance between primary and secondary industries. Only good could flow from such a balanced production. I shall not generalize too much, but I desire to ibe clear in my own mind as to where Labour stands w i th regard to secondary industry production and the encouragement of secondary industries. This matter has become somewhat confused recently. The honourable member for Melbourne, after he had visited Darwin, said that it became more apparent as oue examined the possible points of invasion of this continent that the more we developed our secondary industries the less would we need to worry about the future. I cannot agree with liim more completely. However, the deputy leader of the Labour party in another place has said that the Government should establish secondary industries in far eastern countries. for the Labour party. gentleman who made the remark that I statement has already been mentioned have mentioned is the deputy leader of the outside this House.

Does it still stand where it has always professed to stand, or has it now developed some sort, of Blackburn interpretation of its socialistic policy? 1 confess that, at the moment, I am not sure of the nature of Labour's policy. Vice-President of the Executive Council( Mr Eric J. Harrison) based his criticism of the honourable member for Melbourne (Mi"". Calwell) on certain premises, but he carefully omitted any reference to the most important feature of the remarks made by the honourable gentleman. The lionorable meinber for Melbourne directed attention to the inequity of the Government's tariff proposals and said, very truly, that they represented a sectional tax, thoughts follow logical processes must agree with that criticism. The failure of the Vice-President of the Executive Council to refer to that comment by the lionorable member for Melbourne was very significant. Apparently, he was well aware of the force of the argument that was advanced on behalf of the Opposition. The Minister said that the general policy of this Government was to encourage secondary industries. It is all very well to talk hyperbolically about the encouragement of secondary industries, but facts are another matter. The cold, hard facts prove that this Government is not tryin g to encourage secondary industries. I refer the Vice-President of the Executive Council to Overseas Trade Statistics for June, 1952. I note from section of the community. A small that publication that, in 1950-51, manufactured fibres, textiles and materials worth £13S,669,000 were imported into Australia, and that the value of such imports for 1951-52 was £203,607,000. Those contradict thc statement that this Government is encouraging the development of Australian secondary industries. both sides of the chamber are well aware that this Government has, in fact, discouraged secondary industrial expansion. The increasing unemployment in the textile trade is evidence of the fact. The Vice-President of the Executive Council spoke in airy, general terms that had little relation to the truth. The Government's tariff proposals contemplate the imposition of an unfair tax on one section of the community. Other sections will not be penalized in the same way. I refer specifically to the excise on beer, spirits and tobacco. Every honourable member, I believe, is eager to foster the development of the Australian tobacco-growing industry, but the policy of the Government, as reflected in the tariff proposals, w ill not encourage that industry. The purpose of the Government is merely to increase revenue at the expense of tobacco smokers. Most adult Australians, and, unfortunately, many juveniles also, smoke tobacco. I do not wish my remarks on this subject to be misunderstood. I am not an advocate of excessive smoking or drinkEvery honourable member whose ing. In fact, however, the tariff proposals have been designed, not to curb excessive smoking or drinking, but to obtain extra revenue in a most unfair way from the smokers and beer drinkers. How does the excise duty that we are asked to authorize affect the average man in the street who smokes tobacco? A small packet of Ardath cigarettes costs l s. 4$d. The Government receives 9d. in the form of excise duty from the sale of that packet. A large packet of the same well-known brand of cigarettes costs 2s. 9d., of which l s . 5d. goes to the Government. In other words, more than half the price of a packet of cigarettes is accounted for by excise. I cannot imagine a more unfair levy on a packet of Capstan cigarettes cost Is. l i d . , of which 7d. goes to the Government. A large packet costs 2s. 3d., and Is. 2d. goes to the Government. Pipe tobacco of well-known brands, such as Capstan. facts, among many others, Havelock, Champion and Log Cabin, costs 4s. I d . for a 2-oz. packet. The Government receives either l s. 11-Jd. or 2s. from the sale of each packet. These Most honourable members on figures cannot be controverted. The excise duty on beer was mentioned when the Government's budget proposals for 1951-52 were under consideration in this chamber, but I make no apology for raising the subject again. The excise on bee>has increased over the years u n t i l it",39,Tarif F Proposals 1952 Customs Tariff Amendment No 6
172,Mr Cremean (Hoddle) [2.31],"Th ehas assumed alarming proportions. It is probably one of the most unfair taxes imposed on any section of the community. I hold no brief for the drunkard or for the breweries, but I object to this imposition. As they say in England, ""Beer and baccy are for the working man "". I repeat that the object of the Government is not to curtail the consumption of beer and tobacco, but to increase revenue from such sales. The story of the progressive increase of the excise on beer is remarkable. Prior to World War I., the charge was 3d. a gallon. It was increased during that war to 6d. a gallon, and, after the war, the rate was increased progressively until, during the years of the depression, it ranged between 2s., Is. lOd. and Is. 9d. a gallon. Upon the outbreak of World War' IE., the charge was increased to 2s. 9d. a gallon. In 1941, it was increased again to 3s. a gallon. Extra revenue had to be obtained in order to meet the inescapable commitments of our war effort, and, therefore, the duty was increased again to 4s. 7d. a gallon. That was a tough charge. The Government now proposes to increase the rate to 7s. 2d. a gallon. Who will bear the cost of the increase? Not the breweries or the publicans, but the consumers, to whom the additional charge will be passed on by the breweries and the publicans! The consumers represent a considerable section of the community, and they should not he penalised because they like to drink an occasional glass of beer. The average consumption of intoxicants in Australia in 1938 was 12.13 imperial gallons a head of the population. By 1948-49, the rate of consumption had increased to 17.9 gallons a head. Therefore, the new rate of excise will represent a charge of about. £6 a head annually on the entire population. The actual imposition on beer drinkers, of course, will be much greater than that. No other government levy has increased so steeply as has the excise duty on beer. There has been an increase of 1,450 per cent. The incidenco of indirect taxation does not affect any other seetion of the community so unfairly as it affects persons coming within this category. Whereas in 1938-39,. collections of excise duty on beer, ales, and spirits totalled £7,288,579, total collections for the period from 1939-46 amounted Mr Oremean. to £119,543,611 or, approximately £15,000,000 a year. In the post-war period from 1946-49, total collections amounted to £86,096,738 or, approximately £21,500,000 a year; but since this Government assumed office, total 'collections under this heading have amounted to £123,744,673, or, approximately £61,500,000 a year. The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN ( Mr Bowden) -The honourable member's time has expired. able member has risen, I shall take my second fifteen-minute period. To-day, breweries are to a large degree simply tax collectors for the Government. Last year, Carlton and United Breweries Limited collected for the Government excise duty which totalled £15,050,000, whilst the Ballarat Brewing Company which is a provincial brewery collected, on the average, £1,250,000. These increases of indirect tax are to be borne only by those who, for the most part, like to have a glass of ale now and again. The great majority of Australians do not drink intoxicating liquor to excess. The number of convictions recorded for drunkenness shows that whilst the consumption of intoxicating liquor has not diminished iu this country, it has not increased excessively compared with consumption in other countries. Let us consider the effect of this tax upon the man in the street. A 7-oz. glass of ale is retailed at 9d. Of that amount the brewery receives 1.5d. and the publican 3.4d. whilst the Government collects in excise duty 4Jd. Of the retail price of ls. for an 11-oz. glass of ale, the brewery receives 1.4d., and the publican 4.6d. whilst the Government receives 6d. in excise duty. A bottle of ale is retailed at 2s. 4d. Of that amount the brewery receives 9d. and the publican 4.6d., whilst the Government receives 14.3d. in excise duty, or more than 50 per cent, of the retail price. A dozen bottles of beer cost 2Ss. Of that amount thc Government collects in excise duty 14s-. 4d. A 9-gallon keg of beer, which is a customary requisite at convivial parties, is sold by the brewery to the publican at£4 4s. Of that amount, the",40,Tarif F Proposals 1952 Customs Tariff Amendment No 6
173,Mr Cremean,"As no other honorbrewery retains 19s. 6d. whilst the Government collects in excise duty £3 4s -6d. The Government should seriously consider tbe incidence of excise duty on beer, ales, and spirits from the general economic point of view. Government supporters have much to say about the need to encourage both secondary and primary industries. I point out that .a substantial proportion of primary produce is used in the brewing of beer and ale and in the manufacture of spiritous liquors. Consequently, an unfair tax of this kind can react detrimentally on primary production. The same observation applies to indirect taxation in respect of spirituous liquors. ""Whilst, over only 3s. 6d. per lb. That is a serious the years, the number of persons who drink beer and ale has increased to a moderatedegree, the number who drink spirits has also increased to a reasonable degree, having regard to the increase in our population. Under these proposals, it is intended to increase .these imposts on the small man. The Australian Labour party speaks on behalf of the small man, who makes up the inarticulate mass of the people. The ballot-box presents the only effective opportunity to such persons to voice their disapproval of this unfair treatment, and I have no doubt that they will do so on the next appropriate occasion. I warn the Government that, in spite of all its shibboleths to the effect that it is watchis blended with 3 per cent, of Australianing the economic position closely and that it is privy to the needs of industry, these proposals will react against it. These impositions refute the Government's claim that its .policy is animated by a spirit of justice. The Vice-President of the Executive Council( Mr Eric J. Harrison) emphasized the importance of the tobacco industry to the Australian economy. No honourable member will deny that the National Government, as well as State governments, should do their utmost to encourage that industry. Tobacco growing originally was a very risky venture. Many people who embarked upon it lost considerable sums of money ranging in individual instances from £500 to,£5,000. Later, the industry in Queensland, owing to the assistance that was given to it by that State Government, was enabled to get on its feet, and to-day it is being run on co-operative principles. The Minister referred to the distribution of inferior cigarettes of Australian manufacture. I point out that those cigarettes were placed on the market by go-getters. I , myself, persuaded the management of the parliamentary bar at Parliament House, Brisbane, to place an order for 1,000 packages of those cigarettes, and as far as I know they still remain unsold. The Minister, in a tone that implied that credit was due to the Government, said that under these proposals the excise duty on tobacco was to be increased .by imposition, having regard to the need to encourage tobacco growing in this country. Indeed, the Government should introduce proposals to reduce the excise duty on Australian tobacco. I know that the Minister will retort that the Government would require to make good the loss of revenue that would result from such action. As the marketing of tobacco is a two-way traffic, any loss to revenue could be made good by increasing the import duty on tobacco. I deplore the fact that under these proposals the increase of duty on tobacco imported from any country, even from Japan, is not to be more than that which is to be applied to British tobacco which grown leaf in the manufacture of cigarettes or pipe tobacco. In view of that fact, the Government cannot claim that it is keenly desirous of encouraging the tobacco industry in this country. If it wished to do so, it would encourage the use of the Australian-grown leaf to a greater degree. Perhaps, honorahle members generally are aware of a move that is now being made to import large quantities of Japanese tobacco. I give credit to the Minister for Trade and Customs (Senator O'Sullivan) for the fact that up to date he has strictly limited the issue of permits for the importation of Japanese tobacco and cigarettes. However, such permits could, at any time, be issued practically without restriction, with the result that the Australian market would be flooded with the Japanese article. In that event, we should witness the spectacle of the products of a country with",41,Tarif F Proposals 1952 Customs Tariff Amendment No 6
174,Mr Bruce (Leichhardt) [2.52],"which we were so recently at war heing marketed in Australia in circumstances that would jeopardize the Australian tobacco industry. The Minister said that no representations had been made to the Government by any interests that were directly concerned in the manufacture of articles that are covered by these proposals. I point out that a conference was held recently in Canberra, at which a representative of the Australian Government attended, to consider the future of the tobacco industry, and that as a result of that conference a request was made to the Government that it should provide that a greater proportion of Australian-grown leaf should be blended with imported tobacco in order to enable the latter to qualify for a rebate of duty. Such a provision would encourage the production of Australian tobacco. know that Australia has borrowed dollars and that it must pay them back. We must also pay an excessive rate of in terest upon the loan. Dollars are our greatest danger although they are necessary for industry. The tobacco industry is Australia's greatest potential dollar earner. The Government should encourage the production of tobacco by the imposition of customs duties. Unlimited land is available and the only barrier to production is the lack of preference or at least an even break in competition with tobaccos that are controlled by world monopolies. For some i'eason those monopolies do not want tobacco to be grown in Australia. The Government could establish the industry on sound lines with the help of adequate customs have given some assistance, and as a result some tobacco-growers are prosperous and happy and are saving the country dollars. However, I see no real desire on the part of the Australian Government to assist the industry to the extent that it deserves. The best way to assist it. would be to lower the excise dmy on Australian tobacco to a minimum. Any loss of excise could be compensated by extra customs collections. I am not entirely happy about the preference that has been given to Australian tobacco. intrude into this debate briefly only to answer the ill-founded, uninformed and exaggerated comments that have been made by the Vice-President of the Executive Council( Mr EricJ . Harrison) in an attack on Senator Armstrong, who i6 the Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate.

The honourable member for Eden-Monaro( Mr Allan Fraser) is correct. It does not matter what happened in the House last night. We are concerned with what happens in the committee to-day. statement that was made by Senator Armstrong on the 15th October regarding an article that appeared in the Melbourne Herald on the 14th October, 1952, upon which some of the criticism of the Vice President of the Executive Council was based. Senator Armstrong saidI should like to take this opportunity to place on record my denial of a report which appeared in tlic Melbourne Herald yesterday, Tuesday, the 14th October, 1952. The Herald stated that in a speech which was made by me in thc Senate some weeks ago, I. advocated the transfer of Australian industries to Singapore and to other places in the East in order to get the advantage of cheap coloured labour. At no time did I intend that construction to bc placed on what I said, and at no time did I say that. I did suggest that we should encourage Australian industry to move into South-East Asia, but later on in niy remarks, I suggested that wo encourage every Australian industry that could possibly do so, to Dean, K. L. establish branches in South-East Asia. In advocating that course, I followed exactly in the footsteps of our late Prime Minister nnd Treasurer, Mr Chifley. Mr Chifley gave tangible help to Australian industries which wished to expand into theso areas. His help has been publicly acknowledged by industrial leaders in this country. To suggest, as some would, that I advocated the closing clown of Australian factories, and their re-opening outside Australia, is a complete and utter falsehood. I , with my party, have advocated and fought for the expansion of Australian primary and secondary industries, so that high standards and f u l l employment would he part of our normal way of life. But, if Australia is to play its part in the Pacific, ono of tlie most important ways that it can do so, is by expanding and developing our industries in Asia. Mr Chifley has said, and I say now, that the most tangible expression of the desires that were written into the Colombo plan would be the establishment of branches of our industries in those countries which sorely need our help. The leaders of those nations have pleaded with the great industrial countries of the world to come into [104] their countries and play their part in helping to industrialize them ancl so l if t their standards . . . I am only repeating what I said previously in my speech to the Senate. I was going to say that the strongest bulwark against communism in Asia would be the action of anti-Communist nations such as Australia in helping Asiatic countries to build up their standards so that they can mount their own fight against communism. I thank the Senate for its indulgence. The statement ends there and I believe that it is a fitting and proper answer to the ill-informed and unfounded criticism that has been directed against Senator Armstrong. I propose to submit a Question putThat the motion (vide page 214G) be agreed to. The committee divided. (THE DEPUTY CHAIBMAN-MR . G. J. Ayes. . .. .. 49 Noes. . .. .. 33 Majority 16 AYES.

When I finished my brief speech on the motion for the second reading of this measure, I thought the Vice-President of the Executive Council would have said, in his benign manner, that what I had said was historically correct.

He is continually crystal-gazing, but, unfortunately, he does not interpret correctly what he sees in the crystal. WhatI said was that Senator Armstrong The DEPUTY. CHAIRMAN -When did the right honourable gentleman make the statement? am saying is, that Senator Armstrong, who is the Deputy Leader of the Opposition in another place, saidI suggest that we should establish outside of Australia a branch of every possible busiopposite voted against the adoption of ness undertaking that is operating here, and use Australian brains and "" know-how "" overseas in order to build up our economic strength. He also saidThe only way in which we can obtain value for the products of our secondary industries is be put into employment whilst Austo manufacture them overseas. An honourable member said, on another occasion, that Senator Armstrong, in making that statement, was not speaking with the voice of Labour. Of course, members of the Labour party know that they are in a cleft stick in relation to this matter, because their Deputy Leader in the Senate has said, in effect, "" Take Australian industries and establish them in coloured labour countries"". That is what his statement meant. He also said, in effect, that the only way in which to compete with cheap labour was to put Australian labour out of employment and give employment to coloured labour. To further emphasize my contention regarding Labour's attitude on this matter, it is only necessary to say that when the proposed amendments to the tariff schedule, in relation to which the Tariff Board had made a number of recommendations designed to protect' our secondary industries, were before the Committee of Ways and Means to-day, honourable members opposite called for a division in order to vote against them. That was an attempt to destroy the protection that the Tariff Board intended to give to our secondary industries. achieve the second stage of Labour's objective, which has been set out by Senator Armstrong, in relation to the establishment of Australian secondary industries in Asiatic countries. Senator Armtrong made that statement and then the honourable member for Melbourne, who is his vis-a-vis in this chamber, instructed his followers to vote against the amendments to the tariff schedule, which give effect to the recommendations of tbe Tariff Board, and he divided the committee on it. Is it not perfectly clear that Australia's secondary industries could be destroyed by the refusal of tariff protection against the provision of which honourable members opposite voted? The division list will show that every honourable member the amendments. Having destroyed our secondary industries in Australia, the plan is, according to Senator Armstrong, to establish them in coloured labour countries in South-East Asia, with the result that coloured workers would tralian workers would be put out of employment, and the standards of Australian workers would be destroyed whilst the standards of coloured workers would be improved. If that is not what the Labour party means then its members should go into a huddle and finally decide where they actually stand. [3.33] I have never heard so much hypocrisy as has been uttered by the Vice President of the Executive Council( Mr Eric J. Harrison) about an alleged statement that he read to the effect that the Labour party wants to establish Australian industries in Asiatic countries. the statement from Hansard. people whom the Vice-President of the Executive Council represents in this chamber have exploited coloured labour for centuries, and now he contends that the Labour party wants to do the same thing.

We have heard the Government is going to do to put value back into the £1.

Isi t likely that the Australian business community will stand idly by and watch Japan and other eastern countries pouring cheap goods into this country, or will they try to lead the eastern nations into proper methods of production? If is a question of trying to educate industry in the near eastern countries so that they can at least take their place in combating forms of Japanese production. Let the Vice-President of the ExecutiveA l l I am advancing is that Council analyse the position carefully and decide whether he will be on the side of those who would educate the people in the Asiatic countries adjacent to us, or whether he will bc on the side of the Japanese. We know where he stands. He stands on the side of the Japanese. Ever since this Government took office it has stood on the side of the Japanese in respect of every move that has been made. Wheni t comes to a question of whether or not the Labour party stands for the proper education of near-Asiatic countries, in order to fit them to compete in a proper way with other business communities of the East, the answer is ""clear.

219,Mr Ward,"It was an anti-LabourLimited, of which ex-Senator A. J. McLachlan, a former Minister in an anti-Labour government, is a leading executive, has established itself in the East aud is exploiting cheap coloured labour there. Australian Consolidated out "" Smith is the principal executive, is aUo established in the East. Mr Smith is a member of the Liberal party, and subscribes liberally to its funds. Those people have been encouraged by the anti-Labour Government, the Liberal party and the Australian Country party to establish and expand their activities in the East. The logical conclusion to such a policy is one of the reasons why I am violently opposed to such a procedure. Thc logical conclusion is that if the Australian capital invested in those countries to exploit Chinese and other cheap coolie labour becomes endangered, honourable members opposite will want the lives of Australian workers to be sacrificed in order to suppress what are ordinarily nationalist movements. members put the brand of communism on such movements, and then want the Australian workers to defend the investments made by their own political supporters in those countries. The DEPUTY OH AIRMAN -Order! The honourable member's remarks are a little wide of the bill. developing is that this Government is aiming at a policy of exploiting cheap labour, whereas the Australian Labour party stands for the strengthening and protection of Australian industry and Australian standards in industry. In spite of the efforts of the Vice-President of the Executive Council to extricate the Government from the predicament in which it finds itself, 1 s:iy quite definitely, and I challenge conable gentleman allow a member of the tradiction, that the Australian Labour party stands for only one policy in these matters. The Australian Labour party believes that, if by co-operation, we can assist the people of those countries to establish and expand their own industries and improve their standards of living, wo should do so. The greatest threat to Australian industrial and living standards arises from the fact that we are surrounded by millions of people who are living on a very low standard, and who, necessarily, become a threat to the higher standards prevailing in this country. But we do not stand for the investment of Australian capital in those countries, or for the exploitation by xVustralian capitalists and supporters of this Government of the cheap labour in those countries. We want, by co-operation, to help the people of those countries to strengthen their own industries, and to improve their own standards. We believe that any investment of Australian capital in industry should take place in our own country in order to build up our own industries and provide employment for our own people. That is the policy of the Labour party. If the Vice-President of the Executive Council desires to contest that policy on the ground that it is not in the interests of Australia, let him say so. But we certainly will not remain silent and allow him to try to pin on to the Labour Government party a policy which is really the policy of this Governmenta policy of exploiting cheap coolie labour in the interests of its own capitalist supporters. Therefore, this campaign of distortion must be answered by the Labour party. We must state definitely, as I am doing now, what our party is and what we stand for. There is no equivocation. We are not backing and filling. We believe iu developing Australian industries and we are opposed to the exploitation of cheap labour.

228,Mr Eric J. Harrison,"T h emember for East Sydney, knowing full well that such a policy would not he acceptable to Australian workers and that the advocacy of it would mean the destruction of the Labour party, decided to make his position clear in this chamber. He was not game enough to raise the matter in the party room. The honourable member for Blaxland( Mr E. James Harrison) put himself completely ""onside "" with the Deputy Leader of the Labour party in the Senate, and supported his views. The honourable member for East Sydney was not game enough to bring up the matter in the party room, and decided to vent his spleen in this chamber. He has made this chamber a forum for an argument that should have been conducted in the party room. 3 suggest to the Deputy Leader of the Labour party in this ch amber that it is time he had a. look at his supporters and rallied his cohorts. Perhaps this difference of opinion has been revealed because the Leader of the Labour party (Dr. Evatt) is out of the chamber, and, consequently, some honourable gentlemen opposite have run amuck Surely the lionorable member for Melbourne can control his supporters. It is a sorry state of aifairs when members of the Labour party vent their spleen on one another in this chamber. I shall be interested to hear other members of the Labour party declare where they stand on this issue. The honourable member for East Sydney has usurped the powers of the Deputy Leader of the Labour party in this chamber iu saying, in effect, "" I speak for the Australian Labour party and in denouncing a statement by the Deputy Leader of the Labour party in the Senate, which was supported by the honourable member for Blaxland. I wish that Opposition members would make up their minds where they stand. Does the honourable member for East Sydney interpret the policy of the Labour party? That role used to be undertaken by a former member for Bourke, the late Mr Blackburn. Opposition members, if they look at the last division list, will realize that they have made a sorry mistake, because they have attempted to destroy the protection that the Tariff Board has recommended for Australian industry. must disagree strongly with the Vice President of the Executive Council( Mr Eric J. Harrison) when he refers to the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward) as just an ordinary member of the Australian Labour party. From the demonstrations that we have seen here for some months, it should be evident to every one that the honourable member for East Sydney is the de facto leader of the Opposition in this chamber. the honourable member for Gwydir( Mr Treloar), and accept his correction. honourable member for East Sydney took the direction of thc Labour party out of the hands of the honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell), who is the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, and demanded a division, which placed the Labour party in the position of voting against recommendations of the Tarifl Board. We have seen the honourable member for East Sydney intervene repeatedly, even when the Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt) has been in the chamber. I am sure that the honourable member for East Sydney is the de facto leader of the Australian Labour party. He is trying to pull it out of the mess in which it finds itself. He tells us that it is not the policy of the Australian Labour party to exploit cheap coolie labour in the East, and he claims that we should not establish branches of Australian industry in those countries. Opposition members on other occasions have lamented the fact that Australia is short of capital, yet the Deputy Leader of the Labour party in the Senate has advocated the flight of capital from Australia to the East. That is the position. I do not wish to delay the proceedings, but I think that we all should realize that the honorahle member for East Sydney is the de facto leader of the Opposition. I would have taken no part in this debate except for certain exhibitionist tactics indulged in by the Vice-President of the Executive Council( Mr Eric J. Harrison).

The Vice-President of tlie Executive Council has just left this chamber after giving honourable members another exhibition of his Bland Holt tactics. He has shown quite clearly once again that he is not sincere and that his actions, like those of an actor, are always designed to have a dramatic effect. Yesterday he entered the House with a copy of a report from Hansard. called the Century The Order! The honourable member is now referring to events that took place in the House. Those events cannot he referred to in this committee. sions the Vice-President of the Executive Council would not even read the Century. but yesterday he referred to it to bolster up his arguments. To-day he again referred to something that he had read in the Century. Anything that assists his exhibitionism is suitable for him to use. There is no doubt where the Labour party stands on full employment, the White Australia policy and the expansion of secondary industries. The right honourable gentleman asked why the Labour party did not put its house in order, but in view of what happened yesterday it is pertinent for the Labour party to ask why the Government does not put its own house in order. Yesterday a member of one of the Government parties stood in this chamber and said that he would not support the Government on a measure that was then being dealt with. One of the senior members of the Government called him a cheer-chaser. That indicates the good feeling existing between honourable members on the Government side at present. I assure the Vice-President of the Executive Council that everything is in order in our house, and everything has been so much in order since 1951 that the Government has been gradually crumbling to destruction. Another blow will be struck against it next Saturday when the people of Flinders will indicate in no uncertain manner their opinion of the Government. understand that the committee is discusmanufacturing industries of this country. sing certain duties embodied in the I was amazed to see honourable members measure before it. I have carefully perused this measure and I can see no reference in it to the duties of the electors of Flinders. I suggest that the honourable meniber is not in order in introducing that matter.

That ha? been said by the Labour party for years, but the Labour party does not explain the use of full employment without full production. Of what use is it to reduce the speed of all the workers in Australia to the speed of the slowest workers? The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN. Order! The honourable member is straying from the contents of the measure. which we can successfully have full employment is by having full production. Full production brings full employment in its train, and without full production full employment can last only for a certain time without breaking down and causing chaos in the community. The honourable member for Adelaide advocates full employment irrespective of anything else.

245,By Mr Eric J. Harrison,"Vice-President of the Executive Council and Minister for Defence Production) [4.15] -The excise tariff proposals are complementary to tbe custonis tariff proposals, which I have already explained to honourable members. Therefore, it is not necessary for me to explain them, and I shall not waste the time of the committee by discussing them at length. The Opposition offers the same objection to the excise tariff proposals as it did to and on the eve of the invasion of Okinawa the customs tariff proposals. The tariff should not be used merely for the purpose of raising revenue. The Government proposes to persist with the tariff plan that it embodied in the 1951-52 horror budget, to use the descriptive terminology of the author of that budget, the Treasurer ( Sir Arthur Eadden). The proposals of the horror budget have been carried forward into the so-called incentive budget programme' for 1952-53. There is to be no diminution of the excise duty, and the proposal now before the committee is that the tariff rates fixed last year be continued for another year. The resolution refers to excise duties on beer, brandy, whisky, rum, gin, liqueurs, tobacco, cigars, and cigarettes manufactured in Australia. The Opposition objects to the imposition of duties merely for the sake of raising revenue. The history of the excise on beer over the years is very interesting. Prior to World WarI . , the duty was 3d. a gallon. Three months after that war started, the rate was doubled. Immediately after the end of that war, it was increased to 7d. a gallon, and, before the end of 1918, it was raised further to ls. In 1920, the rate rose to ls. 3d., and six months later it rose again to Is. 9d. The ill-fated Bruce-Page Government increased it to 2s. in 1929. By the end of that year, the Scullin Government reduced it to ls. lOd. In July, 1930, it was restored to 2s. Government! 1933, when the Lyons Government, of unhappy memory, was giving great handouts to its friends, the wealthy graziers and the big city land-owners, by granting remissions of land tax, the excise duty on beer was reduced to ls. 9d. a gallon. In 1939, when the Vice-President of the Executive Council( Mr Eric J. Harrison), the "" ex honourable member for Mayfair "", was Minister for Trade and Custonis, the rate was restored to 2s. a gallon. In 1940, after wo had been twelve months at war, it was raised to 2s. 9d. a gallon. In 1941, when we were seriously at war, it was further increased to 3s. In 1942, after the Battle of the Coral Sea and the Battle of Midway, when the Guadalcanal campaign was being fought, and the other battles that determined the fate of the Pacific, the Curtin Labour Govermnent increased the rate to 4s. 7d. a. gallon, at which level it remained until this ineffable Government was returned to power. On the 26th September, 1951, the Government raised the rate to 7s. 2d. a gallon. There was no war in progress then to justify such a severe increase, unless it was a war in the Cabinet room between the Liberal party and the Australian Country party over the revaluation of the £1, or some such matter. Who pays the excise duty on beer ? Only the beer drinkers! The people who do not drink beer are untouched by this tax. Thus, it is a selective sectional tax. The same criticism applies to the excise on whisky and other spirits. The revenue has benefited considerably from the raising of excise duties on liquor. In 1938-39, to go no further back than the eve of World War IL , excise collections from this source totalled £7,288,579. During the period of the war, the total increased to £22,519,000, but the population was increasing then. After the war, when the 'Chifley Government left office involuntarily, as this Government will do iii the next year or so, though without the knowledge that the Labour party had that it would be returned to power, excise collections increased to £33,400,000. During 1951-52, when the present excessive duties were levied, the Government collected £53,000,000. The difference was a mere £20,000,000 ! Perhaps £1,000,000 here or there is of little significance in these days of the debased Menzies currency. Government had promised to reduce taxation.",54,Deputy Chairman B I L L Read A Third Time Tariff Proposals 1952 Excise Tariffamendment N O 4

250,Mr Morgan,"That was after the Government that promised to reduce all forms of indirect taxation. Yet it increased the excise duty on beer and spirits by at least 40 per cent, in 1951-52. Now, of course, the f l is losing its value rapidly. It will suffer a further depreciation when the next cost of living adjustment is announced at 3 o'clock to-morrow afternoon, and more and more taxation will be exacted from the people. The Governnient seems to thrive on inflation. It condemns inflation, but, as the value of the currency falls, it collects were the beast that is mentioned iu the more and more money from those taxpayers who believe that they are entitled to drink beer or whisky if they want to do so. Therefore, we oppose this tariff proposal and will vote against it. A man who goes into any hotel in any capital city of Australia to-day and buys an 11-oz. glass of beer, is charged Is., of which 5$d. goes to the Treasury. If he buys a 7-oz. glass of beer he is charged 9d., of which 3;fd. goes to the Treasury. The small 4-oz. glass of beer costs 5d., of which 2, id. goes to the Treasury. When l a customer buys a bottle of beer for 2s. 4d., the Treasury takes ls. 2W. of that amount. The Government is extremely misguided if it thinks that the raising of revenues in this way is good business. The only fair canon of taxation is that those who have the money should pay the taxes. This Government taxes a man who buys a bottle of beer 50 per cent, of the price that he pays for it merely in order that the revenue may benefit. That is a ridiculous form of finance. Any government that imposes heavy excise duties upon liquor and other commodities has a vested interest in the increased sales of those commodities. It appears almost as though the Government wants the nation to drink more beer, whisky and brandy so that its income will be increased. during World War II . people to drink more beer. could not hope to repeat all the irresponput it past this Government to tax sible statements of that kind that were persons even for going to church. It is made by anti-Labour Ministers during prepared to raise revenue by the wrong the war. The higher the excise duty, the means rather than by the right means. more beer the Government wants the None of the excessive imposts included people to drink. It does not believe, as we democrats do, that those who have the money ought to pay the taxes and that those who are not wealthy should not be asked to make more than a fair contribution to the cost of governing the nation. would impose a tax on success. able member for Gwydir( Mr Treloar), who talks constantly about communism and hates the Labour party as though it Bible, will support the view of the Government that it has a vested interest in the increased consumption of liquor. Most Australians would be pleased if less liquor were consumed. They do not object to the use of liquor, but they consider that its abuse has gone to extreme lengths in Australia and that we should be better off if we had a more sober community. This Government seems to want to encourage the consumption of liquor so that when it obtains a big revenue from taxes on liquor, its members may adjust their halos and say, "" See what a lot of nioney we have raised for the country"". They pose as benefactors of the community. I have always thought that the halo of the Vice-President of the Executive Council is too tight and causes some of those headaches that occasion his ill-temper in this chamber from time to time. The Government apparently imposes excessive duties on liquor in order to obtain vast revenues from ordinary citizens so that it can help its wealthy friends, for instance, by remitting land tax to the tune of over £6,000,000 a year. The abolition of the land tax benefited 21,000 taxpayers, SO per cent, of whom own city properties and probably have seen the country only when they have driven through it in a motor car or flown over it in an aeroplane.

256,Mr Calwell,"No doubt the honoriu these proposals can be justified. When we were engaged in war, we did not require to impose a duty in excess of 4s. 7d. a gallon on beer. Therefore, this Government has no justification to-day for increasing the duty to 7s. 2d. a gallon. that members of the Opposition have put upon the Government. tralian Labour party will put pressure upon this Government only in order to get it out and make way for a good government under the leadership of the Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt). The Government proposes to increase the excise duty on beer to 7s. 2d. a gallon because, to use the inimitable terminology of the Treasurer, it wants to skim off the women who are the first to make sacrisurplus purchasing power of the people. That sort of talk could easily deceive members of the Australian Country party, because none of them has much ability, but it should not deceive discerning members of the Liberal party most of whom, if they expressed their inner thoughts and heartfelt feelings, would prefer, at this time, to be members of the great Australian Labour party, which is the party of the future and has a distinguished past. The DEPUTY CHAIEMAN -Order! The honourable member's time has expired. ahle member has risen, I shall take my second fifteen-minute pei'iod. imposts are merely a miserable expedient for raising additional revenue. The Vice President of the Executive Council is, no doubt, thoroughly ashamed of them. When he was Minister for Trade and Customs he refused to agree to anything like this. He would fight the Treasurer rather than do so; but, apparently, he has softened under the influence of his Mayfair environment during his recent sojourn abroad. excise duty is the easiest way by which a government can extract money from the community. That is why the Government refuses to face up to its responsibility in this matter. The Opposition emphatically protests against the imposition of these exorbitant rates of excise duty. As the majority of members of the Opposition are abstemious, we are not arguing for some benefit for ourselves. These impositions are manifestly unjust, and the Government should at this stage decide to reduce the rate of duty on beer from 7s. 2d. to 4s. 7d. a gallon which was the maximum that operated during the most dangerous period of the recent war. I turn now to another aspect of these extraordinary proposals. The Government proposes to increase the tax on smokers. Many persons consider that smoking is a filthy habit, that it is most unhygienic and should not be tolerated in any circumstances. The fact is that not only many men but also many women are smokers. Of course, at present, having regard to the diminishing family income, fices, aro obliged to stop smoking in order that their husbands may continue their dedication to the weed. smoke. cently, I tried to smoke the Treasurer out of his hollow log in. Canberra, in an effort to get him to go down to Elinders, but. I did not succeed. In 1950-51, collections of excise duty on beer totalled £37,000,000, but this year it is estimated the collections will total £60,000,000. Whereas in 1950-51 collections of excise duty on whisky, rum, gin and liqueurs amounted to approximately £5,000,000, it These is estimated that the duty on those goods this year will yield a revenue of £8,000,000. The rate of excise duty on handmade tobacco is to be increased from 10s. to 13s. 6d. per lb. The revenue collected at the lower rate was nil, and it is estimated that collections under the same heading for the current financial year will also be nil. The rate of duty on other hand-made tobacco is to The imposition of be increased from 10s. 8d. to 14s. 2d. per lb., and it is estimated that the revenue that will be collected under that heading this year will also be nil. I cannot understand why the Government persists in prescribing a rate of excise duty in respect of an item when it does not expect to derive any revenue by so doing.

261,Mr Calwell,"That is so. Eeexcise duty on manufactured tobacco in tbe manufacture of wbich all the leaf used is Australian-grown is to be increased from 10s. 3d. to 13s. 9d. per lb., and it is estimated that collections under this heading will decrease from £717,035 in 1950-51 to £603,460 in 1951-52. Those figures indicate that less Australian leaf is being used in manufacture, and that is a grave reflection, upon the Government. It should stand up to the big tobacco cartels, the British Tobacco Company (Australia) Limited, and W. D. and' H . O. Wills Limited aud say to them, in effect, "" If you want to trade in Australia you must use more and more Australian-grown leaf, because we want to keep the growers in t.he industry"". If the Government will not stand up to those cartels, let it stand aside. The Australian Labour party will put the big monopolists to the jump, and it will not be long now before we shall have the opportunity to do so. The rate of excise duty on manufactured tobacco, in the manufacture of which other than Australian grown leaf is used, is to be increased from 10s. l i d . per lb., at which rate collections amounted to £9,995,036, to 14s. 5d. per lb. It is estimated that collections under this heading will amount to £14,500,000 for the financial year ending the 30th June, 1953. A lot of that tobacco is dollar tobacco, which we should not be buying at all. If we cannot obtain adequate supplies of Australian-grown leaf, we should get our tobacco within the sterling area. grown leaf blend all right? smoker, I cannot say. However, people get used to these things. But, beggars cannot he choosers. We are in a bad way for dollars and we should not be importing tobacco, or newsprint, while, at the same time, prohibiting the importation of essential capital goods from the dollar area. The rate of excise duty on handmade cigars is to beincreased from lis. 7d., at which rate collections amounted to £37,S42 in 1950-51, to 16s. l i d . per lb.; and it is estimated that collections will amount to £41,649 in 1951-52. The Government is not making so much out of cigar smokers. The rate of duty on machine-made cigarettes is to be increased from 20s. 9d. per lb., at which rate revenue amounted to £10,582,054, to 25s. lOd. per lb. ; and it is estimated that collections will total £13,715,666 in 1951-52. That is an increase of 25 per cent, on the heavy impost that was already being borne by the ordinary Australian who smokes whether he works on a farm or in a factory, shop or office. That increase is far greater than the increase of the rate of income tax which, after land tax, is the fairest of all forms of taxes; and it is almost equal to the increase of the rate of sales tax which was announced in the two last budgets of this Government-the horror budget and the so-called incentive budget. The Government must do something to protect tbe tobacco industry in this country. Climatic conditions in almost every State are favorable for tobacco-growing. Australian leaf. make it palatable to smokers. Between the two world wars our manufacturers used Virginian leaf and discarded the stalk, but under war conditions the manufacturers found a way to utilize the stalk also by treating it with a variety of compounds. Today, Australians who smoke such cigarettes are paying not only for the pure leaf, but also for the stalk. I refuse to decry the capacity of officials of the -Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization and of those engaged in the industry to produce a tobacco that will be palatable to Australian smokers. The 3et against Australian-grown leaf is attributable largely to prejudice. At one time, it was said that Australians could not produce cloth equal in quality to that of imported cloth. That was the old free-trade fallacy that obtained in the days of George Reid in New South Wales; and, unfortunately, it is still lingering on. Anything that can be done in any other country, Australians can do just as well and generally better. I have sufficient confidence in the ability of the people of Australia to believe that their inventive genius and creative capacity is as great as that of the people of any other country. Indeed, Australia would not be the country that it is",57,Deputy Chairman B I L L Read A Third Time Tariff Proposals 1952 Excise Tariffamendment N O 4

265,Mr Calwell,"It can be treated to to-day if Australians were inferior in that respect. This Government is scuttling the ship of State. The tragic Lyons Government destroyed the tobacco industry at Myrtleford, Victoria, after the Scullin Government had established the industry at that centre. The Lyons Government did that because it was owned body and soul hy shipping and tobacco interests and other big cartels. We must be ourselves and think of ourselves. We must put Australia first at all times and in all circumstances. ""Australia for the Australians "" is a good motto. It should be thp motto used in carrying on the affairs of this country for the benefit of Australians. The Government should say that those who want to manuiV.rtuvc tobacco in this country shall use the whole of the Australian-grown leaf that is produced each year; and if en-tain people do not like that, they can lump it. The Australian people can be taught to appreciate the. Australian product, whether it be tobacco or anything else, just as they have been taught to appreciate that Australianmanufactured clothing and textiles are just as good as the product of any other country. The little Australians in this chamber, who sit opposite thc big Australians, who for the time being are in Opposition, must bring their thinking up to date. In any event, if Government supporters have not yet learned their lesson, they will learn it next Saturday when the Australian Labour party will win the Flinders seat. is pleasing to see the honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell) in the circus ring again. It is much more enjoyable to hear him when he is in that frame of mind than when he is in serious mood -He may be a quick-change artist in the circus, but it is difficult to develop its effect, is to reduce the consumption of that role in national politics. The honourable member failed in his quick-change act to-day. First he tried to speak for those who drink beer. He said that they could not buy sufficient beer Vice-President of the Executive Council because of the high charges and and Minister for Defence Production) that was against their best interests. [4.50] -It would be only courteous of Then the honourable member feared me to reply to the honourable member for that he might have offended the Melbourne ( Mr Calwell) and I should members of temperance organizations so he did a somersault and said le hoped that less beer would be consumed. The logical conclusion is that the higher the charge, the less beer will be drunk, because the people have only a certain amount of money for beer. If it were possible for the honourable number to speak again in this debate, I should like him to say whether he favours the consumption of more beer or less beer. In his speech, he expressed an opinion both ways. When honourable members hear the deputy leader of a party express such different views upon the same subject, is it any wonder that they ask just where does he stand? for anything. Ho is one of our greatest assets. jected, the honourable member for Melbourne is one of our greatest assets, but honourable members like to hear some logic in a debate.

[Quorum formed.""] The honourable meniber said that the policy of the Australian Government should be "" Australia for the Australians "". "" Hifalutin "" terms are all very well, but they mean nothing unless they are bolstered substantially. The honourable member for Melbourne referred to excise on whisky, tobacco and some other goods, but he did not refer to many other Australian products which are free of any impost. It is usual for honourable members on the Opposition side to select a few articles and suggest that the charges upon them are unjust and should be lifted, but it is difficult for the people to know what the honourable member for Melbourne means when in one breath he supports those who drink beer, and then expresses approval of high excise because beer.

270,Mr Eric J. Harrison (Wentworth,"hate to he discourteous to h i m . He spoke about excise more in sorrow than in anger, but the honourable member was a Ministeri n happier days and he should know that excise on beer, spirits, and tobacco is a traditional source of revenue. I was interested to hear h i m read from certam statistical records with regard to tobacco. Aft e r dealing -with ale and spirits, the honourable member said that the Government was putting an imposition upon the working man and preventing h im fro m enjoying the things that he was rightly entitled to enjoy. 1 noticed when he was citing figures with regard to tobacco that he made no reference whatever to the fact that in 1942, when the excise on tobacco was 7s. 4d. per lb. tbe Curtin Government in creased the excise duty on all Australian tobacco that'was to be used for cigarette leaf by Si. pcr lb., compared with the proposed increase in the schedule that is under discussion of 6s. per lb. I remind honourable members that the honourable member for Melbourne was a distinguished member of the Curtin Government of that day, and I ask them to compare the Curtin Government's actions with the impassioned plea that has been made by the honourable member for the encouragement of Australian tobacco production. encouraged the growing of Australian tobacco leaf by increasing the excise duty by Ss. pcr lb. middle of the war. honourable member is always excuses. He referred to the cigarettes ber for Melbourne. that are consumed by the average working intrudes in a debate of this nature, he mau. tobacco.

Never dom the home of beef, beer and 'baccy, mind ahout histrionics. I invite honorexcise on beer and tobacco is infinitely able members to consider the facts. I higher than is the excise in Australia. noticed that the honourable member for Melbourne charged the Government with encouraging the consumption of beer so that we would get more revenue. the increase in revenue may be, it has certainly made no difference to the consumption of beer. In 193S-39 consumption of beer in Australia was 84,000,000 gallons ancl it rose to 90,000,000 gallons in 1939-40. In 1951-52, consumption was 173,000,000 gallons. Excise duty does not seem to be having much effect in discouraging the consumption of beer. Brief contemplation of these facts shows how fallacious are the arguments of the honourable member for Melbourne. From time to time, honourable members on the Opposition side speak of the increased basic wage. They say that it has reached astronomical heights, but it is not really as much as it was some time ago. pleased to hear that interjection because in 1942 the basic wage was £4 15s. and now it is £11 7s. In 1942 the excise duty on beer was 4s. 7d. It has now been increased to 7s. 2d. If the honourable member for Melbourne w ill indulge in a The Curtin Government little arithmetic, he w ill discover that the excise on beer has increased since 1942 by 60 per cent, and the basic wage has increased by 140 per cent. If those figures are compared it w ill be evident T h a t was in the that the Government is taking less from the workers' glass of beer than the Labour Government took in 1942. Honourable The members w ill realize how truly absurd finding are the arguments of the honourable memWhenever he He may not smoke Australian selects facts that w ill suit his argument. the minds of listeners by the honourable have convinced him that the charges that are under discussion are traditional sources of revenue.

The committee has been told nothing about the Custonis Tariff (New Zealand Preference) Proposals other than that they relate to alterations of the rates McBride do prepare and bring in a bill to of duty imposed upon corsets and locomotives. The Minister may find that the duty on' locomotives is too big a subject for him to handle. He should be more explicit.

Possibly the honourable member for Melbourne, who has posed as a saint on this occasion, will be able to understand them if he adjusts his halo, which, as I have said, is askew. I thought that every member of the committee was aware of the facts of this matter. We have made reciprocal arrangements with New Zealand and Canada. honourable gentleman say so? thought it was common knowledge, and that there was no need for me to explain it. If the honourable member for Melbourne wants a first primer on this matter, I shall be pleased to give it to him. When any alteration is made of our tariff, we must adjust automatically the tariff arrangements made with both New Zealand and Canada. Nothing more than that is involved in this matter.

The Commonwealth Grants Commission has never had an easy task in trying to determine just how much money should be voted annually to the States of South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania in order to put them in the same relative position as they would have been in hacl they suffered none of the disabilities of federation. The commission was established in order to make up to certain .State governments what they have lost because of federation. It could easily happen that four, or even five of the six State governments may require assistance, but, in practice, only three of them have so far been in that position. It is regrettable that any State should have lost because of federation, but the centrifugal tendencies of federation have seemed to draw the whole population of the Commonwealth into a narrower compass, and helped to develop the two stronger States at the expense of two of the larger States and the smallest State which largely form the outer ring, as it were, of our federation. South Australia, Western Australia to be a happy title. At any rate, they are the States that need assistance from the Commonwealth, and every year when a measure of this kind is before the represent electorates in South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania, refer to the disabilities of their States-the disabilities, often, which are allegedly Because of difficulties that have arisen",63,Harrison And Read A First Time Second Reading

The figure recommended for South Australia as an advance payment for 1.952-53 is £6,600,000, and from that, a sum of £257,000 is deducted because South Australia was presumably overpaid by that amount in the last financial year. £6,343,000 for the needs of South Australia. An advance payment of £8,200,000 is recommended for Western Australia, and an adjustment of £159,000 by way of a deduction, leaving £8,041,000 to be paid to that State in this financial year. In the past, the adjustments have been additional to the grants made for the financial year. advance of £1,550,000 for 1952-53 and, by some extraordinary accountancy process, there was no adjustment, not even of a Id. or a £1 upwards or downwards, and the same amount is to be paid to that State. The Treasurer ( Sir Arthur Fadden) has explained that the deductionsrepresent the amount by which tiie advance payments made in 1950-51 exceeded the finanreally ascertained. cial needs of those States in that year as dually assessed by the commission. 1 have no doubt that the commission did a fair and reasonable job in making those assessments, but it cannot be said that the financial needs of South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania are not greater than the amount assessed by the cominission. That body has had to act within a charter, which is defined by the Parliament, and cannot take into consideration factors beyond its terms of reference. The commission does say, however, that it is unable to estimate what the expenditure of those States will be in the immediate future, because of the number of factors that are operating at the present time. The commission speaks of basic wage adjustments that will, have to be made in the current financial year. It talks about increased expenditure on social services that will have to be undertaken in the States concerned. It mentions the effect upon the^ finances of Western Australia of the prolonged rail strike which occurred earlier this year. Nobody can be certain of what will happen to-morrow in these days of galloping inflation. Nobody knows just at what point the basic wage increases Sir. Calwell. will cease. As from the lst August last, the basic wage was £11 7s. a week. A determination is to be announced tomorrow which might increase it by as much as 10s. or 12s. a week, or by only 4s. or 5s. a week; but it will be an important factor in the finances of South AusThat leaves a total of tralia, Western Australia and Tasmania, and, indeed, of every undertaking, governmental or commercial, throughout the length and breadth of the land. The commission is wise in saying, in effect, "" Well, we just do not know what the future will be, but we estimate that the amounts which we have recommended will be sufficient in the light of existing Tasmania had an circumstances, and we give no hostages to the future "". The commission says that the payments recommended in this bill for the financial year 1952-53 will be the subject of adjustment two years hence, when all the factors relating to this financial year are known. It apparently takes a long time before all the facts in connection with the financial year of a State can be properly determined and I have often thought that we might do something more for the larger States, including Queensland, because if they have not exactly suffered disabilities under federation, they have suffered disadvantages because of inventions and developments. For example, the aeroplane has annihilated time and distance, and made it possible for people to live in the more settled areas and desert the countryside. They have come into the inner areas, and left the great open spaces less occupied tban tbey were 40 years ago. It may be true that working in city factories is perhaps more attractive than working on the land but other things are drawing the people by magnets, as it were, into the capital cities, to the detriment of Australia. Sometimes I think of Oliver Goldsmith's line111 fares the land to hast'ning ills a prey. Where wealth accumulates and men decay. We are seemingly deserting our countryside, because it is much easier to live in the settled areas. Western Australia is the most vulnerable part of our Commonwealth. One-half of it is occupied by only 6,000 people of our blood. I have referred to this matter repeatedly. The other 500,000 square miles of that State is held tenuously by 500,000 people of our blood. The disabilities which Western Australia has suffered under federation are even more extensive than the Commonwealth Grants Commission has so far admitted, and for the purposes of the advancement and development of Australia, it may be obligatory on the Commonwealth ultimately to expend more nioney on defence roads and harbours and strategic railways in that State. When I make that statement. I refer not only to thc roads and railways running north and south, but also to the roads and railways running east and west. I suppose it would be heresy in Western Australia to suggest that that part of the State north of Carnarvon should be ceded to the Commonwealth as a territory, and made the complete responsibility of the Commonwealth. I think I heard the honourable member for Forrest( Mr Freeth) interject, "" Not by any means"". That part of Western Australia is not being developed and populated now. It is the most vulnerable part of Australia. It is only 400 or 500 miles from that point from which rhe next act of aggression against this nation will commence. Perhaps the Western Australian Parliament, in view of the known disabilities of the State, will ultimately be as wise as the South Australian Parliament which, in other days ceded a part of that State to the Commonwealth. of Western Australia is not suffering any take similar action here, so we have to harm at the present time.

At the moment, the area is more or less a no man's land.

I doubt whether it. is possible from the 500,000 people in Sonth Australia, who hold more than 300,000 square miles of territory, to do as much to develop that equally important part of Australia with their resources as the 2,000,000 people in Victoria, holding S8,000 square miles, are able to do with the construction of dams, roads and other developmental works.

The Opposition is desirous of being constructively critical and certainly helpful about this measure, as about all measures that come before the Parliament. It might be said that the last Labour Government did not do anything along the lines that I have indicated, but not much is to be gained by repining the past. We must study history to learn lessons that will be useful to us in the future.

I commend the bill to the House. honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr tion tliere. That area is not a pleasant Calwell), apparently in a somewhat chastened mood after the mauling he received earlier to-day at the hands of the Vice-President of the Executive Council( Mr Eric J. Harrison), made a thoughtful contribution to the debate. I find myself in agreement with a great deal of what he said. He referred to the problem connected with the north-west part of Western Australia. That is a particularly difficult problem, and the Australian Government has to bear a share of the responsibility in finding its solution. I do not believe that ceding that portion of Western Australia to the Commonwealth would overcome the difficulty, because then, apparently, the Commonwealth would, simply pour money into that area in a hazardous attempt to develop it. If the Government were to spend large sums of money in this area before it had a population of any size, it would be embarking upon a great gamble. The problem of the north-west of Western Australia must be approached from another angle. Legislative action by this Government and the Western Australian age people to settle in the north-west of Western Australia and to invest capital in its development. Since the Northern Territory has been under the control of the Australian Government it has gone ahead by comparison with the north-west of Western Australia, but its advancement is due to many diverse factors. Only one of the factors is the developmental work that the Commonwealth has undertaken in the Northern Territory. Other factors are that there have been greater incentives for the investment of capital in the Northern Territory, and greater taxation concessions have been made in regard to income earned in the territory. The Commonwealth has stated that it is precluded from giving taxation concessions to the people in portion of a State, and no doubt there is much to be said for that contention. However, that difficulty must bc overcome. Unless some inducement, over and above the inducements offered by the cities and more settled parts of Australia, is offered to people to live in the north-west of Western Australia, there will never be a large populaplace in which to live, in comparison, with other parts of Australia, and, after all, the sole purpose in life of people is not to amass money. They want to live under reasonable conditions. I do not think that the Western Australian Government would hesitate to cede the north-western part of Western Australia to the Commonwealth if it believed that centralization of control in Canberra would lead to quicker development of the area. If this part of the State were taken away from the State government, the remainder of Western Australia would not be affected to any great degree because the State's trade would still pass through Fremantle and Perth.

A considerable amount of the money that has been granted by the Commonwealth to Western Australia has been advanced in recognition of the special disability under which tliat State labours because of the disastrous metal strike that occurred there during the last few months.

313,Mr Beazley (Fremantle) [8.7],"member for Eorrest spoke of the disabilities of ""Western Australia. The bill represents an attempt to fulfil the obligation, which has always been implicit in the system of federation, for the more developed parts of Australia to contribute financial aid to the less developed parts. Whatever injustices the uniform tax system may have imposed on the major States, at least it has compensated the minor States for one disability. TJnder the uniform tax system, the highly industrialized areas, where there are great concentrations of wealth, contribute most to the revenue of the Government. The disbursement of that revenue on an equitable basis, according to population, has the effect that the less developed parts federation, when there were alternative of the nation receive more than they contribute. Consequently, the uniform tax system has a tendency to compensate the minor States for the disadvantages of federation. Thc settled tariff policy of the Commonwealth has discriminated against agriculture in favour of secondary industry, and the result of that discrimination has been very serious in the States that are almost entirely agricultural in character. Western Australia, for instance, is heavily in debt for its railways. The Premier of Western Australia in 1928 told the royal commission onfinancehow much loan money had to be raised in Western Australia in order to pay the tariff imposed by the Commonwealth on rails imported from abroad, or the extra charge for rails manufactured in Australia that resulted from the tariff. The late Sir James Mitchell said, at the time when raihvay lines cost £3,000 a mile, that £1,000 of duty had to be paid for every mile of line. The result was that Western Australia went into debt and paid the interest on £1,000 for every mile of rail that was constructed at that time. Thus, the settled tariff policy of the Commonwealth undoubtedly added consider a bly to the expense of the developmental undertakings of the minor States. The grants for which this bill provides are justifiable because of that fact. The grants system will survive the uniform tax system, whether this Government abolishes uniform tax or not. The history of Western Australia shows that the State has advanced by means of windfalls. The Mr lieasley. honourable member for Forrest made the extravagant statement that the Kwinana oil refinery would be as important in the history of Western Australia as was the discovery of gold. The honourable gentleman apparently is not aware that the State had a population of 70,000 just before the gold rush in 1890, and that its population in 1900 was 200,000. To assume that any event like the establishment of an oil refinery at Kwinana is likely to be so spectacular as to cause the State to treble its population within a decade is extravagant in the extreme. However, AVestern Australia has depended upon such windfalls for the promotion of its development. In the days before colonies to which immigrants could come, the land of Western Australia, which was poor by comparison with that of the eastern States, did not attract so many immigrants at ls. 6d. an acre as did the land of South Australia at £10 an acre. Recently, many South Australian farmers have sold their land for about £40 an acre and transferred to AVestern Australia, where they are able to take up land for about £7 an acre and use the £33 profit ou each acre for developmental purposes. The grants for which the bill provides are intended largely to enable the States of South Australia, Western Australia, and Tasmania to shoulder the financial burdens imposed upon them by the provision of various forms of social services, such as education and health services. However, some features of State development have a significance that transcend State borders and affect the economy of the whole nation. Western Australia has always had an enormous transport burden. Becausei t is a State with a very large area and a very small population, it must have an expensive transport system for which there are few customers. In these circumstances, it is inevitable that the State must carry a constant burden of financial losses on its railways system. The grants made to it by the Commonwealth help to meet those losses. They do not help to rehabilitate the railways and they are not suflicient to provide the State with a really modern rail system. To the degree that the Western Australian segment of the Australian transport system is weak, the whole of our transport system is weak. ""Western Australia is in need of harbour development, which would he of importance to the whole of Australia. Eeferenee has been made during this debate to the development of the north-western part of the State. I consider that a great deal of nonsense is talked about the development of the north-west of Western Australia and the Northern Territory. We must accept certain harsh facts in relation to those areas. One of the facts of settlement in every country has been that settlers have refused to go first to the poorest areas and have established themselves instead in the best areas. Many rich areas of Western Australia still remain unsettled, and, unfortunately, or perhaps fortunately, they are in the south-western area of the State. No matter what policy is pursued in relation to the north-western part of Western Australia, the State Government is inevitably forced to devote attention to developmental works, such as irrigation, in areas where closer settlement is possible. Therefore, the irrigation policy of the Western Australian Government is directed, not to the uninhabited north-west, bi.it to the inhabited south-west. Although we all pay lip-service to the ideal of developing northern Australia, the fact is that the great projects of the Australian Government are not located in the Northern Territory. Should we have expended in the Northern Territory the money that we propose to expend on the Snowy Mountains hydro-electric scheme? I think that every honourable member will answer, "" No "" . The whole trend of our thinking is towards the needs of the areas where our population is actually settled. I am not convinced of the validity of the defence argument that is often used in favour of the settlement of northern Australia. We ought to turn the map of Australia upside down occasionally so that we may look at it from the point of view of the Asiatic countries to the north of us. It is our great good fortune that all our concentrations of vital industries are on the side of the continent furthest from Asia. The north-western part of Western Australia and the Northern Territory would be very thankless regions for an invading army to occupy. We know that the intention of the Japanese during World War II . was to land, not in those thankless regions, but in the developed northern area of Queensland. It is not true to say that we must have industries established in the north if we are to defend that part of Australia. If we have our armament industries, and the other industries that buttress our war effort, in the southern part of the continent, they can provide cover for the north, even if the north is empty. Northern Australia would be unattractive to an invading army, but it is a fact, I fear, that Queensland attracted the attention of the Japanese, who planned to invade us, not through the Kimberleys. but through Townsville and Cairns. That is a fact that we ought to take carefully into consideration. The Snowy Mountains project will assist in the development of northern Australia. We must realize that, if it provides power for our important industries, it provides also tlie basis of the defence of the whole of Australia, including the northern areas, whether they are empty or settled. My argument is not directed against the development of northern Australia. 1 merely point out to honourable members that the tendency of settlers in any new country is to concentrate on the best areas first. Honourable members must realize that settlers will not take up land in areas where they w ill be committed to enormous capital outlay, which they cannot afford before they commence production, when they have opportunities to take up land in closely settled fertile areas. The grants policy pursued by the present Government is identical with that of the former Labour Government, except that the amounts of the grants are necessarily larger in order to compensate for the changed value of money. There would be no sense, therefore, in wasting the time of the Housei n arguing about a measure upon which we are in agreement. Accordingly, I content myself by saying that I support the bill. purpose of this bill is to make grants totalling £15,534,000 to the States of South Australia, Tasmania, and Western Australia. These claimant States, as they",68,Arthur Eadden
314,Mr Galvin (Kingston) [8.11],"Th ehave become known, have applied to the Government for financial aid under section 96 of the Constitution, which provides for the granting of assistance to States that need additional funds in order to place them ou a basis comparable with that of the richer States. The amount of the proposed grants has been recommended by the Commonwealth Grants Commission iu its nineteenth report. I consider that the nation is indebted to the men who compiled that report, which is well worthy of close study, it sets out very clearly the financial posiPara reservoir. In these circumstances, tions of all States and tbe Commonwealth, and includes a survey of the general economic position. Every honourable member must approve of the granting of assistance to needy States. The ideal of helping the weak could well be put into practice in every field of human activity. As somebody once said to me, "" If everybody cared enough and everybody shared enough, everybody would liave enough"". This bill is based on the principle that our wealth should be shared equitably amongst the States so (hat Australia may develop as a nation, instead of existing as a collection of separate States witli varying economic fortunes. As the commission points out in its report, the States were unable, because of ever-rising wages and costs of materials, to estimate accurately the assistance that they required by way of grants for the current financial year. Indeed, the eommission expresses the view that it is impossible to foresee the end of the present inflationary trend. Of course, the blame for present inflationary conditions must, to a large degree, be laid at the door of this Government. '.lhe development of primary and claimant States. Indeed, I believe that secondary industry must be seriously if an opportunity were given to members retarded.

That pipe-line is needed in order to ensure adequate supplies to Adelaide. The prospects are that many suburban residents, particularly those who grow their own vegetables, will face severe water restrictions throughout the coming summer. Similarly, lack of finance threatens to cause a cessation of work on the construction of the Soutli the grant that is to be made available to South Australia under this measure will be doubly welcome. No doubt, at the meeting of the Australian Loan Council that is to be held here to-morrow, the State Premier will make another urgent appeal to the Commons .ialth to increase the loan allocation to So th Australia. I sincerely trust that his ai Jeal will not fall on deaf ears. The lack c f loan finance is also apparent in the sic .ving down of work on housing projects. If South Australia, which is not a party to the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement, does not receive adequate financial assistance in the near future its building programme will have to be curtailed. Recently, it was obliged to hawk round Australia 800 prefabricated houses which now look like being left on its hands. In principle, this measure is welcome evidence of the value of close co-operation between the States concerned and the National Parliament. These grants have been recommended by the commission as a result of an impartial investigation into the financial position and needs of the to a substantial degree, whilst the Tramways Trust also increased fares in an endeavour to make ends meet. Travel by tram in Adelaide is becoming so expensive that an increasingly greater number of persons are reverting to the bicycle as a means of transport. This tendency is becoming so marked that not only the tramways but also the railways in South Australia might find it more profitable to reduce their fares instead of increasing them. I am sure that if they did so, their turnover would not decrease but increase. Recently, the State Government embarked upon a project to rebuild the wharfs at Port Adelaide, and that work which has been progressing fairly satisfactorily is also in jeopardy because of lack of finance. In the circumstances, the grant to be made available under this measure will help the State Government to some degree to absorb the evergrowing army of unemployed. At present, unskilled men are finding it difncult to obtain employment. unemployed in South Australia at present. men, who are invariably the first victims of unemployment trends, would not be likely to approach the honourable member for Angas( Mr Downer) to seek help in their plight. I do not say that the number of unemployed in South Australia is yet substantial, but no one can dispute the fact that unskilled men are beginning to find it difficult to obtain jobs. Almost daily, Labour members of Parliament are approached by such men in their search for jobs. This measure is an example of what can be done by co-operation between the weaker financial States and the Commonwealth, and it should serve as a model for the provision of assistance to the weaker sections of the community. I again express the hope that the spirit which informs the measure will be much more in evidence at the meeting of the Australian Loan Council that is to be held to-morrow than it has been at meetings of that body in recent months. At those meetings, all the State Premiers, regardless of their party political affiliations, severely critinational income was not accompanied by a cized this Government for failing to make adequate loan moneys available to the States. I trust that at the meeting of the council to be held to-morrow the spirit of co-operation that was in evidence at meetings of that body when Mr Chifley was Treasurer will be revived. Unlike the present Treasurer, Mr Chifley treated the Premiers not as though they were school children but as representatives of the States in partnership with the Commonwealth in carrying on the affairs of the nation. When this matter comes before the Parliament again, I hope that the grant will not be made in the case of South Australia to the Playford Government, but to a Labour government. Then the grant will not need to be so large. report of the Commonwealth Grants Commission that is before the House in connection with this bill to pay grants to the three claimant States of South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania is one that I heartily commend to honourable members for serious study. I commend it particularly to the representatives of the non-claimant States because it provides a very fine :rvey of the actual state of economic affairs in Australia over the past year and a few months earlier. This report is based entirely upon facts that have been elicited by three men of substance who know their subject and are unbiased. They have been able to conduct an exhaustive survey of every aspect of the national economy, government finance and general government administration. The members of this commission have no sectional interest to serve, no political section to satisfy and no personal axe to grind. It is a very fine report and I shall direct the attention of honourable members to some sections of it. On page 13 of the published report, reference is made to the financial conditions of Australia because the payment of grants to the States is based upon a comparison of the economy in the claimant and non-claimant States. The report statesThe year 1950-51 was one of unprecedented availability of nioney. The value of gross national production rose by £904,000,000 to £3,619,000,000 . . .

315,Mr Downjck,Very few persons are,72,Arthur Eadden
316,Mr Galvijst,"Obviously , unskilled",72,Arthur Eadden
317,Mr Leslie (Moore) [8.30],"Th eTliu volume of primary production was slightly below that of 1049-50, mainly as a result of unfavourable seasonal conditions. The volume of exports of commodities such as meat, butter, wheat and flour declined. Factory production increased and imports of manufactured goods also rose so that greater supplies of many consumer goods became available. Supplies of building material, however, were still inadequate. Despite a notable improvement in the production of black coal and pig-iron, special types of coal wore still scarce wonder that this Government found it and pig-iron and steel supplies were substantially short of demand. There is a picture of the production position in Australia as it existed in 1950-51. On page 15, the report statesDespite the considerable reduction of income of primary industries, wages and retail prices continued to rise during the year. I pause here so that honourable members may ponder upon the foolishness of an economic system such as that revealed in the extract that I have read. While the value and volume of primary production declined, wages and retail prices continued to rise. I emphasize again that this is the report of an impartial commission which is revealing to us the faults of our economy. We are bound inevitably to crash if that trend continues. Much has been said about the possibility that Australia w ill price itself out of prosperity.

Full employment prevailed, the volume oi housing construction increased considerably, secondary industry continued to expand, primary production generally improved and marked progress was made with State developmental projects.

The moneyconstant reiteration of honourable members from New South Wales regarding the financial position of that State-it is time many of the industries that it requires, that this Government, in the interests of the national economy, examined the position in New South Wales and the possibility of putting a receiver in charge of the affairs of that State. For the sake of the financial integrity of this country, some action along those lines, if within the constitutional powers of the Government, should be taken. then put a receiver in ! selves. If they are bankrupt, it is this Government's responsibility to ensure that the integrity of the country is guarded. It has been suggested that the grants that are allotted to thc States by the Grants Commission are based upon State disabilities consequent npon federahave contributed to our national economy tion. Initially that was correct, but about 1936-37 the basis of grants to the claimant States was altered so that they would be assisted, according to their nnancial need, to discharge the functions of the State and provide a standard of social and public services no less than that provided on an average by the other States, provided that each claimant State had made reasonable efforts to provide those services for itself. In the calculation of these grants, one and that of Western Australia is 975,920 cumulative adverse effect of federation ou the smaller States is not taken into consideration. The policy of tariff protection which has been in operation since federation has compelled the claimant States, which are mainly primary producing States, to dispose of their products upon an open market, and to buy their requirements from a protected market. The development of the claimant States has been retarded, not only by the political dominance of the eastern States, but also by the protection that the secondary industries of those States have enjoyed. That has had a cumulative effect upon the smaller States. It is one of the disabilities from which they have suffered since federation. Western Australia is many years behind in the development of its natural resources Wales? and the establishment of the industries that are required to make it self-supportbecause it is more comparable with ing to a certain degree. Owing to the events of past years, it is still short of although some are being established now. The shortage of secondary industries iu the claimant States, and the protection that the secondary industries of the eastern States have enjoyed, have had a cumulative effect upon the claimant States. That disability, as well as the disability associated with the provision of social services, should be taken into consideration when the grants to the claimant States are calculated. not be in existence to-day but for federation. lionorable member for Cunningham ( Mr Davies) say that. I do not believe that the degree to which the claimant States is generally known. Let me compare the production of Western Australia per head of population with that of Victoria, where conditions are somewhat similar to those that obtain in the west. The total volume of the production of Victoria is much greater than that of Western Australia, but I want to make a comparison on a per capita basis. The figures that I shall cite relate to 1948-49. The area of Victoria is 87,884 square miles, square miles. In 1948-49, the area in Victoria under principal crops was 4,644,S41 acres, and in Western Australia it was 4,215,11.2 acres, or ahout 400,000 acres less than in Victoria. From those areas of cultivated land, the net value of rural production per head of population was £55 17s. 2d. in Victoria, and £83 0s. 2d. in Western Australia. The area of cultivated land in Western Australia was about 400,000 acres smaller than that in Victoria, and the population of Western Australia was much smaller than that of Victoria. Those figures enable honourable members to compare the contribution of Western Australia to the national economy with that of Victoria.",73,Arthur Eadden

325,Mr Leslie,"I have chosen VictoriaWestern Australia than is New South Wales in population, areas under cultivation and workers on the land. The value of the production of all industries, secondary and rural, was £137 2s. 8d. per head of population in Victoria, and £135 7s. per head of population in Western Australia. The per capita production of the latter State, with practically no secondary industries, was only £2 less than that of the highly industrialized State of Victoria. In 1948-49, the population of Victoria was 2,220,113, and that of Western Australia was only 565,518. The rural population of Victoria was 592,998, and that of Western Australia was only 175,171. Those figures show which of those two States contributes most to the national economy of this country per head of its population. That is the basis upon which the Commonwealth should decide what assistance shall be given to the States. On that basis, the grants made to Western Australia would nearly exhaust the coffers of the federal treasury. It is gratifying to know that the Comfor the assistance that the Commonwealth monwealth Grants Commission, in assessing the assistance that should be given to Western Australia, took into consideration the loss which that State suffered as the result of the extended railway strike that occurred early this year. It was only right that the commission should take that into consideration, because Western Australia ha* a remarkable record of industrial peace. Unfortunately, it was infected this year by a disWestern Australia throughout its history, astrous bug from the eastern States. It is only fair that, as the infection has spread from the eastern States to the western coast, those States should bear some of the loss that Western Australia incurred as a result of that unfortunate strike. There is only one way in which we can vaccinate ourselves against the bug. If that course were followed, I am afraid that the honourable member for Watson( Mr Curtin) would be one of the wogs that would be eliminated. The honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell) referred to the necessity to develop the north-west of Australia. In that matter, I agree with the honourable member for Melbourne, not with the honourable member for Fremantle ( Mr giving the House a factual account of the Mr Leslie. Beazley). It is necessary to do something to develop the north-west of this continent. That development can be achieved only with a substantial degree of assistance from the Commonwealth, but Western Australia is not prepared to pay the price for it that the Commonwealth apparently wants it to pay. It is not prepared to cede that territory to the Commonwealth. I am not referring particularly to this Government or to any other government. I am talking of the attitude that has been adopted by the Commonwealth to requests for assistance for the development of the north-west of Western Australia over a long period of years. We are not happy about what the Commonwealth has done in the past in the territory over which it has control. We fear that what has happened in that territory might happen in the north-west of Western Australia if it were under Commonwealth control. That area can be developed only with Commonwealth assistance, but I repeat that Western Australia is not prepared to pay the price desires and will not agree to cede the territory. The honourable member for Fremantle suggested that Western Australia has been able to make progress only as the result of windfalls. That may be so in connection with gold-mining and with other industrial developments of that kind. But if the honourable gentleman analyses the statistics relating to development of he will discover that steady progress has been made. Each year, the position has been better than it was in the previous year. That progress has been achieved by the persistent efforts of our pioneers and settlers who, working in the face of great difficulties, have overcome many problems. They have received but little encouragement or assistance. I do not blame the Commonwealth for that entirely. Western Australia is so far away from the other States that it has been left to carry on to the best of its ability. The old maxim "" Out of sight, out of mind "" applied to it. Its ability to carry on was great. Otherwise, I should not be standing here to-night, remarkable contribution that Western Australia has made to the economy of this countrya contribution that entitles it to a fair and reasonable grant to enable it to meet the cost of providing social services and public amenities. I support the bill. Mr W. M. BOURKE (Fawkner) [9.0]. T am astonished at the speech that has been delivered by the honourable member for Moore( Mr Leslie). This is a non-contentious measure. It proposes that a sum of £15,934,000 shall be paid to the claimant States, which are South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania. The speakers who preceded the honourable member for Moore were the lionorable member for Fremantle ( Mr Beazley) and the honourable member for Kingston( Mr Galvin). Each of them represents a claimant State. They discussed this matter on a higher plane. They realize that the money which it is proposed sball be paid to the claimant States will come from the general revenues of the Commonwealth. They know that most of that revenue is derived from the larger States -Ne w South Wales and Victoria. As they pointed out, such bills as this actually represent a desirable spirit of co-operation between the States, and I liave pleasure, as one who comes from one of the larger States, to express our appreciation of the fact that development is being carried out in the smaller States and aUo our recognition of the problems and difficulties of those States. We are pleased that this money is being granted by the Commonwealth' to the smaller States in order to assist in their development. However, the honourable member for Moore did not approach the matter on that plane. He endeavoured, instead, to arouse State rivalries. He made what was really an astounding attack on both New South Wales and Victoria. I do not propose to be drawn into such controversies except to say that his statement tliat Western Australia is almost an earthly paradise seems to me to be a good argument in favour of a case that Western Australia is already so prosperous that it is really not entitled to a grant; rather should the money go to the unfortunate larger States, Victoria and New South Wales, and Western Aus1105] tralia should contribute to such grants to them. However, we do uot wish to enter the field of State rivalry. The debates ou this bill and the similar bills presented each year are, after all, among the few instances when we have non-contentious matters before us. We should, therefore, deal with the bill as Australians and not as residents of particular States. I also refuse to be drawn aside by the political note with which the honourable member for Moore commenced his speecli. He quoted from the excellent nineteenth report of the Commonwealth Grants Commission, selecting from it certain extracts that suited his purpose which he used to support his argument that the economic and financial policies of the Government were desirable, wise and had achieved good results. I could join issue with him on that matter and devote the rest of my speaking time to a refutation of his arguments and to a consideration of the economic and financial policies of the Government. If I wished I could remind the honourable member of the fact that when the Government took office.it had made certain specific promises to the people. It had promised to reduce taxation, check inflation and put value back in the £1. I could go into details of its failure to honour those promises. 1 could also give details of the Government's savage increases of taxes, both direct and indirect, and prove that it has failed to check inflation and that prices are still rising. I could show, in addition, that the Government, as a result of its policy of credit restrictions and similar policies, has produced a deflationary condition, so that the national economy is in the astounding postion of being afflicted with, on the one hand, inflation, with prices and costs rising, and, on the other, with deflation, which is causing general economic dislocation. I could develop that argument if I wished by showing that whereas two years ago there was confidence among the people there is no longer confidence, but there is, instead, hesitation and concern about the future. I do not propose, however, to he drawn off on to those side issues by the statements of the honourable member for Moore. I shall deal, instead, with the matters raised by the bill. The bill provides for a grant of £15,934,000 to the three claimant States, South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania. This money is to be paid uuder section 96 of the Constitution, which provides as follows:During a period of ten years after the establishment of the Commonwealth and thereAustralian Loan Council will meet in after until Parliament otherwise provides, the Parliament may grant nnancial assistance to any State on such terms and conditions as the Parliament thinks f it . That section of the Constitution has not been altered since its inception. Under it the claimant States have applied, right from the beginning of federation, for special grants which, they claimed would provide compensation for what they described as the "" unequal incidence "" of federation. The honourable member for Fremantle discussed this aspect of the matter lucidly, and pointed out that at the time of federation, the Commonwealth adopted a uniform protective tariff that imposed disabilities on agricultural States, which are the smaller and claimant States. The grants were made yearly, until 1933, by the Parliament. They were not based on any definite principle, but were hand-^o-mouth. The result was that the States were not able to plan ahead or make definite commitments for the future, because they did not know the exact amount of the grants they would be allotted. It was not until the establishwish the federal system to function effectment of the Commonwealth Grants Commission in 1933 that the grants were put on a proper basis. It is significant that the recommendations of the commission are among the few matters brought before this Parliament in relation to which there is almost complete factory state of Commonwealth and State unanimity on both sides of the House. financial relationships leads us to examine A bill similar to this one comes before the workings of the Commonwealth us each year and is invariably passed with Grants Commission and to realize that in the support of the Opposition of the day, one minor sphere, at least, of the financial because it is generally recognized that relationships between the Commonwealth the Commonwealth Grants Commission and the States, we have a system that has done a really good job. It works in works satisfactorily. Like the honourable such a way that it is not possible to member for KingstonI should like to question its findings and, in fact, the pay tribute to this fine nineteenth annual claimant States, which receive the money, report of the commission that was tabled and the other States, which make contrirecently. The commission consists of Mr butions towards the grants indirectly, do A. A. Fitzgerald, who is chairman, and not query the commission's findings. The Professor Gordon Wood and the honorcommission's work has been such a great able J. Kenneally. It has an expert staff, success that I believe its function and and examines all the economic and finan-if.ope should be widely extended. Sfr. TF. M. Bourke. The attitude to the commission's recommendations of all the parties concerned is in violent contrast to other aspects of the financial relationships between the Commonwealth and the States. As the honourable member for Kingston( Mr Galvin) pointed out the Canberra to-morrow. That body was established under the Constitution to determine the loan policies of the States and the Commonwealth. Wheni t meets each year we find constant bickering between the States and the Commonwealth, or among the States themselves. There is a constant tussle, with each State trying to gain some advantage at the expense of the others. The same remark applies to the income tax reimbursements which are dealt with under a formula, and are invariably a subject of acrid discussion at the yearly conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers. Those reimbursements are the greatest of the grants that the Commonwealth makes to the States, and are made as compensation for the surrender, by the States in 1942, of their right to levy income tax. The States ask for more money than the Commonwealth offers, and we have this unseemly bickering, which should not take place because, after all, we are all Australians, no matter from which State we may come, and we all ively and efficiently. Constant squabbles over vital financial matters do not contribute to the successful and efficient operation of the system. A consideration of the whole unsatiscial facts, not merely regarding the three claimant States, bnt also regarding all States. It considers all their problems, tlieir sources of revenue and fields of expenditure, and the economic problems that they have to face in order to function effectively. The facts are set out in a fine and easily readable style in the annual report, which constitutes a splendid summary of the economic position of the Commonwealth. The people responsible for this wonderful report deserve great credit. I turn now to a most significant fact. When this commission is determining the amount of the grants that should be paid to the claimant States, it works according to a definite principle, and not on the hand-to-mouth basis that characterizes the relationships between the Commonwealth and Statesi n other aspects of finance. A t page 53 of the report, in chapter IV . , the commission sets out the principles on which it works in determining how much money shall be made available each year to the claimant States. It statesDuring the initia] period of its work the commission considered compensation for disabilities arising from federation as a possible basis upon whicli its recommendations should he macle. That was the principle that I previously mentioned with respect to disabilities that arose mainly from the fact that the Commonwealth's protective tariff had imposed hardships on these States. The report continuesI t considered also the basis of financial need. next biggest grant was £17,231,000, which In its Third Eeport (1936) the commission finally rejected compensation for disabilities arising from federation as a basis, and chose instead the principle of financial need, which it expressed in the following terms:The report then quotes a well-known passage from its 1936 report that is frequently quoted as being the basis on which it recommends the amounts of the various grants. The passage readsSpecial grants are justified when a State through financial stress from any cause is unable efficiently to discharge its functions as a member of tlie federation and should be determined by the amount of help found necessary to make it possible for that State, hy reasonable effort, to function at a standard not appreciably below that of other States. The report continuesSince then, this principle has remained unaltered as the basis on which the commission's recommendations have been made; but, from time to time, methods of applying the principle have had to be adapted to changed circumstances. Based on that definite and clearly stated principle the work of this commission has proved so satisfactory that, as I have said, its recommendations are not queried in this Parliament. They are normaUy accepted by both sides of the House and by the claimant States, I place before the Housef o r its consideration the proposal that since the work of the Commission represents something that operates smoothly and satisfactorily, we should consider extending its methods of determining the financial relationships between the Commonwealth and the States over the whole sphere, if possible, of such financial relationships. Admittedly the amount of money that i8 paid to the States under this provision is only a small proportion of the total amount paid to them by the Commonwealth each year. I was rather astonished, on looking at the figures in appendix 17 of the report, to see that in the financial year 1950-51, the Commonwealth paid to all the States a total sum of £173,923,000 under a considerable number of headings. Of that total, the most substantial amount was £90,107,000, which constituted the income tax reimbursement to the six States. The next largest item was the grant of £21,810,000 made to the Statesf or housing. The was provided as assistance for the relief of primary producers. The next biggest payment was grants of federal aid for ' roads and works, amounting to £14,143,000. The fifth highest amountand well down on the list-wa s £12,175,000, being special grants under section 96 of the Constitution. Those are the grants that the House is now considering. The amount is to be increased this year to £15,934,000. From those figures, the House will see that the amount of grants under section 96 of the Constitution comprises an in considerable proportion of the total amount of money paid by the Commonwealth to the States each year. Looking at the amounts paid each year, as set out in this statistical table, I find that the special grants under section 96 have been getting proportionately less and less since 1942, when the taxation reimbursements commenced. In 1942, the special grants amounted to only £2,175,000 out of a total sum of £45,107,000, whereas in 1950-51 the special grants had increased to £12,000,000, but the figure corresponding to £45,000,000 had risen to £175,000,000. PerhapsI have cited too many figures, because they are rather dry fare, yet they are revealing, and I have given them in order to stress the point that I am making. Although the sphere of operations in which the Oommonwealth Grants Commission is working is only a minor sector of the whole sphere of Commonwealth grants to the States, the system in the minor sector is working so satisfactorily that we should consider extending the work of the commission to cover the whole field of Commonwealth payments to the States When we examine our federal system and the general chaotic financial relations between the Commonwealth and the States, we must reflect upon the fact that the unsatisfactory position is, perhaps, one symptom of a general breakdown of federation in Australia. There is no doubt that the federal system which the fathers of the Constitution envisaged, and upon which the voters of this country gave their decision when they supported federation, was something entirely different from what has developed to-day. TJnder our Constitution, we have a division of responsibilities. That is necessary in a federal sphere. Buti f the federal system is to function satisfactorily, there must be, in addition to the division of responsibilities, financial inconstitution. It left them legally free but dependence of the partners to the federal pact, so that each partner will have suflicient revenue under its control in order to carry out its responsibilities. When we examine the present position, we must come to the conclusion that the whole centre of gravity of our constitutional set-up has changed in favour of a dominant Commonwealth. States, instead of being sovereign in their own sphere and handling their own moneys, are not independent, but are really mendicants, relying upon doles or hand-outs in order to carry out their Mr W. if . Bourke. responsibilities. What are the reasons for this general change that has taken place in our constitutional set-up ? There seem to be two factors why federation has tended to break down in this respect. In the first place, the general march of events has meant that the responsibilities of the Commonwealth partner in the federation have increased tremendously. There have been two world wars with all the accompanying problems of defence and repatriation ; the development of our status in the sphere of international affairs; the growth of commerce and industry; the development of our country as a great trading and industrial nation; the building up of a programme of social security; the introduction of an immigration policy; and great progress in development. All those things have meant that the responsibilities of the Commonwealth have increased tremendously, and, accordingly, the income of the Commonwealth, of necessity, has had to expand in order that it may carry on those greatly increased responsibilities. In the second place, quite apart from this general development in the responsibilities of the Commonwealth, there is the fact that the constitution itself was weighted against the States from the beginning of federation. It is interesting to note that Alfred Deakin, one of the statesmen who played a prominent part in the founding of the Commonwealth, predicted that this state of affairs would come about. He pointed out in an article which was publisbed in the English Morning Post in 1902The rights of the self-governing States have been fondly supposed to Se safeguarded by the financially bound to the chariot wheels of the central Government. Their need will be its opportunity. Those words have proved to be truly prophetic, because the financial powers of the States under the Constitution were permanently limited, and whereas limitations were also placed upon the financial powers of the Commonwealth in order to The protect the States, those limitations were only of a temporary nature. The Commonwealth has succeeded, in the passage of the years, in getting rid of them, so that it has been able gradually to achieve the completely dominant position in financial affairs which it now occupies. Section 86 of the Constitution provides that the collection and control of duties of customs and excise shall belong exclusively to the Government of the Commonwealth. Duties of customs and excise were the main sources of revenue of governments in those days, but the States were permanently excluded from them. Other sections of the Constitution provided that although the States could no longer collect duties of customs and excise, the Commonwealth should reimburse them with a considerable portion of its collections from that source. For example, section 94 providesAfter live years from the imposition of uniform duties of Customs, the Parliament may provide, on such basis as it deems fair, for the monthly payment to the several States of all surplus revenue of the Commouwealth. That is quite a specific section whereby the States would have been entitled to receive the surplus revenue of the Commonwealth. That section became a dead letter, when the High Court of Australia held that the payments by the Commonwealth to trust accotvnts, under the Commonwealth Audit Aet, of moneys appropriated by law for the purposes of the Commonwealth were considered to be expenditure, and thus not surplus revenue to be distributed among the States. So the States were deprived of that potential source of revenue at an early stage of our constitutional development. Section 87 of the Constitution-the famous Braddon clause-provides During a period of ten years after the establishment of the Commonwealth and thereafter unti l the Parliament otherwise provides of the net revenue of the Commonwealth from duties of customs, and of excise not more than one-fourth shall be applied annually by the Commonwealth towards its expenditure. The balance, shall, in accordance with this ConstituTreasurer ( Sir Arthur Fadden) presented tion, lie paid to the several States, or applied towards the payment of interest on debts of the several States taken over by the Commonwealth. That section was intended to be the basis whereby the States would receive a considerable amount of revenue from the Commonwealth. It was a serious limitation upon the financial powers of the Commonwealth; but it was limited in duration. It was to last for only ten years. At the expiration of that period, the Parliament exercised its power under this section, and promptly provided for the discontinuance of such a state of affairs. The Parliament substituted a new system under the Surplus Revenue Act of 1910, whereby the States were paid an amount of 25s. for each member of its population each year. That system continued until 1927 as the basis of Commonwealth reimbursements to the States. So, in the sphere of excise and customs, the powers of thc States were definitely and permanently taken from them. Certain serious limitations which were placed upon the powers of the Commonwealth were only temporary, and, in the course of years, the Commonwealth succeeded in getting rid of them. The Constitution provided that the Commonwealth should have concurrent rights of taxation with the States. Again, over the course of years, the Commonwealth gradually began to exercise those rights, and impose taxation in a number of directions. Section 109 of the Constitution providesWhen a law of a State ia inconsistent with a law of the Commonwealtli, the latter shall prevail, and the former shall, to the extent of the inconsistency, be invalid. The result was that when the Commonwealth entered the taxation field, the States, for all practical purposes, were forced out of it. The Commonwealth imposed new forms of taxation, such as the land tax able member's time has expired. purpose of this bill is to provide sums amounting to £15,934,000 for the financial assistance of South Australia, Western Australia, and Tasmania. When the his budget to the Parliament on the 6th August last, he estimated that these grants would amount to £10,522,000. So the actual amout exceeds the estimate hy £5,412,000. I merely mention that point in order to indicate that "" the best laid schemes o' mice and men gang aft a-gley"". Every additional £5,000,000 that the Treasurer has to provide will make it the more difficult for him to achieve the results that he hopes to gain from his budget.",74,Arthur Eadden

327,Mr Bland (Warringah) [9.28],"Th eI wish to join with otlier honourable members in extolling the work of thc Commonwealth Over the years, it has done its job very well, and as the honourable member for Eawkner( MrW . M . Bourke) has remarked, it has performed its duties in a scientific way, and excluded all thoughts of politics. Althoughi t has been watching the political repercussions of its proposals, its decisions have been taken on the basis of actual facts that have to be faced by each of the three States concerned. repeat the conditions, laid down in the legislation that set up the Commonwealth Grants Commission, under which the States may be given assistance by the Commonwealth. Constitution makes provision for Commonwealth grants to the States and, as the honourable member for Fremantle ( Mr Beazley) pointed out, this provision w ill survive the new policy of returning taxing powers to the States. It has been suggested by the honourable member for Fawkner( Mr W. M . Bourke) that it would be wise if , instead of dealing with the financial relationships of the Commonwealth and the States through the political machinery of the Australian Loan Council or through the financial agreements, we were to use the machinery of the Commonwealth Grants Commission. Under present arrangements the Loan Council supersedes the States and the Commonwealth and both lose their financial sovereignty to the extent that they can do only what all of them together want to do. The principles of finance followed by the Loan Council cannot be decided administratively as in the case of the Grants Commission, but must be decided on the highest possible political level, and although honourable members have disparaged political decisions, financial decisions such as I have been mentioning can never be other than political decisions. ""We complain frequently of making business decisions the Government makes political decisions. out to honourable members that no deciapproach to State financial assistance that sions can be made in politics other than, has been adopted by the Commonwealth political decisions. matters and other matters can be conframers of the Constitution did not lay Sfr. Bland. sidered in reaching a conclusion, but the conclusion itself must be of a political Grants Commission. nature. Governments have created the Australian Loan Council; they have signed financial agreements and they have created the Commonwealth Grants Commission. It has become a tradition that the Parliament should accept the decisions of the Commonwealtli Grants Commission, and at present it would be difficult to go behind the decisions of that body when trying to reach a conclusion as to the amounts that should be provided to There is no necessity to the States under section 96 of the Constitution. However, in our search for abstract justice and in order to keep our governmental machinery working smoothly and easily, and i u trying to reSection 96 of the move obstacles from our path, we frequently depart from principles that we should follow. Created institutions tend to become Frankenstein monsters and slip away completely from our control. In considering this matter, it is well to remember how much we tie the hands of the Parliament. For example there has been some controversy about whether the Australian Government should intervene in our arbitration court about matters that affect the economy of the whole of the nation. The Parliament has woven a. kind of sanctity around it institutions, and they are throttling us. We are lost within the maze of institutions that we have created, and yet we are constantly trying to create more institutions of the same kind. Therefore, I warn the honourable member for Fawkner that when he is seeking in a facile way for an analogy with the working of the Commonwealth Grants Commission, and is applying that analogy to thc working of the Loan Council and the financial agreement he is advocating the destruction of the whole basis of parliamentary government. If we are to bu governed by a democratic parliament, we must not subordinate the whole of the activities of the Parliament in any given direction to a created institution. Yet that instead that is what we are tending to do. I point I challenge the validity of the whole Of course, business Grants Commission. It is true that the down any conditions under whicli grants to the States were to be made; it merely indicated that they were to be made from time to time as the Parliament might decide. That left the Parliament completely free. In the beginning, we had to persuade Western Australia to enter the federation of the States, and to do so we had to provide certain inducements that otherwise would not have been made available. Then we decided to investigate year by year the applications for assistance made by Western Australia, as that State was suffering from disabilities those of the eastern States, but the only which it had not expected when it had to some extent been cajoled into joining the federation in 1900. That policy of making special investigations was carried on, sometimes by parliamentary public accounts committees and sometimes by parliamentary select committees, but there was always some body available to consider whether the claims of Western Australia, and later South Australia and Tasmania, were legitimate. Therefore, a tendency grew up for the whole matter of Commonwealth and State financial relationships to be coloured by politics, and there was a considerable difference of opinion as to whether the amounts recommended were suflicient according to the conditions within the States. Subsequently we h it upon the device of the Commonwealth Grants Commission to make these investigations for us. The Commonwealth Grants Commission set out upon its investigations with the old notion of compensating for disabilities, [t tried to place the smaller States on the same basis as the more prosperous ones. Theni t discovered that that was not the soundest way to deal with the matter, and it decided to t r y to provide the States with the money that would enable them to enjoy the services and amenities that were enjoyed by the move prosperous States. WheneverI consider the attempts that have been made to provide uniform conditions throughout Australia, my ire is aroused. uniform galvanized iron sheds throughout Australia, a uniform education system, a uniform basic wage, uniform social services and uniform everything else cannot be other than destructive of the whole cultural life of our country. A system of thought has grown up that would tag everybody w i th the same label and ensure that they w ill all say the same things at the same time in the same places and in the same way. God forbid that we should try to continue this process, and create more agencies to produce these uniform conditions. I do not want to see an Australia in which every one is raised to the same level and given things because somebody else has them. People should be set back on their own resources. The resources of the smaller States are less than way that we shall ever progress is by setting all the States back on their haunches and making them responsible for their own methods and systems. That w ill make them do things in their own way. If these States are to he told what to do by the Commonwealth Grants Commission or some other instrumentality, we shall reduce ourselves to a stalemate and we shall never be able to get away from the dull level of uniformit y which is destroying enterprise and cultivating mediocrity throughout Australia. Therefore, while I do not oppose the measure, I want to challenge the whole principle underlying it . This measure brings up again the necessity for a re-examination of the whole federal system in Australia. It is true that that system is not working satisfactorily, and that some suggestion has been made that we should deal with this matter of financial resources when we deal w i th the arrangements for an alteration of the uniform taxation system. The Commonwealth Grants Commission's activities in relation to the States produces a condition in which we give each State the amount of money that it requires to bring it up to a certain level which haa no connection with its own resources. I hope that instead of these amounts being arrived at in this way we shall devise a system under which we shall be able to examine all the A system that acquiesces in activities of the States, as well as those of the Commonwealth, and consider whether a fresh distribution of functions, as well as the distribution of resources, will carry out our objectives. Consequently, I make a plea for a constitutional convention to consider the whole problem of distributing functions and resources. Because the present activity of the Commonwealth Grants Commission will continue when uniform taxation has been .abandoned it seems to be vital that we should look at this suggested fresh basis in its effect upon special grants to the three States. This matter is linked with the development of our sparsely populated areas. It is abundantly clear that one of the reforms that will have to be made will be a revision of the areas which are called States. The areas of Western Australia, South Australia, Queensland ancl New South Wales will have to be re-examined to ascertain whether they are the most suitable areas for the most efficient and economical government and development. I am satisfied that these areas are entirely unsuited for the efficient development and advancement of their industries. The only course open to us is to create additional States. Perhaps we shall have to put aside certain areas to be Commonwealth territories, but that might be a bad thing because the farther territories are from Canberra the less they will be considered by the Government, as has already been demonstrated. Perhaps the sparsely populated areas that I have mentioned will have to be made dependent upon the new States. The activities of the Commonwealth Grants Commission present a challenge to us to consider not only whether the objectives of the Commonwealth Grants Commission are sound, but also to consider the resources and functions of the Commonwealth and States and to ascertain whether we can find some way to develop our outlying areas. We cannot afford to leave that development for very much longer. At this stage I support the bill, but I hope that it will he a challenge to us to consider the whole relationship of the States to the Commonwealth, and I hope that some better system will result from that examination. [9.45] I join issue at once with the honourable member for Warringah ( Mr system of education compared very Bland) and accept his challenge. The -honourable gentleman apparently has lost, sight of the fact that this bill represents a method of bringing thc weaker States closer to the position of the other States. He advocated the abolition of the system of making grants to the StateJ and said that all States should be treated as equal members of the Commonwealth. The effect of his proposal would be to make poor relations of the weaker States. I hope that we shall not allow ourselves to be misled into making such a decision. The honourable member for Fawkner( Mr W. M. Bourke) traced the history of States grants and explained how the States first relinquished to the Commonwealth the right to collect customs duties and how, as the Commonwealth encroached on the revenue-raising preserves of the States, provision had to be made for the compensation of the States. The gradual evolution of this system has brought about a state of affairs in which the three poorer States are better treated than ever before in the history of federation. Western Australia, South Australia and Tasmania receive a fair deal from the Commonwealth Grants Commission and would suffer if any other system were adopted. I am well acquainted with the history of South Australia, particularly during the period that immediately preceded the establishment of the Commonwealth Grants Commission. In those days, the South Australian Government could not provide for the welfare of its people as efficiently as the governments of other States were able to do. The result was that South Australians had to accept lower standards than prevailed in other States. Education, which is of vital importance to every community, had to be restricted because of the lack of finance. Our primary industries and our grea, secondary industries all depend for their prosperity upon a sound educational, system, from primary schools to technical colleges and universities. If we want to obtain the best results, we must give the best service that we can to our people. In South Australia, only 22 years ago, the State government was unable to provide adequate education services. Its unfavourably with those of the eastern States. But the situation is vastly different to-day. The Premier and Treasurer of South Australia presented his budget to the Parliament of that",80,Arthur Eadden

I have not had an opportunity to study it, but I heard a radio news item this evening which reported that the Premier would endeavour to develop deposits to the best advantage as quickly as possible. to be expended on development and research for this purpose, and there will not be any direct financial return from that expenditure. The grants for which this bill provides are not intended to take the place of loan Grants Commission considers the applications of thc claimant States in the light of the information that the Treasurers of those States supply to it . It compares their budget proposals with the plans of the other States before it makes its decisions. claimant States must take cognizance of the economic policies of the other States. South Australia, for example, was obliged recently to increase railway fares and freight charges. Grants Commission took into account the charges made by the railways services of other States and decided that South Australia was not charging enough for the services that it provided. The State has been compelled to increase its rail charges on two or three occasions for this reason. Notwithstanding the increases, most of the money that will be paid to South Australia under this bill will be used in conabolished and the States regain their nexion with rail services. The honourable member for Moore( Mr Leslie) referred to the high costs of the railways service in claim on the taxpayers, of course, and I Western Australia and the great loss that had been sustained by that service as a result of a strike this year. Transport costs have increased considerably in all States in recent years. These costs impose the most severe of all the demands that are made upon the financial resources of State governments. The Government of New South Wales, for example, would be in a much happier economic situation if it could eliminate the loss on its railways system. South Australia has been very hard h it by increased transport costs. South Australians arc proud of the fact that they have developed a comprehensive and efficient education system. development would not have been possible if the State had not received financial assistance regularly from the Commonwealth on the recommendation of tha South Australia's uranium Commonwealth Grants Commission-.. Without such grants, the SouthA u s Much money 'will have tralian Treasurer this year would have been obliged to prune many millions of.' pounds off his estimates of expenditure. If the States of Western Australia, South Australia and Tasmania were thrown on their own resources, as the honourable member for Warringah hassuggested, they could not continue to money. The Commonwealth provide the ordinary services of State governments. Eeferenee has been made to the meeting of the Australian Loan Council to-morrow at which the subject of interest rates will be discussed. Interest rates are of great importance to the Government of South Australia, which is Therefore, the committed to considerable expenditure in order to maintain interest payments on loans that it has raised. Any increase of the interest rate on loans must involve t.he State Government in heavier costs The Commonwealth with the result that it will need largergrants. AlthoughI disagree with the proposal hy the honourable member for Warringah to throw the States on their own resources, I ag:ac with him that a convention should be called in order to thrash out problems of government finance. The problems of Commonwealth and State financial relations w ill be aggravated if the uniform tax system is former taxing powers. The Commonwealth Government will make the first am sure that the result w ill be that the taxpayers w ill be called upon to pay more than they pay under the present system. I acknowledge that this is only supposition, but we can only base our forecasts on supposition reinforced by our knowledge of conditions in the fields of Commonwealth and State finance. If the uniform tax system is abolished, the need for a convention to examine problems of finance w ill become even more urgent than it is to-day. The bill provides for a grant to South Australia of £6,343,000. However, an excess payment that was made two years ago will have to be recouped, and the That giant will be reduced by that amount. The sum of £6,343,000 represents the estimated requirements of the State Government for the current year if it is to balance its budget. whether the estimate is accurate. Perhaps larger grants w ill be necessary in future years, or the demands of the State may be reduced. We claim that Australia has made great advances during the last twenty years. We are not so dependent upon the Mother Countryf or -defence and economic aid as we were -formerly. In our new state of indepen-dence, we must be extremely careful not to weaken any of the six States, because our strength depends upon our weakest link. We should treat this bill as a non-party nieasure. Our object should be to safeguard the interests of the whole nation and to t r y to foster a broader and more lively Australian spirit amongst the people so that Australia may have a bright and prosperous future. nieasure contains the true spirit of federation. The States belong to a single nation, and they should be placed on an equal footing. I support the bill. support the bill. This debate affords an and has a reasonably high rainfall.

In South of Canada combined in a federation Australia, the population in a limited shortly after the end of the American Civil War, and the fathers of federation in that dominion were principally conTime w ill tell cerned to ensure that the provinces should be closely bound in the federation. Incidentally, it was originally suggested that the combined provinces should be known as the Kingdom of Canada. The central Government in Canada was vested with very wide powers, financial and otherwise. In Australia, the reverse was the case. Eederation took place in this country following a period of peace during which nothing had occurred to alarm the people here; and, in those circumstances, the. States handed over only limited powers to the Oommonwealth. The principal problem that has arisen as a result of federation has not necessarily been the financial relations between the States and the Commonwealth but Thisrather the geographical demarcation of the various States. That observation does not apply to Tasmania, the boundaries of which have been decided, not by man, but by nature. The State of Victoria has been very fortunately placed in that the The Thus the people of Victoria were able for Port Adelaide( Mr have given rise to difficult administrative Whilst development has taken in the fertile areas, the The system of making development of the State as a whole has The fertile lands in The relations people in those areas have been called",83,Arthur Eadden

By far the greater part of Western Australia is dependent upon a great deal of assistance from the population that is centred in the fertile south-eastern corner which has a reasonably high rainfall. That population must bear, for instance, the nnancial burden involved in the provision of transport facilities in the Kimberleys ancl in thc north-western portion. The suggestion that the honourable member for Warringah macle and which the honourable member for Port Adelaide entirely misunderstood was that in the Commonwealth Grants' Commission we are perpetuating what he described as a Frankenstein monster. To-day, the commission is assisting in perpetuating thc extraordinary unbalanced divisions which we now call States. I exclude from that observation the Northern Territory for which the Commonwealth is directly responsible. Whilst the development of that part of Australia will suffer from the disability that it must be administered fro m Canberra, the Northern Territory enjoys the advantage that the Government which is responsible for its development has at its disposal financial resources f a r greater than it requires for that purpose. A t the same time, however, it is purely an accident that that area has become the direct responsibility of the Commonwealth. much more just and, indeed, more beneficial from the point of view of the development of Australia as a whole, if the north-western portion of Queensland had been taken over in the same way instead of being dependent for its development upon the assistance that can be macle available for that purpose by a population that is confined to the coastal belt in that State and whicli must necessarily be limited. To-day, that population has the responsibility of financing the provision of roads and railways for the development, of that large, dry and sparsely settled area. Again, it would be f a r more beneficial fro m the point of view of the development of the Kimberleys and the north-western portion of Western Australia, which constitute practically half of Western Australia, if other means could be evolved for that purpose instead of the rather curious method of making annual grants to the Government of t h at State, whose population is largely confined in its south-eastern corner and! saying to that Government, in effect,. "" You must deny yourself the right toexpend this money which we give to you as compensation in respect of disabilities that you suffered at the time of federation and expend it on the development of the north and north-western portions of your State, the development of which is so v it a l "" . The honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell) made one of the most interesting suggestions that have emerged from this debate when he advocated the formation of new States. We require to r i d ourselves of the idea that the present State boundaries must remain unaltered for all time. The existence of the Commonwealth Grants Commission tends to cement that permanency. The development of dry, difficult land which involves the provision of roads and railways should be regarded as a job for the Commonwealth as a whole; and the development of the fertile, high rainfal l areas around the fringe of the continent should be regarded as a job that can be done quite comfortably by the concentrated populations which naturally inhabit those areas. Those are some of the thoughts to which this debate has given It would have been rise in my mind. I agree entirely with the honourable member for Warringah that we are too prone to set up bodies like the Commonwealth Grants Commission and then permit them to control us. We are content to place upon the populations in fertile areas, apparently for all time, responsibility for the development of much larger and more sparsely settled areas in each of the States, whereas, if Australia is ever to be truly a nation, that should be regarded as being a national job. We shall not get anywhere by relying on a method of making grants to what are known as claimant States on the basis of some curious formula by which money is made available to government's whose populations are confined in limited fertile areas on the condition that they expend it in the development of the sparsely settled areas under their control. I support the bill' [10.10] -This bill seeks to authorize the payment of special grants to South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania, which are commonly known as the claimant States, and to South Australia it provides for the payment of the sum -of £6,343,000, The commission reported T that one of the main reasons for making ""these grants is the inflationary conditions -which have persisted since 1950-51 up to 'the present time. According to the commission, those conditions have resulted in a continuance of the upward trend in wages and other costs of government and that the finances of the claimant States have been adversely affected as a consequence. As a representative from South Australia, I must make the shameful admission that the Premier of that State, Mr Playford, contributed to the development of inflationary conditions as much as any other single individual did and, indeed, more than most. Everybody in South Australia vividly remembers the full-page advertisements that were insorted in the press in that State under the authority of the Liberal party in the course of the referendum campaign in 1948 when the Chifley Government asked the people to give to the National Parliament power to continue prices contrpl on . an Australia-wide basis. A photograph, of Mr Playford was featured in. all of those advertisements which asked the people to reject the Chifley Government's proposals and in which the Liberal party promised that if the proposals were defeated the State Government would effectively control prices -Order! The honourable member must Mr Playford, .when he sponsored that promise, was well aware of the fact that prices 'could not he effectively controlled by the. States. Their failure to do so is one of the main causes of present inflationary conditions. Since the defeat of those referendum proposals, the Playford Government in South Australia has ceased to control the price of clothing with the result that, to-day, the cost of clothing to the ordinary person is extraordinarily high. That Government also contributed to present inflationary conditions by removing rent control. In the main, rents are payable to wealthy persons who are the friends of the Liberal party. I suggest that the Commonwealth Grants Commission should have examined the contribution that Mr Playford made -to the present inflationary conditions when it was dealing with this important aspect of the Australian economy as a whole. Paragraph 17 of the commission's report statesTo counteract the intensified inflationary pressure in Australia, the Commonwealth Government increased taxation on luxury goods and the Commonwealth Bank imposed greater restrictions on advances by. financial institutions. I invite honourable members to examine that paragraph. I wonder what the commission would have thought had it listened to the budget speech in which the Treasurer ( Sir Artliur Fadden) announced that the Government had decided, to reduce the taxes on luxury goods. He did not reduce the taxation on goods that are needed in every day life. The Government still imposes a tax of 12£ per cent, on bottling outfits which the ordinary housewife has to use for bottling fruits. ( Mr Bowden) -Order!

Thc railway system in South Australia is a losing proposition. One of the reasons is that it is not so favourably situated as is Victoria and some of the richer States. paying in Victoria. say that the Victorian railways were paying. I said that the South Australian railways were not so favourably situated as those in other States. Tlie losses could be reduced if the Government would take advantage of the agreement that exists with the Australian Governmeut to standardize the railways. While South Australia continues to have an obsolete railway system, heavy losses are certain. Although the commission has reported that railway charges in South Australia 20 the railways are still losing money and the position w ill not be improved unti l tlie railway system is placed upon a sound economic foundation. The commission has also referred to South Australia's problem of water supply and irrigation. One of the schemes promised to the people of South Australia by Mr Playford was a water reticulation sclieme for tbe Yorke Peninsula. So far, it is still in the promise stage. The people of South Australia were told also that supplementary supplies of water for the reservoirs in the metropolitan areas would be provided, ancl that the South Para reservoir at Williamstown would be completed. Work upon that reservoir was commenced, but nearly all of the men engaged upon it have been dismissed. The South Australian Govornment said that it had to dismiss the men because it had not enough money to carry on with the work, because, according to the report of the Commonwealth Grants Commission, one of the reasons that the State advanced for being unable to complete some of its developmental works was a shortage of man-power. There is not a shortage of manpower in South Australia to-day. A t lea.st 3,000 people in the State are unemployed. There are 941 people on the dole in South Australia. In those circumstances, what is the use of the South Australian Government telling the commission that it cannot complete developmental schemes because sufficient manpower is not available? Why does not it give to the 941 poor wretches, who are on the dole, an opportunity to work on The railways are not developmental projects? The report deals w i th housing and with hospitals. Mr Playford told the people of South Australia that his Government would build a new mental hospital, but it has made no effort to do so. That scheme is still in the promise or blueprin t stage. The South Australian Government promised that it would embark upon a great war service land settlement scheme. Section 35 of the report of the commission deals with the preparation of land for war service land settlement. All that the South Australian Government has done has been to emhave been increased by bark upon a very small, but very good, per cent. to 25 per cent., war service land settlement at Loxton. Ex-servicemen in South Australia are screaming for an opportunity to settle on the land, and there is plenty of good land in the State that could be allotted to them if the South Australian Government were prepared to honour the promises that it has made to ex-servicemen who have done so much for this country. When Mr Playford appears before the commission again, he should admit, that so f a r he has spent the whole of his time in hoodwinking the people, and apparently the commission as well. Prior to the Gawler by-election, Mr. Playford promised the people of Gawler that sewerage facilities would be made available to them, but when the Playford Government's candidate was defeated in that by-election, the scheme was forgotten. The Playford Government has claimed that it has not enough money available to enable it to undertake all the grandoise schemes about which it makes promises to the people of South Australia, especially when elections are near. In section 32 of the report of the commission, the following passage appears:In South Australia, new ventures planned or under investigation included the production of sulphuric acid from pyrites anrl an expansion of the chemical industry at Whyalla and thc motor car industry.",89,Arthur Eadden

The Soutli Australian Government will have to foot the bill if the project fails. If the project proves to be successful, Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited will reap the benefit from it, but if it fails, the South Australian Government, as the guarantor of the money necessary to develop the scheme, will lose money on the proposition. According to the evidence given before the commission, the South Australian Government can find money to start a chemical industry at Whyalla and to help the motor car industry but, for some reason best known to Mr Playford, it cannot find money for other schemes about which it has made great promises to the people of South Australia. The time has come when some straight talking is necessary. I hope that on the next occasion when Mr living, and reflects the degree of inflation Playford appears before the Commonwealth Grants Commission; Premier of South Australia. event the commission would have to meet before the next general election in that State. If the commission does not meet again until after that election, Mr Playford will not have an opportunity to appear before it, because Mr O'Halloran will bu the Premier of the State. The people of South Australia have realized at last that Mr Playford makes a lot of foolish promises which he does not intend to honour. They know that he makes those promises for their propaganda value, and he has been trying to hoodwink them. The people of Australia have at last woken up to the Playford Government. Next year, there will be a new government in the State, and the new Premier will be able to present to the Commonwealth Grants Commission a case very different from thc phony case that has been presented by Mr Playford. honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr Clyde Cameron) has made some of his usual irresponsible statements. They are as far from the truth as any statements could be. The tenor of the honourable the Premier of .South Australia. Mr Playford is the finest Premier that this country has ever produced. He has enjoyed the confidence of the people of South Australia for sixteen years, and he will retain it for many years to come. The honourable member for Hindmarsh pointed out that one of the reasons why the grant to South Australia has been increased is because of the present infia/ tionary trend. He failed to mention the fact that inflation is in progress throughout Australia, and throughout the world. He had the audacity to say that the inflationary situation in South Australia was caused by the Playford Government. He implied that in South Australia inflation was worse than in any other State. The basic wage is based upon the cost of that has occurred. The basic wage in South Australia is £11 4s. a week, but in the Labour State of New South Wales it is £11 15s. a week. That proves clearly that the Playford Government has controlled inflation more effectively than has the Labour Government of New South Wales. The honourable member for Hindmarsh referred to the fact that the Premier of South Australia advised the people of that State to vote against Commonwealth prices control. They voted overwhelmingly against the proposal to give the Commonwealth power to control prices. If there is any substance in the argument of the.honourable member that there would be less inflation in this country now if power to control prices were in the hands of the Commonwealth, whyare prices higher in New South Wales, where a Labour Premier has effective power to control prices, than in South Australia, which has a Liberal Premier? South Australia has kept prices down far better than any other State. The honourable member for Hindmarsh then attempted to discredit his own State by trying to give the impression that there",90,Arthur Eadden

365,Mr Wilson (Sturt) [10.36],"Th eis wholesale unemployment there. Unemployment in South Australia, per head of the population, is lower than it is in any other State. Quite a large percentage of the unemployed have drifted to South Australia from New South Wales and Victoria because they could not find a job under Labour governments. What are the facts about unemployment? The unemployed in South Australia number only 1 per cent, of the working population compared with the average of 8 per cent, which obtained from 1900 to 1940. I was about to give the figures in regard to unemployment when Mr Acting Deputy Speaker said that I was out of order. Is the honourable member for Sturt( Mr Wilson) in order in citing these figures? we arc engaged in a debate on unemployment. ber for Hindmarsh ( Mr Clyde Cameron) stated that there was unemployment on a large seale in South Australia for which hc blamed the Premier of South Australia. As he was allowed to make that statement surely I should be given the opportunity to state that his facts and figures were entirely incorrect. There is less unemployment in South Australia rluui in the other States of the Commonwealth. Each week more and more people are becoming unemployed. It may bc --aiil that there is no substantial unemployment in South Australia at present because at all times there is some unemployment which arises from seasonal conditions. The present percentage of unemployed is only one-eighth of the average percentage between 1900 and 1940 and it is actually lower than the figure for tlic last year that the Chifley Government was in power. So if there is wholesale unemployment in South Australia at present, there was more than wholesale unemployment when Labour Avas in office in this Parliament. The houorable member for Hindmarsh next dealt with the clause in the report concerning national development. The report mentioned the development that has occurred in South Australia and the development that has been planned for the future. No State has proceeded faster with its development than South Australia. Production per head of population is higher in South Australia than in any other State of the Commonwealth except Victoria and it is now very close to that of Victoria. That is a great tribute to the Premier of South Australia and his Liberal government because South Australia is very poor in natural resources. It has no high-grade coal. It has great distances and therefore needs extensive road projects. But in spite of the natural deficiencies of coal and water, South Australia has progressed in the last ten years faster than any other State and its productivity per head of population will soon be the highest in the Commonwealth. The honourable member for Hindmarsh then proceeded to deal with the railways. He suggested that Mr Playford had not kept liis promise concerning railway development and that nothing was being done to develop the railways in South Australia. Again, the honourable member was far from the facts. The south-east line, which is being built to one of the most valuable parts of the State, has almost been completed. Perhaps the honourable meniber may have the privilege of riding in the first train that travels on that line when it is opened in a few months. The honourable member then dealt with the housing situation. He tried to give the impression that housing was in the doldrums in South Australia. The facts are that last year more houses were erected in South Australia than in any year in its history. More houses are now under construction than at any time in the history of South Australia. The number of applications for permits to build new houses is an all-time record. With a record number of houses erected last year, a record number of houses under construction and a record number of applicants for permits to build, how can the honourable member truthfully say that anything is wrong with the housing situation in South Australia? South Australia is still building brick homes for £200 and £300 less than they are built elsewhere in the Commonwealth. Rents are the lowest, in Australia and the best",91,Arthur Eadden

368,Mr Wilson,"The honourable memtypes of houses are constructed. The houorable member's attack did a disservice, not only to his State, but to himself. All thinking people in South Australia have faith and confidence in their own State. Since the days of the depression we have decided to develop our State, and overcome our national deficiencies. We have taken water where there was no water. We have developed the very inferior coal-field Leigh Creek and can now provide a large part of our own power requirements from Leigh Creek coal-field. The honourable member then proceeded to criticize the Mannum pipe-line which has been developed as fast as the material and labour available would permit. The honourable member also dealt with the South Para reservoir and suggested that all work had ceased there. That suggestion is entirely incorrect. When the Premier of South Australia attended thc conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers he was disappointed, as the other Premiers were disappointed, because insufficient loan money was available on with the job. to carry out all the loan and developmental works that he wanted to undertake. But he did not go back to his State and sack men. He said that not one man would be sacked and not one man has been sacked by the State Government. It is true that where retrenchments have been necessary the natural wastage of staff has not been replaced. But the Premier gave confidence to thc people of South Australia. He did not intend to allow a depression to develop in his State. He said that State works would continue and that the men engaged on them would continue to he employed. The honourable member for Hindmarsh has tried to create a similar psychological Premier about which they cannot be attitude to dismissals and depression to that created in New South Wales by the Labour Premier, with the result that the people have lost confidence in the New South Wales Government. That Government has panicked and dismissed people unnecessarily. encouraged the type of calamity-howling in which the honourable member for Hindmarsh has indulged. The kind of remarks that he passed will not do him any good in South Australia. We do not like Mr Wilson. calamity-howlers. We have confidence in our State and our Premier. We are going ahead from strength to strength and notwithstanding the calamity-howling of the honourable member and his colleagues we shall continue to maintain full employment in South Australia. We shall continue with our housing programme in South Australia. The honourable member dealt with Eadium Hill. We are tremendously proud of the achievements of the South Australian Premier in connection with Eadium Hill. We have the complete confidence of the governments connected with the Atomic Energy Committee. We have also been provided with financial assistance for the development of that great undertaking. South Australia is leading the way among Australian States in relation to atomic energy, and will be producing uranium oxide for atomic energy long before any other State can produce it. Labour governments in the other States have done absolutely nothing about atomic energy. Under Mr Playford, South Australia is the only State that has got The honourable member for Hindmarsh then spoke about the Port Augusta power house. No undertaking has ever gone ahead more quickly than has that power house, which will use coal mined at Leigh Creek in South Australia, and will provide electricity to the northern areas of the State and supplement Adelaide's electricity supply. Chifley Government! opposite say that in respect of every achievement of the South Australia Jeremiahs. They claim that Mr Playford has achieved his successes because he was forced to undertake projects by Mr Chifley. Such statements are so foolish that nobody in South Australia would believe them.

Before many years have passed it w ill be producing atomic energy that w ill be used for industrial purposes. The honourable member for Kingston( Mr Galvin), who usually makes more moderate speeches than those of the honourable member for Hindmarsh, unfortunately developed in his speech this same attitude of depression talk, which is thc last thing that should he spoken about in relation to South Australia, because thai, State has an extraordinarily high level of production and an expanding industrial capacity. I [indmarsh made another misstatement when he dealt with the subject of wheat, production. Adopting a completely oneeyed approach to the matter, he said that. South Australia's production of wheal had fallen to an alarming degree. The facts are that its production of wheat ami barley combined is higher this year than it. has been in any previous year. It is true that, owing to a shortage of superphosphate and to the fact that the price obtainable for barley overseas is liigher than the price obtainable for wheat, a great number of farmers have switcher! from wheat-growing to barley-growing. Hut what does that matter? Surelyi f we can get more money overseas for our barley than we can get for our wheat, it is better to produce and export barley, and so improve our overseas balances. In any event, it was almost impossible for some farmers to produce wheat becanse of the lack of fertilizers. The honourable member then proceeded to criticize the Nairne pyrites plant. He chastized the Playford Government for expending money on a sulphuric acid plant which is to do for South Australia, in relation to sulphur, what Leigh Creek has done for it in relation to coal. The pyrites plant w ill produce pyrites for the purpose of making sulphur, from which wil l be produced sulphuric acid at Port Adelaide, from which, in turn, superphosphate will be manufactured. soon as that plant is in production. South Australia w ill be independent of the rest of Australia, and the rest of the world, in connection with superphosphate supplies. Yet the honourable member had the effrontery to criticize the Playford Government for the expenditure of money on it . Nairne is only a few miles away from Adelaide and has rich deposits of pyrites that w ill be taken by rail to Port Adelaide ancl turned into sulphuric acid. I whole-heartedly support the bill under which the recommendation of the Commonwealth Grants Commission that, a larger grant be paid to South Australia will be adopted. The commission made that recommendation because it realizes that South Australia, its Premier and its Government, have done such a good job that that State is entitled to a larger The honourable member for grant. The grant is paid, in the first place, to offset the disabilities of South Australia, which covers a large area and, therefore, has to build and maintain a great mileage of roads in order to function efficiently. It is for that reason that South Australia and ""Western Australia will receive grants to enable them to maintain the same standards as other States. South Australia has shown that, even with its natural disadvantages, it has been able to achieve the highest production a head of population of any State, with the exception of the small, rich and compact State of Victoria.

372,As Mr Howse (Calare) [ 1 1 . 0 ],"I wishpensions payable to British war widows residing in Australia and to Australian war widows residing in the United Kingdom, are subject to income tax in those countries. I believe that no war widow should have to pay income tax. Disability pensions are not taxable in Australia, and all war widows' pensions, with the exception of those paid by the United Kingdom Government, are free of tax. To my mind that exception is a serious injustice. I shall illustrate the anomoly that exists under the present agreement. As honourable members are aware, Burns Philp and Company Limited is an Australian shipping company. For various reasons, one of which is to avoid certain provisions of the Australian articles under the Navigation Act, ships belonging to this company are registered at various overseas ports, one of which is Hong Kong. During World War II. some Burns Philp merchant ships were, sunk by enemy action. Those ships were manned by Australians, and the casualties amongst the crews were heavy. The men concerned were Australian citizens, working under Autralian merely because the ships were registered in Hong widows pensions, and because those widows live in Australia, their pensions are taxable. On the other hand, widows of Australian mariners who perished on vessels belonging to the Adelaide Steamship Company Limited or other ships registered in Australia, receive a war widows' pension free of tax. I know of one pathetic case concerning an Australian family. The husband served on an Australian ship registered in Hong Kong. He lost his life at Singapore. His widow is now living in depressed circumstances in Sydney. to live in her native land with her family, but because her husband was serving on an Australian ship, registered in Hong Kong, her small widow's pension is taxable. Apparently nobody wants to tackle this problem. Probably both the Australian Government and the British Government tend to consider it as only a small item in a very large agreement. In the last six years, no effort has been made to correct the injustice. I submit that it is a very serious injustice, and Mr Howse. I urge the Government to approach the United Kingdom authorities with a view to amending the double taxation agreement, or to referring the matter to the Commonwealth Committee on Taxation for investigation and report. If the matter is referred to the committee, I hope that it will not be put aside as an insignificant item in a wide agreement. This is a very rea] human problem, and it should be tackled immediately. I ask the Government to treat the matter as one of urgency and to do everything possible to have this gross injustice removed. This House has discussed oil monopolies and the attempt by certain British interests to get control of Australian radio stations, and many things have been said about those matters; but I wish tonight briefly to draw the attention of the Government to certain happenings in the film industry in Australia, and to the dangers to Australian interests that have arisen because of attempts by groups of distributors to harm the owners of a articles, but number of picture theatres throughout Australia who belong to what is called the Kong, their Australian Independent Group. In tbe United receive United Kingdom States pf America quite recently, a successful attempt was made by the Federal Government to destroy a monopoly which had gained control of film producers, distributors and exhibitors. In that country now, those three branches of the film industry live side by side, and no one group can control either of the other two. Unfortunately in Australia one or two American interests are attempting, by unfair practices, to place the owners of independent theatres at a great disadvantage. One group of distributors has gone from strength to strength, buying up She chooses small independent theatres. By releasing in its suburban theatres films that are showing currently in the city theatres, this group is able to obtain an advantage over independent theatre owners in the same suburbs. The result is that more and more independent exhibitors who have helped to build the industry in this country, are being squeezed out of business.

Greater Union Theatres Limited not only distributes films, but also owns a considerable number of theatres. T speak from a personal knowledge of the position in Brisbane. In that city alone, Greater Union Theatres Limited controls, through Haymarket Tivoli Theatres, the Tivoli Theatre. In Winterg -.rden Theatres Limited the company has a large and influential holding in the Wintergarden and Majestic Theatres. Greater liiiion Theatres Limited also owns and controls the Embassy Theatre in the Valley. From the information 1 havo given, it will be seen that it has a controlling interest in the great majority of the theatres iu Brisbane. Regent Theatre, and the St.. James Theatre, are owned and controlled hy Hoyts Theatres Limited. If I remember correctly, the honourable member for Melbourne suggested that Hoyts Theatres Limited was not doing as he suggested the other companies were doing. The only other city theatre in Brisbane is the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Proprietary Limited Metro Theatre. I mentioned that, in the 1930's, Hoyts Theatres Limited and Greater Union Theatres Limited got together and endeavoured to squeeze Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Proprietary Limited out of the business of exhibiting films. I am able tq speak with authority on what occurred in Brisbane. The only other theatre in that city available to the company was His Majesty's Theatre, which was a legitimate theatre, that is, a theatre which stages flesh and blood shows. The Metro Theatre endeavoured to obtain His Majesty's Theatre, and for a short time succeeded in doing so. Through the activities of Hoyts Theatres Limited and Greater Union Theatres Limited, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer was frozen out of His Majesty's Theatre. It was compelled to take over a dilapidated building in South Brisbane which was remodelled. In the meantime it was forced by the octopus to exhibit Mr Wight. Anybody who has a practical knowledge of the industry knows that unless a first release is obtained for a film in a major theatre in a city, a great financial loss is sustained and its selling value is lost to a considerable degree in country areas, from which a large part of the revenue of the film industry is obtained. Therefore, I suggest that the attempt by the honourable member for Melbourne to attribute, to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Proprietary Limited particularly, the practice of owning and controlling theatres for the exhibition of films to the detriment of the independent exhibitor, is completely unjustified. My statement is further borne out by thc fact that the majority of the theatres in the country districts are not controlled by Metro-G-oldwyn-Mayer Proprietary Limited. To my knowledge the only theatres which Metro-GoldwynHoyts Mayer Proprietary Limited controls are in the city areas, and I understand it owns no more than two theatres in any one city. suburbs. That is my complaint. pany is only following the trail left by Hoyts Theatres Limited and many other subsidiary companies, including firms under the directorship of Mr Stephens in partnership with Mr Munro, who was the late managing director of Hoyts Theatres Limited. If Metro-GoldwynMayer Proprietary Limited is in fact advancing into the suburbs, it is only employing the same tactics as were employed against it in the early 1930's. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Proprietary Limited produces films which are usually acknowledged by the members of the Motion Pictures Exhibitors Association JfV being of a considerably higher standard than are those marketed through other companies. There are about nine major distributing companies in Australia. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Proprietary Limited, because it handles only feature films, and gives to them a considerable amount of expensive publicity, is required to charge high prices for its products.

But that is not peculiar to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Proprietary Limited, because Greater Union Theatres Limited has been recognized as the hardest company in the industry with which to do business and has done likewise. I assure the honourable member for Melbourne that Greater Union Theatres Limited is recognized as one that is the least tolerant of its employees, and that the wages it pays are by far the poorest in the industry. A young lady who was employed as a secretary to the manager of the company in Brisbane gave loyal service for. eighteen years.
