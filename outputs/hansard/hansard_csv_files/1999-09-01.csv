Wednesday, 1 September 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 9689 Wednesday, 1 September 1999 Migration Agents Regulation Authority Report of 25 August 1999, Mr Kerry O'Brien said: Thousands of hopeful migrants have had their futures cast into doubt following the closure of Australia's biggest immigration law finn. Barlow& Company-which had offices in Sydney and Melbourne has suddenly closed its doors after 20 years; its principal lawyer, Neil Barlow, declaring himself bankrupt. Of the finn's 3,000 clients, many stand to lose thousands of dollars in up-front fees. Reporter Jacinta Tynan noted: Just days before, staff at Barlow& Company were telling clients they would be closing for an inventory and back in business this week, in fact the finns's principal, Neil Barlow, had already filed for personal bankruptcy, the day after he deregistered himself as a migration agent. Clients were told nothing. Dr Charles Sinclair, a former employee, said in the report: A notice was put up saying that an inventory was being carried out. I don't know how you carry out an inventory in a law office. But the switchboard was also told that no calls were to be put through to us and that they could call back on 20 August, by which time, of course, we had all departed. The 7.30 Report notes Dr Sinclair worked as a migration agent at Barlow and Company for the past 15 months. Dr Sinclair became concerned about the firm's business practices. Clients were made to pay up front on the promise of a refund if the case was unsuccessful. Charles Sinclair believes those funds were being withdrawn before the work was complete. The 7.30 Report interviewed Mr Ray Brown of the Migration Agents Regulation Authority, MARA, who said: I can't say he was under investigation but there were complaints that were before us and we were looking into those complaints. MARA has limited powers to investigate agents or audit their books. Since Neil Barlow deregistered himself as an agent, he is no longer accountable to the authority. Dr Sinclair further notes: I think that the clients have really been short-changed. They have paid monies to have a contract executed. They have paid for a whole lot of work which will never be done and I feel very sorry for these clients because they have no redress at all now. The immigration department says that because of the 'human impact' of the collapse of Barlow and Company it will grant special concessions to the firm's former clients by extending the deadlines for processing visas. But under present law there is little that can be done to prevent this happening again. Just two weeks ago Neil Barlow was advertising in the ethnic press, trading on his expertise as a lawyer, to attract clients. My. electorate of Lowe is one of the most culturally diverse electorates in Australia. The vast majority of my constituency work is immigration work, resulting many times from constituents who have lost confidence in the legal system. I agree with Dr Sinclair's following comments:",147,Nalsas To The Year 2000 That Is An Allocafrustration Over This Government S Handling Of

286,Mr Murphy (Lowe},"-I raise the issue of migration agency regulation. On the ABC's 7.309690 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 1 September 1999 I think the Law Society has an utter hide, the way they have carried on in this case. They have a responsibility to clients. They have a responsibility to solicitors. There is no doubt at all in my mind that Mr Barlow was a solicitor. The Law Society is under a duty to all clients and society as a whole in this matter. I note Mr Bitel's comments: I'm amazed that ... the Law Society won't speak to the 7.30 Report. I would have thought that whenever a firm goes under-and they do from time to time-the Law Society's public relations department should at least come on line and assure the community that the Law Society is in control. I urge the minister for immigration to conduct an inquiry into this matter, especially the conduct of the New South Wales Law Society because the Law Society refuses to intervene in assisting those displaced clients and restore confidence in the legal profession. (Time expired) Dunkley Electorate: Frankston High School joined in the 75th anniversary celebration of Frankston High School. It was quite an experience for all involved, particularly as we look back over the history of Frankston High School, from its very early beginnings in the Masonic Hall in Young Street with 64 pupils, to the 1,500 students who gain a first-class education from Frankston High School, and the transition from ink wells to laptop computers, from simple woodwork models to a school that now constructs its own aeroplanes. A lot has happened at Frankston High School and there were plenty of good reasons for the celebration over the weekend. WhatI found most striking was the deep affection all those involved in the celebrations had for the school. The guest list read like a Who's Who of people that have come out of the Frankston community and made a very significant contribution to the nation more generally. Debbie Flintoff-King was there, and was delighted to have the sporting centre that has recently been completed at Frankston High School named in her honour. Also there were Graeme Horsburgh, Mary Evans and Heather Murray. Mary and Heather did terrific work in bringing together a history of the high school called Optima Semper, which means 'The best always' for those who have not done their Latin. It was a great occasion for all concerned. WhatI enjoyed most of all was seeing the interchange between Harry Carter, an ex-principal, and Stephen Fyfe, a year 7 student, as they compared the experiences of their different times at Frankston High School. A lot of other first-class young people at Frankston High School were involved in the celebrations. Michael Caridakis, Ricky Taylor and Arney Lee talked about what Frankston High School meant to them. Associate' Professor Anne Stonehouse, who is the school council president, also emphasised that the academic and sporting excellence that Frankston High School embodies is something they will continue to work to. The school has a terrific academic record. In 1998, the VCE pass rate was 99.3, with the highest university ranking at 99.55, and 83 per cent of students going on to tertiary education. The school has a strong music program; a laptop computer program, which is well recognised as a leading application of that technology in government schools; and a big international program where students travel to sister schools in Japan, France, and Soweto in South Africa. The school ventured into a new initiative in 1998 with the year 9 students studying aviation theory. This year that is going to the next step. The students are starting to build a two-seater Jabiru aeroplane for next year as well as obtaining a pilot's licence as part of their studies. There is a great deal of extracurricular activity. It is a first-class educational institution.",149,Representatives Main Committee
287,Mr Billson (Dunkley),"On the weekend of 27 to 29 August, the Frankston communityWednesday, 1 September 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 9691 Principal Ken Rowe, the school council and all those that have been involved in Frankston High School's development over the last 75 years deserve to be congratulated for their contribution to the Dunkley community. Industrial Relations: Employee Entitlements the government's so-called More Jobs, Better Pay legislation, and specifically the independent contractor provisions of the legislation, which take away a contractor's right to have an unfair contract addressed in the Federal Court. This leaves independent contractors shockingly exposed. I received a letter from the Victorian Forest Harvesting and Cartage Council. I share this letter with the chamber this morning for their benefit, because this area of the so-called More Jobs, Better Pay legislation has received very little attention. In part, the letter says: As you are probably aware, virtually all log harvesting and cartage in Victoria is done by individual contractors. These contractors usually carry a significant amount of debt on their machinery, often running over $500,000 and often the only job security they have is a verbal contract with the regional logging syndicates. These regional logging syndicates are owned by a handful of wealthy sawmillers who have been given a monopoly over logging in each region by the Kennett government. Since the introduction of these monopolies, there has been constant pressure to reduce harvesting and cartage rates, and those who object are threatened with the cancellation of their contract. In some cases, rates have been reduced by up to 15% and this is against a background of increased costs. There is a widespread view amongst contractors that this uncertainty and instability is a contributing factor to the high death rate in the industry. This view would seem to be logical-as rates and security are diminished, the pressure is on to work harder for less in a dangerous environment and this can only have one outcome. The only protection afforded these contractors has been the right to have their unfair contracts addressed in the Federal Court. The independent contractor provisions of the so-called ""More Jobs Better Pay"" legislation remove these protections entirely. In these circumstances Regional Forest Agreements are almost irrelevant. Resource security that delivers certainty only to a handful of wealthy sawmillers, is of little value to timber communities if those communities do not also share in that security. The way that this legislation is currently framed and the way that it applies to contractors, it should be called the ""No Jobs No Pay"" legislation. I think that the Victorian Forest Harvesting and Cartage Council have summed it up very well, and I think this points to Minister Wilson Tuckey's ineptitude in dealing with his portfolio area. He talks shrilly about how he is going to get resource security for the industry, and he holds up the RFA process as some sort of panacea for every problem confronting the industry. I tell you: it is not. His incompetence in dealing with and understanding the significance of this has also been shown by the fact that the CSIRO Forest Products Laboratory in Clayton, whilst he is the Minister for Forestry and Conservation, has just announced that they are going to cut half of the 83 jobs at the Clayton laboratory.

289,Mrs Gash (Gilmore),"TodayI am going to talk about the importance of the University9692 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, I September 1999 in tenns of relative earnings from research grants and its outstanding research and development partnerships with local and international business. The drain of talented young people from the country to the city does not happen because young people want to leave but because they have to. Distance education is available in some courses but brings its own difficulties and furthers the experience of isolation for students from rural and remote areas. There have been no opportunities to gain a first-class, hands-on university education in Ulladulla, Nowra, Moss Vale, Bundanoon, Jamberoo or Kiama. Even if our young people come back after completing their studies, very few employment opportunities currently exist within easy reach of their home towns. Eventually they have to move away to suitable jobs or to give up their vocations before their potential has in any way been realised and work in casual jobs during the tourist season to earn a living. This also has an impact: those who nonnally would have the seasonal jobs are pushed out of their only opportunities for work. However, now it is a different story. The University ofWollongong has maintained a campus at Graham Park at Berry for some time, and in January 2000-that is, in four months timethe campus at West Nowra will admit its first students. A further campus in the Southern Highlands is mooted for the following year, depending on decisions made by the local people. All of these will create opportunities to stem the flow of young people out of the area and encourage others to move here to work with them. Others who might come to join them include lecturers, professors, researchers and businesses in associated research and technology industries. Creating and running a university campus also means jobs for builders, landscapers, carpet layers, electricians, cleaners, security people, cooks, clerical assistance and maintenance crews. Then, of course, there are the businesses that sell their wares to these tradespeople. As you can see, the spiral continues and we have not yet counted the new salaries being spent in the region. This highlights the ability of the university to create jobs and to significantly and positively affect our local economies. I and the residents of Kiama, the Southern Highlands and the Shoalhaven look forward to working with the University of Wollongong in the future. At each campus we plan to develop a centre of excellence in research, specialising in an area of local interest and expertise. In this way, together with the University of Wollongong, we will seek to attract rather than lose rural and regional young people.

291,Mr Williams (Tangney,"Attorney-General) (10.06 a.m.)-I move:Wednesday, 1 September 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 9693 Prechelt. The effect of this decision is that customs duty would not be payable on goods that are not required to be formally entered for home consumption. In summary, the case involved the importation of 25 cartons of cigarettes with a customs value of $180. Under the current terms of the Customs Act, such goods are not required to be formally entered for home consumption. Instead, summary information in relation to such goods is required to be given to Customs in an approved form. Goods exempt from formal entry requirements include the personal effects of passengers and crew of ships and aircraft, goods of a value of less than $1,000 imported through the post, and goods of a value of less than $250 consigned otherwise than through the post. The Customs Act provides that the rate of any import duty payable on goods is the rate of duty in force when the goods are entered for home consumption. For the majority of importations, a formal import entry, which details between 50 and 60 items of information in relation to the goods, is required to be lodged with Customs either by document or by computer. Customs uses this information to assess the duty liability of the goods, and payment is required before they can be delivered for home consumption. As the goods the subject of the decision were exempt from the formal entry requirements, the court found that no rate of duty could be determined. As a rate of duty could not be fixed, the court went on to find that no duty was payable, despite the clear words of the Customs Tariff Act 1995 that impose duties of customs on goods imported into Australia. General application of the reasoning in the decision would mean that no customs duty is payable on imported goods for which no entry is required. This bill proposes amendments to the Customs Act to make it clear that duty must be paid on imported goods that do not require a formal entry before those goods can be delivered into home consumption. The amendments will also provide that the rate of duty is to be fixed at the time information in relation to the goods is given to Customs or the time when the goods were imported into Australia, whichever is the later. The amendments will take effect from 1 September 1992. This is the date when the import entry processing provisions of the Customs Act were completely rewritten to allow the electronic lodgement of entries via the COMPILE computer system. As part of that exercise, the replacement of a former provision that deemed goods delivered under similar permissions to be entered for home consumption was inadvertently overlooked. These amendments will confirm that the duty liability of non-entry goods imported during the intervening period was that which both the Commonwealth and importers had always understood it to be. They will impose no new duty liability on goods already imported into Australia. I commend the bill to the Main Committee and present the explanatory memorandum. loophole be closed through the Customs Amendment Bill (No.1) 1999 and it will facilitate the government in that regard. It is a matter of some regret that from time to time this parliament has to address issues which one might have thought would have been resolved by the courts in a more common sense manner. I think the Attorney, in his very gentle way, indicated a similar view that the decision was at least unpredictable. It may well be that this decision might have been reversed on appeal. Nonetheless, there have been a number of instances where the parliament has acted quickly to deal with such",152,Representatives Main Committee
292,Mr Kerr (Denison) (10.10 A.m.},"The opposition regards it as appropriate that this9694 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 1 September 1999 issues. I instance the case some little while ago in which it was alleged that delegations given to junior ministers to carry out the work of portfolio ministers were invalid. In the Federal Court, Mr Justice Spender held that that was not an appropriate and lawful way to operate, save in some restricted circumstances, and held that those restricted circumstances had not been then in effect. Obviously, the consequence would have been extreme. In that instance, we also facilitated legislation to deal with the issue quickly but, in any case, the original decision of Mr Justice Spender was overturned on appeal. In that instance at least the reason which drove the legislation was removed. Nonetheless, we well understood why the government took that course. Similarly, in this instance we understand why the government is taking this course rather than pursuing potential remedies by way of appeal and the like-notwithstanding that the likelihood of success, I believe, would be high, given the terms of the legislation that the Attorney has referred to. But it does allow us at least to indicate that there is an obligation on the courts to look at the purpose and intent of legislation and to facilitate that. There has been some backsliding by the courts from a process of examination of legislation from the point of view of giving some regard to the underlying policy intentions of the parliament as expressed through the second reading speeches and the general intention that can be inferred from the framework of the legislation. In this instance, it could hardly have been thought to be intended that the revenue would not be protected because the goods were able to be entered for home consumption without formal entry requirements. We are content to facilitate the closure of the loophole. When the government introduced this bill into the Senate it asserted that the amendments were intended to ensure that they reached back to goods imported since 1 September 1992, which was the circumstance that they asserted the Commonwealth and importers had always understood to operate. On that basis, I think it is fair to say that this legislation, whilst formally retrospective, in practice operates in a way which imposes no actual retrospectivity other than that which the community at large expect to be in operation. To close a fortuitous loophole does not seem to be anything other than sound housekeeping. It gives us the opportunity to indicate that the government obviously is looking at these revenue iS-J,lCs-and it would not be expected by the community to do otherwise. It would have opened up the real prospeCt of large amounts of product being imported under the value of $1 ,000 through the post or of goods to the value of $250 being consigned otherwise through the post. Within that range, cigarettes, which carry a high rate of duty, would have been the obvious goods which would have been brought in by that mechanism. Other goods could also have been brought in, but I think that cigarettes and perhaps alcohol and some perfumery would have been the obvious items that would have been the subject of abuse. However, when we look at this legislation, we can contrast the approach of the government, in quickly moving to address a revenue loophole, with its approach in some of the areas where it seems to be finding it rather more difficult to make the hard decisions that are necessary. One instance is the situation with Coastwatch. The government has announced a number of measures, which includes additional expenditure, but it still has not addressed, or had a substantial review of, the way in which the Commonwealth does business in relation to the management and protection of our coastline. Wednesday, 1 September 1999 MAIN COMMITIEE 9695 The surveillance and policing functions of the Commonwealth cover a whole range of agencies, not just Customs. It is also responsible for fisheries, quarantine and a whole range of other important matters. The Heggen and Max Moore-Wilton reviews focused almost exclusively on the issue of illegal immigration-I think to too great an extent. Whilst no-one denies that the problem of people smuggling is one which needs to be addressed and needs to have a much more substantial response given to it than the government has done hitherto, nonetheless, there is a whole range of other issues-including, not the least, the importation of drugs, quarantine issues, protection of fishery resources, economic interests and questions relating to the smuggling of wildlife-all of which were not addressed in any explicit terms by those reviews and which really still stand to be examined. There is no doubt, at least in the view of the opposition, that there is a widely held view in the community that the arrangements for the protection and surveillance of our coasts are far from adequate. I think a very disappointing feature of the report was that in a single line it dismissed the possibility of a more coordinated strategy, developing something in the nature of a coastguard service, of which many models have been developed in other nations. That opportunity went astray when the government was under pressure to bring down some response in relation to the number of incidences where boats had come undetected down the east coast of Australia. No-one doubts that that issue needed to be responded to, and responded to quickly, but there is another task yet to be undertaken. The government's dismissal of this, on what I thought to be an extremely superficial argument of more structural response, was very disappointing. Similarly, I think the government's approach to drugs with its Tough on Drugs strategy is an issue which the community is going to examine very closely. There is no doubt that the benchmark for success, that the Minister for Justice and Customs has asserted, of the Tough on Drugs strategy will be measured in terms of positive impacts on supply reduction, demand reduction and harm minimisation. There is very real doubt that the initiative is having the success that was forecast for it. The Families and Friends for Drug Law Reform recently issued a report card on the Tough on Drugs strategy, and they said what we have been saying ever since the Prime Minister launched this strategy: the government's approach has failed, and will continue to fail, to achieve positive outcomes in any of these areas which the minister has identified. The price of drugs is, if anything, reducing. Certainly, no-one contends that it has increased as a result of supply reduction, and availability is increasing-as, indeed, is purity. Drug use related deaths are rising. The Prime Minister's promised leadership in the area of drug law reform has consisted of using some language which picks up the concept of harm minimisation but which essentially, when you look at it, is evolving along the lines of the approach in the United States. It really is time for the government to admit that a zero tolerance approach to illicit drugs has been, and will continue to be, a dismal failure. I draw his attention to the fact that most of the things that he has been talking about for the last several minutes are not related to the bill. from the legislation. I was simply making the point that we seek to be constructive in opposition and to facilitate the passage of this legislation. It is sound legislation.

294,Mr Kerr,"I grant that you are correct, Mr Deputy Speaker, that they do not arise directly9696 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday,1 September 1999 this legislation arises, where we believe inadequate attention has been given by the government. More specifically, if I might be critical in relation to customs processing issues-again, you might say, not immediately relevant to the terms of this bill, but nonetheless relating to what customs agents and how Customs itself operates--I ask the Attorney-General to convey to his ministerial counterpart a concern we have heard recently from constituents who are not happy with the way that customs agents are presently operating. Thf' problem is that customs agents operate on a basis whereby any liability that emerges for duties payable or penalties payable attaches to the importer, and, by law, importers cannot facilitate customs processing on their own. They must use a customs agent. It seems that customs agents are not regularly accessing the Customs database for tracking changes to regulations and keeping up to date. That means that from time to time they are making errors when declaring goods which they are bringing into the country in relation to their importer clients. One of the consequences is that the importer then becomes liable for penalties associated with the errors made by these customs agents. I am certain this issue has been brought to the attention of the government. It is an important one because, if you are by law obliged to use a customs agent, and then you are attached with the consequences of that customs agent making a mistake in relation to the rapidly changing legal environment, then there is a considerable degree of disquiet. It is a matter that needs attention. Perhaps there needs to be some examination of how agents can be better brought to understand their obligations. There does seem to be a large number of perhaps inadequately trained customs agents processing these matters, particularly as staff of licensed agents. It is not a situation which will do the reputation of the department good, if people find that this issue continues. When you have a system which does not allow people to process their own goods through the customs barrier but, rather, requires them to use the services of others, and if as a result of that they find themselves attached with some liability, you can imagine that this is not something that they feel particularly happy about. The mechanisms for redress are quite limited. With your indulgence, Mr Deputy Speaker, I appreciate that my comments have been slightly outside the formal terms of the legislation but I think that in an opportunity in the Main Committee there is some flexibility for us to explore some of the issues that need attention. Having made those three brief side points on the legislation at hand, which we are content to assist the passage of, I would be grateful if the Attorney would pass those concerns to the Minister for Justice and Customs. I am certain that those concerns in relation to importers would have already been drawn to her attention, because much of the correspondence that we have received has been copied or directed initially to the minister. But I would appreciate it if the opportunity were taken today as well. The opposition is quite content to address the issues raised by the Prechelt case to ensure that a loophole which was potentially open, and which would have required the process of an appeal to redress, is closed by legislation. We are content that, in practice, it is not retrospective legislation. We support the Attorney's introduction of this legislation and its passage through the House and we will support it in the Senate. opposition's assistance in dealing with this matter. After all, it is all about protecting revenue of the Commonwealth from the risk that importers of certain high duty items or commodities",155,Representatives Main Commitiee
295,Mr Hardgrave (Moreton) (10.26 A.m.),"I am sure the government welcomes theWednesday,l September 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 9697 will change their importing practices to try and take advantage of this legislative loophole that has been around as a result of an oversight in the drafting of the 1992 amendments to the Customs Act. The effect of this Customs Amendment Bill (No.1) 1999 will be to deal in a retrospective way, but at no additional cost to those involved in this industry, so that all the money collected as duty between 1 September 1992 and the date that this bill receives royal assent can be treated as having been properly collected under the act. What we literally could have seen, if we had not dealt with what the member for Denison described as a housekeeping item, was a circumstance where plane loads of personally addressed cartons of cigarettes could have been arriving here and people could have essentially been avoiding some of the duty. If you were to look at a standard carton of 200 cigarettes, the current approximate value and duty liability stands at a customs value of $10 and a duty liability of $50. If 20 cartons were imported as a low value consignment without entry requirements under the current paragraph 68(l)(f), that would carry a duty liability of approximately $1,000. If a plane arrived with 400 such consignments, the simple mathematics would be understood: if each of those assignments were ordered by and addressed to a separate individual-literally, 400 by 1,000--$400,000 in customs duty would be at risk. We were not about to see, I suspect, an underground movement to bring this about-but given human nature, when a loophole presents itself, one never quite knows exactly. It is probably the duty of every taxpayer to avoid paying too much tax, so, in a sense, a legitimate use of the unintended loophole would have proceeded. So it is a housekeeping matter, certainly. It is a matter that alsemphasises that customs officials of the government have always had this traditional revenue collection role. When you see the word 'customs' you normally would think of tax. It is a payment of a duty, a tax, and it is a measure which government uses directly to create revenue. This protects the national revenue--that is what this measure is about. I will address a couple of the matters that the member for Denison did introduce into this debate. I think it legitimately is hinged into this bill in that the other role of customs officials is as border protectors, dealing with the interdiction of illegal narcotics and illegal migrants into this country. Those people who are plying the trade of human misery-the importation of illegal drugs and illegal migrants into this country-tend to be the same people. They tend to be the same syndicates who are organising themselves in such a way that they are able to use their little boats to land drugs and people along our shore. If the land based version of the Collins class submarine--the Jindalee over-the-horizon radar network-were actually operating, it might have addressed a lot of the concerns of average Australians about how secure our coastline is to these breaches of our national integrity. I am confident that, once we do have an effective radar system operating in that regard, we will be able to even more effectively watch the movement of craft bringing illegal narcotics and illegal migrants into this country. However, more money has been put into that Coastwatch area by the government to try to.offer an additional set of sea craft and aircraft for the greater confidence of the average Australian. Most of the illegal narcotics that come into Australia are coming through areas that are dealt with by the Customs department on an everyday basis, including our airports. The port of Botany would probably be the key place for heavy narcotics coming into this country. The fact that there is a great volume of items that comes through that port provides in itself ready 9698 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday,1 September 1999 cover for those who want to bring illegal substances-items that are never even going to be subject to duty but are illegal for other reasons-through that particular port. This bill is all about dealing with a housekeeping matter and taking away an item of administrative concern-an item that would perhaps keep Customs officials from performing the second half of their job, that is, as border controllers protecting the integrity of this nation. One of the downsides of having a strongly performing economy, as we have here--the world's best economy and certainly the region's best economy-is that our poorer neighbours, particularly to the north, are finding that there is greater return on the investment of their time, energy and money in certain agriCUltural efforts-growing more drugs. If there is a decrease in the cost of drugs at street level, as the member for Denison suggested, that would go hand in glove with the fact that there are a lot more desperate people from some of the countries to our north trying to tum a dollar and providing drugs at an even lower price than they had been doing in the past. The big concern for us as a nation is that, if drugs are cheaper, the chances are that those who, because of their own marginal utility, may not have purchased drugs in the past will be tempted to try them. We may actually be creating a greater class of drug users, and that would be of great concern to everyone in this place. The work of Customs officials and their ongoing coordinated efforts with the National Crime Authority, the Federal Police and state authorities are even more important. That also makes this bill important, because to delay these simple arrangements would delay the fight against drugs. I submit that the government has undertaken a very balanced approach in this area. The use of a number of new physical facilities that have been afforded to the Customs department to look at some of the containers that are coming into this country on a more regular basis can only lead to further advances. In a week or two, I am going to be in Miami, Florida, and will be talking to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms people, Customs people, the FBI and the US. Coast Guard about some of the measures they are taking in a similar capacity. I will be particularly interested to have a look at the large mobile truck X-ray unit and gamma ray container cargo inspection site that is in the Miami area. This will be an educative process for me as a member of both this place and the National Crime Authority's parliamentary oversight committee. There is a lot to be learnt from overseas, but I also applaud the efforts of Customs officials, on behalf of the government and on behalf of the people of Australia, for their dedication to the task of trying to stop the flow of drugs into this country. It is a battle that, in one sense, we will never quite win. I have spoken to a lot of people in my electorate about this at Neighbourhood Watch meetings, and everyone believes that, unless we attempt to take this head on, we will be letting the side down completely. The bill before us deals with basic housekeeping stuff but it does give me an opportunity particularly to reflect upon the member for Denison's concerns to remark that I think the government and the Customs Service in particular along with the other authorities are doing a tremendous job. The government's commitment to fight the importation of drugs and the use of drugs in our community is a strong one and second to none in previous governments. The loss of human potential as people take up drugs, essentially flying their brains and ruining their possibilities, is something we need to watch; it is something that this country cannot survive. It is far in advance of the loss of revenue that might have occurred if we had not Wednesday, 1 September 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 9699 closed this particular loophole. It has been closed as a result of this bill. I commend the bill to the House. for Denison and Moreton for their support of the Customs Amendment Bill (No.1) 1999. The member for Denison raised in the context of the second reading debate of the bill the subject of Coastwatch, Tough on Drugs and, as I understood it, an issue relating to the liability of an importer for the actions of a customs broker. He did not refer to the relevance of the first point. He said of the second that it was not directly relevant. I submit it is not relevant-either indirectly or at all. He said of the third that it was not immediately relevant. I would say that it is not even remotely relevant. It is not relevant at all to the subject of the debate. I will not add to the answer given in respect of the first two items by the member for Moreton. I would simply say that I am sure that the matters will in due course be drawn to the attention of the Minister for Justice and Customs. In respect of the third point, I briefly respond to say that I am advised that it is not correct that an importer is obliged to process their goods through a broker. They can do it themselves. But I will ensure that the matter is raised with the Minister for Justice and Customs. If she has the correspondence referred to by the member for Denison, I am sure it has already been drawn to her attention. The only other matter that I wanted to refer to is the question of retrospectivity mentioned by the member for Denison. This was actually the subject of a report by the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills. The minister responded to that-an extract of the response being published in the Scrutiny of Bills 12th report of 1999. The minister advised the committee in effect that the retrospective operation of these amendments does apply to the facts of the Prechelt case but in order to be able to collect the duty that was in fact payable on the consignment of cigarettes-the subject of the decisionthe Chief Executive Officer of Customs must demand the payment of duty short paid within 12 months of the short payment. The minister advised that the CEO does not intend to exercise his discretion after the passage of the bill in a way that will reverse the outcome of the court's decision in the Prechelt case. The minister also advised the committee that there is no other litigation pending as a result of the Prechelt decision that might be affected by the retrospective operation of these amendments. The committee itself noted that, since the CEO of Customs does not intend to use the retrospective application of this bill to reverse the outcome of the Prechelt case and there is no other litigation pending as a result of that decision, it does not propose to make any further comments. I commend the bill to the Main Committee. Question resolved in the affinnative. Bill read a second time. Ordered that the bill be reported to the House without amendment.

297,Mr Williams (Tangney,"Attomey-General) (10.39 a.m.}-I move:9700 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday,1 September 1999 This bill amends the temporary importation provisions of the Customs Act 1901 to address two aspects of their operation in relation to goods imported for the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games, Paralympic Games and a number of other related events. First, the bill sets 31 December 2000 as the last date that goods temporarily imported for the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games can be exported. Second, it requires lodgement of a formal application for a temporary importation permission if goods are not accompanied by standard internationally accepted temporary admission papers. The current maximum period allowed before re-exportation under a temporary importation permission is 12 months, subject to case by case extensions. This time limit places an administrative burden on industry and Customs in applying for and processing extensions for goods imported for use at more than one of the specified events, many of which are already taking place. On the other hand, as none of the eligible events occur after December 2000, there is no need for any of the goods to remain in Australia after 31 December 2000. This bill introduces a set date of 31 December 2000 as the final date for exportation of goods imported temporarily for the purposes of the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games, the Paralympic Games and other related events. This date will apply whether the relevant permission was granted before or after the commencement of the amendment, but it is capable of being extended if, for example, genuine difficulties are encountered in arranging suitable transport within the time limit for some specialist equipment. The second aspect of the temporary importation provisions which this bill addresses relates to Customs' ability to require information in relation to those goods temporarily imported. This is in order to maintain an appropriate audit trail and to ensure compliance with temporary importation provisions. Generally, temporary importation permissions are granted to goods imported in accordance with the terms of international agreements on temporary importation. Eligible goods covered by agreements that Australia is a signatory to currently include motor vehicles used by private travellers, media equipment and goods for display at fairs and exhibitions. In most cases, the goods are covered by temporary admission papers known as 'camets' that are issued by sponsoring organisations and take the place of formal customs import and export documents. As the current temporary importation provisions were designed with camets in mind, goods are exempted from formal import and export entry requirements. This exemption from formal entry, however, also applies to goods imported temporarily for the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games, the Paralympic Games and certain related events-as well as some goods under international agreements---despite the fact that they may not be accompanied by temporary admission papers. Customs currently has no legislative basis to require information to be provided in relation to these goods. This bill introduces a requirement to lodge a formal application---either by document or computer-to import goods not accompanied by temporary admission papers. This will improve the Customs audit trail, assist in the acquittal of import permissions against export information and ensure compliance with temporary importation conditions. I commend the bill to the Main Committee and present the explanatory memorandum to the bill. 1999 proposes to amend the Customs Act to provide that customs duty will not be payable on goods imported on a temporary basis for use in the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games, the",159,Representatives Main Committee
298,Mr Kerr (Denison) (10.43 A.m.},"The Customs Amendment (Temporary Importation) BillWednesday, 1 September 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 9701 Para1ympic Games, certain events in the Sydney Cultural Olympics and a number of events in the lead-up to the Olympics. The intention is that no duty is payable on these goods on the proviso that the goods are exported by the end of the year 2000. A regulation to this extent has already been made. The bill essentially is giving legislative support to the regulatory arrangements. The goods that will be covered by this provision are the vast amounts of infrastructure items such as desks, tents and chairs which will be and, in some cases, have already been brought in by SOCOG. Also covered will be motor vehicles, telecast technology and other goods which will be imported specifically for use in relation to the Olympics and related events and which will be exported again once these events are completed. Duty will become payable if the goods are used in contravention of the regulations-that is, for example, for a purpose other than one related to the Olympics or associated events or if the goods are not re-exported before 31 December 2000, unless there is a grant of an extension of time of the nature that the Attorney-General indicated. The opposition is willing to support these provisions. It does have some concerns. These are largely in relation to the issue of whether the government pursued with sufficient rigour the question of the provision of this infrastructure from Australian sourcing. The understanding I have from briefings we have received is that a very large amount of infrastructure material in the arrangements for the Olympics is going to be provided from overseas sources and reexported. That includes items which are manufactured in Australia. It does trouble the opposition that so much of this material will be brought in and out under these arrangements when perhaps, with a little more creative endeavour from the national government, better programs could have been put in place to ensure that this material was sourced from Australian manufacturers or Australian providers of services. It is a point that does require examination. We appreciate that the arrangements for the Olympics are not solely under the control of the national government. They involve the International Olympics Committee and the arrangements put in place by the New South Wales government, the City of Sydney and particularly as its legislation is required for measures such as this. Much of the material that is going to be re-exported at the end of the Olympics could perhaps have been supplied for a reasonable cost by Australian manufacturers. It is an issue which I do not imagine the Attorney-General would be able to respond to today-although I would be grateful for a response if he is briefed on this matter and is able to do so. Nonetheless, it is an issue which leads us, whilst supporting the legislation as proper and necessary to the running of the Olympics, to raise the fact that it seems to be covering a wider range of material being brought in and out of the country to support the Olympics than one would have strictly thought necessary. There are some technical provisions in relation to this legislation. An audit trail will be required as the goods come into Australia to ensure that they are not left behind after the Olympics. The bill provides Customs with the power to demand inform!ltion relating to the goods. Owners of the goods must also notify Customs of their intention to export the goods without entry documentation so that Customs has a complete record of movements of the goods. The bill will reduce the administrative complexity involved in large numbers of goods being temporarily imported into Australia for the Olympics and related events. It will ensure 9702 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday,1 September 1999 that Customs is able to track these goods and prevent them from illegally entering a domestic market. Whilst we support this measure, it is an interesting question as to whether or not the government could look at initiatives to improve the efficiency and solve the administrative problems relating to the system that the Attorney-General referred to as the camet system, which goes to existing arrangements for the temporary import and export of goods, usually by travellers or short-term occupants who come to Australia. The arrangements put forward here might have broader applications, provided they were properly monitored and supervised, as no doubt they will be for the period of the Olympics. The other issue I should raise is the resourcing of Customs. I understand Customs has been provided with $6.6 million to provide additional resources for the Olympic period. I am not certain that the $6.6 million will be enough to ensure that the department has the ability to undertake all the tasks that will be required for the period of the Olympics. There is no doubt that Customs will be heavily tasked by the increased flow of traffic from the Olympics, the Paralympics, the Sydney Cultural Olympics and the increased tourism generated by these events. Reports are that all leave for Customs employees has been cancelled for the Olympic period and the periods just before and just after it. There have also been suggestions that Customs officials from all over Australia will be brought to Sydney to help the agency cope with this increased workload and that these extra officials will be billeted with officials who reside in Sydney. I am not certain whether those arrangements will be satisfactory. I am concerned also-and I imagine the community as a whole is concerned-that the increased focus which is inevitable during the Olympics should not lead to weaknesses in the system of Customs in other parts of its jurisdiction, at a time when its resources will be heavily stretched in the New South Wales or Sydney environs. The other work of Customs has to proceed whilst the Olympics are ongoing. I am not certain that $6.6 million of additional funding will adequately resource that. It would concern the community if, at a time when inevitably we have to focus much of the resources available to the national government on Customs in Sydney and on those travelling to and from those events, we were caught short in some other part of the system. Also, we ought not to find ourselves in a situation where people are expected to put up with inadequate arrangements. I appreciate that accommodation in Sydney will be short during that time, but, if officers of Customs are required to provide billeting facilities for fellow officers, that is a big call. It would be useful for us to have some understanding of what measures the government is putting in place to ensure that this does not place an improper strain on the service in other parts of the country or raise a personnel issue in relation to the support of those officers who are brought to Sydney, if accommodation is so stretched that the normal arrangements when public servants are transferred from city to city cannot be put in place. With those remarks, we are willing to support this legislation. We do not do so with any particular enthusiasm, because for all the goods that come in that are not manufactured in Australia obviously manufacturing opportunities are lost to those who could have undertaken the work and enterprise here. But we do accept that, for an event of such a dimension, inevitably there is going to be some material that needs to be brought in. We accept also that we have some international obligations in respect of the Olympics. It is part of the arrangements, I think, that go with becoming a host city for the Olympics that special Wednesday, 1 September 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 9703 arrangements are put in place in relation to transactions such as travel arrangements and the import and export of goods. Some of those other arrangements have been facilitated already. We have been willing to assist in the protection of Olympic intellectual property, particularly trademarks in relation to the Olympics. We accept that we have an obligation to assist with the passage of this legislation. We are not seeking to carp in relation to the questions we have raised about the fact that so much of this material could potentially have been sourced in Australia. I imagine that anybody looking at the position now, about a year out from the Olympics, would be concerned to know how much of this material which is being brought in could have instead been manufactured in this country. Nonetheless, on balance, failure to pass this legislation would create far greater problems than if we were to seek to address those issues now. The time for dealing with those matters has well and truly passed and arrangements are on foot now which are required to be completed. So, it would not only be churlish, it would be counterproductive for the opposition not to support these particular measures. We do so on that basis. for Denison and the opposition for their support, albeit qualified and equivocal, for the Customs Amendment (Temporary Importation) Bill 1999. There were a couple of matters raised to which I propose to briefly respond. The first related to the sourcing of infrastructure from Australia. The member for Denison regrets the fact that more of the goods that were to be acquired by SOCOG, or others, for the Olympic Games and related events were not sourced from within Australia. I am advised that the relevant tenders were normal commercial tenders which were open to Australian companies. In fact, a number were won by Australian companies that then sourced the goods from overseas. An example I have been given concerns a tender for uniforms. It was won by an Australian company which then supplied material from Australia for fabrication in Fiji. There is more than one issue involved in this. The cost effectiveness of the tendering process is obviously relevant as well. In relation to the personnel deployment of Customs in and around the Olympic Games time, I am advised that there will be, at most, minimal movement of staff to Sydney from elsewhere, if there is to be any at all. Customs has brought forward recruiting of staff to cater for the additional demand so there will, in effect, be advance appointments to assist at the time when pressure is likely to be on. Planning is based upon the non day-to-day activities to supplement border activities. The bill seems to have the support of both sides of the Main Committee. I commend the bill to the Main Committee and to the House. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time.

299,Mr Williams (Tangney,"Attorney-General) (10.55 a.m.}-in reply-I thank the member9704 MAIN COMMITIEE Wednesday,1 September 1999 to comment on the recommendations of the report of the Joint Select Committee on the Retailing Sector. That committee spent some nine months investigating the dominance of the major chains in the retail market and the impact that dominance has on the small and independent sector. Labor, of course, was the first party to commit itself to such an inquiry prior to the last federal election, and the Liberals subsequently followed, reluctantly. After the election, I must say the government was somewhat reluctant to meet its pre-election commitment and some time passed before the committee was actually established and the inquiry got under way. I am happy to acknowledge the work of Senator Boswell and former Senator O'Chee in terms of the way they placed pressure on the government to put this inquiry in place. Labor supports the recommendations of the committee. We worked very hard. We put forward quite a deal of compromise to ensure that the recommendations of the committee enjoyed unanimous support of committee members, and we put maximum pressure on the . government to move quickly to adopt the recommendations. To those who say that the committee has not been effective, I simply say that the recommendations do have teeth. The mandatory code, which will deal with relationships between all the players in the sector including consumers, retailers, wholesalers and suppliers of goods-including farmers, of course-will be mandated under the Trade Practices Act and will therefore have the full force of the Trade Practices Act. The Ombudsman will be fully independent of all industry players if the government agrees to the committee's recommendation and funds that position independently. The ability of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to take representative action on behalf of injured small and independent players is very significant. It was a recommendation which first flowed from the Reid committee but unfortunately was not picked up by the government. It is one which will deliver for the first time an opportunity to people who have been victims of bigger players misusing their market power to be recompensed for any economic loss. The recommendations include mandatory notification of acquisitions of small and independent players by the big chains and mandatory notification to the ACCC of acquisitions by retailers of wholesalers and vice versa. One of the most significant recommendations is the last recommendation, and that is the one that puts the major chains on notice that we want to review the situation-the market, the industry-in three years time with a view to checking on the success of our recommendations and making further recommendations if the recommendations we have already made have not achieved their aims. I think that is a very clear notice to the major chains that we are serious about addressing this issue which is causing very deep concern in the community, in particular in regional communities where the concentration of the big chains has led to a dramatic decline in small and independent businesses and therefore a decline in the basic infrastructure that makes up some of those communities. It was an interesting inquiry. I think committee members learnt very quickly from the outset that, with respect to the growth in the dominance of the major chains, consumers are voting with their feet. It was also very clear that, as a result of that intense competition amongst the large chains, food prices over the last decade or so have dramatically declined. I twa s important that the committee got the balance right between the interests of the small and",163,Representatives Main Committee
300,Mr Fitzgibbon (Hunter) (10.58 A.m.),"It is a great pleasure to have the opportunityWednesday, 1 September 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 9705 independent sector and the interests of the major chains, but just as important were the interests of the consumer. I think that posed a very great challenge to the committee members. One of the great forces behind the establishment of the committee was NARGA, the National Association of Retail Grocers of Australia. Their proposition was that we cap the major chains in terms of their presence within the sector. Whilst that might seem very tempting in the first instance, it was very clear throughout the course of the inquiry, when we heard from market analysts, the big chains themselves and consumer organisations, that that would be a retrograde step. Not only would it impact upon consumers in terms of what it might do to competition in the market, not only might it impact upon Australian shareholders with an interest in the major chains, but it might be counterproductive for those with small and independent stores who actually have an interest in selling or taking up an offer from a large chain to purchase their store. Things are not always as simple as they seem. These are complex issues. I am a little disappointed that the committee spent so much of its time dealing with what I describe as a war between the three major chains and all those banner stores that fall under the umbrella of Davids Holdings, their wholesaler. I think we could have spent a lot more time dealing with the corner butcher shop, the florist, the greengrocer, the small clothing store, the candlestick maker or whatever it may be in regional communities. They provide the real impetus for community concern about the small business sector. I do not think the community generally really cares about the war between Woolworths, Coles, Franklins and those that fall under the banner of Davids. Many of those retail banner stores are as large as the retail chain store. WhatI think people do care passionately about is the CBD infrastructure of local towns, and of course that infrastructure is very largely made up of the local butcher store, et cetera. But that was somewhat outside of our control, because, throughout the inquiry, the sheer weight of submissions kept our focus on the war between the big chains and the banner stores, and it was very difficult to shift the focus. Many of the submissions that did come from very small players related very much to competition policy. Of course, competition policy was outside our terms of reference and not a matter we were able to deal with directly. At every opportunity, I recommended to the government that it look at the impact of national competition policy in rural and regional Australia to see whether, in some aspects, we might be getting some counterproductive results. I think that it was a very helpful inquiry. From the opposition's perspective, it was an inquiry which will provide a great deal of infonnation as we approach the next federal election in tenns of our policy development process. A lot of good infonnation came from market analysts, lobby groups and the chains themselves about the nature of the industry, where it is heading and how changes in the industry are impacting upon consumers, particularly consumers in rural and regional Australia. The committee members worked very well together. We all went into it with common aims and objectives and with a shared concern about small business, particularly small business in rural and regional Australia. I thank the secretary of the committee, Andrea Griffiths, and her staff, who did an enormous job. I think it is fair to say that we were a very demanding committee-in our desire to seek further infonnation on a range of issues and to travel widely. Early in the inquiry, because of the logistics of travelling so far and because of time constraints, there was a view that we might go only to capital cities, but I insisted that the committee should go to rural and regional Australia, particularly. That of course put an additional heavy burden not only on committee 9706 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, I September 1999 members but on those who were charged with keeping us tidy, driving the agenda and producing the submissions and the reports. Again, to those who say that the committee has been somewhat ineffective, I say that that is not true. These recommendations, including one that I did not mention-that is, an amendment to section 50, which will include the word 'regional' in terms of what is a market for the merger provisions-give a very clear signal and message to the ACCC and to the wider community that we recognise that markets are not just markets and that how a merger impacts upon a metropolitan market might be very different from the way it impacts upon a market in rural and regional Australia. We all had a shared interest, and I am delighted that we were able to reach unanimity on the recommendations. I say to the government, 'With the Reid committee you had the opportunity to pick up on representative actions and to pursue, for the first time, an effective national retail tenancy code. You dropped the ball in both instances.' We now present those to you again, and we ask you to reconsider them very keenly. We cannot now afford to have this committee document gather dust. The recommendations do have teeth. They are biased in the interest of the small and independent sector in order to give them a chance. I said from the beginning of the inquiry that it is quite clear, because of the complexity of these issues, that we should not be about reconstructing the playing field, but rather we should be about ensuring that all those playing on the field are playing fairly. The small and independent sector faces enough challenges dealing with the sheer purchasing power and economies of scale enjoyed by the major chains. What they cannot afford to be competing against in addition to that is misuse of market power. So what we have attempted to do is strengthen the Trade Practices Act to ensure that in the future, in all instances, the major chains are playing fairly. I thought it was very interesting that the boss of W oolworths, Roger Corbett, was prepared to appear before committee members early in the inquiry and admit that, while Woolworths does not seek to misuse its market power, he could not ensure that in every instance, in every store around the country, one of his overenthusiastic and ambitious managers was not misusing that power, in particular in the area of predatory pricing. That, to me, was an extraordinary admission. I say to the major chains: you have the resources, the technique, the money and the ability to ensure that all your managers, no matter where they are in this nation, are doing the right thing. The mandatory code will place down the markers for that behaviour and, on that basis, with the weight of the Trade Practices Act, I am very confident that that will ensure a much fairer game in the future. Indeed, throughout the course of the inquiry, we have already seen a change in the attitude of the major chains. I think that they were generally fearful of what may have come out of the inquiry, and that has already caused them to pick up their game. Of course, that last recommendation which I referred to is symbolic of a very big stick hanging over their heads for the next three years. I am very confident that that very big stick will cause them to behave themselves and to act in the interests of not only the Australian consumer but also the small and independent sector. I commend the recommendations to the House. I commend them to the government, and I call upon the government to act on them very quickly in the same spirit we enjoyed as a committee. honourable member for Hunter in regard to the recommendations and other aspects of the",164,Representatives Main Commitiee
301,Mr Nairn (Eden,"Monaro) (11.12 a.m.)-I would like to support the comments of theWednesday, 1 September 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 9707 report from this inquiry by the Joint Select Committee on the Retailing Sector. I found it a fascinating inquiry and a very good committee to work with. We did a lot of work over a short period of time. Unfortunately, it is one of the aspects of parliament which do not get publicised enough, and that is why I will say something about it now. The workings of some of these committees and the particular cooperation that occurs between members of parliament to get the best possible result for the overall community are probably, as I said, not publicised enough. This committee is a good example of where members from the Labor Party, the Liberal Party, the National Party and the Democrats all worked extremely well together. We all had a common goal in mind, with everybody taking a very pragmatic view and throwing around the issues in great discussions. The parliament is the better for those sorts of inquiries and those workings of the committee. It would be wonderful if we could get the message out to the greater public a little more as to how we do cooperate to get the best result-probably more often than not. But all they see is the adversarial aspect, unfortunately, and so the greater public thinks that that is the only part. We titled this report Fair market or market failure, which was really the crux of the issue. We wanted to make sure that there was a fair market out there and that market failure was not occurring. We went into this inquiry with a lot of anecdotal evidence and a lot of comment that probably was not able to be stacked up as high as a lot of people thought it would be when we really got to the nub of the issue, although I would also say that there were probably many people who were not prepared to come to the committee and give some information that would have helped. Some people were concerned about their particular business and whether it would impact on their business if they provided some information. But we did get a lot of information and we also took quite a bit of evidence in camera which helped the committee understand exactly how the marketplace works and the retail sector works behind the scenes, which was very useful. The reason the inquiry took place was the growth of the major chains. There was pressure on all parts of the parliament to have a look at this and to say whether this was good or not. It is fair to say that a lot of the growth of the major chains has taken place through the appearance of major shopping centres over the last couple of decades. We have moved away from the main street separate shops and gone into this major supermarket issue where eventually you see developers encouraging a major chain to establish in their complex, that then acts as the attraction for lots of people and, therefore, smaller shops tag along as well. That has been a phenomenon that has been happening for some time. When you throw in deregulated trading hours as well, that has been the crux of what has occurred in the retail sector and the reason the chains have grown to the size that they have in the time that they have. A lot of those matters are matters for state governments and local planning authorities-the issues of location of shopping centres and trading hours, et cetera. Although we do not have the power federally, it is an aspect that did come through in this report. I would hope that, in the future, local councils do look at some of these issues a bit more closely than they may have in the past, and at the effect of allowing new shopping centres to be developed often on the outskirts of town which takes the people away from some of the main streets. I am not so sure that that is actually going to continue as much, because I am seeing a slight change in people's shopping habits, and there could in fact be a reversal of those types of complexes. 9708 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday,1 September 1999 Consumer demand has contributed to this rapid growth as well, with people wanting the onestop shop and being able to get a very large variety of goods all in the one place. So the major chains would argue, and I think quite rightly, that they have been providing a product that the consumer wants. If it is being done in a way that is fair competition, then that is probably good if the consumer thinks that is great. The concern that we had was that if the chains get to a point such that they can use their market power to dictate to the consumer what they will be given and then, ultimately, at a price which is not competitive, then that is when you have market failure. I do not think we have got to that point, even though there are some irregularities. The strong argument put to us was for a market cap. Once again, as the member for Hunter said, that superficially looks attractive. But when you start to look at how you implement that it is a different matter, particularly if you go along the line that was put forward of capping the majors to 75 per cent of the market overall. That is saying you can have three majors at 25 per cent each. Or you could say that one should not have any more than 25 per cent, and then you open it up for having four major stores at 25 per cent each, which goes against what is required. It also brings in train the problem of how you achieve that and how you defme what that market share is at anyone time. Certainly, you would have a situation where Woolworths, for instance, would have ultimately to divest themselves of almost a third of their stores. Woolworths is owned by 200,000 to 300,000 shareholders, predominantly individual Australians. You would probably see a rapid drop in their shares and you would probably see a rapid growth in the shares of Franklins because Franklins currently only have about 14 or 16 per cent of the market. They would be able to grow and they are in a position to grow rapidly. Most of the shareholding in Franklins is actually in Hong Kong. You would be having a very negative effect on many Australians. I think it is an interference in the market which really would not achieve a great deal in the long term anyway. We saw that strengthening the Trade Practices Act was a far better way to go than a cap, which I think would be very draconian and would not achieve the result required in the long term. There are two things we put in which I think will have a very good effect on this. One is the mandatory notification whereby stores buying an independent would be required to notify the ACCC that they were acquiring it. The other is the change to section 50 of the Trade Practices Act to include regional areas when we talk about market share. Currently, the ACCC, if it is looking at market power and domination, would have to look at the share of a major within a state. Some additional purchases of an independent in one part of a state would not seem to be a big deal as far as the market is concerned but, if you look at that little region on its own, that one purchase could provide a situation where the competition could disappear. If the change had been made to give the ACCC the opportunity to do that in the last couple of years, I am very confident that we would not have had the situation that occurred in Cooma and Batemans Bay in my electorate. There are currently two Woolworths stores in both of those towns. If this sort of test had been in place, I am sure the ACCC would have insisted Woolworths divest themselves of one store in Cooma when they took over Cannons because the ACCC would have been able to specifically look at the regional impact on competition. Similarly, in Batemans Bay, the two major supermarkets are both Woolworths stores. That is what, in a regional sense, we want to prevent. I think these changes will do that. Wednesday, 1 September 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 9709 The other aspect that came through very much in the hearings was in relation to competition and where fierce competition stops and predatory pricing starts. Once again, this is very difficult to get concrete information about but the committee was fairly convinced that those sorts of practices do go on. I think the code of conduct that we have recommended and a retail ombudsman are the way to overcome many of those problems. I think having somebody there specifically to look after the little guy and to be able to get in and talk to them early on will put a lot of pressure on the larger stores to convince them that they should not look at a process whereby they are virtually using predatory pricing to push somebody out. It is true to say that strong competition has in fact worked in favour of the consumer. We certainly had evidence of a reduction in the price of groceries over the last 10 or 15 years as a result of strong competition between Woolworths, Coles, Franklins and the independents. We want to make sure that that continues. The regional hearings that we held were very useful to the committee. We did them all in a four-day period. We were able to use a government plane to get to many regional areas in a short period. I found that that sort of concentration of information in four days was very useful to really understand what was happening out in regional Australia. We went to regional Tasmania, regional Victoria, regional New South Wales and regional Queensland in a four-day period. I think all the members of the committee found that very strong concentration of evidence in that period really helped us get a handle on what was happening out in regional Australia. I was certainly pleased that one of the places we went to was Cooma, in my electorate, where we took some excellent evidence. I think all the committee agreed with me on that. We had a very good cross-section of people giving evidence at Cooma, which helped us understand just what is happening. I would certainly like to thank Peter Wilson, who is a store owner at Adaminaby, a little town out from Cooma, and who is very innovative. A lot of the small independents could learn a lot from Peter and his father as to what little stores can do. They have been quite innovative in how they are doing things: they are a mini-distribution centre for a lot of the little villages around the region, and they have been able to grow their business in that way. They have found a way to compete with some of the bigger guys in a different way, which is great. We had some evidence from Greg Coombs-Pearce, the business development manager of Cooma Monaro Shire Council, as to what has occurred since Woolworths took over the additional store in Cooma, which meant that it had both stores. We also heard from John Mercer, the manager of the business enterprise centre, who had spoken to many small businesses and who provided a good amount of information as to what was happening in that town. We also heard from Stephen Bartlett, proprietor of Slater's Fuel Services. Terri Edwards is the proprietor of a cafe, and hearing about some of the dealings that she has with the suppliers provided useful information as well. I am really pleased that they were able to come along and give evidence which has helped the inquiry. In conclusion, I found the inquiry very good and useful. The team worked well together. There are some excellent recommendations. I support the member for Hunter in encouraging the government to take these recommendations up and act on them very quickly. I will certainly be interested in what happens in the marketplace, because I think we will see some changes in the way in which retailing will occur, away from some of the major supermarkets in complexes to smaller, niche stores. I think that even Coles, Woolworths and Franklins are 9710 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 1 September 1999 thinking partly along those lines as well. A recommendation was that the government should reconvene the committee in three years time and I would encourage that as well, because the very fact that the committee is there will keep the pressure on those larger retailers. comments I made upon the tabling of the report of the Joint Select Committee on the Retailing Sector. The subject matter that was investigated by the committee is fairly complex. The committee has had to sit in judgment about many accusations that are made about the behaviour of companies within the retail sector, and often it is difficult to know whether these are made in the context of the pressure that people feel from the very harsh environment of competition and whether it is a perception that these things are happening and they are offered because people genuinely believe that that is the reason that they cannot succeed, or whether they have a basis in fact. The difficulty in this inquiry was that we had a tight time schedule in which to report. We do not have complete investigatory powers to subpoena books and go through accounts to actually see what is going on. I suppose in reality we could, but whether we have the expertise to do that and whether that is not more appropriately done by other bodies was something that the committee had to decide. The committee believes that bodies like the ACCC should take many of these accusations and investigate them in a most rigorous way to try to find out more about people's perceptions of the reasons for the behaviour of some of the bigger players in the retail sector and whether the reasons for that behaviour are, in fact, going beyond what should be seen as fair competition. There is an expression used in the report about deciding whether things are either socially beneficial or socially detrimental. That is a fine line; it is a very fine balance for us as legislators to achieve. It is also a fine line for those who are the regulators. On balance, the committee believes that the recommendations that have been made arising from this inquiry, if adopted by government, will shift the balance towards the smaller players and give them greater confidence to go about competing in the market, because that is what it is all about. Regrettably, a problem that we had was that, whilst the terms of reference talked about the retail sector, because the major protagonists that came forward to give evidence were involved in the grocery part of that sector-supermarkets and the like-we tended to concentrate on that aspect. I hope that, at the end of the day, because we did that, we have not missed what might be going on in the wider retail sector. I believe that the recommendations we have made apply not only to supermarkets and groceries as a subset but to the wider retail sector in to to. That is a sector that has undergone great change. It is, in part, driven by what it is perceived that consumers are calling for. Often, those people say that that change is being driven by the consumers, but in some evidence people even admitted that they were delving into practices that could only be described as consumer engineering. I can think of the evidence given by Coca-Cola, as a manufacturer, which I would recommend should be read by all members, as it was an exercise not just in marketing 10 1, but in marketing 301. This was straight-out marketing whereby a company had decided that this was the way in which they thought their product should be out in the marketplace, and they were going to make sure that they offered it to the marketplace in that manner, and only in that manner. I do not wish to dwell too much on the practices of Coca-Cola Amatil, but I believe that they need to understand that the committee was of the view that the way in which they approached things represented a real case study, having regard to the way in which they were pushing the envelope towards what",166,Representatives Main Committee
302,Mr Jenkins (Scullin) (11.27 A.m.),"I am pleased to have the opportunity to add to theWednesday, I September 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 9711 they believed consumers should do, rather than sitting back and analysing the way in which consumers operated. The interesting point about Coca-Cola as a manufacturer was that they have kept control of their distribution. They have many thousands of customers. In the main, we found with other manufacturers that they dealt through the wholesale chains that have developed, and they might only have in the order of six to seven customers. That is another aspect of the inquiry that was very important: we really need to look at the wholesale chain within which goods get to the retailers. At the core of this inquiry were the allegations that if the independent sector within the supermarket sector reduces too much further it would not be sustainable in that there would not be sufficient critical mass of market share to ensure that the wholesalers that the retailers depend on could go about their business. In fact, that probably was the central theme throughout most of the inquiry. To protect that market share, those who spoke on behalf of the independent supermarket sector suggested a cap. The report goes into detail about the many reasons why the committee decided that that form of cap was impractical; and why, therefore, the committee looked at other suggestions-especially, the strengthening of the Trade Practices Act-to give smaller retailers the opportunity to bring forward accusations that the ACCC might take up on a representative basis. If the amendments to the Trade Practices Act are made, the accusations should not only be taken up by the ACCC on a representative basis; the ACCC should call for damages for those third parties. The committee realised that the ACCC process could be a rather lengthy, time consuming process. We acknowledged, through our calls for representative action through to damages, that it was also a costly process which dissuaded some of the smaller players from taking that action. In calling for an industry ombudsman, we understood that in many cases the complaints were of a nature that could be better dealt with quickly by an independent arbiter. We understood that if it were put in the hands of a body that could take timely action, a body where th-re could be clarity about what is actually happening in the marketplace, then the cultural basis on which some of the players behave could be changed without taking it to the courts. . The other aspect that is very important-and I did not get the chance to mention it in my tabling statement----concems the changes that we have called for about the nature of a regional market. The present Trade Practices Act talks about substantial markets but uses as its basis either a national level or a state and territory level. It is a bit quaint now as we go towards 100 years of federation, as we go to the next millennium, that we are still hung up on the geopolitical boundaries of the colonies when we decide what is an economic market. We believe that the best way in which the ACCC should look at whether market dominance has gone too far would be if the ACCC were empowered to look at substantial markets being on a regional base. We think that could improve greatly the protection against further strengthening oligopolies or monopolies. The other thing that should be said is that we are calling for mandatory reporting of the so called phenomenon of creeping acquisitions. That is where s()me of the major supermarket companies might buy up, on a one-by-one basis, independent players. We are saying that those sorts of purchases should be reported to the ACCC on a mandatory basis. The committee was of the view that the ACCC should look at those types of creeping acquisitions as acquisitions that might have a demonstrable effect on the market. We would hope that the ACCC is able 9712 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday,l September 1999 to keep a close eye on those sorts of movements that are a result of creeping acquisitions, overlaid by what the major companies are doing by developing greenfield sites. Another important recommendation of the inquiry was to increase the limit for transactions that might be looked at under the appropriate sections of the Trade Practices Act dealing with unconscionable conduct. We recommended that the limit on transactions be increased from $1 million to $3 million because, as it was put to us, that would give greater scope for looking at transactions that might qualify under those sections. It is something that we had considerable debate on arising out of the Reid inquiry. The opposition felt that the only basis that need be put in place about whether a case could go forward was whether it involved a company that conformed to the ABS's definition of small business. The government at the time decided that the $1 million transaction limit should apply. We believe that has been a bit restrictive and the committee is suggesting an increase. Another important aspect is the code of conduct. It is suggested in the recommendations that the code of conduct include a number of items that we have highlighted. Of course, we do not believe that is a restricted list of items because the ACCC should consult widely with those players in the sector to come up with the code of conduct. But one of the important things that we believe should be in a code of conduct is truth in branding of companies. We believe that, where there are subsidiaries that are part of a wider umbrella organisation, the wider umbrella organisation should also be listed in the trading signage and advertising, et cetera, of that company. on board. Bi-Lo is an interesting example because not many people understand that it is a part of the Coles Myer group. They have two brands, for want of a better expression, operating in the supermarket area. Coles runs as Coles, but they also have Bi-Lo which is going for a different part of the market. It was surprising to find the number of people who did not actually understand that. The other important part of the industry code of conduct is the like terms for like performance for like customers. There is some belief by the smaller players that they do not have access to product on the same terms as the bigger players. Whilst under questioning the manufacturers believe that, except for discounts on the basis of volume, they are offering like terms for like customers, sufficient anecdotal evidence abounds that makes the committee believe that there is a need to put this in a code of conduct. Once it is in the code of conduct, which the committee believes should be mandatory, it is then subjected to the sections of the Trade Practices Act about unconscionable conduct. Therefore, the ACCC could look at these accusations of many of the below the line trading terms on promotions and the like that smaller players believe that they do not get access to. Another important point to stress is the need for education about what is available for the smaller players in the retail sector and the type of redress that they can use under the Trade Practices Act. A lot of those players act without full knowledge of what is possible for them to do. I acknowledge the comments made earlier that some of them will not come forward because they are concerned about what repercussions there might be if they enter into some form of legal action. But I think we have to take on board that often some people do not take action because they do not know what is required. We would hope that an ombudsman, if put",170,Representatives Main Committee

304,Mr Jenkins,"The honourable member's interjection, whilst not totally welcome, I takeWednesday, 1 September 1999 MAIN COMMITIEE 9713 in place, would be pro-active in making sure that those who could use the services of such an ombudsman realise that. The final thing I would like to say is that the retail sector will continue to undergo great change. That great change will be about not only who controls the market share but the way in which that retail sector interfaces with consumers and customers. We will see an increase in the use of electronic commerce. Some people believed-and gave us evidence-that by about the year 2020, some 20 per cent of the retail market share might reside in those using electronic commerce. To put that in context, that is about equal to the whole of the independent sector now, so the players in this market have to act very smartly. They have to rely on the speciality that they can put in. They have to rely on the way they can diversify and the way in which they can improve their niche marketing. Some of the successful people that came before us were able to do that. They were able to analyse their market and they were able to compete. All they were calling for was that they be able to compete on fair and equal terms with others. (Time expired) the Joint Select Committee on the Retailing Sector. The report entitled Fair market or market failure was a review of Australia's retail market. Before speaking on the findings and recommendations, I would like to express my sincere thanks to the Chairman, Mr Bruce Baird, and the Deputy Chair, Mr Harry Jenkins, for the support and excellent cooperation between them and the committee members. It certainly paved the way for some very honest discussions. My sincere thanks also go to the secretariat and staff of the committee. They all did a fantastic job, in particular Andrea Griffiths. Nothing was too much for her and she is definitely a true professional. I give a huge thankyou to the Hansard reporting staff for their cooperation as we collected evidence from 103 witnesses in all states around Australia. As a committee we were asked to inquire into the degree of industry concentration within the retailing sector in Australia, and overseas development with respect to this issue, plus possible courses of action by the federal government. As stated by previous speakers, this was a very difficult inquiry, with small business expecting us to give them a quick fix. Personally, it was very rewarding to me to be given the opportunity to view the big picture. It was evident that there was definitely not going to be any quick fix by governments. I believe we will see substantial changes in the retail market and how they conduct their business deals over the next few years. This will not be brought about solely by the recommendations but by the fact that this inquiry gave the opportunity to 332 people to make submissions and voice their opinions on the many problems that exist in the retail industry. We were given a good insight into the problems faced daily by small business people, warts and all. I know that I speak for all members of the committee when I say that some small businesses have done it tough. Some have fought back and won the battle and others are hanging in there, and all they want is a fair go. I hope that these recommendations will send a clear message to our major chains that we have taken note of what small business has said during this inquiry and that we expect they will take responsible, self-regulated steps to ensure that they maintain a good corporate and community image and, at the same time, accept responsibility for being contributors to their local community.",172,Representatives Main Committee
305,Mrs Elson (Forde) (11.42 A.m.),"It is my pleasure to speak in support of the report of9714 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, I September 1999 One thing was very evident in the inquiry we had: small businesses playa very large role in supporting their local communities, their sporting bodies and welfare groups. When our large major chains came into town they not only closed down businesses but also took out of town the income revenue that had been going to the local charities. They took it back to main headquarters and distributed it to major charities in that electorate. I hope the majors take this into consideration; I know they heard it at every hearing we had. At every opportunity, I think it was mentioned how they playa major role and have a responsibility to put money back into local communities if they are going to come into town and close down some of the shops. If they do not take note of what they heard through this inquiry, I think we would have no hesitation in implementing recommendation 10, which states that this committee will be reconstituted in three years from the date of the tabling of this report in order to review the progress of the recommendations and, in particular, the operation of a code of conduct and to determine whether further legislation is required. Such changes could include our asking them to divest their assets and, also, once it had been established that a corporation with a substantial degree of market power had used the market power, the shifting of the onus of proof to the corporation to prove that it did not use the power for prohibitive purposes. That is one thing we would have to make sure we did in three years time if we did not see a change in the market. During the inquiry we also heard evidence of unfair conduct, problems with franchising, misuse of market power, unfair conduct with predatory pricing, loss leader practices, the lack of legal successes and the lack of awareness by some small retailers of their rights and obligations. Some gave hard core evidence, other evidence was anecdotal and some was pure urban myth. In a few places in Australia, we heard how extended trading hours had helped small businesses survive and, in other towns, we heard how they had been destroyed by it. Evidence was given of how some small specialist businesses survived in the base that they were pulling. They were in shopping centres, the big majors were pulling people into that shopping centre, and those businesses were surviving and employing people. So small businesses wanted it both ways in some ways, as we saw it, because if they were not in a major shopping centre, there were large problems. But in major shopping centres there were a heap of speciality shops that were surviving and employing because there was a major tenant there. As a committee, we did not seek protectionist measures for small independent retailers. Rather, we recommended measures that we believe will enhance competition in the marketplace. The food industry is a $12 billion dollar market driven by consumers who appear, from the evidence in the report, to benefit from the competitive forces of the current market structure. Blame has been directed at the majors as the cause of structural change, but some of the blame has to be directed at governments. Evidence we received throughout the inquiry indicated that local councils and state governments could do more for better future planning to control the overdevelopment of large shopping centres in some towns. We saw first hand in the regional town of Bundaberg that there were five major outlets within a one-kilometre radius. It was really strange to see that any local government would actually allow that to go ahead. When we questioned them, they said their hands were tied due to state government regulations. Responsible town planning can stop an oversupply of large complexes like the Wednesday, 1 September 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 9715 ones we saw in Bundaberg and in other areas of Australia. Recommendation 4 covers that one quite well when it says: The Committee recommends that mandatory notification of retail grocery store acquisitions by publicly listed corporations be prescribed within the mandatory Code of Conduct. . . and approved by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, with a requirement that the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission consult with local authorities and other relevant parties in order to make an informed assessment of the likely impact on local businesses of such acquisitions. As the report states, there were cases for the major chains to be capped at 25 per cent. This proposal would have required Woolworths, which is owned by 340,000 ordinary Australians, to shed one-third of its stores, while Australia's largest private sector employee, Coles Myer, would have been required to sell 100 of its Coles Bi-Lo supermarkets. More importantly, about 36,000 jobs would have been placed on the market. Some, though, would have been transferred to new owners. The committee heard compelling evidence that the cap would be unworkable and would effectively regulate the consumer. The ACCC Chairman, Professor Allan Fels, believes that, at least in some cases, some areas and some product markets, a market cap would mean that Australian consumers might be condemned to purchase and to be supplied with inefficient and high cost operations. On the other hand, evidence revealed that the majority of independent retailers felt that at some stage of their business careers they would like to be able to sell out to a major chain. The impact of a market cap would have the likely effect of preventing them from doing so, with a consequent reduction in the value of their stores. Finally, on this subject, should capping occur it would provide the opportunity for foreign retail chains to enter the market to the detriment of the companies owned by thousands of ordinary Australians. Small business is not dead in Australia. There are over one million small private sector businesses in Australia employing around 3.5 million people. Some are being squeezed out of the market by consumer choice. If we take our minds back a few years, we could all recall a number of family comer stores-and I owned one-in our local districts that were forced out of business by independent grocery stores which offered the consumer a wider range of products. We can see the same consumer demand today as the major chains provide over 40,000 products to consumers. However, we also saw evidence during our inquiry that there . was a very viable and increasing market of small independent stores marketing their friendly and efficient service, providing what the consumer wanted, and succeeding. They are alive and well in our communities. We saw some very viable small business people out there competing with our majors and winning. In closing, I would like to sincerely thank all those who took time out of their busy schedules to come before our committee. They gave us a very frank insight into their daily battle for survival. I hope that these recommendations will give the support that they seek for a fair go. Ms MACKLIN (Jagajaga) (11.53 a.m.}--I am very pleased to be able to contribute to the discussion about the report by the Joint Select Committee on the Retailing Sector. What is very clear from listening to the debate this morning and looking at the recommendations is that the committee's work does strike a very good balance between the interests of small and independent firms and the interests of the larger chains and shareholders, and appropriately also gives weight to the interests of both consumers and employees in the retail sector. WhatI would like to do briefly this morning is comment on a particular aspect which is particularly important to the health sector, and that is the issue of community pharmacy. I am 9716 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday,1 September 1999 very pleased that, in its general review of the retail sector, the committee has included this issue and, in fact, made the following observation in recommendation 8: The Committee recommends that the major supermarket chains take note of widespread community and pharmaceutical industry concerns that the nature of the role played by pharmacists is unique, as it relates to matters of public health. The Committee is therefore of the view that expansion by the major chains into the dispensing of pharmaceutical products should be discouraged. This is very welcome news to the phannacy sector, which has been living under the shadow of the government's competition policy review. Labor certainly supports the continuation of phannacy ownership by phannacists because the professional health care provided by phannacists is a vital part of delivering health care to all Australians wherever they live-and I will talk a little bit later about, in particular, the rural issues. There are substantial benefits to the community ftom having a very strong network of community phannacists delivering a wide range of health services throughout the country. These services are not-and I know that phannacists know this-limited to the goods that a phannacist sells as many free services and information programs rely on community phannacies for widespread delivery. I am pleased to say that, at the last election, Kim Beazley gave a very clear commitment that we would oppose the removal of the requirement for ownership because it would undermine community phannacy and inevitably result in American style service and standards. Under that arrangement, local phannacies would be unable to compete with supermarket drug dispensing. The parliament has already received a number of petitions, I am pleased to say, including one from electors in my own constituency of Jagajaga where 2,000 people signed petitions located in community phannacies, saying that they wanted their community phannacies to stay. It has been the case that similar petitions have b'een presented from other electorates. Talking to my local phannacists, I find that they are very apprehensive and concerned that their professional standing, which has been built up in the community, will be lost so easily if supermarkets are able to employ phannacists and dispense medicines. We are concerned about the competition policy review that is under way, but I want to make it clear that this support for phannacies is being given for a reason. On this side of the House, we are generally supportive of competition. We believe that many strengths have come to the Australian economy as a result of the many reforms that were implemented in the 1980s, but this notion that we are talking about with phannacies is not about protecting phannacies from competition. Phannacy is, of course-and I think the committee heard a lot about this in their review-a very competitive business. They are not only competing against each other but, for many of their product lines, competing against other retailers as well. The public and the community at large benefit from competition by virtue of cheaper products and better service,' but the problem is where that competition theory is taken too far and the community loses by virtue of the loss of specialised services that have been built up over the years and which are being provided as a package along with many other services. My judgment is that community phannacy has achieved this because it is prepared to make a commitment to provide more than just the dispensing of prescriptions. What community phannacy is showing is a new vision for phannacy which puts the emphasis on delivering professional advice and services on the grounds that phannacists are about creating a future which has appeal to the public. All of us, of course, have grown up with phannacies in every Wednesday,1 September 1999 MAIN COMMIITEE 9717 shopping centre to provide a whole range of goods and services. Imposing open competition for this dispensing function without taking heed of all of the facts, particularly all of the other services, runs the risk of throwing the baby out with the bathwater. Nevertheless, of course, the pharmacy industry must not be complacent-and I do not think they are. Making a distinction between supermarkets and pharmacies will only remain defensible while pharmacies continue to provide a unique service and enjoy the high level of public support that they currently do. I want to make a few remarks about rural access because I think we see the problems that exist for doctors-and they are very real-but there are also serious problems with access to pharmacy services as well. The government has recognised this and earlier this year it announced a number of incentives to try to encourage pharmacists in rural areas to stay. We recognise that it is early days. As to whether this will have a positive effect, it is too early to say, but we are certainly supportive of moves to try to do whatever can be done to keep pharmacists in, and to encourage younger pharmacists into, rural areas. There is a chicken and egg problem. If the doctor closes down in a small town, it is very hard for the pharmacist to continue. And if there is no pharmacy, it is very hard for the doctor because the patients have to go in to a bigger place to fill their prescriptions. The pharmacy profession has raised a number of other problems facing community pharmacy, particularly in rural areas-the need for succession planning and emergency locum relief, many of the things that face doctors as well. Hopefully, these initiatives that have been put forward by the government will work to make sure that pharmacy can remain, not just in our urban shopping centres but also in these smaller rural towns. A very good way that we can see pharmacy playing a role in the delivery of professional health care is in the management of medications, particularly for the elderly-those living in residential care and those living independently at home. Medication reviews undertaken by professional pharmacists can be a very important step in improving the quality use of medicines to avoid adverse reactions and to ensure that the best outcome for the user happens and also that costs to the overall community are contained. There is potential for the concept of an intranet to link up pharmacies to ensure improved medication records and that better practice takes place. Consumers would certainly benefit from this through portability of access to services, and pharmacists would have much greater information available to them. Anything that can be done to deter doctor shopping and the inappropriate use of medicines is something that across the parliament we should support. This is an area with great potential if, as we acknowledge, considerable technical and privacy issues can be resolved. Nevertheless, in the context of the debate we are currently having, this would be much easier to resolve within a network of professionally owned pharmacies then in a deregulated environment. Other examples of potential 'value added' pharmacy services of the future include asthma management, diabetes care, wound care, monitoring blood pressure, assisting with managing incontinence and providing on-the-spot pathology and screening tests. There are many initiatives that I know community pharmacists are very keen to pursue. They know that this is necessary to maintain their outstanding status within the community. As I said at the outset, I am very pleased that this report recognises the critical role that community pharmacists play and recognises that that role will not be able to be maintained if restrictions on the delivery of pharmaceuticals are lost and that delivery is handed over to 9718 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 1 September 1999 supermarkets. I am certainly strongly supportive of the recommendations on this ,issue that have been brought forward here today. Select Committee on the Retailing Sector, I would like to focus on three recommendations: recommendation 8, which the member for Jagajaga has just spoken on, relates to the pharmacy sector; recommendation 3 goes to the issue of a retail industry ombudsman; and recommendation 5 goes to the question of a code of conduct. I will go through those recommendations. Recommendation 3 reads: The Committee recommends the establishment of an independent Retail Industry Ombudsman through which small business can bring complaints or queries relating to the retailing sector for speedy resolution. The Committee believes that the Retail Industry Ombudsman should consider, among other things, the application of the Retail Industry Code of Conduct (Recommendation 5) in his or her deliberations. Where complaints received by the Retail Industry Ombudsman raise issues that fall within the jurisdiction of another established body, such as the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, those complaints should be referred to such bodies for further investigation. The Committee recommends that the Retail Industry Ombudsman be appointed and funded by the Government. The Committee recommends that the Retail Industry Ombudsman be required to produce a bi-annual report to the Parliament in order to increase transparency in the retailing industry. I think this is a good recommendation and I hope the government does act upon it. I would like to make a couple of comments about the overall conduct of the inquiry. The fact is that the recommendations are unanimous. That has meant there has been an element of compromise to some extent, or an attempt, through goodwill from all sides, to try to come forward with a unanimous report which is powerful in its recommendations so that it will ensure that the government does take the report very seriously. Certainly, it is good to see a report where there are unanimous recommendations for government to act upon. It is not always the case. We believe that does require the government to look at these recommendations, hopefully, as quickly as possible. As I think we are all aware, the operation of the retail industry has been a matter of concern, particularly to small players within that industry, for quite some time because there has been increasing market share by the major chains on an ongoing basis. That has led to allegations of, and in some cases some proof of, predatory pricing arrangements and a range of other activities which have unfairly discriminated against smaller players in the field. Certainly, I know that a lot of the smaller players' organisations have been keen to see this inquiry go further than it has done with respect to its recommendations. But, with things like the retail industry ombudsman we see an example of something which, if it works properly and if it is implemented fully, should lead to some real and actual changes that will benefit competition and fairness within the operation of the retail industry. That will have a benefit for the average consumer and also ensure a better working and operating environment for smaller players within the industry. The committee has recommended that the ombudsman be funded by the government and appointed by the government. It is fair in terms of the overarching role of the retail industry across the country that the government is seen to be auspicing and partnering this approach. Here we are also talking about a mandatory approach in relation to the code of conduct beyond that. That is very important and I will come back to that a bit later on in terms of making sure that such an ombudsman has real teeth and the capacity to be able to really act upon",173,Representatives Main Commitiee
306,Mr Griffin (Bruce) (12.03 P.m.),"In making a few comments on the report of the JointWednesday, I September 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 9719 recommendations and situations that the ombudsman may have raised with it. Ombudsmen have been patchy in some industries in terms of their actual real operation. The banking industry and the health industry are two examples. However, I think they certainly are a very important part of any regulatory framework in order to ensure that people do have somewhere where they can go to raise concerns. Recommendation 5, which is in relation to the retail industry code of conduct, is also very important. It says: The Committee recommends the drafting of a Retail Industry Code of Conduct by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission in consultation with retail industry groups and other relevant parties for the purpose of regulating the conduct associated with vertical relationships throughout the supply chain. The Committee recommends that the Code of Conduct be a mandatory code, and should contain a precise form of dispute resolution, with the process of resolution clearly spelled out. The Committee recommends that the Code of Conduct be drafted to include specific provisions that address: (a) The general principle of 'like terms for like customers'-where the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission may seek information from corporations, on a confidential basis, revealing key terms and conditions of contracts of supply. (b) Transparency in 'vulnerable' supply markets-where growers have to deal with a range of market characteristics, including perishability, market volatility and a high degree of risk exposure. (c) Product labelling and packaging requirements-with a view to implementing a more equitable system than that which currently exists. (d) Contractual uncertainty-in particular, the passing of ownership of produce and the circumstances under which produce can be returned. (e) Truth in branding-so that businesses, which are subsidiaries of, or are substantially owned by, a listed public company or major retailer, note that association on shop front signage, in advertising, on stationery, and so on. The Committee recommends that disputes falling under the Code of Conduct should not be limited to resolution by the Retail Industry Ombudsman. For example, disputes raising issues relevant to National Competition Policy or the Trade Practices Act 1974 would be more appropriately dealt with by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. The whole point of having a code of conduct and taking a mandatory approach is to try to ensure there is a regulatory framework in place so that all the players within the industry are aware of their rights and responsibilities and so that the ombudsman or others who would endeavour to review that regulation have a set of firm rules to work off to ensure that decisions are properly made. Hopefully an approach such as this will lead to less litigation in a formal sense. One of the problems with having a voluntary code of conduct and having to go to other means to resolve issues and not having detailed and proper regulatory processes and forums for reviewing matters is that people will often end up in the courts. That, in itself, is incredibly expensive and can often be much more time consuming than other processes and, in those circumstances, not a desirable way to ensure that problems within an industry are resolved. Certainly those two recommendations-the ombudsman and the code of conduct-are positive steps forward. In an overall sense, there is a view in some of the comment the inquiry has gained so far that maybe it does not go far enough. I think we really have to wait to see whether, over the next year or two, that is in fact the case. The important thing is that the government needs to act upon it now. 9720 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 1 September 1999 The other issue I would briefly like to talk about was covered in some detail by the member for Jagajaga in her previous speech. Recommendation 8 states: The Committee recommends that major supermarket chains take note of widespread community and pharmaceutical industry concerns that the nature of the role played by pharmacists is unique, as it relates to matters of public health. The Committee is therefore of the view that expansion by the major chains into the dispensing of pharmaceutical products should be discouraged. This goes to the issue of phannacies being set up within supennarkets and as part of supennarkets. As has been said by earlier speakers, this raises a range of issues which cause quite a deal of concern. It looks to the question of whether the major role of phannacies in the dispensing of medicines and advice to clients as to the appropriate medications required in their circumstances is an issue which can be handled within a supennarket scenario. That practice occurs in some places overseas, although I am not at all convinced that in fact it is a good idea. I think it does underestimate and undennine the actual professional role of phannacists and phannacies within a community. As has been said in many regional centres and country towns as well as in metropolitan areas, phannacies are often the first port of call for those who require basic advice and assistance on medical matters and, with the range of medications available now, there is a need for professional advice with respect to what is utilised. I think a much greater role can be developed for phannacists into the future as to what role they perfonn as part of general health care development within our community. Certainly, I know from discussions I have had with representatives from within the industry and also from some of the facilities I have visited-for example, at the University of Sydney-that there is great scope to develop the role of the phannacy industry and phannacists in providing a greater level of health care within our community. These days, when we look so much more to preventing illnesses rather than to actually dealing with them after the event, when we look so much to the different types of assistance that can be given at an earlier stage rather than at a later stage, that role of phannacists is something that can be developed further down the track and that ought to be embraced and developed by government in any way that is of assistance. Certainly, I know the industry itself is keen to work down that track and to see a greater role for itself and for its members, but I think it is something which would be difficult to foster effectively in a supennarket setting. I think it does lead to the potential for an undennining of a range of conditions around the question of service delivery, and that is something we would not like to see. Overall, though, as I said earlier I think the report is to be commended to government as a report with a range of unanimous recommendations that deserve urgent and detailed attention. I am sure the chair of the committee and other government members will endeavour to take these recommendations forth to the relevant ministers. I certainly know they go with the support of the opposition in seeking that sort of action around these sorts of recommendations. To those who would say that the report could have gone further, I would say that I think that that is always a legitimate comment with respect to the consideration of an issue in some detail, as has occurred on this occasion. Now that we have a report that does have a range of recommendations which I think we all agree will lead to an improvement in the operation of the retailing sector, we have to give those recommendations a chance-give the government a chance to implement them and give the industry a chance to work with them. That will, hopefully, lead to a situation where some of the issues of concern that have been raised quite rightly over the last few years in particular will be addressed. Hopefully from there we will Wednesday,. 1 September 1999 MAIN COMMITTEE 9721 see a situation where those sorts of concerns will not be the concerns that they have been in the past.
