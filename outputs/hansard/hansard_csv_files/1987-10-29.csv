The table shows a concentration of PBS prescriptions in the $3 to $6 price range. Drugs costing more than $6 account for less than one-third of total sales for each group of beneficiaries, and drugs costing more than $10 account for less than 7 per cent of total sales in all categories (and less than 5 per cent in the pensioner category). feature of that table is the very thick clustering ister for Health, the present Minister for Comwithin a small band of prices of the majority of munity Services and Health (Dr Blewett), for prescription costs in the general, concessional deleting 45 or 46 items from the pharmaceutical and pensioner categories.

The simple answer is that Medicare honourable member for O'Connor( Mr Tuckey) is failing. Medicare is failing because, as everyin his speech earlier on the National Health one knows, it was destined to fail right from the Amendment Bill (No.2) 1987, in particular, as beginning. Such a system does fail. It has failed they highlight some of the weaknesses of the overseas. It has failed in Canada, on whose syshealth system.

However, what Govtals are being closed. ernment members fail to understand is what is There is no doubt that the case which I have causing those abuses. Furthermore, having tried to cut out those abuses, Government members just highlighted is a serious indictment of what is happening to the whole health care system in still fail to understand that the methods they are Australia and, in this particular instance, not using in fact, in many cases, penalise the genuinely sick and, in particular, penalise those who only what is happening to Medicare but also what is happening to the repatriation system.

It does not rain very often and when it I turn to the cost of the proposal.

On capital city prices, without a carriage argument. or any engine to drive it, it would cost $4m a I have been looking through the Hansard reckilometre. The direct route involves at least 42 ords of all the Minister's comments and I can kilometres and that would mean the monorail assure honourable members that there is no logic would cost $168m-without any carriages.

If it is the monorail into place if it goes over the tops to be two feet to three feet above the ground of the sand dunes. How many visitors a year and 42 kilometres long how will vehicles cross would we be building this very expensive monover it? They could not cross over it and there orail for?

It would not be two feet or three feet ludicrous on an economic basis to argue that we above the ground; it would have to be 10 feet should have a monorail out in that part of the or 20 feet above the ground as the one in Sydney world.
