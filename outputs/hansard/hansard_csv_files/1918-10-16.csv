4,. Mr Jowett.,"I s the Acting Primeprepared to .allow this House, hearing in mind that this is .a .self-governing dominion of the British .Empire whose soldiers have played a 'great and valiant part in winning this war, to consider the advisability of affirming a amotion to the effect that, in our opinion, no further communications should he sent by the Allies to Germany except to demand that all of her submarines and other ships of war, -and all her armies, shall unconditionally surrender to the Allied Forces? Mr ""WATT -The Government has uo official information of the motion -which has been moved in the American Senate, though, in common with other members of the public and of this House, I have seen a brief account of it. There is a distinction between the American Senate and this Legislature. The American nation cannot make war except with the consent of the Senate, which, as the honourable member doubtless knows, conditions the actions of the Executive in peace and in war. Then, the American Legislature is an absolutely sovereign body, which we are not. There are many other differences, but those two are the main ones. The adoption of the suggestion that the honourable member has made in perfect good faith and right spirit would not, I think, make any easier the task of the statesmen of the Empire who are dealing with these matters. The Government, knowing something of the actual war situation, which it is not permitted to dispresent shortage of tonnage in Ausclose, does not propose at fhis stage to invite the House to discuss the matter, but later we may be in a position to do so. Minister tell us why he offered to payihalf ber know to-morrow. of any allowance made by the States to the dependants of deserting soldiers?

I could not off-nand, and without reference to the files, repeat what we have, said, but if the honourable member will give notice of the question for to-morrow, I shall see that he is told why our offer was made, and the basis of it. that the Commonwealth Government has commandeered the city of Sydney's electrical supply? Will the Acting Prime Minister tell the House the reason fortius, and whether the same thing has been done in all thecapitals of the Commonwealth ? city of Sydney's electrical supply has been commandeered, but if my honourable friend will give notice of his question for to-morrow, I snail then be prepared with an answer.

Acting Prime Minister whether he w ill lay upon the table of the' House any representations that may have been made to him by trustees and other. persons administering trusts in the direction of endeavouring to induce the Government to submit a measure which would enable them to meet the compulsory war loan provisions while keeping within the four corners of their deeds of trust? any such representations have been made to me.

23,Mr Watt,"I am unable, at present,an opportunity during the day to investigate with him the exact results of the loan up to the present hour. I may be -able to tell the House later in the sitting whether or not an extension of time will be made. the question just asked by the honourable member for Barker( Mr Livingston), I would remind the Acting Prime Minister that he promised last week to make an early announcement as to the date to which the time for making these payments would be extended. There has not been time for trustees and directors of companies to meet in order to determine how they are going to raise, as a contribution to the war loan, six times the amount of. their income tax. ""Will the honourable gentleman tell the House to what date he intends to extend the time within which compulsory contributions may be made? Mr ""WATT -It seems to me that the question put by the honourable member, although"" phrased differently, is precisely the same as that asked by the honourable member for Barker. ferent question. stood the honourable member. "" I take it that what he desires to know is whether people who have not been able to put their money into the loan will be granted further time before the compulsory provisions of the Bill are enforced against them. of my question. I oannot at present determine. I should like to point out, however, that the community has had far longer notice than some members of the community allegethey have had with regard to the application of compulsion. When the House met after the recent recess, the honourable member was unfortunately absent owing to illness, but at that time the Government explicitly announced in a Minis.terial statement, which was printed by order of the House, that compulsion would be applied, and the date and hour. of the closing of the loan were then announced. The only point not specified at that time was as to the nature of the compulsion and the extent of the penalty, but the fact that compulsion was to be applied was announced by the Government, and was discussed in the House. representing the Minister for Recruiting state whether he has noticed certain repulsive pictorial incitements to bloodshed that are posted in various conspicuous places, and notably on public buildings in and around the 6ity of Melbourne? To one of these special reference was ma'de last week by the honourable member for Indi( Mr Leckie). Will the Minister take steps for the withdrawal and destruction of these odious publications? printing of the poster in question was given before the war situation had reached its present stage, and we are considering the advisableness of withdrawing it. If the position were less favorable than it is to-day, it is just possible that the poster to which the honourable member has referred might bring home to eligibles the methods of the enemy whom we are fighting. state whether the Government intend to -pay a maintenance allowance to old-'age pensioners in charitable institutions; and, if so, at what rate and when ? ference, held some six or seven weeks ago, the Commonwealth, for the first time, came tc aii agreement with the States a"" to these payments. I am unable offhand to speak of when they will be made, or of what the amount will be, but I shall endeavour to furnish ""the honourable member with the information tomorrow. MT.

Its inclusion in the list of compulsory subjects was approved by the Minister in 1916, and District Commandants, and ' the schools throughout the Commonwealth were duly notified of the change. It was a compulsory subject for the Entrance Examination held in 1916, and it is not understood how any candidate could have formed the impression referred to by the honourable member. SALE OF WOOL CLIP. M in is t e r , u p o n notice1. Has he seen the statement in the public press that, in the opinion of able business men in London, ""the opinions of British manufacturers have been permitted to weigh too heavily"" in ths negotiations for the purchase and sale of the Australian wool clip; also the statement by Sir Arthu r Goldfinch, Director of Raw Materials, "" that prices have been paid excess of the basis agreed upon w it h Aus"" ? 2. In this connection, w ill he state what was 1. Yes. ' 2. I have no information on the subject, but ister for Defence, upon notice1. Whether, in view of the Crown Solicitor's opinion (13th September, 1916) "" that. Captain Carroll was appointed by the late LordK it chener to The rank of major, that approval of this appointment was given by the Queensland Government, that the appointment of Major Carroll to the rank of major in South Africa became de facto complete on the consent of the Queensland Government being given to such appointment,"" the Government intend to withhold from M a j or Carroll the brevet rank to which he appears to be entitled? 2. If so, w ill the Minister state the reasons? able member's questions are as f o l l o w : 1. Yes.. 2. [a) The paragraph in the first question purporting to be a quotation is not aquotation, but is a collection of statements extracted from the Crown Solicitor's opinion, and is misleading. The Crown Solicitor states that a Cabinet minute has no legal effect in itself, and it is a question of policy whether it be given effect to or not. He further states that the effect of the appointment was not to give Major Carroll the rank of major in the Commonwealth M i l it a r y Forces, and would not have done so even if the consent had been given by the Commonwealth Government and not the Queensland Government. Major Carroll is .therefore not entitled to claim any promotion as a matter of right in consequence of his servico in South Africa. (6) No promotions of officers for service in South Africa were made' u n t i l eight months after the second Cabinet decision of the 30th A p r i l, 1902, and, therefore, it is quite irrelevant to consider whether Major Carroll returned before or after that decision. The cases of a l l officers who returned from South Africa and received promotion (240 in all) were considered under the second Cabinet decision, and it is, therefore, not proposed, after a lapse of fifteen years, to single out Major Carroll for special recognition from amongst all those who returned meritorious service in South Africa. .

Does the agreement between the Commonwealtli Government and these war workers provide for the employment, support, and return of the men to Australia, and also continuous attention to the needs of their dependants in this country? able member's questions are as follow:1. If pronounced fit to resume their civil occupation, munition workers and navvies will be discharged in accordance with their agreements on return to Australia, and the Commonwealth has no further responsibility. Special provision has been made, however, for men who are returned on account of ill-health to receive treatment for a reasonable period with a view to making them fit to resume their civil occupation, and allowances to dependants will, be continued during the period of treatment. 2. Under the navvies' agreement, a standard wage of £2' Os. 6d. is guaranteed from the date the man commences work up to and including the fourth working day prior to the departure of the man from. Great Britain on his return voyage to Australia, provided such guarantee docs not extend to the case where' time is lost by the worker from causes within his own control. An advance of £3 on voyage allowance is then paid to the worker prior to his embarkation. There is no such provision under the munition workers' agreement, but a sustenance allowance is paid by the Board of Trade, England, to all Australian munition workers who, from causes beyond their own control,areout of employment in Great Britain. An' advance of £3 on voyage is also paid to munition workers. 3. Tlie Ministry of Labour, England, is responsible fbr tlie placing of the men in employment. With regard to the support of these men whilst in Great Britain, see answer to question 2. Navvies and munition workers' agreements provide for ""the return to Australia of the workers. Both agreements also provide for the payment of allowances by the Commonwealth to dependants during the absence of the men from.

In Committee of Supply: OrderedThat the consideration of the General Estimates be postponed, until after the consideration of Estimates for Additions, New Works, Buildings, &c. Proposed vote, £165,865. Acting Prime Minister) [3.45] -It has been the invariable practice in recent years to postpone the consideration of the General Estimates in order that the construction of works may not be postponed. The total amount included in these Estimates for Additions, New Works, Buildings, & c , is £454,951 , which is £802,666 less than the provision made in the year 1917-18, when the total amount estimated to be payable from revenue upon Additions, New Works, Buildings, & c , was £1,257,617. The policy followed in framing the Estimates wasto provide for the completion of works already in progress, and only in cases of urgent necessity was provision made for works not already in hand. By this limitation, the Estimates now submitted are £541,000 less than, the amounts which the Departments originallyasked to be provided this year. Seeing that the amount asked for is now confined almost to works that were in hand on 30th June last, it is to be expected that the bulk of t i e expenditure will take place in the earlier months of this financial year.

If this proposal means merely the appointment of a ' certain number of University professors, who are to make academic research work, without _ that being put to any practical test, it will be money thrown away.

However,, I do not wish to go into that question now, because I shall have an opportunity later on; at present, I ' merely wish to i refer to the fact that we are handing tobureaucracies work which Ministers themselves ought to do, as responsible to the taxpayers. I am glad to hear the M in ister say that this money will not be expended u n t i l authority is given by this House for the establishment of a permanent body. Minister to say t h a t this money will remain in suspension u n t i l such time as authority is given for the establishment of an Institute. When this machinery is in operation in all the States, it is the duty of Parliament to' see that there is real co-ordination under one large scheme, and that work done by any academic bodies is practically tested in respect to both primary production and manufacture. Such an Institute should be in sufficiently close touch with the operations of manufacture to be able to gather all the necessary information. The work of co-ordination with the States should beundertaken' before any B ill is brought before Parliament. I know that we cannot discuss the Budget 'on the present occasion; but it is just as well to remember the -I great increase of general exjienditure during the war. While we applaud the Acting Prime Minister( Mr Watt) for cutting down the expenditure in various Departments, as indicated in the Budget speech, no one can say that that reduction goes f a r enough in this war period.' We, as a Parliament, which is talking economy, should first set our own house in order, as an example to the people. So far as I can see, on looking at the general Estimates, the only drastic reductions are in connection with new works, with the result that very important undertakings, which would be reproductive, and amply supply interest and sinking f u n d , have been put on one side, while, in the various administrative Departments there is not only no reduction but, in many, an increase. This is quite j beyond my comprehension during this period of war. According to the Estimates, our works expenditure has I am referring to, dropped from £2,673,000 in 1914 to £454,000 in 1918. We all know that 1 expenditure on the 1914"" standard could not be continued under present circumstances,* and we are prepared to submit 1 to great reductions in connection with new works, and to lop off all expenditure not of a purely reproductive character. While the States are constructing railways out of money secured through the Commonwealth, in order to open up country and increase the production necessary for our present sustenance, and also for the demands after the war, we, as a Federal Parliament, are practically at a stand-still, so far as the extension df telephone works throughout the Commonwealth is concerned. We find that the expenditure on new works has dropped from £1,257,000 to £625,000, a reduction of more, than one-half; yet, in nearly every one of the administrative Departments, there is increased expenditure. In the Prime Minister's Department, for instance, in 1914, the expenditure was £149,000, whereas now it is £204,000, notwithstanding the fact that the Treasurer has adopted a process of devolution, and delegated large expenditure to other Departments.

They spent a week upon the task, and returned to him with estimates of expenditure showing a reduction of some £8,000 or £9,000. He said to them, "" Hasi t taken you all that time to hatch out that much 1 I will show you what to do with it . "" Thereupon he took his pen, and ran it through the items providing the salaries for the heads of the Departments. .In this way he saved at least £80,000. When these gentlemen found that they were likely they very soon came along w i th a supplementary recommendation acquiescing in what the Premier required. That is what this House should do with some of these Departments that are growing so quickly. How many , times have we heard Ministers come down to the Housei n the earlier days of this Parliament saying that they desired the establishment of such and such a Department, which, they pointed out, would not cost more than £4,000 or £5,000 per annum.? In my foolishness I have acquiesced and agreed to vote the necessary money. But what did we find? For a Department requiring £5,000 in the first year, double that amount was required in the next year, treble the amount in the t h i r d year, and then eight times the amount in the fourth year. It will probably be found to require £500,000 at the present time. These Departments get what they ask for, and they are still growing. Surely the Government, instead of establishing an Institute of Science and Industryi n war time, should practice a littl e of the economy that they are asking the public and the State Governments to observe. Por many years past the Queensland Government have done good work in the direction of tackling the prickly pear and Texas fever problems. America, and obtained all the information it was possible to gain. They are still battling against the ravages of the blow-fly pest, and I understand that in some of the districts it is being overcome. Why is it necessary in war time to duplicate the machinery already in existence'? I suppose that the proposal will be to quadruple it in peace time. It is all very well to do this sort of thing if one has certain friends he wishes to p u t into good positions, b u t once a Department is established, there are sub-Departments created immediately, and they grow and grow. I should like to know how many clerks, senior clerks, accountants, and other officers there are to be in the Bureau of Science and Industry. If the vote is in creased from £6,000 to £20,000, they w ill all have a right royal time for the next twelve months.

A great deal could be saved by amalgamating the Taxation Departments of the Commonwealth and the States. vernment should compel the Governments to consent to the necessary amalgamations. for the duration of the war. how .satisfactory the arrangement was, they would not give it up. The Electoral Departments should be amalgamated, and so should many others.

Then there is the new Postal Institute, for the opening of which the Postmaster General composed a set of verses. They get all the good things in the cities; the people in the bush are treated very differently from the city populations.

The pastoral and agricultural interests are the backbone of our prosperity, yet when people in the country ask for postal and telephonic services they are met with obstacles, although telephone extensions and the like are readily granted in the big cities, where the telephone is used as much for the discussion of social' affairs as for the transaction of business.

That is a very drastic regulation. means that the Treasurer can veto building operations carried on throughout the Commonwealth, not only by the Federal Government,' but by the States, as well as private individuals, municipalities, and associations. might be interfered with in the erection of homes. We daily have evidence in the newspapers that building particularly in tlie direction of private. homes for the peojale, are very necessary. there any reference to the building of homes.? ration from the Government as to whether or not this regulation would prevent the construction of homes. Building operations throughout Australia should not be interfered with unless there are very satisfactory reasons for doing so. A t the present time such operations are being penalized to a very serious extent. No individual would readily undertake the expenditure of money on building at the present time, the cost of labour and are theymaterial, particularly ironmongery, .being very high. Here, however, is a ""regulation which practically puts a stop to building operations throughout Australia. not include homes'. vent any person spending more than £250 on any building or alterations without the consent of the Treasurer. It is proposed to reduce the expenditure on works to the extent of £170,000 this year, and to prevent expenditure on building operations by private individuals; indeed, the Government are even proposing to interfere with the right of the States to carry out such works. That is economy of the -wrong kind. In tha Estimates area number of items on which, I think, we can economize, and I hope to have the opbe. exercised. There is no doubt that economy must be exercised, but my coneconomy-that it will not help us to meet our .obligations, but, rather, make us less able to carry on the affairs of the country.

An area of about 56 acres was acquired, and an additional area of 250 acres was recommended for subsequent purchase.

However, the point T rose to speak upon was the cutting down of expenditure that would show a profit. It is most remarkable that in instances where a profit could be shown the Governmentshould refrain from spending money, and, indeed, take.a course of action that ordinary common sense and business principles would show to be entirely 'wrong. I agree with the honourable members who 'have urged t h e -necessity for developing those services to t h e community -that are especially included -within the activities of the Postmaster-'General's Department.

The items shown on the Estimates now before the Committee are fairly small, but some amounts are provided for naval works, the Pederal Capital, and the Institute of Science and In dustry. I do not object to the last named project, because the reply given by the Minister to the (honourable, member for Kooyong( Sir Robert Best) is satisfactory to me. I hope that, when the Bill conies before the House, we shall have ample opportunity to discuss the project fully. It is well to try on every occasion to point out extravagances, in order that they may be obviated in the future. I have in my hands a photograph of some' filling . work that was done in connection with one of the avenues at Canberra. I think that, when the honourable member for Herbert( Mr Bamford) was Minister for Home Affairs, he stopped that work, and only a small amount of money is provided on the Estimates now before us for preservative-works in the district. I wish honourable members to realize, however, to what projects the country is being committed. This avenue is one of about a dozen to be constructed in connection with the formation of the Capital city. The photograph shows an embankment about 25 feet high, and, although the avenue is only 40 feet wide at present, it is ultimately to be 200 feet wide, and, approximately, 1,000 feet long.

Two years ago, when the Public Works Committee was investigating the proposal to build an Arsenal in the Pederal Territory, the departmental engineers estimated' that it would cost £25,000 to build a railway to the site. To-day the estimate for building that railway is £62,000. proposed to build a factory, and engaged an engineer to pick out a good site and estimate the cost of establishing railway communication with it, what would ihe think of an engineer who, after first estimating that a railway to the site would cost £25,000, revised his figures two years later and said, "" We cannot build the -railway from that spot; we must build one 4 or 5 miles further away "" ? Surely Government officials should work exactly as do men working for private individuals. £25,000 for a railway to the Tuggeranong site? neers now find that, on account of the grades, the railway cannot follow the route upon which they submitted that estimate.

It w ill help people to realize that, so far, Australia has not done its duty in these matters. We have been promised time after time that a balance-sheet of the operations of the Small Arms Factory would be prepared to enable ' honourable members to ascertain whether decent work was being carried out in that establishment, but we cannot get the information.

The result was that an inspector was sent to the Small Arms Factory, and there was a big improvement in the work turned out there; but it has to . be realized that the Ministerf o r Defence, who appoints this inspector, also controls the Factory. I am sure that we would get far better work done and far better value for our money if similar establishments were removed from the control of the Minister for Defence. The Defence who are employed, otherwise a Department could give instructions as to the class of small arms or munitions it required, and the order could go to a Factory under the control of some other Minister. The trouble with the present system is that if an inspector begins to find faul t with tlie management of a Factory or with the class of goods produced in the establishment, he is lodging complaints against the administration of his own Minister. The .Defence Department would be better served if the control of these, factories could be transferred to some other M in ister.

The Public Works Committee, which inquired into portion of the work at Cockburn Sound,pointed out that the reclamation work, certain parts of which were simply a matter of blowing down limestone and sifting sand, was costing more per cubic yard than the Eremantle Harbor Works, under exactly the same day labour system, were paying, although they had to blast rock, dredge it , and dump it into the sea 4 miles out.

Although the Brisbane was commissioned on 31st October, 1910, the accountant at the island hae only within the last month been able to arrive at the. approximate cost, which is now stated to be £.746,459. Obviously this does not include the full cost of the ship to the Commonwealth, as no charge has been included either for depreciation of plant or for interest on capital.

Sitting vote of £175,000, over £100,000 will be required in respect of the plant for the automatic exchange in Sydney, without which that great service cannot go on, and for the telephone exchange at Malvern That being so, there is not much l e f t for other works. [7.47] -Although a representative of a city constituency, I believe that the telephone facilities provided for country districts are not what they ought to be. WheneverI visit a country district I , in common with other representatives of city divisions, am charged with being unmindf u l of country interests. This complaint, however; is not well founded. City members are willing that the best possible telephone facilities should be provided for rural districts since the telephone is one of the absolute necessities of modern civilization. I appreciate the desire of the Postal Department that the telephone service should pay; but I fail to see why it should be expected to yield a profit. The provision of adequate telephone facilities incountry districts is of greater concern than the making of a profit. member know that we are already bearing 60 per cent, of the loss on many country telephone lines? the country or the metropolitanservice? vice. It finds money to subsidize country services. master-General's statement; but even a casual visitor to a country district will [252] recognise that increased telephone facilities are necessaiy. Country residents are not allowed to provide a service which they think would be sufficient for their requirements; they must conform to a Departmental condition. tions lines might be erected which would not give the expected service-, and endless trouble would arise. so, country people would be satisfied with a service that did not come up to the maximum requirements of the Department. Newspapers voice the cry that we hear, in rural districts, that our public suspended from 6.30 to 7.£5 p.m. expenditure is, for the most part, for the benefit of city constituencies. The Postal Institute, which was opened yesterday, will undoubtedly improve the service, but in connection with that and many other outlays, we are charged -with catering for city requirements, and overlooking country wants. I should certainly like a better telephone service to be provided for country residents. I am well aware that the Postmaster-General, who is himself a representative of a rural division, has given this matter consideration; but I hope he will look into it further. Many city residents who complain of a slight increase in the telephone charges would be prepared to double the present rate rather than be deprived of the service, and if the telephone is absolutely necessary in the closely-populated metropolitan areas, how much more necessary must it be in scattered country districts? The telephone to-day in every country is an actual necessity of civilization, and I think the Postmaster-General, in the very near future, should ask the Treasurer to provide him with more money with which to extend the telephone service in .country districts. for failing to give the Postmaster-General honourable the money he wants. from time to time publish statements I believe that is so. about the waste of public money here and there, and are pleased to refer to the present Administration as ""a spendt h r if t Government.""

Of these vessels, twenty-seven are of steel and twenty-four are of wood. The steel ships are 5,500 tons dead-weight capacity, while the wooden ships are 2,300 tons, and some 2,600 tons. A t present six of the steel ships are in course of construcin my opinion, an exceptionally capable tion, and one, the first, will be launched at ""Williamstown by, I think, the end of the year. ""We have a large quantityseveral hundred tons-of the material already riveted, and a start will be made on the assembling of the second vessel alon the hulls of steel ships-is quite equal most immediately. At ""Walsh Island there are three steel vessels laid down, and the first of these will be launched about February next. Island one of the vessels, a collier, will shortly be finished, and a mercantile ship will go on what is known as the Adelaide slip. There aTe now employed, directly and indirectly, on this shipbuilding some 1,200 men. niunber of men employed is small compared with what there will he in the future. [252]-2 ' when the work was started on the mercantile ship, only forty men were employed, and that at least six months is occupied on the preliminary work, seeing that a ship has to be constructed, practically in wood before a hole is drilled in the steel. I am pleased to say that the results up to date, so far as the labour is concerned, are very satisfactory indeed. The only difficulty that we have, and it is in consequence of the war, is that we have to pay a veTy high price for steel. . In this connection, however, we do suffer in comparison with the cost of steel in the Old Country. According to the last report of the Board of Trade, it is estimated that the price of rebuilding the ships after the war is over, to replace those lost through submarines, will cost £103,500,000 i u the Old Country, on a basis of £29 per ton. I may say that I have let contracts here at prices which it may be interesting to compare with those placed in other parts of the world. Here there is an arrangement as between the three Government shipbuilding. Honourable yards at ""Williamstown, Cockatoo, and ""Walsh Island that the price paid at all shall be that at Williamstown; that is to say, if the cost be £28, £29, OT £30 at Williamstown, that is the price paid at all the Government yards. rest and wear and tear to machinery? thing. The manager at Williamstown is, man, and in a newspaper interview he stated that the work done at Williamstown, although it had to be started with raw hands-and even boilermakers have much to learn when they are first placed to that done at any yard in the Old Country or in the United States of America, under similar circumstances. The report At Cockatoo of the Commission appointed by the English Board of Trade .shows that to make good the losses in mercantile steel shipping in the United Kingdom to the end of 1917, will cost £103,500,000. The total loss of the world's shipping . was 13,000,000 tons deadweight.

If there had been no war, and the shipping had increased at the normal rate, there would have been at the end of 1915 27,000,000 tons; -at the end of 1916, 28,000,000 tons; and at the end of 1917, 29,000,000 tons.

Instead, the total world shipping at the end of 1917 was -21,000,000 tons, showing a shortage of about 33 per cent. When I tell honourable members that the total British steam shipping at the same date was only about 11,000,000 tons, they can realize what the loss in tonnage has been. In order that construction might be spread over all the States, and that as many keels as possible should be laidbecause the output depends upon the number of slips in operationI found it necessary to make contracts with private firms. do not construct for profit, but private concerns must get a return for the capital they have invested. A f t e r a thorough investigation of the subject, and a consultation with the Acting Prime Minister, I came to the conclusion that we could not get private shipyards to undertake shipbuilding unless we made some arrangement as to the maximum profit they should derive. Finally, it was suggested that they should receive 1 \ per cent, on the turnover. But the trouble I apprehended was that the higher the cost of the ship the more profit the builder would derive, and in that way there would be an incentive to increase rather than keep down the cost of construction. some difliculty I arranged a scale of payments which has the very opposite effect, and it applies to the two big firms which have undertaken the construction of eight steel ships. The scale of profit starts on a basis of £ 2 6 per ton. turned out at that price, the builder will make a profit of £13,000, or a little over 1 \ per cent., and the ship will cost the Oommonwealth £156,000.. As the 'cost But that does not tell -all per ton increases the profit decreases, unt i l on a ship which cost the maximum ;of £ 3 3 per ton-and all constructing costs are subject to inspection by the departmental officers-the builder will receive no profit at all. I claim that this scheme will have a tendency to speed up construction whilst keeping costs down to a m in i mum.. Honourable members may be curious as to how our maximum cost of £ 3 3 1 per ton for privately constructed ships compares with American prices. PriorA lot of those ships would to entering into this agreement, I cabled to America for information as to the rates paid there for a similar class of construcA t the tion, and the reply was $190 to $200, or £38 to £ 4 0 per ton. I assume that that is the average price. British estimates of costs in connection with the restoration of British tonnage to the pre-war standard are based on an average cost of £ 2 9 per ton. raw material compare? of raw material in England is much higher than it was before the war, but not nearly as high as it is in Australia. Steel plates in England cost £11 10s.' per ton, as against £ 3 0 in Australia. Steel sheets in England cost £16 5s. peT ton, as against £49 10s. and £54 10s. in AusOf course Government shipyards tralia. The advance in the price in England is largely due to the increased cost of labour. One of the most pleasing features in connection with the shipbuilding scheme is the interest that the workmen are taking in it . It is true that one organization, the Amalgamated Society of Engineers, has refused to enter into agreement with the Commonwealth, but there are thirty-one organizations connected with the scheme, and nearly all the men are on piece-work. Honourable members may see at Williamstown what is being done by the men on the piece-work system. Mr Curchin assured me to-day that the cost of labour is very satisfactory; his A fte r only complaint is of having to pa*r £ 3 0 per ton for steel plates. Of course, we cannot avoid that, because, even if we attempted to get the steel from England and shipping were available, it would cost us more than £ 3 0 per ton landed here.

That after the word ""adopted,"" line 3, the words "" for the duration of. the war"" be inserted. do not propose to debate the motion at any length. In my opinion, the Government is making a mistake in proposing it, because there is no need for curtailing members' speeches. Ministers may plead that they are busily occupied with war work, but it must be remembered that every Minister has handed over a great Boards of various kinds. We were told, when this Ministry was formed, that we were to have a return to responsible goless responsibility than this. No Ministry has had the assistance of so many persons in various walks of life outside Parliament; estimable men, of wide experience, but men absolutely without responsibility to the electors. Ministers cannot plead that they have little time for atten-: tion to parliamentary duties. Take the question of wool tops, which-the Acting Prime Minister( Mr Watt) says is burnt into his brain. It has been handed to Sir John Higgins and the Central Wool Committee. So with a hundred other governmental activities. Ministers could meet Parliament during several additional months' of the year, and provide opportunity for the discussion of their various measures. Their proposal is calculated to drive us to the press for the discussion of public affairs, which will mean that Parliament will lose its standing, and the country will be governed by the newspapers issued from the offices in Collins-street, Melbourne; King and Hunter streets,' Sydney; and the other cities of the Commonwealth. cease then? liamentary institutions have come tb be deemed by the public at large,, as they are now by a section of it, a mere excrescence.

At the present time legislation is too hurried. A little while ago the Ministry introduced a B ill to impose a tax on eligibles. It was driven through the House, memhers not being allowed to discuss it fTeely. Had a ful l discussion been allowed, probably the Government would not have proceeded with the Bill. Asi t was, it became law, but has never been put into operation. Then, when the Loan Bill was before us, and the honourable member for Grey( Mr Poynton) proposed that the Government be instructed to issue no more loans with, interest free of taxation, the "" gag "" was moved after the proposal had been under discussion for about an hour, and the Government proposal was carried. A few months later the Government adopted the suggestion of the honourable member, and now the interest paid on war loans is subject to income tax. The Government may pass this motion, and they may or may not put into operation the proposed new standing order. I . a m inclined to think that the guillotine will operate before the session closes. If it does, we shall have a great deal of slip-shod legislation, which either will not be put into operation or will have to be repealed by subsequent Parliaments. I protest against what is being done. The passing of this motion will be one of the things for which the public will punish the Ministry at the next elections. enter my protest against the proposed standing order. Before proposing the drastic curtailment of debate, Ministers should show that members are abusing their freedom of speech.

Under the new standing order it can be determined by a vote of the House how many members shall be allowed to speak on a question, and how much time shall be allowed for the discussion of any measure. All that will be necessary will be to declare the business urgent, whether it be a Bill or a set of Estimates. The time that shall be allotted for the discussion of a proposal is to be fixed, and thus members are to be prevented from giving expression to the views of those who sent them here. I warn Ministers not to go too far. Proposals like this may have a boomerang effect. The time may not be far distant when ""those now in office may be no longer enjoying their snug positions. The whirligig of time may place some other party on the Treasury bench. What will honourable members opposite say then if this standing order is applied to them? The proposed standing order directly restricts the freedom of debate, and makes Parliament a mere machine for churning out legislation.

Is legislation to be carried without reasonable debate merely because it is declared by the Government and their supporters to be of an urgent character? Only two or three members of the Opposition will be allowed to speak on any measure declared to be of an urgent character. Surely we ought not to legislate in such a way for a country that is passing through a time of crisis. We should carefully consider all the business put before us. We have confronting us to-day the most serious problems. If we are to have this limitation placed upon the discussion of measures in this House, how are we to properly consider the great after-war problems with which we shall have to deal ? How can we hope, for instance, to deal adequately with the great question of Australia's trade relations with other countries, which must receive our attention as soon as the war is over? Are such questions to be disposed of after a discussion extending over a few minutes? I am convinced that if the Government and their supporters were to give serious consideration to this standing order, they would recognise the danger of it , to not only the Parliament, t h i r t y minutes, and It h in k ' the Gobut the people. I urge the Government, in the interests of the Commonwealth, to withdraw the motion, since the existing Standing Orders are quite ample to provide for the proper conduct of business in this Chamber.

My experience of this House is short, ""but I have given close attention to the measures which Have been p u t before us since I was returned to Parliament, and it seems to me that the great defect of this proposal is that it will lead to questions of special importance receiving less attention than is given to measures of minor significance.

If ever there is a period when members of Parliament should have f u l l opportunity to express their views it is during the period of the war, when necessarily there is legislation quite new to both Parliament and to the country.

The honourable member for Grampians ( Mr Jowett) remarked that most of the matters that come under our consideration are very serious, and that is quite true. For instance, there are the taxation proposals; and out of regard for those whom one honourable member has described as the "" victims,"" these proposals ought to be discussed f u l l y and freely. There are great differences of opinion as to war taxation, even between city constituencies and country constituencies. ber will not be in order in going into that subject; the question before us is simply the question of the duration of the proposed standing order. proposal that it is very difficult for a man. of liberal views to keep within bounds; indeed, it makes hi m question whether he is really in a Parliament. If tbe Government desire to keep this House in such a temper as to .prove of assistance in the work of legislation, they ought not, -The honourable especially during war time, to attempt to persecute honourable members in this way. rushed As has already been pointed out, there is no justification for such a proposal; no concrete case has been cited showing anv necessity for it . A Parliament of men should have sufficient spirit to resist the temptation to smother discussion on questions of great importance to the people. Are we a Parliament of pigmies, or what are we ? If we are men, we ought to have sufficient Backbone to resist tyranny of this sort I cannot think that after this debate honourable members opposite can seriously agree with this motion-thi s unwarrantable proposal. When the present occupants of the Government benches were in Opposition, their utterances against the Government of the day were almost intolerable, under circumstances less serious than those of the present time. If I were asked for a good electioneering cry for honourable members on this side, I I "" rise to a point of could suggest nothing better than that the Government should introduce a motion of this kind during war time, for I am listening to nothing Would appeal more to the people than an attempt on the part of the Government to bludgeon those who differ from them. In all my experience of ParliaI n the British Parliament I have never known an Opposition more anxious than the present one to assist the Government, and a motion of this kind is a stigma on the Parliaments of Australia. It will go forth to. the world that this Parliament is prepared to smother freedom of speech on the part of the people's representatives.

When the Leader of the Opposition rises in the Imperial Parliament, the Government are anxious to know what the members on the f r o n t Opposition bench think of the proposal before the House, and until the view of the Opposition is obtained no measure is regarded as having a possibility of becoming law.

House there is an overwhelming majority on the Ministerial side, and if the Government, acting under this proposed standing order, were to place a time limit on a certain debate, Mr Speaker, following the usual practice, would call upon honourable members from each side of the House alternately. members sitting in Opposition would have the same share of time as the much larger number of members on the Ministerial side, and many of the majority members would be deprived of the opportunity of participating in the debate. That would not be fair. After the next election there may be quite, a different distribution of parties. regard this proposal not as a party matter, but as one affecting the privileges of the House, and we should all unite in order to deal with legislation,, especially war-time legislation, in a way that will best serve the interests of the people. The amendment whioh I intend to move will reduce by half the time allowed to each speaker. present limit certain speeches to 1 hour 85 minutes each; other speeches to 1 hour each, and speeches in Committee to halfan-hour. times by 50 per cent., to give twice as many members an opportunity of contributing to any debate upon which the Government impose the time limit. not propose at this stage that this limitation of individual speeches should be applied to all debates. for consideration as to * whether there should be a further general reduction of the time now allowed by the Standing Orders for each speech, but the amendMr Sampson. The allotted time ment I intend to propose will apply only to those debates which will be affected by the suggested new standing order. I think the amendment would immensely improve the motion that is now before the House, would help to preserve the privileges of honourable members, and would enable the bulk of those who wish to contribute to a debate, to do so. We must give consideration to"" the fact I think that an economy that the Government would not declare measures to be urgent unless there was very good reason for doing so. An amendment of the Standing Orders in 1905 gave the Government the opporIn the present constitution of the tunity to apply the closure to a debate and also to silence any individual member. There have been occasions when that standing order has been applied drastically, but we know that Governments have learned certain lessons from its operation. I believe that no Government would exercise its. right to apply Thus honourable the closure unless there was big justification for it , and Ministers would only attempt to declare a measure urgent after a very grave consideration of the consequences that might follow their use of this power too lightly, or too frequently. I do not fear the consequences of allowing a responsible Government to make use of the opportunity to declare a But we should measure urgent so long as it is found possible at the same time to safeguard honourable members from being deprived of their right to make a proper contribution to the discussion. proposed amendment would not accomplish that object. The Standing Orders at standing order is adopted in its present form, some honourable members, by using the full time allowed to each honourable member to speak, would exhaust the I propose, by reducing those whole of the time allotted by the Government for the debate on the measure; but my amendment would at least enable double the number of honourable members.

If a debate is carried on to an inordinate extent, the Government may fix an early hour for the con' elusion of it , just as they may now apply the closure; but I conclude that they w ill follow the House of Commons practice, and declare that a debate must close ' within twenty-four hours, or forty-eight hours, or on a day in the'following'week. However, the Government cannot take away the privileges of the House. Honourable members have, first of all, to vote on the motion when the Government bring it forward; and I do not think that honourable -members of the Opposition will find honourable members on this side of the House allowing any Government to get up and declare measure after measure to be urgent, and secure a majority of honourable members to support them in ' doing so unless reasonable time is.afforded for the conduct of debate. I think that, with a further limitation on speeches, we will have better speeches. They will be more condensed, and thus will be more valuable contributions to the debates. In fact, the proposal should tend to improve our legislation. A t the same time, my amendment will afford honourable members an opportunity to express their views and make any representations they may wish to make according to the particular interests they represent. not in favour of the. amendment submitted by the honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr Kelly) . I agree with the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Tudor) that measures brought forward during'a time of war are of such importance that we should have just as much opportunity of discussing them as we would have in time of peace. Instead of seeking to defeat the Government's proposal, it should be our endeavour to improve it so that the object sought may be attained, while at the same time the privileges of honourable members are not too seriously curtailed. It seems to me that the phrase the gladiators of ancient Borne made use of, ' ' We who are about to die salute the, Caesar,"" is appropriate. on the Ministerial side. The gladiators are on this side, fighting for a little more freedom of speech. Whether we shall die or not, politically, the f u t u r e alone coming if we had a full House to hear the can show. As long as I have speech, I shall continue to object to the curtailment of the very limited powers we now have. The Government which is asking for this additional power has allowed work to accumulate day by ^ day which should be done by Parliament, and it must accept the blame for any congestion that may occur. I am perfectly certain that if the people had the initiative referendum and recall there would be no need for this motion. The existing Standing Orders would be quite sufficient. It is the duty of Parliament to clear off every motion on the notice-paper. There are many awaiting discussion by this House, yet I can say without contradiction that I am the only private member who has succeeded in carrying a motion here since the war began. The very idea of having a day set apart for private members' business is a farce. The Government would be far more straightforward and honourable if they would say to the people, "" Y o u r members oan bring forward no private business."" Couch this motion in whatever language one likes, even if it be amended as the honourable member for Wimmera proposes to amend it , it will be understood by the people of Australia to mean a furthe r limitation upon the already limited amount of business in which the Government permit private members to take part. One factor that causes so much I am debate is the absence of control by the people. The wide spaces of Australia do not tend to cause excess of talk during debate. If honourable members spoke in three separate languages our proceedings would ocoupy a greater time. If , for instance, the Postmaster-General made one of his famous speeches, and it had to be_ translated into another language for the benefit of honourable members, and then a second time had to be translated into another language, our debates would be greatly prolonged. Three languages are spoken in the Swiss Parliament. If one member ""of that Parliament makes a lengthy speech, and the representative of a German-speaking State claimed to have it translated, as he has the righ t to do, and then a representative of one of the. French Cantons, made the same claim, as The Csesars are he has the righ t to do, the proceedings would be unending. honourable member. [Quorum formed.] '",63,Limitation Of Debate

We now propose to add a whole page to the already overburdened book of temporary Standing Orders which contain those rules. W h y is it that Switzerland can do without a rule of this kind ? The only difference between the winter and summer sessions in Switzerland is that in the winter time the meeting is at 9 o'clock.

The honourable member' stated that the Secretary to the Naval letter which was incorrect, and had misled him.

The Navy Department had a claim on the services of another tug, which bad been transferred to the State Department some years ago, and, in satisfaction of this claim, the Albert He was again was accepted, free of cost, by the Navy Department, as a tug was required for duty in connection with dredging at Flinders Naval Base. Before the Albert was accepted, she was surveyed by a Board of technical officers, who reported that an expenditure of £4,600 would render her quite efficient for the service required. The vessel was accordingly sent to Cockatoo Island, Sydney, under her own steam, for overhaul; but when the ship was opened out, and the boiler removed, it was found that a new boiler and considerable repairs would be required. The Naval Board would not approve an expenditure in excess of what the original report of survey stated would be necessary, and as the vessel could not be put to any useful purpose without a considerable expenditure, The honortenders were invited, and she was sold to the highest bidder for £806. The Department has no knowledge of how the engines of the vessel were disposed of by the purchaser. No letter has been received I wish to from Mr Kelly making any inquiry about this vessel.

The Censor, in dealing with that pamphlet, allowed all the words of that clause to stand except, "" with a view to their total abolition."" Then in sub-clause i of the same clause there appeared the words, "" the organization of workers and other associations with a definite view to ending war."" whole of that to be struck out. I fail to see, and I think honourable members on both sides will agree with me, that there is anything in the phraseology of this platthe direction of peace are at present form or in the words ordered to-be elimif nated, calculated to "" help the enemy,"" ""prejudice recruiting,"" or ""involve the safety of the Commonwealth"" the phrases which are utilized by the Censor when he cuts out what he regards as objectionable portions of documents or speeches from time to time. : nothing objectionable from any point of view. say. The Peace Alliance was formed long prior to the war, with a view to inculcating love of peace generally. We have been told that the object, or one of the objects, for which this war is being waged is to render future war impossible -that it is a war to end war. Mr ""WATT -Some speeches are all right in the afternoon, but are no good at night, and some proposals about peace are good at certain times, and not good at others. There are two hints in this interjection. the other "" h in t "" the censor got -The Acting Prime Minister will admit, if he examines the platform of the Peace Alli ance, and reads the words which the censor has struck out Mr ""WATT -Why not show me some of these things, and not make long speeches about them here? the Acting Prime Minister to know, without being told, what comes under his juristhe House. diction. Of course, the honourable gentleman cannot know everything, but honourable members have repeatedly drawn his attention to the escapades of the censor. I do not think that the words struck out of this pamphlet would come under the parliamentary ban. honourable member on either side could speak in advocacy of all the planks of the Peace Alliance platform, and not have his remarks objected to by the Crown Law authorities, or find any action taken by Mr Speaker to have them .eliminated from Hansard. Why is it that the censor is not given some direction as to the procedure he should adopt-som e definite lines to go on? Why is not'some Minister made responsible for the censor's actions, The Censor caused the so that the censor may be checked ? There is no redress for censorship of the kind to which I have drawn attention. People who desire to promulgate their views in harassed by the censor; and we know that the regulations concerning outside matters have been considerably tightened up with a view to giving the censor more power. Nobody could say that this pamphlet, or the words eliminated, could affect the issue of the war one whit; it merely inculcates peace sentiment, which should be encouraged and not suppressed by the censor. should he leave in some of the words I have quoted and cut out others? There does not seem to be any. sane principle guiding the censorship. the pamphlet which should have been cut out before those quoted by the honourable member. It is something like the man who cut the tail off the dog and threw away the wrong piece. anything about such surgical operations, but I do not think it would be out of place if the censor were curtailed. The Acting Prime Minister must admit that, in this instance at least, the work of the censor has not been guided by any fixed principle. If the Acting Prime Minister, or the Cabinet generally, would take some measure to control the censor, or give him some definite line of action, honourable members would know where they were, and would not be repeatedly troubling I draw the ""attention of the Acting Prime Minister to the danger of what is known as the Spanish influenza.
