Wednesday, SO August, 1941. took tbe chair at 3 p.m., and read prayers. ister) -It is with much regret that I refer to the fact that on the 1st August the Honourable James George Drake, a member of the first Commonwealth Parliament and first Commonwealth Ministry, passed away in Brisbane. Mr Drake came to Australia from England as a young man. His early years in Australia were devoted to journalism, and subsequently he was admitted as a barrister of the Supreme Court of Queensland. His parliamentary career commenced in 1888, when he was elected to the Legislative Assembly, Queensland, for the Division of Enoggera, which seat he retained until 1899, when he was appointed Postmaster-General and Secretary for Public Instruction, with a seat in the Legislative Council. In February, 1901, he resigned from the State Ministry and Parliament, and successfully contested the election for the Senate. . The late Mr Drake held the portfolio of Postmaster-General in the Barton Ministry from February, 1901, to August, 1903. Later, he was Minister for Defence in the same Ministry for a short period, and became Attorney-General in the first Deakin Ministry which held office from September, 1903, to April, 1904. From August, 1904, to July, 1905, he was Vice President of the Executive Council in the Eeid-McLean Ministry. He retired from the Senate at the expiration of the second Parliament in 1906. Subsequently, the deceased gentleman became Crown Prosecutor in Queensland,",9,Cable Aits Wttua Bounty Aot 1941 No 29 Of 1941

2,Mr Menzies (Kooyong,"Prime Minaud held that position for eleven years. Although he had reached the age of 91 years at the time of his death, he retained an interest in public affairs almost to the last. This was perhaps natural in one who had been so prominently associated with the inauguration of the Commonwealth Parliament and Government. Prom the point of view of the Commonwealth there will be a special feeling of regret at his passing, because by his death the last surviving link with the first Commonwealth Ministry was severed. Members of the present Parliament, other than my colleague the Attorney General( Mr Hughes), will not have had any parliamentary association with the late Mr Drake, but his capable work as a senator and Commonwealth Minister is on record. I move That this House expresses its profound regret at the death of the Honourable James George Drake, a former member of the Senate of the Commonwealth Parliament and a former Minister of State, places on record its appreattained to the age of 91 years at the date ciation of his meritorious public service, and tenders its deep sympathy to the members of his family in their bereavement. the Opposition) -In seconding the motion, I endorse all that the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) has said. It was a high honour as well as a very great responsibility to be a member of the first Commonwealth Parliament; and, after 40 years of federation, I believe it will be acknowledged that it was an even greater responsibility to be a member of the first Commonwealth Administration. The late Mr Drake was the first gentleman to hold the office of Commonwealth Postmaster-General, and, as the Prime Minister has said, he was also one of the earlier holders of the portfolios of Defence and Attorney-General. His period of service extended over the first two Parliaments, and ensured for his name an enduring place in the annals of this country. I , of course, was too young at the time to have any realization of the work which the late Mr Drake did; but I have endeavoured to familiarize myself with what occurred at the foundation and during the early years of this federation, and I think it can be said that all of those who played a public part in that inaugural era were animated by a high conception of what they hoped would become a great nation. I feel confident that the late Mr Drake played a very important part in laying the foundations of the Commonwealth, and gave liberally of his undoubted talents to the work that he performed. On behalf of the Opposition, I pay tribute to his career and his memory. Treasurer and Leader of the Country Party) I associate the Country Party with the motion of appreciation of the public service rendered to the Commonwealth by the late Mr Drake, and the expressions of sympathy with those who have been left to mourn his loss. I had the privilege of personal acquaintance with the late Mr Drake, and had many opportunities to partake of his wonderful hospitality and to gain an insight into his character. He was a most interesting man. I met him within the last twelve months, and although he had of his death, the whole of his faculties were unimpaired and he maintained to the end a keen interest in political affairs generally. Question resolved in the affirmative, honourable members standing in their places. Minister) -Honorabl e members will have learnt with regret that Mr John Dunlop Millen, a former member of the Senate and a close personal friend of many members and senators, passed away at Launceston on the 1st August last. The late Mr Milieu's parliamentary career commenced in 1919, when he was elected to represent Tasmania in the Senate. He was re-elected at the general elections of 1925 and 1931, and retired on the 30th June, 1938, having been defeated at the general elections held in the previous year. During his membership of the Commonwealth Parliament, he served on the Joint Committee of Public Accounts from 1920 to 1925, and the Wireless Agreement Committee during 1921-1922. He will be remembered especially for his work as chairman of the Royal Commission on National",11,Death Of The Honourable James George Drake

He was always courteous, and the tolerance of his political outlook gained for him the esteem of those who were opposed to him. He was a man of real ability. Por many years, the Commonwealth Government had the benefit of his services as one of its directors on the Board of Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited. I move That this House expresses its profound' regret at the death of Mr John Dunlop Millen, a former member of the Senate of the Commonwealth Parliament, places on record its appreciation of his meritorious public service, and tenders its deep sympathy to his widow and family in their bereavement. the Opposition) -Al l of us in this Parliament knew Mr Millen very well. We admired his ability, and had a high appreciation of his sterling personal worth. He was a member of the 'Senatef or eighteen years, and during that time was associated with the passing of many important pieces of legislation. He displayed a wide knowledge of Australia's requirements, and brought to the consideration' of the problems of the Commonwealth a well-trained mind, and natural gifts of a high order.

Question resolved in the affirmative, honourable members standing in then places. THE REVEREND JAMES BLACK ister) -With regret I refer to the death in Melbourne on the 27th J u ly of the Honourable the Reverend James Black Ronald, who was also a member of the first Commonwealth Parliament. Mr Ronald arrived in Australia from Scotlandi n the year 1S88. He was elected to the House of Representatives ' for the division then known as Southern Melbourne at the general elections of 1901.. He was re-elected in 1903, but was defeated at the general elections in 1906. It w ill be within the knowledge of many honourable members that Mr Ronald's public career was in some respects a stressful one. The strength of character displayed by him over a long period won for him much public support and sympathy. It is worthy of mention that one of Mr Ronald's sons was killed in the 1914-18 war, and that another son recently won the Distinguished Service Order with the Australian Imperial Force abroad. I move That this House expresses its profound regret at the death of the Honourable James Black Ronald, a former member of this House and a member of the first Commonwealth Parliament, places on record its appreciation of his meritorious public service, and tenders its deep sympathy to the members of his family in their bereavement. Opposition) -There is nothing that I can say about Mr Ronald's membership of the first Parliament thai does not apply to all of those who were members of that Parliament.

He sat in the first two Commonwealth Parliaments, and was afterwards, I understand, one of that little band of original members who foregathered in Melbourne each (DarlingD o w n s year on the anniversary of the date on which the Commonwealth Parliament was first opened.

11,Mr Menzies (Kooyong,"Prime MinI t seems clear that the German time-table and strategy hare been seriously deranged. If the Russion forces can maintain their magnificent resistance for anpore and Malaya as a vital outpost of its other month or two, the German invader will, by reason of weather and ground, experience even more difficulties. We must be cautious in forming estimates or making prophecies, because the German mechanized power is enormous; but we can say quite safely that already the camJapan that their country is encircled by paign has substantially weakened the Germans' hitting force and has so occupied Germany's air force that widespread and successful bombing raids from Great Britain on a much greater scale than at any previous time have heen rendered possible. The important thing for us is not comfortably to watch the progress of events in Russia, but to use to the best advantage the breathing-space given to us by Russian resistance. Honourable members will at once see that any early and extensive Russian successes in the Ukraine and south Russia generally will have a real bearing upon our own strategic position in the Middle East. The importance of extended British raiding of Germany will appear if I say that during four nightB in one recent week the RoyalA i r Force dropped 700 tons of high explosive and 70,000 incendiary bombs on industrial {plants and similar targets in north-west Germany, whilst in a single daylight operation against objectives near Cologne, over 000 aircraft, including fighters, were engaged. In the Far East, the military occupaa result of recent discussions, asked me tion of French Indo-China by Japan has produced acute international complications. The move was regarded, both by the British Empire and the United States of America, as an unjustified act of aggression in a direction which was plainly of concern to both British and American vital interests. measures of an economic kind were therefore adopted, with substantial effects upon Japanese oversea trade. Subsequently, Japan has heen in discussion with Thailand, the importance of which will be at once clear to all honourable members who glance at the map. WhilstI do not desire to say anything that will impair the cause of peace in the Mr Menzies. Pacific, I should be saying lees than the people of this country feel if I did not point out that Australia regards Singaown defence, and that whilst we are a friendly and peace-loving people, we do not propose to abandon any of our defences or avoid any sacrifice which their maintenance may render necessary. It has been said hy some spokesmen for the ABCD powers-as I understand it, hy the Americans, British, Chinese and Dutch. If this talk of ""encirclement"" is a mere reference to geographical position, then it is no better and no worse founded to-day than it was 50 years ago. Buti f it is intended to create the belief that the Americans, British, Chinese and Dutch are contemplating an encircling military movement against Japan, or any policy of aggression against that country, it can he said positively that this allegation is utterly untrue. We remind Japan that it entered French Indo-China; it is Japan which has apparently formulated demands or requests to Thailand. It is Japan's acts, not ours, that have created tension. If the tension is to be relieved as we all sincerely hope it will be, Japan has the means of relief to its own hands. There is a long history, and indeed tradition, of friendship between Japan and Australia, but occasionally it is a good thing even for friends to talk plainly and honestly to each other. My colleagues in the Cabinet have, as to pay another visit to London. Having regard to the balance of parties in Parliament, I have indicated that it would not be practicable for me to go abroad at present, except with the approval of all parties. Therefore I propose to ask honourable Countermembers to attend party meetings at which the proposal can be discussed. In the meantime, all that I need say is this: The war is characterized by extraordinarily sudden changes and developments. Less than three months have elapsed since I returned to Australia, but in that time we have seen the invasion of Russia by Germany, the conquest of Syria by British forces; the Japanese occupation of French Indo-China, with all the tension consequent upon it, and the momentous meeting between the Prime Minister of Great Britain and the President of the United States of America. Each of these events has a great interest and significance for Australia. The events in Bussia and the Middle East may well affect the whole strategy of the Middle Eastern zone; the occupation of French Indo-China, coupled with the subsequent discussions between Japan and Thailand are clearly of first-class importance to Singapore and Australia, to say nothing of the Netherlands East Indies. Both matters, taken together, raise questions as to the disposition, mainvisiting Prime Minister will be weltenance and equipment of Australian overseas armies. The meeting between the Prime Minister and the President has opened up a new vista of BritishAmerican collaboration, not only in the field of military supply but also in the economic field generally. In all these matters, it is, in the opinion of my colleagues and myself, of great importance that Australia's voice should be directly heard in. the place in which the major decisions are inevitably made. When I say this, I do not offer any purposes connected with the discussion criticism of the Prime Minister of Great of war policy and related matters is not Britain or of his War Cabinet. In my to be a member of the War Cabinet, he visit earlier in the year, I found them will largely duplicate, without necessarily in the highest degree co-operative, willing improving, the work of the High Comto listen to the Australian view, willing missioner. to attach significance and weight to special Australian interests. Buti t is discussion still true that each member of this I lay on the table the following paper:British Commonwealth of Nations has its own method of approach; its own point of view. The best results for the British Empire as a whole will be achieved by having matters of high war policy which concern any particular dominion disand movecussed freely and frankly at the right place by an authoritative spokesman of that dominion. Experience has shown adjourned. this, and I doubt whether anybody would deny it. Nobody recognizes more clearly than I do the impracticability of a Prime Minisaspects of the matters to which I have ter of Australia being indefinitely, or for referred which honourable members may a prolonged period, absent from his own think can be discussed more freely in country; but that limitation in point of a private meeting. I , therefore, direct time leaves the force of the general proattention to the presence of strangers in position quite unimpaired. May I just add a few words about the suggestion which has been made in some quarters that an Australian Minister other than the Prime Minister, whoever the Prime Minister may be, can automatically occupy a seat in Mr Churchill's War Cabinet. This suggestion lacks foundation. Honourable members will at once perceive that if one dominion can claim such a position as of right, so can all the dominions, and if that claim were granted the British War Cabinet would be very greatly enlarged. In the course of the war, the British Prime Minister has made it clear that as a matter of courtesy between the self governing portions of the Empire, any comed at meetings of his War Cabinet. But there is no warrant for the belief that such a rule can be extended merely at the will of a particular dominion. I say nothing at this stage about the merits of dominions representation in the British War Cabinet. I merely point out that it is a problem as yet unsolved, the merits of which would normally no doubt be discussed at an Imperial Conference, if the holding of such a conference were practicable.

The only proposal is that the Prime Minister shall go abroad, and that can be discussed in public with the Hansard reporters present when the House resumes its ordinary procedure. It is very desirable that every honourable member here, who is responsible for making decisions in this matter, should be as fully equipped as possible to make those decisions on their merits. I , therefore, believe that Ministers and all honourable members who have information to impart owe it to their fellow counsellors to impart it to them.

The honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward) referred, with perhaps some justification, to certain incidents at an earlier private meeting, and I hope that there will be no more incidents of that kind; nevertheless, we cannot get away from the fact that Ministers are responsible for what they say. Naturally, in a place like this, and in secrecy, Ministers may be tempted or prompted to say things which would not be said in open debate. I cannot see the usefulness of Hansard remaining here. I am still very doubtful of the usefulness of secret meetings. They begin nowhere, go nowhere, and end nowhere, and the decisions which this country so badly needs will not be arrived at by these methods. Question resolved in the affirmative.

I am sure that the Government will comply with my request, and therefore I content myself with bringing the matter to its attention. I ask the Prime Minister whether he will make a statement, as early as possible, upon the amount of assistance which the Australian Government proposes to give to Russia in the common fight against Nazi tyranny. Can Australia supply Russia with any surplus products, such as wheat, wool and lamb? Have any representations been made to the British authorities in order to secure ships to transport these goods? The Government should do all that lies within, its power to help the Russian armies, which are resisting, against great odds, the invaders of their country. Has the Prime Minister been approached by the British authorities with regard to the sending of diplomatic representatives from Australia to Russia, or the opening of trade discussions with the Russian people? I shall be glad if the right honourable gentleman will supply to the House this and any other information that may be in his possession. member will allow me to give such answers as I can to-morrow. I bring to the notice of the Government a matter of great importance, not only to my electorate, but also to every other rural effect of war-time activities upon country towns. suffered considerably owing to the loss of many young men who have either enlisted in the armed forces or improved their lot by moving to the cities and undertaking munition and other wartime work. This problem should be viewed beyan, in my electorate, there are about 80 empty houses. In one town which I visited a fortnight ago there were 30 or 40 empty shops. The man-power of these places has been drained into the cities. Some people consider that this movement of population is inevitable in war-time. I disagree with them. The Government could do a great deal more than it has done in order to help rural communities by encouraging the establishment of small industries. The Man-power and Resources Survey Committee is considering this problem, but the collation of evidence and the preparation of reports is a elow process. By allowing the drift to the cities to continue, the Government is creating difiiculties that must be overcome after the war. When peace returns we shall have great difficulty in bringing our young men back to the country. Before then they will become city-minded and will grow to like the bright lights. There has been much talk about this problem; the time for action is long overdue. For the last twelve months the Government has been promising to establish a munitions factory inGoulburn, the ""fourth most populous town, in New South Wales. It has great industrial facilities and plenty of homes are available there for workers. Nevertheless, the plan has not gone beyond the stage' of discussion, although I have consulted Ministers and written letters to them on the subject. In the meantime Goulburn, and many other country towns, are suffering from economic starvation. I speak for the whole of Australia. As a member of the Parliamentary Committee on the Apple and Pear IndustryI have travelled widely in recent months, and I have seen the devastation caused in country towns by the departure of their young men. We want to win this war, but we are neglecting to take precautions against conditions that will cause us trouble electorate in Australia-the when we have gained victory.

But still the Government encourages our young men to desert their homes in the country. In company with a number of honourable members opposite I visited Russia a few years ago. Even then the Russians had realized the danger of concentrating their important industries in Moscow and Leningrad. They planned to build their factories in remote areas. It is obvious now that they followed the right course. If the Germans capture Leningrad and Moscow they will not have captured industrial Russia. That country will still be able to live on its resources I know that housing is a vital question in the rural districts. A different state of affairs exists in Australia. A few bombs dropped on 'Sydney and Melbourne could blow our key industries to glory. Something should be done to safeguard the nation and, at the same time, to help our country towns. The Government should not wait to receive the full report of the Man-power and Resources Survey Committee before it takes action. Scores of towns throughout Australia are in need of assistance. ""We cannot help every one of them, hut we can keep the people country-minded, and give the best of our country centres a chance to flourish and develop when the war is ended. If the Government takes the right steps now, it will have less troubles to face when the war is ended. direct attention to several matters that he was recommended for the Disare exercising the minds of some of my tinguished Flying Medal.

The matter is urgent and I hope that the Minister for the Army will make a decision on it forthwith. The next subject to which I refer concerns the urgent need for additional housing for persons employed in munitions works at 'Castlemaine, Victoria. The Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Holt) sent an officer to Castlemaine to make a report on the subject. At present the munitions workers in that very old town are living under housing conditions that are totally unsatisfactory. in the Maribyrnong district, but it is not less urgent at Castlemaine, where many of the houses are old and dilapidated. The need may be even greater at Castlemaine. I ask the Minister to make available to me the report of his officer on this subject. The need for prompt action is acute, and I request immediate attention to the subject. Honourable members may have seen in the press last week reports to the effect that an Australian air gunner serving in a British squadron was mortally wounded while taking an important part in an air action and did not disclose how dangerously he was injured.

As a matter of fact many transport drivers were receiving the extra ls. a day, but it was subsequently taken from them. I know of men working at the transport depot, Addison-road, Sydney, who were receiving the extra shilling and were afterwards deprived of it. This caused great dissatisfaction, as well may he understood. From inquiries I have made, I have learned that transport drivers in the Royal Australian Air Force have been receiving the extra amount for some time. I hope that the Minister for the Army( Mr Spender) will see that military transport drivers are granted this specialist rate to which they consider the Opposition bring under notice in this they are entitled. Another important subject which requires urgent consideration from the Government is the re-ahsorption into industry of many men who had been discharged from the Army. These men enlisted but, through no fault of their own, did not leave Australia. They were received as medically fit and were afterwards discharged as medically unfit. The Repatriation Department will not even register them for employment on the ground that it has to deal only with men who had been abroad and had received a satisfactory discharge. Some of the men to whom I refer were kept in camp for twelve months or more before being discharged. They were willing to go abroad and expected to do so. Dissatisfaction is also increasing on account of the treatment that some ex-soldiers who have returned from this war have received from the military authorities. The practice is to grant them susofficers, taking precedence over men who tenance for a period of three monthsI speak subject to correction as to the term -and , if they have not been found employment by the expiry of their sustenance period, to advise them to register at the State labour bureaux. Any honourable member who has had experience of State labour bureaux in the last few years will know that many thousands of registered men have been waiting for years for employment and have not been able to obtain it . It is remarkable that a Government which makes so many statements about the necessity to employ all the labour available in connection with the life and death struggle in which the nation is engaged should allow any manpower to remain unused. In fact, people who are unemployed are not even granted proper sustenance although, according to press advertisements, we must "" fight the enemy in the kitchen "", and eat as much lamb, fruit and dairy produce as possible. The present position is anomalous and the Government should correct it at once. It is not possible for me to give the names of my informants on these matters, for members of the Defence Forces are not permitted to approach members of Parliament on such subjects; but the Government may take it for granted that complaints of this nature, which members of House, are based on information furnished by members and ex-members of the fighting forces. In my opinion, it is quite wrong that the members of the forces should be liable to punishment if they approach members of Parliament on such matters. The proper thing for them to do is surely to bring their grievances to the attention of their parliamentary representatives. Another subject which calls loudly for attention is the method by which promotions are made in the Army. This is causing grave discontent in Sydney and, I have no doubt, in other capital cities and elsewhere in Australia. We hear in Sydney about ""social pets"" being shepherded into "" Romano's "" or "" the Prince's Own"" or some other fancy regiment. These social pets are then sent to various military schools, where they receive some training. Afterwards they are sent out as have had years of practical experience in the military service. The system is all wrong. I do not know what the present position is, hut at the outbreak of the war an instruction given was that no man over the age of 27 years was to be granted a commission. The result of that instruction was that men who served in the last war and were comparatively young when the war ended, have been denied promotion to commissioned rank. As these men not only served in the last war but also joined up with our Militia Forces in a voluntary capacity years ago and maintained constant touch with military activities, it ia most unfair that they should be superseded hy carefully selected social darlings who have joined the fighting services within the last few months. The whole procedure is causing dissatisfaction and rightly so. It would cause dissatisfaction anywhere. administration of these matters is faulty. A few days ago I read in the press that an officer returning from Darwin had said that the men there were enthusiastic and happy, but I , and no doubt many other honourable members of this Parliament, have received letters from members of the complaining of the conditions, and claiming that accommodation and the food are not everything that could be desired. I realize that at times difiiculties arise for which nobody can be held directly responsible, but it is tihe duty of the military authorities and the Government to remove as quickly as possible any cause for complaint among our troops in the northern areas. I bring these matters under the notice of the Minister hoping that he will give to them his immediate attention. We do not know how infrequently Parliament will meet and these matters are urgent. [10.22] I should like to direct attention week a scathing indictment of workers' once .again to a matter which I raised in this House more than a year ago, namely, air raid precautions in Darwin. I have been prompted to bring this matter under notice at this stage because there is now a Minister for Home Security. The Treasurer ( Mr Padden) will recall that last session he promised that Darwin would not be forgotten in the Estimates. When that assurance was given, I imagined that adequate money would be made available for the provision of air raid precaution shelters in Darwin, which is admirably suited for tunnelling because the land rises sharply to 100 feet above sea-level, but the last paper which I have received from Darwin reveals that there is considerable dissatisfaction there. Although blackouts are being imposed at regular intervals there is not sufficient money available to carry out all the air raid precaution work that is necessary. It must be remembered that unlike other Australian cities, Darwin is on the edge of the foreign world. Apparently, some honourable members have a poorly developed geographical sense. I consider that it is a matter of grave urgency that money should be made available immediately for this important workThe entire I am glad to see that the report of the city planner of Brisbane, Mr Mclnnis, on the town planning of Darwin has already been boundI obtained a copy to-day from the secretary of the Departbut I regret that there has been apathy on the part of the Government towards forces in Darwin, providing money to implement the recommendations contained in that report. Mr Mclnnis is one of the few people in this country who have the distinction of being a member of the Town Planning Institute of London. When I saw Mr Mclnnis recently, he said that he wished to thank all officers of the department who had assisted him, but as there was no town council in Darwin, he did not expect that anything would be done. I urge that the old Darwin town council be reconstituted so that civic pride may be engendered and planning carried out in that town which is the gateway to Australia. No doubt honourable members read in the Sydney Daily Telegraph last housing conditions in Darwin written by a man named Eager. His view strongly supports a speech made by the honourable member for Indi( Mr McEwen) shortly after he relinquished the post of Minister for the Interior, deploring the lack of a housing scheme for Darwdn on the lines of schemes operating in the States. I admit that government officials in Darwin are well housed and well catered for. but we have been remiss in providing houses for people on the lower rungs of the social ladder. Obviously, a town-planning scheme is something which cannot be undertaken and completed immediately, but at least a start should be made on the civic square. Unless the Government takes that plan seriously, nothing can be done. Planned development is handicapped because no town council exists, and I urge the reconstitution of the old body as the first step. My remarks to-night were inspired by a statement by the honourable member",21,Tions Voluntee R Defence Corps

""When I first mentioned the word ""planning"" in this chamber, I was looked upon as a Communist. I have in front of me a volume entitled Town Planning for Australia, by George A. Taylor.

He may have had some disability which had lain dormant for a number of years; but surely it cannot be argued that a recurrence of the complaint is not attributable to, or aggravated by, his war service! When a man is prepared to make the sacrifice of serving his country overseas, and is returned to Australia because of illness caused through no fault of his own, surely it is not too much to ask that he be given a war pension! The promise made in the last war, that this country would be fit for heroes to live in at the termination of the struggle, is once again being made; yet men invalided back to Australia are being denied a pension. Department of the Army is not getting the number of recruits desired? The refusal of pensions to men who have made great sacrifices, which have resulted in their being unfit to resume their former occupations in this country, must tend to induce young men to refrain from volunteering for service overseas.

[ trust that when the honourable member for the Northern Territory is happily able to relinquish his military uniform, and return once more to civil life, the work that will by then have been done in Darwin will command even his admiration. desire to make an appeal to the Minister for the Army( Mr Spender) on behalf of a universal trainee, Gunner Lance Carroll, serving with the 9 th Field Regiment. He is a student in accountancy about to sit for his final examinations. I understand from his father, who is a school-teacher, that he is a very able student. A t his father's request I made application to have Gunner Carroll transferred from the unit with which he was serving to the District Finance Office. The finance officer informed me that Gunner Carroll, and any other accountancy students, would be welcome additions to his staff. However, the adjutant of the 9th Field Regiment said that Gunner Carroll could not be released, because, in his opinion, he was a key man. This is what the adjutant wrote to me in reference to the application:Re Gunner Carroll. Tlie Commanding Officer has considered the transfer of the above gunner and regrets he is mentary representatives, I have never unable to accede to your request as Carroll is a key man in this unit's organization. (Sgd.) R. G. STYLES, AO. 9th Fd. Rgt. doing so. After that, I had a conversation with Carroll and his father, and found that the men who approached the honourable memduties upon which this supposedly key ber for Dalley( Mr Rosevear), the man was employed were such as any one else in the unit might well have been able to do. In a letter to the adjutant, I referred to the matter in these wordsTo say that he was a key man was absurd for the following reasons:(1} He is supposed to be a key man of wireless signallers; he has no stripes and juniors have been promoted, but not Carroll. (2) He has done no wireless work for a fortnight (with exception of one day only). Others can easily do the work. (3) He has been employed in cutting wood. (4) Unloading gravel. (5) Guard duty. (6) Mess orderly. (7) Detailed to burn putrid rubbish. rities accept that as an accurate representation of the position? cepted as true. his share of fatigues? dering far better service if engaged in the work to which he is accustomed. This regiment is commanded by LieutenantColonel Anderson, the brother-in-law of Sir Bertram Stevens. It will be remembered that he enjoyed very rapid promotion. It was he who recommended the dismissal from the Army of three subalterns, mainly because they were alleged to be fraternizing too much with the men. Representations were made to the Minister, and the men were re-instated. I do not know whether the Minister is satisfied with this, main, who, I understand has taken the stand that he will not accede to any requests made to him through a member of Parliament; indeed, he regards it as ""like their hide"" to trespass on his domain. It would be a good thing if a regulation were drafted to protect those persons in the Army who make representations through their federal members. courage persons in the Army to make direct approach to me, or to their Parliapermitted any one to be penalized for",25,Tions Voluntee R Defence Corps

72,Mr Falstein,"Well, these threehonorable member for Martin( Mr tralian necessities, and that the basis has McCall) and myself have definitely been victimized since they rejoined the Army. They were not restored to their seniority as was promised, and other men have been promoted over their heads. I again remind the Minister that some men in the forces are being employed on work to which they are not accustomed, while there is other work to be done upon which they could give better service. This position could be remedied by a simple administrative act. Recently, a gentleman by the name of Englart, a waterside worker in Brisbane, had his licence under the National Security Act withdrawn. Some comment was made on it in Parliament, and the case was heard before an appeal tribunal. This man is a returned soldier with a wife and seven children, so it can be easily understood that he was not likely to have much money to spare. Nevertheless, counsel who was examining him before the tribunal asked him, among other things, how many war savings certificates he had purchased, this being regarded, evidently, as a test of his loyalty. He was also asked whether he had seen a procession of soldiers passing down the street, and when he said that he had, he was asked quickly, "" D i d you cheer?"" What kind of mentality is possessed by counsel who asks questions of that kind, or by the members of the tribunal who listen gravely and determine, according to the replies to such questions, whether a man shall have a licence to earn his living? It is disgraceful that such things should happen, and an investigation is called for. I implore the Minister for the Army to investigate the matters which I have mentioned, and I hope that he will be able to bring order out of the chaos at present associated with universal military training. the Minister for the Army( Mr Spender) in a position to announce when a revised list of reserved occupations will be issued ? I understand that a special committee has heen investigating this matter for some time. It has heen suggested that the existing list of reserved occupations has heen based on the British precedent rather than on Ausnot been in the best interest of reinforcing our troops overseas. I realize that a thorough investigation is not an easy task, but I hope that the Minister will soon be able to announce when the revised list is to be made public. There is a good deal of discontent among members of the Volunteer Defence Corps in this country, particularly in New South Wales. Many of these men are of the opinion that their services are not wanted. In some units consisting of about 150 men only three or four rifles are available. This is a serious matter. Some of these men travel up to 15 or 20 miles on bicycles in order to undergo training. I recently interviewed some of them who held high rank in the last war, and they are becoming dissatisfied. They are anxious to secure uniforms, hut their chief concern is in respect of rifles. I believe that there are thousands of rifles in this country in the possession of private individuals. rifles of .303 calibre which are held by private individuals. that. It may be that men for home defence will be as necessary as are men for service overseas, although I hope that that will not be so. I agree with the honourable member for Gwydir( Mr Scully) that instead of establishing one distillery in each State for the production of power alcohol from wheat, it would be better to have three distilleries in each State. In New South Wales, distilleries could he established in the north-west, the central west, and the southern districts. The establishment of power alcohol distilleries in these districts would enable a more equitable distribution of power alcohol to be made when manufactured. There will be great dissatisfaction throughout the country if only one distillery is set up in each State. If the production of power alcohol were spread in this way, some of the difficulties associated with water supplies for the purpose would be diminished. The establishment of distilleries should bear some ratio to the amount of wheat available and the quantity of power alcohol to be consumed. I ask the Minister to give this",27,Tions Voluntee R Defence Corps

It is distressing to gee producers being driven off their properties at such a time as the present. We are in danger of losing the very things for which we are fighting. I support the appeal by the honourable member for Maranoa( Mr Baker) for a moratorium that will enable farmers, graziers and others, who are in debt, to remain on the land. Mr SP2SNBER (Warringah-Minister for the Army) [11.5] -The honourable member for Riverina( Mr a waste of money. Langtry) referred to the treatment of members of the Volunteer Defence Corps. These men fill an important place in Australia's defence scheme, and no one realizes more than I do the difiiculties under which they work. I have endeavoured to assist them by authorizing Militia units to make available to them certain equipment wherever possible. I have also endeavoured to arrange for a number of officers of the Volunteer Defence Corps to attend command schools for purposes of instruction. Moreover, I have encouraged the taking into camp with Militia units of members of the Volunteer Defence Corps so that they can have direct training with such units and ako have access to equipment. The problems associated with these men have not been lost sight of, but the honourable member for Riverina will realize that until further equipment comes forward, I cannot do more than encourage these men to continue with their tactical exercises, despite the difiiculties associated with lack of equipment. Recently, I issued I an order for the impressment of all .303 rifles held by private individuals. That order should overcome the difficulty in some degree. I am not at liberty to say how many rifles we are producing in this country, or the number of men who are going overseas, hut the problem is a very real one. The production of rifles is being accelerated, as indeed is the production of munitions generally, and it is hoped that the present position will soon be remedied. As to uniforms for these men, I announced recently that uniforms should commence to become available from about the' beginning of October. I assure the honourable member that I have at all times been sympathetic with the claims of the Volunteer Defence Corps, because I realize that its members will discharge important functions in the event of certain contingencies arising. think that the issue of uniforms to these men is justified? are part of the Army organization. Volunteer Defence Corps, and I know that many of the men associated with that body regard the issue of uniforms as of the men generally, and it is not my view. These men are members of the Army, and they should he recognized as such by being clothed in a proper uniform. The honourable member for Moreton( Mr Francis) asked when I expected to be able to announce a revised list of reserved occupations. This is a matter which normally comes under the Department of Labour and National Service. A special Man-power and Resources Committee on which the Services are represented has considered it. It is true that, the present list is based on the English system, as it was thought that that system could be adapted to the needs of this country. Experience has shown, however, that a large number of occupations should not come within the category of reserved occupations. This is a matter which bears on the problem of enlistment. I shall ascertain when an announcement on the subject can be made. Replying to the honourable member for Watson( Mr Falstein), I do not know the details of the case of Gunner Carroll, but I shall examine them and come to a decision upon it. Regarding the general problem, the fact has been revealed to me that since the Department of the Army has been calling up universal trainees many devices have been resorted to by eligible men in order to avoid active military training. For example, persons who are supposed to be studying accountancy enter upon a. business course for which they pay five guineas for the year. They then claim that, being students of accountancy, they should be exempted or given clerical positions. Of",28,Tions Voluntee R Defence Corps

Treasurer) member for Gwydir( Mr Scully) and the honourable member for Riverina( Mr Declarations Nos. 52-62. Langtry), as enthusiastic representatives of wheat-growing districts, advanced a claim for the establishment of power alcohol distilleries in their electorates. They are not the only members representing wheat-growing constituencies who consider that their districts have prior claims. The Power Alcohol Committee was the most efficient body that the Government could secure to examine the ramifications of this complex problem, and, acting upon its report, the Government decided to establish distilleries, paying f u l l regard to all conditions, with particular attention to the economics of the proposal. Whilst honourable members may contend that the production of 8,000,000 gallons of power alcohol should be divided among three or six distilleries, the economics of the position require that the conversion of wheat into liquid fuel shall be effected with a minimum of cost. The committee, in its wisdom, considered that the greatest possible economy could be achieved by the concentration of the production of the 3,000,000 gallons in one distillery unit. However, the representations of the honourable members will be brought to the notice of the Minister for Supply (iSenator McLeay). The honourable member for Maranoa( Mr Baker) and the honourable member for Riverina( Mr Langtry) recommended the introduction of a general moratorium. Considered superficially, such a measure appears simple, but the Government has not neglected this important subject. The Finance and Economic Committee, which advises Cabinet upon such subjects, considered that the time is not opportune for a general moratorium, and that much harm would be done to our internal and external economy by its application at this stage. If honourable members will bring to my notice specific cases of hardship or lack of consideration on the part of the banks which are unduly pressing their clients, the matter will be thoroughly investigated and expeditious remedies will be provided.
