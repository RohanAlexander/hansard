Tuesday, 2k November, 1936. tion to the question raised by the honourable gentleman. I point out, however, that the practice has been for the Government, year by year, to make a grant for this purpose to the Returned Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League of Ausw.alia, and to permit the organization to distribute it. At this stage I do not see any reason for any departure from that practice. ister aware that the majority of returned soldiers, including many .of those who are in distress, are not members of the particular organization to which he has means to enable these men to participate in this grant? mated, I shall be prepared to consider the point raised by the honourable member. the Government intended Concerning the particular returned year to soldiers to whom he has referred, I can only say that when the Treasurer introduces a measure directly the honourable member will see that as ordinary citizens, those men, if they are in distress, will share in a grant to be made by the Commonwealth for the purpose of providing Christmas relief. tribution of Christmas cheer to returned soldiers, I ask the Assistant Minister in charge of War Service Homesi f during the festive season, he will suspend anyevictions from War Service Homes that may be pending? the honourable member .a promise in that direction because I do not-think that any case of eviction is under consideration by the department at the present time.

The search that it conducted was similar to that made in connection with a previous disaster in the same waters. A zig-zag course was followed on a 30 mile front to and from Lord Howe Island. I do not think that the possibility of the men being found on Middleton Reef had been mentioned up to that time; but from what I have read in the press, I believe that a vessel has since examined that reef, and there have been several proposals for a similar search by private persons. I shall be glad to institute inquiries to see what further efforts may' be made. the Treasurer published recently a pamphlet in which he criticized the principle of one government raising moneys for another government to spend. Will the honourable gentleman agree to, and recommend, a drastic reduction of Commonwealtli taxation, with a consequential reduction of grants by the Commonwealth to the States, so that the States will be obliged to raise more revenue on their own behalf, instead of relying on Commonwealth aid? in the publication to which the honourable member has referred, I devoted much space to a criticism of the policy mentioned by him.

The impending dismissals have no relation to the recent increase of the basic wage. Tradesmen numbering, I believe, thirteen, and nine labourers, were employed on the erection of an additional factory at Maribyrnong.

55,Mr Casey (Corio,"Treasurer)that during the last four years unemployment, has been steadily decreasing, aud that this' Christmas the great bulk of the people will enjoy much better conditions than in recent years. Nevertheless, there are still many persons in the different States of the Commonwealth whose lot is still difficult because of the lack of employment. The Government therefore proposes to ask Parliament to grant a sum of £150,000 to provide assistance to persons out of employment. It is proposed that this grant shall be distributed amongst the States on a population basis as follows:New South Wales 59,200 Victoria .. 40,900 Queensland South Australia Western Australia Tasmania 150,000 membership of the trade unions furnishAs the Commonwealth Government, has-no detailed records of the names of persons out of employment in the various States, it is impracticable for the Commonwealth to undertake the distribution of a grant of this nature through its own departments. On the other hand, the States have labour agencies and detailed records in regard to employment which would enable them to distribute a grant of this nature on an equitable basis. It is therefore proposed that the Commonwealth grant shall be made to the States, and the State governments have been asked to undertake the distribution of the grant to persons out of employment. It is the intention of the Commonwealth that the States should be at liberty to distribute the grant either in cash or in kind, and that the basis of distribution within each State should be left, to the discretion of the State government concerned. The bill is being introduced now in order that, if Parliament approves the proposed grant, there will be ample time for the States to arrange for its distribufurnishes is contained in a general tion before Christmas time. No provision is made in the bill for assistance to the unemployed in the Northern Territory, Norfolk Island, or the Federal Capiemployment figures is only in respect of tal Territory. These territories are under the control of the Commonwealth, and inquiries are now being made with a view to determining what measure of assistance should be given in them. The amount involved for the territories will not be large, but it may be assumed that assistance will be given in the territories on a basis at least as generous as that possible in the States under the grant now proposed. I commend the bill to the sympathetic consideration of honourable members. pensioners to receive any special consideration ? assist only the unemployed. The amount to be appropriated in the bill to be founded on this resolution is .. 21.700 £150,000, which is to he distributed by 13,000 the States to assist the unemployed10.000 According . to the latest figures supplied 5,200 by the Commonwealth Statistician, the ing returns is 436,000, and the number of unemployed trades unionists over 52,000, or 12 per cent. As a matter of fact, the total membership of trades unions in Australia is over S00,000, and therefore only about one-half of the trades unionists in Australia are taken into account in computing the volume of unemployment, amongst trades unionists. The ""proportion of unemployed amongst those who are not members of a trades union is regarded by every competent authority as being much higher than the figure shown by an analysis of trade union returns. mation does not support that contention. Government could obtain any information of a sufficiently reliable character to enable tbe Treasurer to make that assertion. Government has reliable information on that point. which the Commonwealth Statistician memorandum marked "" Confidential"" dated the 15th October last, from which it will be seen that the improvement of the factory employment, and does not necessarily include all avenues of employment.

62,Mr Curtin,"The informationis notorious that officials and the Government should not place any reliance upon tlie 12 per cent., because it which has reaped no advantages from the is not a true indication of the volume of unemployment. Eifty-two thousand trade unionists are registered as unemployed, but the figure, I venture to say, exceeds 100,000, if we look at it fairly, because apparently only one half of the trade unions make the official returns upon which the unemployment statistics are founded. No account at all is taken of the great number of unemployed men' and women who are not members of the trade unions. The 52,000 unemployed members of trade unions have, I would submit, average families that, it would be safe to say, represent a community of 150,000 persons. Yet the honourable Treasurer professes to be doing a stroke of extreme generosity when he gives them £1 each at Christmas. claim. ber is looking a gift horse in the mouth. gift horse in the mouth at all. can vote against this. that it is impossible at any stage of these but I submit, that no bureau can spread proceedings to. move that the appropriation he increased; that this House is in the position of having to vote for this miserable £150,000 or get, nothing at all. I am merely urging that fhe state of the Commonwealth finances warrants a more substantial amount being voted, and asking the Treasurer to look at this matter dispassionately. It is is getting this money as the result, of the not an exaggeration to state that the numfiscal' policy of encouraging imports from ber of unemployed in this country is between 175,000 and 200,000. The appropriation, therefore, provides less than £1 for each of the persons out of work and leaves no provision at all for the families some real Christmas cheer and not give dependent upon them. We are to give them £1 at this juncture, when, as the honourable gentleman, says, the other sections of the community are enjoying conditions better than they have enjoyed in the last five or six years, and when the Commonwealth has been able substantially to reduce taxation in respect of those the gesture which it is making by supplewho have large incomes and who can iifford to pay taxes ""better to-day than at the men who are provided for in this bill. any time in the last five or six years. There is one section of the community improved conditions. Its members have had no reduced taxation, and no increased earnings; that is to say, they have benefited neither from the Government policy of less taxation nor from what it claims to be its policy of increasing employment. They are the forgotten men in this community, and for them, I submit, the provision which is to be contained in the bill, which will be founded on the resolution of this committee, is hopelessly inadequate. It will be impossible for the States to distribute the money equitably. What the honourable gentleman has done is to find £.150,000, give .it to the States, and then let the States discover that it will be insufficient to cover the claims which will be legitimately submitted to them, with the result that they will learn that, although they are in possession of the amount appropriated, they will have to stand-up to the brunt of the criticism of its inadequacy and, therefore, of all the anomalies which must be inherent in its distribution. That is unfair. It is true, as the .Treasurer says, that the States have bureaux which will be able to attend to the distribution of the money, this amount equitably among the thousands of persons who have claims to participation in the grant. In order to act fairly, properly, and competently, in the spirit of the Christmas season, having regard for the fact, that customs revenue for the last three months is enormously in excess of the estimate-the Treasurer overseas-the Treasurer should allow the section of the Australian community, which so far has had no share in the benefits from economic recovery, to get it what is equivalent to a fleshless bone.

68,Sir Charles Marr (Parkes),"if the amount is as paltry as he suggests, theu the efforts of previous governments fade into insignificance, because this is the first time in the 35 years of this federation that any Commonwealth government has made such a grant. rhe first time that moneys have been found by the Commonwealth to supplement, the unemployment relief votes for works of the States, but never has a grant been made by the Commonwealth at Christmas time without any tag being attached to it. made a similar grant. Government did make a grant, but conditions were imposed upon its spending. Grants previously made have been subject to tbe approval of the Commonwealth Treasurer of the works that were to be carried out. work the Scullin Government, and other governments, did during the depression in making moneys availahle, but this Parliament on each occasion appointed committees in the States to supervise the manner in which the moneys were spent. I am not saying anything against those grants, but I repeat that this is the first time that a Christmas grant has been made by any Commonwealth government to the State governments, for unemployment relief purposes, without a tag being attached. This is the first time that it has been left to the States to distribute the money unhampered by Comonwealth restrictions. Opposition will agree that the States have instrumentalities and bodies which are much more competent to distribute this money than the Commonwealth is. We have no organization, and no means of ascertaining the distress which obtains in various districts. The honourable member for Hunter( Mr James) recentlyasked a question concerning what steps were to be taken to relieve distress in his electorate. I have heard other honourable members also cite the distress which exists in their districts. I undertake to say that those honourable gentlemen know of organizations within their electorates which are much more competent to distribute this money than is the Commonwealth Government. I commend the Government for providing this money. All honourable members would like to see a larger amount, but no other previous government has even provided the amount which is to be made available under the proposed bill. We must all recognize the responsibilities of the States in regard to the problems associated with unemployment, and we must all recognize that in the States there exist institutions and societies which have for years been helping to relieve unemployment and distress, especially at Christmas time. The appropriation of this money will be ;i gesture that the Commouwealth recognizes the obligations of the States, and that it is making an effort to help them, even in a small way, to provide for the unemployed over the Christmas period. not help much. all like fo have a larger appropriation J recognize the made. I should like to see the amount increased four times. this amount to be distributed? say; I am not a member of the Government. But even on the honourable gentleman's own figures, the distribution will be on the basis of £1 a head. a pproximately £1 a head. can be so, for there are more than 50,000 trade unionists registered as out of work. Surely the Leader of the able member for Franklin( Mr Frost) interjected a few moments ago that the basis of calculation was entirely wrong, for Tasmania would get only £5,200, but, in my opinion, the basis is sound. This is the first time for many years that money has been distributed to the States for this purpose on a population basis. We are all aware that for several years New South Wales has been paying the deficits of certain other States, and it is time that everybody awakened to that fact. If the money proposed to be allocated under this proposal is made available on a proportionate basis New South Wales will be treated exactly like the other States. I submit that in the distribution of money for Christmas relief",17,Mentrelief Bill 1936

I was glad, also, to hear the Prime Minister say to-day that £2,000 is to be made available through the Returned Sailors and SoldiersI m perial League of Australia for the relief of necessitous returned soldiers. I point out to the honourable member for Dalley( Mr Rosevear) that that organization has never differentiated between its own members and other returned soldiers when distributing relief money of this description. I sincerely trust that the amount now being provided for Christmas cheer will be made to go as far as possible. with the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Five weeks or more ago I urged that if Curtin) that the amount of £150,000 proposed to be made available for Christmas cheer for the unemployed is quite inadequate. I have made representations on a number of occasions to the Government and also to the Prime Minister( Mr Wales has beeu that the political comLyons) and the Treasurer ( Mr Casey) personally that special need exists for relief measures on the coal-fields. I have asked that that problem should be treated as urgent. When distress has been caused by floods and other calamities in other States and countries, various governments have provided money for relief measures, and I can see no reason why the special circumstances of the unfortunate people on the coal-fields should not be considered. Both the Prime Minister and the Treasurer were sympathetic but said that it would be most, difficult, to find an equitable means to distribute money to relieve distress on the coalfields without discriminating unfairly against other sections of tbe community. It must be borne in mind, however, that the amount of unemployment on the coalfields is increasing, for notliing that has been done so far has tended to solve this serious problem. The honourable member for Parkes( Sir Charles Marr) said that a grant of the kind now under consideration had never previously been made, but he is in error, for in 1929 the Scullin Government made a sum of money available for Christmas relief. Unfortunately the Bavin Government of New South Wales applied the federal grant unjustly in that it used portion of it to reduce its own dole bill. The Scullin Government. never intended that such a course should be followed. I fear that unless some definite provision is put in this bill to make this grant conditional upon the State maintaining at the existing rate, any relief payments they now have in operation, we shall find the Federal grant being once again used in the unfair way in which the Bavin Government used it. any previous grant of the kind now being made by this Government. Previous grants were for works and were on an entirely different basis. further inquiry he will be able to assure himself that my contention is correct. any grant were made available for Christmas cheer, it should be expended through local governing bodies and not through State government agencies. Unfortunately our experience in New South plexion of the State Government influences the distribution of relief moneys. For example, the people on the coal-fields have always been unfairly treated by anti-Labour governments, for all the State parliamentary representatives of the people on the coal-fields sit in Opposition. One result of this has been that they have been shabbily treated in the distribution of unemployment relief moneys, although they have suffered more from the depression than any other section of the community. Surely it is not unreasonable, in these circumstances, for the Government to make specific provision in this bill that the money shall be distributed equitably. fields people ought to alter their political representation. compelling the Government to do the fair thing, something could be said in favour of appointing a Country party representative or two, for undoubtedly the Country party in this Parliament has been able to get all that it has asked for from this Government. But the members of that party will soon be relegated to the political scrapheap. I urge the Government to agree to the inclusion in this bill of a provision for the distribu-",18,Mentrelief Bill 1936

We should also provide that State Governments shall not take advantage of this grant in order to reduce existcheer, to brighten the lot of unemployed ing State unemployment relief grants. In view of the fact that the suggestion which I put forward for a special grant to the distressed people of the coalfields was rejected on the ground that the distribution of such relief would have to be general throughout the 'Commonwealth, I hope that the Treasurer will realize that the grant he has proposed is inadequate; to be of any substantial benefit to the unemployed it should be doubled. I emphasize that the unemployed persons in the Hunter district are in desperate straits. AlthoughI dislike to parade tlieir poverty before the National Parliament it is a tragic position when good honest citizens who are anxious and willing to work are unable, through no fault of their own, to find employment. As the result of their poverty they are ill-clad and many of them have lost their homes. Some had paid all but £60 or £80 of the purchase price of their homes to banks and building societies, but now they have lost their all. In those circumstances this proposed grant for Christmas relief is totally inadequate. I urge the Treasurer to accept the suggestion of the Leader of the Opposition and increase the grant in order to .alleviate the distress of these unfortunate people. The Government should be congratulated on bringing forward this measure. Notwithstanding what has been said by honourable members of the Opposition, in ridiculing the amount of £150,000 which will be distributed among the unemployed as Christmas relief, most honourable members were pleasantly surprised to learn that the finances of the country are in such a condition as to permit the Treasurer to make this money available. It -cannot rightly be contended that because the number of unemployed is 150,000 and the size of the grant is £150,000, that the amount of Christmas relief which each applicant for it will receive will be £1. Many thotisands of unemployed will not make application for this assistance; again, in many homes, two or three persons may be unemployed, in which case tbe amount of relief in such homes will be doubled or even trebled. The distribution of this money is not designed to create work ; the grant is for Christmas 1 at the festive season, and, in my opinion, it will give them a more cheerful Christmas than they have had for several years. If .any evideiice were needed that we are back again on the high road of prosperity it may be found in the ability of the Government to provide this amount of money as a special Christmas grant for the unemployed. I have no doubt that the people who benefit from this distribution will feel very grateful to the Government for bringing forward such a humane proposal. Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Curtin) complained at the right stage of this discussion that the amount of £150,000 to provide Christmas cheer for the unemployed was inadequate to meet the situation. The honourable gentleman put that case well and forcefully, and I do not propose to add a word to what he said. My main purpose in rising is to reply to a statement which was made by the honourable member for Parkes( Sir Charles Marr). In my opinion he made the most extraordinary defence of the Government's proposal to which I have ever listened. In the first place he said that no other Government had done anything like this. If that were true-and it is abundantly clear to every one that it is not-it would still not be an answer to the contention of the Leader of the Opposition. In years gone by there was not the occasion for making a grant of this nature because, fortunately, there was not the same amount of distress. Later when the distress did prevail, the revenues of the Commonwealth were seriously depleted. But the Lyons Government cannot claim that it has not the money to spare-that its revenues are not buoyant at the present time. As the Leader of the Opposition said, it is getting millions of pounds of easy money, a large amount of it at the expense of Australian industry and employment. I find that I am constrained from time to time to defend the Government which I led. When I heard the honourable member for Parkes snv that no previous government had made a provision of this nature,",19,Mentrelief Bill 1936
85,Mr Perkins (Eden,Monaro) [4.2],20,Mentrelief Bill 1936
86,Mr Scullin (Yarra) [4.4],"Th eand when he made specific reference to the Labour administration which I had the honour, and, perhaps, the misfortune to lead through a crisis, I immediately challenged him. When he was challenged ...y interjection what was his defence-by what pretext did he try to justify his out the money rather than grant to rageous statement ? The honourable member said that this grant was the first money given away without having a tag to itwithout carrying an obligation to work for it. I join issue with the honourable member, and say that that fact is not a recommendation of this proposition. I read the protests made in recent months in New South Wales when the State Government proposed to abolish relief works for the unemployed and revert to the dole. Immediately there was an outburst of indignation throughout the State because it was believed in proper circles that surely if there is an uplift in this country the grant is not sufficient. If that be -and there is-that surely if conditions are improving as rapidly as it is saidand I hope that they are-the time has arrived to wipe out completely the dole and substitute for it work for the unemployed. And yet the honourable member for Parkes claims, as a special virtue, that this money is being granted by the Commonwealth Government to the States, not for the purpose of providing work for the unemployed, but in order to give to them charity. not charity. Government that. . I led in its hours of adversity and deficits voted £1,000,000 to the States in order to provide a few weeks' work for the unemployed prior to the Christmas season. It is true that some of that money was diverted to one particular State that had more unemployment than any other State. At the following Christmas, £500,000 was distributed, mostly among local governing bodies. I ask the honourable member for better to give to the unemployed a week's solid work and pay them £4 or £4 10s. for it. than to give them a dole of 10s. for Christmas cheer? twice as much as that offer. was voted for work for the unemployed at Christmas, 1930, following the £1,000,000 which had been voted to the States in the previous year. Is it not better to give men two weeks' work before Christmas and let them have the satisfaction of knowing that they earned themwhat is really a dole? I desire to get the fact into the minds of the Government that the unemployed of this country are looking not for charity but for justice and the right to work and earn for themselves and their families the money which they require for Christmas cheer. [4.8] -Personally , I see no reason why there should be any criticism of this measure, except that honourable members may consider that, in certain instances, their opinion, the ordinary parliamentary procedure is open to them and they are entitled to move that the amount be reduced by £1 as an indication to the Government that the bill should be withdrawn aud reconsidered. I have a strong suspicion, however, that no motion of that description is likely to emanate from the Opposition. As to what took place in the unfortunate times which were visited upon this country when the right honourable member for Yarra( Mr Scullin) was in charge of the Government, I contend that anything which was done in those times should not be taken as a precedent for what we are able to do to-day. But in passing a bill of this description the House should bear in mind that what we do under conditions such as those which face the country to-day will be looked upon as a precedent for future occasions, and, personally, I always take the view that we should be particularly careful of creating precedents in the expenditure of public money. So far as the method adopted by the Government is concerned. T have no objection to find with it. If there is any ground for criticism, it is that the Commonwealth is giving to the State Governments a free hand in connection with the expenditure of this money.

Such things should not be permitted in connection with any grant from the Commonwealth to the States. The only possible criticism of this measure is that it does not provide that the Commonwealth shall specify the purposes for which the money shall be used. If its intention be that the unemdependent on doles. ployed shall derive some benefit, it should provide that they shall not be deprived of something which, were it not for this grant, they would have obtained from the States. That is the intention of the committee, and I should have no objection to a definite provision to that effect being incorporated in the bill. Tiie sum to be allocated to the States for good chap he is because he prodistribution among the unemployed at Christmas time is so small that it will have little effect in relieving distress among the families of men out of work. The problem of unemployment cannot be solved by the piecemeal methods of the present Government. Men out of work have told me that they want, not charity, hut the right to earn a living for themselves and their families. The failure to carry out a comprehensive scheme of public works is largely responsible for the present unsatisfactory condition regarding, employment in this country. Because loan moneys for public works have heen restricted, men are idle, and all that the Government is capable of doing is to make available £150,000 to tide them over the Christmas season! It is of little avail to ask the unemployed to rejoice at Christmas time, if they know that work will not be available to them for several months. sincere in our desire to deal with the problem, let us attempt to deal with it thoroughly.

How different will their fare be from that of honourable members opposite! Every person in Australia is entitled to employment whereby he may earn suflicient to provide for himself and his family. The term "" Christmas cheer "" conveys little meaning to men who throughout the year have been clamouring for an opportunity to earn their livelihood, so that they shall not be I shall not vote against this proposal; but I condemn the Government for its failure to grapple will the problem of unemployment. Instead of handing out this dole, the Government should draw upon its hidden reserves, and carry out a programme of public works throughout the country. The honourable member for Parkes( Sir Charles Marr) pats the Treasurer on the back, and tells him what a poses to give to the unemployed something for nothing. To that policy I have always objected. I maintain that the workless can maintain tlieir selfrespect only when, given the right to pay their way in the community. The average unemployed family will not receive from this distribution of money more than enough to keep the landlord from the door for a week. This grant will not prevent unemployed families from being evicted from their homes. Let us be sincere, and act as statesmen.

The honourable member is getting away from the resolution. A more appropriate time to discuss that matter would be when the bill is before the House. act the effect of the propaganda started by honourable members opposite, who said that this is a wonderful piece of legislation. The unemployed, however, will see no benefit in it. Apparently the Treasurer ( Mr Casey) is not seized of the seriousness of the plight of the unemployed. If the remarks of honourable members opposite are permitted to go unchallenged, the unemployed will be in the position of those who, lost in the wilderness, and suffering the pangs of hunger and thirst, see in the distance imaginary trees and cascades of sparkling water, but whose hopes are dashed to the ground by the realization that they have been lured on by a mirage. The unfortunate unemployed will quickly realize that they will have to tighten up their belts another hole, because their stomachs will not be filled to any extent by this so-called magnificent gift of Christmas cheer on the part of this make-believe Government which is always pretending to be doing something for them. If the provision in this bill is the best that the Government can do for the unemployed this year, those unforConsidering their poverty, and the great number of evictions which are taking place throughout Australia at the present time, it behoves the Commonwealth Government to make such provision as will enable the States to give a greater measure of relief.

All I can do is to suggest that the Treasurer should redraft the bill to increase the provision to £250,000. If the amount proposed to be made available for Tasmania were increased to £10,000, the Christmas cheer that would be given to the unemployed in that State would be far greater than is possible with the meagre grant now proposed by the Government. The CH-AIRMAN -Order! The honourable member's time has expired. [4.26] -I , like honourable members opposite, am pleased, that the Government is making available a sum of money to be applied by the States for the benefit of the unemployed during the Christmas season. My only complaint is that the amount to be provided is not sufficient. A grant of this kind has been asked for by several honourable members, and I fail to see how anybody can take exception to the principle behind, it, though I would be more pleased if conditions were imposed in regard to the distribution of the money to be made available. instance, it does not seem to me to be fitting that the Commonwealth Parliament should be dealing with the question of Christmas gifts for out of work families; such work is done by municipal councils and private individuals during Christmas week. If his colleagues will permit him to do so, I should like the Treasurer ( Mr unemployed person, and is not eligible to Casey) to substitute for this proposal a grant which would enable a full week's work at full wages to be given to each person on the unemployment registers of the various States. In Australia, there are 1,500,000 classified breadwinners, approximately 12 per cent, of whom are out of Avork. words, about 100,000 breadwinners who are heads of families, and responsible for their unemployed. If the Government were to accept my suggestion, its contribution towards the relief of the unemployed during the festive season would be something really worthwhile. The present provision, when distributed among the various municipalities in the metropolitan area, will provide very little for each unemployed person. The call will be made from those who are already receiving sustenance from the State governments, and they will be given an extra £1 at Christmas. That is hardly meeting the situation in a worthwhile way, and I suggest to the Treasurer that, instead of providing £150,000 as is proposed in the bill, he should make' available approximately £500,000, so that every man on the unemployment registers of the States may be given a full week's work at full rates of pay.

It is not likely by it for the relief of distressed persons. to be called together before Christmas, and how are the unemployed in that State to obtain a share of this grant? I do not propose to criticize the Government in regard to the amount that is to be made available. We know that at this time of the year, every municipal authority, in New South Wales at any rate, tries to make as much employment available makes special grants for Christmas cheer. Eor instance, the Sydney City Council has voted £3,000 for asked the State government not to take into account money received by families from this grant when determining the permissible income in regard to State assistance. gratulate the Government upon making available this sum of money for the relief of distressed persons. Like other honourable members, I should have liked to see a very much iarger sum set aside for this purpose, but we know that the Government is doing all it can. It ill becomes honourable members opposite to use this opportunity to discuss the whole unemployment problem, and to accuse the Government of having neglected its duty in regard thereto. This is a goodwill grant, made by the Government in the spirit of the season we are now approaching, and the Opposition should at least respect that spirit, and abstain, at this time, at any rate, from party propaganda. Some honourable members opposite have complained that in the past, money made available to State governments in this way has not been fairly distributed, but my experience has been that there is no ground for that complaint. The State government of New South Wales, and Uie municipal authorities in that State, have always made funds specially available at this time of the year for the relief of distress. Eor honourable members to suggest that the Commonwealth should pass over the Slate government of New South Wales, and hand the money directly to the municipal authorities is merely, a piece of political propaganda. 0 knows that the Stevens government misapplied Commonwealth grants received government is a king compared with the Lang government, and with what it did to the unemployed.

I know what the present government of New South Wales has done for the unemployed, and I am convinced that the unemployed are very much better off under that government than under the previous government led by Mr Lang. Honourable members opposite know that too, if they would only admit it. It is unfair of honourable members to suggest that part of the grant should be earmarked for distribution on the coal-fields or in any other specified areas. I could quite easily distribute a very large proportion of this money to deserving cases in the Barton electorate alone.

The Government might very well have considered -other aspects than those that are dealt with by the bill. To-day, for example, .1 asked the Minister for Defence( Sir Archdale Parkhill) a question in regard to the dismissal of a number of men from the munitions establishment at Maribyrnong, and the honourable gentleman was good enough to promise to make inquiries to see whether their services may be retained. Men who are now dismissed from government employment, particularly low-wage workers who need assistance very badly, will not have been off the employment list for a sufficiently long period to enable them to participate in Christmas relief. The relief envisaged by the bill would probably be very acceptable to them, although some of them may be fortunate enough not-to need it because of the length of time during which they have been employed. If government works are approaching completion, some financial means should be found to keep the displaced men in employment, so that the number of those who participate in this gift may be as few as possible. The obligation rests on the Commonwealth Government to see that men are not thrown out of employment at this particular period. The continuance of their engagement would indicate that good feeling of which the honourable member for Barton( Mr Lane) has spoken. N""o party should attempt to make political capital out of a matter of this sort. During the course of the debate some rather heated statements have been made, perhaps unjustifiably. But if one side draws a comparison with what some other government has done, that is bound to provoke reprisals. This is what has happened, with the result that the debate has not been as informative as it might have been. I feel that this Government is imbued, as all governments must be at this season of the year, with a desire to help those who, by reason of unemployment, have been in difficulties for a lengthy period. While the proposed measure of relief is entirely inadequate the Government might improve the position by paying attention to the suggestion that I have made. It should tackle the problem of making work available. The distribution of approximately £50,000 will not go very far in Victoria. We should provide a larger sum, so that useful employment might be given over a period. I hope that the Government will afford adequate relief to those who will otherwise have to go short of food this Christmas. gratulate the Government upon the introduction of this measure, and commend it for the reasons given for the proposed grant to the States of £150,000 for the purpose of providing Christmas cheer for the unemployed. I fear, however, that the money may be distributed through the ordinary channels to sustenance workers and to those registered by trade unions as uenemployed, whilst other members of the community who are out of work may not receive any relief. Many young members of the community are now out of employment, and will probably not be reached through the channels by which relief is ordinarily distributed. In the capital cities in each State, and in most of the provincial cities and large towns are branches of the Young Men's 'Christian Association, which hold vocational classes for young, unemployed persons. The Legacy Glub conducts such classes in Victoria for unemployed sons and daughters of deceased ex-soldiers. In Geelong, Ballarat and Bendigo, such classes are held. I suggest that, as has been done in the past, the State authorities should be asked to allocate at least 10 per cent, of this money for the benefit of the more youthful unemployed persons throughout Australia. I am sure that it would be a most welcome windfall to this distressed section. not imagine that the Government regards this measure as one that will give adequate relief to the unemployed throughout Australia.

I urge the Treasui-er to increase, the grant to £500,000. proposal under this bill is merely to provide an extra grant to unemployed persons as a gesture of goodwill at the Christmas season. The instrumentalities of the States will be used for the distribution of the money, but no safeguard is contained in the bill to prevent the State authorities from reducing the expenditure which, if it were not for this measure, they would be called upon to incur. State unemployment relief is regulated by stipulations regarding permissible income, and in all probability the money proposed to be paid to the States will not reach the unemployed at all. In New South Wales, for instance, relief is not granted to persons in receipt of more than a certain income. The £150,000 to be provided under this bill can be distributed only in accordance with existing -State laws, unless those laws be altered. Obviously, therefore, a good deal of the money can be used to relieve State budgets. Another point to consider is that the State authorities definitely prescribe the classes of persons who shall receive unemployment relief. In Western Australia are a large number of farmers who, on account of drought and other disasters, have lost their all. They would be glad of .assistance under this bill, but they will be unable to get it.

My statement will not be seriously disputed when I say that there are from 170,000 to 200,000 unemployed in Australia. Therefore, the sum to be provided would not enable each of those persons to receive £1. I do not say that they are all on unemployed registers; they are not. In New South Wales a person has to be a resident of the State for six months before he can qualify for registration as unemployed. The question is raised whether men have been on the lists for some time, and whether they have recently enjoyed permanent employment. In the Federal Capital Territory, men who have been intermittently employed for years, and during the last three months have had seven consecutive weeks' employment, are not regarded as part-time or relief workers. They are even called upon to pay arrears of rent, owing to the Department of the Interior, because they are not considered to be unemployed. Of course they have piles of other debts to tradespeople.

Tbe honourable member for Fawkner( Mr Holt) is greatly concerned about the welfare of youths, but if 10 per cent, of the money were hypothecated for the benefit of young persons, we should be giving them something for nothing. In the interests of the unemployed youth of the community, there should be an organized plan of industrial opportunity. Over a year ago I brought this matter under the notice of the Government, and 1 submitted a proposal in this House for the constitution of a national employment council which should confer with the State authorities and treat this ma tter as being of as much importance as any other subject discussed at the conferences of Commonwealth and State Ministers. I also suggested that the conference should have regard to all the factors related to .the matter. I pointed out that the employment of men and youths on the land had to be considered in conjunction with the known fact that the general volume of employment in rural industries is now far less than it was when the production of those industries was considerably less than it is at the present time. If this National Parliament decides to deal with ;the unemployment problem, despite the permanency of its causes, by a distribution at Christmas time of a miserable £150,000, it will reveal its own incompetence to discharge a great responsibility. done absolutely nothing to meet the needs of that section of the community which, by reason of industrial changes, is now superfluous in the economic structure. Factory employment is increasing but tbe amount of employment which is available to the community as a whole is shrinking, and, were it not for the loan expenditure by the State governments and municipal authorities, adding, as it has during recent years, £150,000,000 to the public debt of this country, the demand for factory goods would not be so great, and the amount of employment which factories could give would not be nearly so substantial as is the case to-day, and the problem of unemployment would be brought more definitely to the door of this this money is to be given to the States Government. I object to the principle of this bill, apart from the fact that the Mr Gwtvn. amount it appropriates is hopelessly inadequate for the purpose for which it is intended. I do not believe that the unemployed of Australia desire anything in the way of payment without doing something to earn such payment. This bill bears on its face the impress of an entire misconception of the character of those who are unemployed at the present time. bers opposite been asking for a Christmas grant ? grants for the purposes of organized re-employment on public works in the creation of useful assets. member can vote against the measure. member does not object to my stating my views. object to the honourable member misrepresenting the whole purpose of this gift. sented it ; I say decidedly that the purj>ose of this gift misrepresents what ought to be the national policy of Australia on unemployment and, further, that this method of dealing with the matter entirely misinterprets the hopes and aspirations of the persons dependent on such assistance.

The money could be used to create useful assets. agree with the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Curtin) that if any money is made available for the relief of the unemployed, it should be on the basis that recipients do some work in return for it. I am satisfied that neither the Treasurer ( Mr Casey) nor the Government seeks any political credit as the result of this grant, and I am equally certain that no honorahle member on the other side of the chamber who has spoken-in this debate has any desire to make party political capital out of it, but it will oe difficult to make the public believe it.

I agree with the Leader of the Opposition that if the Government feels inclined to provide assistance of this nature, it should do so on the basis that recipients are required to do a certain amount of work in return for the money they receive. Otherwise, the gift savours too much of charity. It has been suggested lhat the amount could easily be increased and that the extra cost could be made good by raising extra taxation or loan moneys. To honourable members who generally discuss matters of this nature, such a procedure seems simple. There is need for the exercise of greater care in regard to the expenditure of public money in Australia. I venture to say that if, some years ago, the Commonwealth Government, made available a grant of money to the States on the basis on which it is proposed to make this grant, there would have been a general outcry, at least from members of the party with which I have been associated. I feel satisfied that after being castigated by honourable members for their want of liberality, the Treasurer must feel a disappointed man; he must now be dubious as to the advisability of having brought up this measure. If the bill could be amended, it would be wise, I suggest, for the Treasurer to alter the conditions of this grant by stipulating that it should be used by the State governments to enable them to carry on public works immediately so that people out of work could be given a timely opportunity to earn a few pounds. That would be a better basis for its distribution. At any rate I do not approve of the method provided in the bill. it not for the fact that some honourable members opposite claimed that honourable members on this side were endeavouring to make party political capital out of this grant, I should not have spoken again on this matter. I have conducted considerable negotiations with the Government for the relief of distress among the unemployed, particularly on the coal-fields in the electorate which I represent. Although many people will probably say that my action in that respect was purely selfish, and that I was merely looking after the interests of my own constituents, such was not the case. I acted sincerely with the desire to help people most urgently in need of assistance. In response to my representations, the Treasurer ( Mr Casey) and the Prime Minister( Mr Lyons), said that they were anxious to do something along the lines I suggested, but they pointed out that, as unemployment was so prevalent throughout Australia, it would be rather difficult to make a special grant for the relief of distress on the coal-fields. I agree that such a difficulty exists. In reply to questions asked by myself in this House, however, the Prime Minister has repeatedly admitted that unemployment on the coal-fields is a special problem. He visited those areas and promised to do something in a special way to relieve the lot of the unfortunate people residing there. Honourable members generally, who have heard his answers to my questions on this matter from time to time, are aware of those facts. In the course of my representations, not more than five weeks ago, I pointed out to the Prime Minister and the Treasurer, that, if the Government made a grant to meet the special circumstances existing on the coalfields, it would not be establishing a precedent in that respect, because the Scullin Government had made such a grant, whilst special grants had been made by past Commonwealth Governments to relieve distress caused by floods in certain areas in Tasmania and Victoria, and in some cases, to relieve distress caused by disasters' outside Australia. My request was all the more justified in view of the fact that the Government has admitted that it has not found a solution for unemployment,particularly unemjployment on the coal-fields. The Treasurer has admitted that this measure is partly the result of the representations which T made to the Government. This grant, however, is purely a gesture of goodwill on the part of the Government towards the unemployed. When the bill was introduced, I pointed out that it was defective in that, in handling this money, some of the State Governments might follow a course similar to that which they followed in respect of the Christmas grant in 1929. At that time, they refused to pay the dole to certain unemployed men, because the allowable weekly income of the unemployed had been",29,Second Reading

By way of interjection, the honourable member for Barton( Mr Lane) has contended that such was not the case. I repeat that some of the State Governments used this money in the way I have indicated, in order to avoid meeting ordinary expenditure on their own part for the relief of unemployment. I believe that it is the intention of the Government in this measure to give the unemployed something over and above what they now receive by way of the dole or sustenance payments. should stipulate that any money distributed from this grant, should not in any way be deemed to increase the income of the recipients to such an extent as to preclude them from receiving any of the ordinary grants made by the State Governments to the unemployed at Christmas time. I propose, in committee, to move an amendment along those lines. I hope that honourable members generally will support it, because we should make sure that the unemployed who qualify for assistance from this fund, should receive it, as something over and above assistance ordinarily given to them by the States. I again urge that special consideration should be given to the relief of disaware of the urgency of the position in tress on the coal-fields. There can be no doubt that suffering among the unemployed in those areas has been greater, and of longer duration, than is experienced, generally speaking, by unemployed in other areas. Mines have been closed down since 1928, and, in the intervening 7,000 miners have been continuously out of work. That, I suggest, is a tragedy. Such suffering is more severe than that resulting from floods, for instance. The effect of a flood disaster is purely temporary, yet Commonwealth Governments in the past have made grants of from £5,000 to £15.000 for the relief of distress caused by floods, whereas the unemployed on the coal-fields have been suffering severe distress for the last nine If that were done, we could accept the years. .When the Prime Minister visited the coal-fields in the electorate which I represent, he interviewed some boys who had reached the age of 24 years and had never done a day's work. It is tragic, yet true, that young men and women on the coal-fields to-day are marrying on the dole. If that is not a special problem,, worthy of special consideration, I do not know what is. If past governments could justify making special grants to relieve distress caused by floods, I claim that this Government would be justified in taking special measures to relieve the present distress on the coalfields. That is not done in this bill. Under it, an amount of £59,200 is allocated for distribution in New South Wales, in which State unemployment is greater than in any other. In the past, political influences have been brought to bear in .the distribution of these grants. More has been allocated in electorates represented by supporters of the Government than in electorates represented by honourable members in opposition. We had an unfortunate experience of that kind in 1931. I merely mention the incident to show that, so far as I personally am concerned, I have been actuated solely by a genuine desire to do something in the interests of the people who have suffered for so long. The Treasurer, I think, will admit that much in my favour. I appreciate his point of view that no special provision has been made for the relief of distress on the coalfields, because many people who are not those districts would not agree that special provision should be made for them in comparision with that provided for the relief of unemployment elsewhere. I do not desire that any differentiation should be made in that respect. I urge that provision should be period, approximately made in this bill to prevent any State government, no matter what its political colour, from taking advantage of a Federal grant by depriving recipients of this assistance of the ordinary assistance given to them through the dole. This grant should be distributed to the unemployed as something over and above the assistance which would normally be given to theni by State governments at Christmas time.

That is not surprising, because it could quite reasonably be contended that one electorate should not receive benefits which were not being conferred upon others. circumstances are considered it will be found that unemployment and distress in the coal-fields districts present a special problem. Earlier in the day I endeavoured, by means of a question, to ascertain whether there is a possibility of Ministers visiting the New South Wales coal-fields to learn exactly the -nature of the distress which prevails there. Honourable members are doubtless aware that, in consequence of a visit of His Majesty the King to the Welsh coalfields, British Ministers propose to visit the Welsh colliery districts to ascertain if additional public works can be started to relieve acute distress and unemployment. The members of this Government -should also make themselves conversant with the distress prevailing in the electorate which I represent. Members of this Parliament, regardless of the politi-ca-1 opinions they hold, should, wherever practicable, become acquainted with the -conditions in districts other tban those which they represent, to enable them to ""legislate in the interests of the whole of the Australian people. The Prime Minister having admitted, during his visit to the New South Wales coal-fields, that the conditions are deplorable, should gi""3 special consideration to the people there. I believe that these special grants are. being made available to the States largely in response to the representations I mads to the Prime Minister on behalf of the coal-fields some time ago. the honourable member for Barton( Mr persons in distress. While I appreciate Lane), who accused honourable members on this side of the chamber of making political capital out of this measure, that, unknown to other honourable members, I approached the Prime Minister and the Treasurer ( Mr Casey) and asked if some assistance could not be rendered. It cannot, therefore, be said that I was anxious to obtain any political advantage. Prior to the last general election, a definite promise was made that an earnest endeavour would be made to utilize coal for purposes other than for fuel. I would have been justified in attacking the Government for the delay that has occurred in that respect, but I have refrained from doing so. I again appeal to the Government to increase the amount to be appropriated, so that special assistance may be given, parI f the whole ticularly -to the women and children in the New South Wales coal-fields area, many of whom have insufficient food and clothing. ing £150,000 available for distribution by the States to relieve distress, the Government is not establishing a precedent. If it is contended that these grants can be regarded as charitable gifts, it must bo remembered that for some years State Governments have been distributing relief, but .the recipients have not regarded such grants as charitable donations or in any way objectionable. I do not think it desirable that the Government should stipulate that the money should be expended on works, as the time between now and Christmas is so short that there would be insufficient time to prepare a works programme. If such a course were proclaimed, the money would not be available at a time when it is most needed. The intention of the Government is to give the States a free hand in its distribution, and with that proposal I entirely agree. With other honourable members, I regret that the amount to be appropriated for this purpose is not larger. congratulate the Government upon pro-viding £150,000 to assist the unemployed.

Unemployed youths should be placed in camps in various parts of the State where they could be trained on military lines. The remarks of the honourable member are irrelevant to the bill. that this grant should be utilized to train returns has been questioned by no less an Australian youths. ber think that compulsory military training would solve the unemployed problem? oonducted camps, youths could devote some of their time to physical training under capable instructors, and the remainder to learning a trade, to enable them to become useful citizens.

It is true, as the Leader of of the Opposition stated, that taxes have been reduced to a greater extent during recent years than relief has been afforded to those in distress. Those in receipt of incomes of £8 a week and upwards have had their taxes considerably reduced, but the amount which the unemployed will receive as a result of the expenditure of £150,000 will not provide each person with £2. receive that amount. maximum. Taxpayers in receipt of £S a week have received relief in excess of £2, which is the amount each unemployed person may receive under this proposal. The estimated receipts for this financial year have already been exceeded, and as the revenue position generally is buoyant, a much larger amount than that proposed could be made available to relieve the distress amongst the unemployed, which in some districts, is most acute. The Government has the money and should make it available for this purpose. Despite what has been said about the. unemployment figures, as disclosed by the returns from the trade unions, tlie fact remains that the accuracy of those authority than the former Commonwealth Statistician, Professor Giblin, who recently said that the time had come when the returns were not a reliable guide as to the number of unemployed in the country. I think that his contention was borne out by the data obtained at the recent Australian census. To accept those figures as an indication of the number of unemployed in this country is wrong. What is to be clone with this money? Is it to be given to every man who is unemployed? Are single and married men to participate alike? Is something to be done to preserve to the unemployed who are in receipt of assistance from the the States their right to receive that assistance in the week in . which this money is to be distributed? I do not see anything in the bill which would indicate that it is the intention of this Government that the money Parliament is now asked to vote should be additional to the money which the State governments themselves provide, and I consider that safeguards should be incorporated in this measure to ensure that this money will be regarded as a special Christmas gift. member surely trusts the governments in the States, especially the three States in which Labour is in power., They would surely do the fair thing. trust Labour governments to a greater",32,Second Reading

This is not a matter of the political colour of the State governments; it is a matter of bestowing the benefits in the direction in which this Government is seeking to bestow them. A better proposition, if the Commonwealth Government could do it, and I suggest that it could, would be to make available sufficient money to provide the married men in this country with an additional week of work on the basic wage. That would provide them with a substantial Christmas gift for themselves, their wives and their families. The revenues in these days of increased prosperity are sufficiently buoyant to enable the Government to take this step. I think further that all single men, whether they live at home or away from home-ther e should be no discrimination-shoul d receive at least three and a half days' work. That would provide a little additional comfort to those in distressed circumstances. Anything less than that seems to me to beI was going to say "" hypocrisy ""-bu t it may not be so bad as that. Sir hypocrisy, the honourable member would vote against it. vote against anything that will provide a measure of assistance to the destitute. The Ministei would not think that, the 1 amount appropriated by this measure was reasonable if he had shared the experience of the unemployed. My only purpose in speaking is to support the suggestion of tlie Leader of the Opposition, that the bill should be withdrawn and replaced by a proposal, such as the Government could easily bring forward if it had the desire, which would provide some real relief for the destitute. I consider that the amount provided for in this bill is inadequate to provide anything in the nature of Christmas cheer, and I hope that the Government will respond to the appeals that have been made and do something to enlarge the grant, preferably by providing every married unemployed man with a week's work, and every single man with half a week's work. It would, thereby, be doing something useful for the community and helping to preserve the manhood of the nation. weeks ago I asked the Prime Minister( Mr Lyons) if provision would be made by the Commonwealth Government for special unemployment relief at Christmas, and he replied that the Government regretted that it could not see its way clear to grant my request. I am pleased indeed to see that the Government is now making some provision for the relief of the unemployed during the Christmas period, although I join with' other honourable members in stressing the inadequacy of the amount which is made available. The unemployed of this country will not be provided for on a liberal basis by this grant. I believe also that the Government should make better provision for the distribution of this money. There are many aspects to be considered in this regard and the one which I wish to impress on the Government is the existence in New South Wales of a condition that the income of a household shall be less than a certain figure before unemployed members of that household can obtain condition operates even in cases where children are bringing small amounts of income into the household. I do not think that such circumstances as permissive income should operate in respect of this grant from the Commonwealth. In towns in my electorate I have discovered that many persons are refused the dole and relief work solely on the discretion of the police. If the matter is brought before the State authorities tliey say that the distribution of food relief is something for the discretion of the police; but, in many cases I have found that the police have used their discretion wrongly with the result that many persons entitled to relief have been deprived of it. It seems to me that there is a possibility of the same persons being denied assistance under this proposed grant because of the manner in which it is to be distributed has not been specified. In my opinion the best way in which this money should be disbursed is through the local governing authorities. They could increase the amount of relief work which they are at present providing.

I understand that it is intended, by this party, to move in committee for the inclusion of a clause in this bill to prevent the money which is to be distributed under it from being taken into consideration by the State governments in assessing'family income. The Government should reconsider this aspect of the question. Some years ago the Government of New South Wales evaded its responsibilities by using money, which, was provided by the Commonwealth, in carrying out works which it had formerly carried out by using its own funds. This Parliament should make it impossible for that to recur. The States should meet their responsibilities and should do their utmost for the unemployed irrespective of action taken by this Government to provide additional relief. The States should not be able to restrict their own expenditure by taking advantage of this grant. support the declaration by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Curtin) that the -money to be made available under this bill is inadequate I also believe that it is a pity that action in the direction contemplated was not taken earlier. We have been informed by the Treasurer ( Mr the Government is responsible for that Casey) that the States will have to take certain legislative action in order to give effect to the proposals contained in this measure, but as the South Australian Parliament is now in recess it will not be able to do so. I should hate to think that any State, as has been suggested by the honourable member for Darling( Mr to take this action, the State GovernClark), would take advantage of the money, which is to be provided by the Commonwealth as Christmas cheer for the unemployed, to evade recognition of its own responsibilities. The Queensland Government has earmarked a large amount of money to bo used for purposes similar to those envisaged in this proposal, and the provision of money by the Commonwealth will be a welcome addition. It is essential that this money be spent in providing work for the "" down and outs"". I am sure every honourable member appreciates the fact that if a man can earn and spend wages for even two days' work, he feels much more independent than he the dole. The morale of the people is sapped by unemployment. I remember that when the honourable member for Darling( Mr Clark) asked a few weeks ago whether the Government intended to make any money available for Christmas relief for the unemployed, he was told that it did not intend to do so. I do not know whether that answer was given in order to deprive the honourable member of any kudos 'attached to the first mention of the idea, but in any case, it is a pity that an earlier statement was not made. Had the State governments been informed that the Commonwealth Government intended to take this step, their own procedure might have been different. We understand that the Parliament of South Australia has entered upon its Christmas recess. If , therefore, complementary legislation is needed in South Australia to enable the Government of that State to take advantage of this grant, difficulties will be encountered. Had the State governments been advised of this move by the Commonwealth Government I have no doubt that arrangements could have been made for the grant to be used more effectively. I shall not say anything about the amount of money to be made availabledecision, and must stand by it-bu t I regret that the circumstances in which the grant is being made will militate .against the most, effective use of it. Queensland is to receive £21,700. Had the Minister for Labour in Queensland, Mr Hynes, known that the Commonwealth intended men's Christmas relief plans might have been materially varied. I agree with the honourable members who have contended that this money could best be distributed through local governing authorities, which have a more intimate knowledge of the unemployed than is possessed by governmental instrumentalities. I do not think that there is danger of governing authorities misusing the money.

The State governments also have adopted measures independently of the 'Commonwealth to provide work for the unemployed.

I propose to overlook entirely the allegations of certain honorsion of a Christmas gift of this sort. able members of the Opposition that'the Government of New South Wales would stoop to the methods that have been ascribed to it, or that it would do anything to attack unfairly the unfortunate people in the community who are unemployed. I would not sugge3t, either, Queensland, Tasmania would stoop to such tactics. I believe that the sovereign State governable member there is nothing in this ments can be relied upon to accept and distribute this money in the spirit in which it is intended it should be spent. If honourable members of the Opposition suggest that at Christmas time the State governments could stoop to some petty trick in order to do unfortunate men out of some portion of this money, I must say that I have more faith in human nature than apparently they have. The State governments are necessarily in much closer touch with the conditions of bureaux and other agencies; and all of them-whateve r their political colour may be-ca n be relied upon to put this money to the best possible use. Honourable members of the Opposition describe this grant as being one of charity, but in my opinion it ill-becomes those, who purport to represent the workers, to speak of charity in this regard. This grant is not made available by the Eederal Government as charity. It is a simple gesture at Christmas time to the section of men who are without employment. As to the so-called inadequacy of the amount, I ask any honourable member of the Opposition, and in particular the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Curtin), if in their wildest dreams they had any idea that, the sum of £150,000 would be forthcoming for this purpose at Christmas time. Of course the answer is "" No"". The idea probably never entered their heads. Again as to whether the money should be used for the purpose of providing work for the unemployed instead of being Opposition that from time to time two or three of his supporters have asked questions without notice whether the Government proposed to make some proviWhether or not this shows a cleavage in the ranks of honourable gentlemen opposite, I am not in a position to say.

AlthoughI was aware of the fact that the parliament of South Australia had adjourned, I had in mind that the State government, if it had been necessary to pass legislation in this connection, could devote the equivalent of this grant from its own funds for the purpose of providing Christmas relief for the unemployed and offset this charge on revenue w it h the grant at a later stage when it had time ""to pass the necessary legislation. From my inquiries by telephone, I have learned that a trust f u n d exists in South Australia out of which this money can be paid under existing legislation.

The tariff resolutions which were tabled on the 22nd May-si x months ago-intro duced an entirely new development in Australian tariff-making, in that questions of principle, rather than the rates of duties on specified items, were involved. It must be acknowledged that the schedule was laid on the table somewhat dramatically, and in a manner which suggested that the Government was not too certain as to the soundness of the course that it was pursuing. That tariff involves Australia's relations with the United Kingdom, the United States of America, and Japan; and we have to consider it at a time when the world is trembling in an atmosphere of mistrust. At best, the international situation at the moment gives cause for grave disquietude. From the stand-point of the British Empire, the position is such that, although the Empire has no misgiving, all governments are concerned, with matters affecting international relations which necessitate I admit, that a man in grave caution and wisdom in the maximum degree. Although Great Britain has no need to fear any nation, it is most anxious to maintain friendly relations with all its immediate neighbours, including France, Germany and Italy.

180,Mr Curti N (Fremantle) [8.10],"Tke Commonwealth Government has failed to take a broad national view of the situation. A t all times its policy is dominated by sectional interests, and for .that reason it has failed in this, as well as in other matters, to place Australia first. The schedule has been described as a trade diversion schedule, aimed at diverting the source of Australia's imports from certain countries to other countries. It is, therefore, a discriminatory tariff, and, *o that extent, it can properly be described -as provocative. It has not increased the number of countries with which Australia is on terms of goodwill, but it has given rise to a distinctly unwholesome atmosphere for Australia in its dealings with its Pacific neighbours. Speaking of the Government's fiscal policy in May last, the Minister directing negotiations for trade treaties ( Sir Henry Gullett) saidWe are aiming in future to draw our supplies fio m countries which are already great customers of ours and which we may confidently expect w ill .become greater customers if we customs revenue has swelled. increase our purchases from them. In this way we expect substantially to increase our export trade. That means that the Government hopes that countries which are already great customers .of. ours, will become better customers as j a .result of this trade diversion policy. /Does the Minister think that that statement squares with this schedule, which, is ..aimed at transferring from Japan to other countries a considerable portion of Australia's imports? Sir' HENRY GULLETT -Yes, absolutely. ment in May last could mean only that countries which buy goods from Australia are those from which we shall encourage imports. Therefore, if Japan buys goods from Australia, the logical implication of the Minister's statement is that Australia . will buy goods from Japan. A good customer nation for Australia's products should find Australia a good customer in return. Prior to the 22nd May last a cardinal feature of the Government's tariff policy was a systematic reduction of duties, but on that date it introduced a policy which substantially reversed the principles upon which it had acted previously. Before that date every tariff matter of major importance was submitted by the Government to the Tariff Board, and a report was received from that body before a schedule to give effect to alterations, in some instances drastic reductions, of the tariff was introduced. In this instance, however, the duties were not referred .to the Tariff Board before the schedule was laid on the table. Reductions of duties have been effected not only in the British preferential tariff but also in the general tariff, for in addition to 1,289 items in the British preferential tariff which have been reduced there are nearly 600 items in the general tariff upon which the duties have been lowered. increases of duties in the general tariff. systematic and consistent reductions of the general weight of the tariff against imports, there has been a great increase of the total imports into Australia, and employment. resisted all criticism of its policy. It encouraged imports because they meant easy money for the Treasury; considerations of revenue made the Government reckless of every other consideration. .

Repeatedly during the life of this Parliament, as well as in the previous Parliament, the Opposition has drawn attention to the growing lack of balance, as between the values of Australian imports and exports, as a result of which the strain on our overseas balances was continuous. In its latest report the Commonwealth Bank Board drew pointed attention to the fact. The Government persisted in its policy, but during the present year a change took place; the Government which would not protect Australian cement against British cement sought to protect British textiles against the textiles of another country, and attempted to justify its action as a trade diversion programme in order to assist exports to countries which are good customers of ours. According to the Minister directing negotiations for trade treaties, it acted in the interests of Australian exports. During the last five years Australia has had an excess of exports over imports largely because of Japanese purchases of Australian goods. The following table sets out the position in regard to exports and imports as well as Japan's share in creating an excess of exports over imports:Excess Exports. Total Total Countries. from Japan. Million Million Millio -£ 1931-32 56.8 1932-33 89.9 1933-34 59.4 1934-35 1935-36 This shows clearly the importance to £stg.39,S00,000 or £A.47,200,000.

The report states: The share of world trade which Europe enjoys has steadily declined since 1932. But not Europe's purchases. purchaser of the goods of the rest of the world. this year? The honourable gentleman would argue, of course, as he did some little time ago when dealing with our trade relations with Czechoslovakia, that we ought not to take wool into account. He has a most convenient memory which enables him readily to forget his pivotal point in one debate in order that he may use contradictory arguments in the next. In 1935 European trade represented only 35 .per cent, of its value in 1929, and its. exports, in particular, fell off heavily. The volume of European trade -in 1935 was barely above the level of 1932, but the aggregate trade of other continents in 1935 was about 20 per cent, greater than in 1932. I submit that statement of the reorientation of world trade for the serious consideration of the Minister and the Government. To the extent that world trade is developing, that is due, not to any recovery in Europe, but to developments Imports. Exports.

The honourable gentleman would account for the revelations that are to be found by statistical research by the assertion that, as wool constitutes 100 per cent, of our exports and can be sold anywhere, we need not found our internal fiscal policy on wool. But he did not say that when the Scullin Government was laying down its fiscal policy for Australia, and he was in opposition. Excluding wool, the total exports to Japan for the last six years were as follows:Value£ 1030-31 1931-32 193233 193334. 193435 193536 In altogether, Australia sold to Japan goods to the value of £18,924,000, representing an annual average for that period of £3,154,000.

The second point that emerges from these facts is that imports into the United Kingdom from Japan are nearly double those from Japan to Australia. Thirdly, Britain's imports from Japan are nearly two and a half times as large as its exports to Japan, whereas Australia's exports to Japan are three times as large as its imports from that country.

229,Mr Curtin,"The Prime MinisterSir member of the Government at that time. ment took f u l l credit for it . Japan is not only a buyer; it is also a seller, of goods. It did not force its goods on to the Australian market; they have been sought by the agents of tlii3 Government, by its special goodwill messenger, and by a l l those merchant princes in our midst who wave loyal flags made in Japan on government platforms at election time. Therefore, the problem is one for which this Government is responsible. Thei n crease of imports from Japan, of which the Minister directing negotiations for trade treaties has taken notice in this schedule, has occurred during the life of the Lyons administrations and, as the Minister 'has shown, the trade has grown in that period, to very substantial dimensions. It did not occur during the regime of the Scullin Government. It is also true that. Australia's exports to Japan grew. Now a situation has arisen of which the Government is afraid, and to deal with which it has taken action. All that I have to say is that, if a major problem calling for drastic action by the Government presented itself in May last, it was the outcome of previous d r if t by the Government. When the Government sent the Latham Mission to the Easti t had no conception of the implications of Japanese trade upon Australia's imperial relationships. It has been incapable of looking at Australia's trade as a whole. It, believed that it could sell more to Japan without, buying more from Japan. I i is also true that when the importation into Australia of certain Japanese lines began to swell, tariff measures were contemplated by the Opposition, but honourable gentlemen opposite resisted such proposals. We asked for increased duties to stem the flow of imports, and debate after debate took place in this Parliament with the Government insisting-as the honourable member for Swan( Mr Gregory) now insists-that notliing should be done until the matter had first been investigated by the Tariff Board. It had become so much the habit of the Government, to refer to the "" Himalayan "" Sculli n tariff, that it took a positive delight in being able to reduce duties from point to point until the tariff had reached so causes this most drastic contradiction of everything that the GoT h e n tlie Governvernment had previously done. It would have been then, as it will be in the future, justifiable and proper to tell either Japan or any other country, at any point, i( Your imports into Australia, and the trade that you have been enabled to obtain here, have now reached proportions that we consider j u s t if y action to l i m it further expansion "". Every country has done that in its tariff-making from time to time. Buti t is one thing to tell a country that a market which it does not hold is not available to it , and quite a different thing to allow a country to capture a market and then t r y to deprive it of that which it has legitimately won. The consequences of such action, I submit, are too subversive of stability in international relations. As regardsthe statement of the Minister directing negotiations for trade treaties, that there is room for a substantial increase of Australian exports of primary products provided that we are able to give to Great Britain a larger share of the Australian market, all that I would ask is, what actual benefits in the for m of increased trade with the United Kingdom are to be derived as the result of this trade diversion policy? I thought that the benefits which Australia had secured were the direct outcome of the Ottawa agreement. I also understood that the Ottawa agreement, of itself and by itself, completely safeguarded Australia's trade in the United Kingdom. If that be true, then this action against Japan is unjustified as a measure for the protection of Australia's exports overseas. Another country which is interested in this matter is the United States of America. In his speech on the Government's new tariff, the Minister directing negotiations for trade treaties saidCircumstances compelled the Government to divert a certain amount of our import trade from countries which'are very indifferent purchasers of Australian exports, first as far as practicable with respect to Australian secondary industries, and next to i-ountries which are heavy purchasers of our exports. Professor Giblin, discussing the new tariff, said that attempts to balance trade between two countries represented the greatest of obstacles to the revivalof",45,Growth Of Imports
230,Mr Coetin,"international trade. That is admitted in a statement published in the Sydney Morning Herald to-day, by the British Chamber of Commerce. Professor Gibli n went on to sayTlie United States of America was a bad customer country because Australia had a heavy adverse balance of trade with her. The facts -were tliat we had an even heavier adverse balance with Britain. Turning to the balance of payments, Professor Giblin saidAustralia had to pay £31,000,000 for imports of British goods, and about £26,000,000 for sinking fund and interest and other services Jbeyond those included in the valuation of imports. Australia had, as a credit, about £38,000,000, the value of imports from Australia retained by Great Britain. The year ended with a balance of £19,000,000 against Australia. About £6,000,000 of this balance was paid with gold, and the remainder (£13,000,000) had to come out of favorable balances with other countries, or London reserves. Against this should be set the capital investments from Great Britain, which might have been about £5,000,000. He went on to sayIf, then, we are going to talk about good industries without any guarantee of customers, Britain is no doubt in one sense a increased trade from Britain. good customer of Australia, but Australia is the trade treaties, our secondary in a much better customer of Great Britain. He addedIf we are to adopt this vicious system of balancing trade between two countries, it is tariff. The truth is that, having done unfor Britain to buy a great deal more to make told damage as the result of its low-tariff the balance even. Japan cannot be classed as "" a very in different customer "", seeing that it is our. posing a tariff w i th a view to safeguardsecond best customer. The Minister was ing Australian industries from all outside absolutely incorrect when he said that competitors, the Government has taken our sales to Japan were practically all the course of imposing discriminatory of wool. I have statistics to prove that restrictions, with no thought of the that is not the case. The following pareconomic repercussions which must follow ticulars of trade done by the United euch action, or of the antagonism that Kingdom with Australia and the United might be engendered.

Having misunderstood the statement of the honourable gentleman, I now desire to withdraw the words used by me. Minister directing negotiations for trade treaties) [9.3] I propose to offer little or no criticism of the speech delivered by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr managed economy in substitution for the Curtin). To my idea, it is perfect as it stands. As a member of the Government, I could not wish to have a better speech by the Leader of the Opposition recorded. At this stage, I propose to make a brief survey of three of the main matters covered, by the schedule now before the committee. taken by the Government with respect to the diversion of trade, the manufacture within Australia of motor car engines and chassis and, finally, the trade dispute with Japan. If my remarks are not of a comprehensive and detailed kind, it is because I shall have further opportunities to speak on the individual items. I do not propose to follow the honourable gentleman in his remarks regarding our trade relations with Japan. I take no exception to his "" boiling over "" in that regard, although he "" simmered "" for six months in complete silence. I do not propose to say more now than that the negotiations with the Japanese delegates are actively proceeding, and not without some prospect of an early settlement. In approaching the steps taken by the Government as from the 23rd May last in the diversion' of the source of some portion of our import trade, I would remind honourable members that we live in abnormal times. We have within the last six or seven years witnessed phenomenal changes. During these I rise to make a peryears the Bank of England has been forced off the gold standard; Erance has .twice been driven into heavy devaluation of the franc; the United States of America has voluntarily abandoned the gold standard; and most countries have, indeed, depreciated their currencies. Here in Australia we have twice adjusted exchange until our £1 note, which a few I stated in one inyears ago was worth a sovereign, is to-day worth somewhat less than half a sovereign. In the international trading sphere we have witnessed even more important changes. The United Kingdom has abandoned free trade for protection; Russia has established government monopoly of all foreign trade; and the policy of national self-sufficiency has been adopted almost everywhere in varying degrees. Italy and Germany have moved in the direction of a planned and old self-regulating system. Quotas and exchange control have been adopted as the principal aid3 to bi-lateral trade between nations. The prolonged pressure which the depression has exercised on the world has not only resulted in the overthrow of political institutions in certain countries, but has also destroyed They represent the steps the faith of many countries in the economic principles by which they had been guided for many generations. These new currency and trading measures clearly prove that the world has abandoned what it believed to be fundamental and enduring principles. It has abandoned these in the belief that they have failed to meet present-day emergency needs. New principles have not yet crystallized. Under the indefinite liquid conditions now prevailing throughout the world, economic policy in the widest sense must be, and, indeed,, should be, a well considered expediency. The world must from time to time, as problems arise, take those steps which are best calculated to meet the situation of the day and the not distant to-morrow. At the same time, the steps taken should be, if possible, of",46,Henry Gullett J Was Not A Low A Level That The Flood Of Imports

234,Sir Henry Gullett (Henty,"a kind which, whilst tiding us over the present, will bo constructive in a general sense. The new expediency policies have not left Australia unaffected. Much as we may have tried to escape their effects we have had forced upon us the choice of adhering to old, out-of-date principles or partially yielding to the new order. An examination of our trading position with, two countries will suffice to satisfy honourable members that my statement that Australia has not remained unaffected by these policies is true. Italy was the first Australian "" good customer "" country to adopt a closed economy, with tlie result that our exports to that country fell from £4,600,000 in 1933-34 to £996,000 in the following year. Germany followed with the result that our exports to that country fell from £9,439,000 in 1933-34 to £1,73.3,000 in 1934-35. These phenomenal changes throughout the world are the considerations which moved the Government to the adoption of the policy expressed in the schedule. I shall deal first with the proposed diversion of part of our import trade. We have heavy overseas obligations which can be met only through the medium of a more or less regular excess in value of exports over imports. If we fail to maintain that essential favorable balance of trade, we fail financially before the world. That is, I know, as unthinkable to the Opposition as it is to members of the Government. This was indeed eloquently .expressed by the Leader of the Opposition in his no confidence motion in this chamber on the n th March last. The motion which he then submitted declared, in partThat tlie Government is deserving of censure for failing to take action to safeguard Australia's overseas funds by checking the increasing flow of unnecessary imports . . . Minister's defence was that it was not necessary to do that. Sir Leader of the Opposition sought to show at that time that we were likely to have a large adverse trade balance in respect, of last year. That the Government was able convincingly to deny and disprove. We did not say that we were satisfied with the trade conditions for all time; 'we did not commit ourselves to that. We merely said that we were perfectly safe for the time being, as we proved to be. The Leader of the Opposition, in the forceful speech he has just made, still subscribes by strong implications, if not in actual terms, to the words I have quoted from his motion of want of confidence. The Government and the Opposition are, therefore, one in subscribing to the absolute necessity for maintaining a sufficient margin in the value of our exports over the value of our imports to place the meeting of our overseas obligations beyond question. Minister consider that the present proposal will do that? consider it a great constructive contribution. The only difference I have with the Leader of the Opposition and those who support him is in regard to the means to be employed to ensure the end whicli we in common have in view. The honourable gentleman charges the Government, in the policy it has adopted to reach that end, with discriminating among countries which are more or less substantial exporters to the Commonwealth. He appears strongly to favour the alternative course of adopting tariff restrictions against certain items of import irrespective of country of origin. There we reach the fundamental difference between the policy of the Government and the policy of the Opposition. My honourable friend would apply restrictions equally against those countries which are good customers for Australian exports, and those countries which are very indifferent customers for our exports. Japan a good customer? now referring to the Japanese issue. I am in a peculiar position in conducting these negotiations, and I think that it would be improper for me to enter into a controsubject. I would make one comment on the speech by the Leader of the Opposition.. He sought to show the great growth of imports into Australia since 1931-32. As I remarked by way of interjection, in the first place, he compared the purchasing power of this country for",48,Raisins Imports Into United Kingdom

239,Sir Henry Gullett,"I am notall goods at tbe depth of the depression period with its purchasing capacity at the present period of relatively great prosperity, and, secondly, he entirely overlooked the fact that, of our total imports, only .14 per cent, or 13 per cent, come in under protective duties. The honourable gentleman showed startling ignorance of what our imports compose. The great bulk of our imports to-day are manufacturers' raw material, or partially-manufactured material, without which Australian industries could not carry on. Onlyf r o m 14 per cent, to 15 per cent, of our imports come into competition with the products of Australian protected industries. MrA . GREEN -Well, then, where does trade with the United States of America, the revenue ? Sir HENRYGULLETT main, from revenue duties. The Commonwealth, in the diversion scheme it has adopted, has proceeded down different lines. It has, as a primary condition to success in maintaining and improving the favorable export balance, given first place in its consideration to the maintenance of the export trade of the Commonwealth. The soundness of this consideration w ill not be denied. If we had proceeded, as the Leader of the Opposition suggests, by applying restrictions to all countries from which we import, we could not have failed to antagonize all countries, and to have prejudiced their disposition to continue their purchasing from Australia. We have, therefore, excluded from the diversion policy, in the first place, all good customer countries, and, in the second j>lace, years; that adverse balance might easily those countries which presented little or no opportunity for the diversion of trade we had in view. On the other hand, we have aimed to .bring about diversion on a large and beneficial scale from sources which were very heavy and increasing exporters to Australia, and very limited purchasers indeed from Australia. In brief, if we wish to increase our exports to those countries which offer a market for commodities of the kind produced for export, we must, under the conditions now prevailing in international trade, be prepared to give them a reasonable measure of our custom in return. We cannot give these countries a portion of the trade in goods being manufactured in Australia; therefore, it is preferable that we divert to them the trade in commodities which we are importing from countries which offer us but slight compensating advantages by way of reciprocal purchases. In the practice of this policy, which has now been in force since the 22nd May last, the diversion policy has worked against the interests of the United States of America. It is unnecessary to say that we deeply regret this circumstance, but the considerations' in favour of such a policy were so overwhelming that, as we saw it , we had no alternative. To state the position briefly, with respect to our Government get its enormous if we had allowed the adverse trade balance to develop as it was developing In the without restriction from that country, or with only a small partial restriction shared by all other countries, no stops we could have taken to achieve the all important objective could have been successful. I would' again invite the attention of the House to our trading relationship with the United States of America over the last decade, or a little more. For the five years ending 1929 our adverse trade balance with that country amounted, on the average, to £29,000,000 per annum. In 1931-32 that adverse balance had fallen as low as £5,600,000. As we emerged from the depression the adverse balance again became active and cumulative. B y the financial year 1934-35 it had reached £S,900,000. and nothing was more certain at the time we took action than that, within a very few have reached at least £20,000,000 per annum. For the financial year ended the 30th June last, it amounted to £9,500,000. In addition to this adverse balance in trade, dollar loans entail interest payments to America exceeding £3,000,000 sterling annually. There are also the profits from American investments in Australia, whilst profit-taking on films, petrol and oil sold in the Australian market adds greatly to the invisible payments to be remitted to America annually. W it h this continuing d r if t the Australian capacity to establish a ,sufficient balance for overseas interest must have failed utterly. On that fact is based the whole of this policy; if we did not take some steps to adjust this rapidly-grown adverse trade balance with the United States of America, our whole overseas balance would be in extreme danger. gentleman apply that argument in respect of Japan? deal with Japan when I am able to do so. We have a highly favorable balance with Japan, although it is less favorable than our balance with any other country whicli is a substantial buyer of wool. In deciding, in May last, to curtail imports from the United States of America by an estimated amount of £2,300,000 sterling, the Government still left to that country, in its trade with Australia, an estimated favorable balance of not less than £7,500,000 sterling. These figures do not take into account the larger diversion to Australia of motor chassis to the value of over £4,000,000 sterling. To make it clear that the present Government is entirely free from any desire to single out the great American republic in this matter, I might mention that no less than five members of the present Administration were members of the Bruce-Page Administration for the whole, or part, of the five-year period I have mentioned prior to 1930 when the annual adverse balance was at an average of £29,000,000. No action was taken at that time because the necessity for it had not then arisen. The United States of America has been, as I have said, a very indifferent purchaser from Australia. That has been due to circumstances easy of explanation. During the last five years that country has taken from us commodities to the value of only £11,000,000 sterling, while we have taken American commodities to the value of £4S,000,000 sterling. This latter figure is more than the value of our total imports from all continental Europe to which, in the same five-year period, we sold commodities to the value of £84,000,000 sterling, and from which we bought commodities to the value of only £36,000,000 sterling. Our exports abroad are of primary produce which are, in the main, the product, and even the surplus product, of the United States of America. No doubt this circumstance was at least partly responsible for the restriction in the American act empowering the President to make foreign treaties, a restriction which lays it down that he may only make treaties on a basis of reciprocal benefits. That restriction prevented the Government of the United States of America from entering into trade negotiations with the Commonwealth. The Government understands this restriction on the President's treaty-making powers, and also understands the reason why America cannot buy commodities from: Australia of which she also produces a surplus. I emphasize that point. It is reasonable, therefore, to appeal to the Government and the people of the United States of America to show the same understanding of the Australian position and the steps which led us to take the action which we have taken. The United States of America cannot take our primary products because it is a surplus producer of those products. But we are also a surplus producer of primary products, and we must find markets overseas for those products. The United States of America can give us no markets for them, and, I contend, we are a thousand time3 justified in adopting a trade diversion policy of this kind which will enable usto continue sending our surplus primaryproducts outside this country. man now apply that argument to Japan ?* honourable member go to the miners of BrokenH ill and advocate his policy of cheap goods from Japan! I am pleased to be able to say that,, although America has made a protest to the Commonwealth Government against its action, there is quite a lot of evidence that the American people do understand' the situation which has arisen. Undoubtedly this understanding has been aided by the fact that the Government of the United States of America has refused, despite various attempts on our part, even to negotiate with us. It is true that there has been some stronglyworded propaganda against Australia,, but this has come from quarters interested in the export trade to Australia. This propaganda from interested parties was.",49,Henry Gullett The Versy With The Honourable Member On This

243,Sir Henry Gullett,"Let thenot unexpected. In brief, we bave, by our action, run the risk of incurring a very modified form of displeasure from one great country, which purchased relatively little from the Commonwealth, and we have left undisturbed our trading relationships with tbe rest of the world. Had we -taken common action, such as the Leader of the Opposition so strongly advocates, we would have incurred not merely the displeasure, but .also the very active and deserved hostility, of a great many of our best-customer countries. It is yet too early accurately to assess locally as a contribution to Auscomprehensively and in detail the results of this diversion policy. It will be remembered that goods for which orders were in suppliers' hands by the 22nd Mnv were allowed entry into Australia provided they were shipped before tbe 30th June. The latest complete statistics available are for the quarter ended September. policy, while it has, of necessity, been firm, has not been unreasonable, and, as would be expected in the early period, many permits were granted for the continued import of goods in limited, but -diminishing, quantities. AlthoughI cannot give actual figures, therefore, to show the results of the diversion, I can say that it has been, on tbe whole, greatly successful. Already it has, in many directions, led to considerable expansion of Australian manufacturing, especially in the all-important engineering and electri-cal industries. Moreover, it has diverted .a very substantial amount of trade to the United Kingdom, and in a less, but still material, degree to Belgium, Germany, .and our other best-customer foreign countries. Therefore, it can be confidently claimed for the policy that, while it has caused a minimum of overseas trouble, it has proved, and will continue to prove, highly beneficial to Australian secondary industry and employment and to Australian primary industry by assisting onr good-customer countries in their compensating exports to Australia; and it has achieved this without adding to the sum total of our imports. Honourable members will be asked, in the cotirso of the consideration of the schedule, to accord their support to the Oovernmettt's proposals to bring about, by a relatively early date, the manufacture of motor car engines and chassis as far as is practicable within the 'Commonwealth. T n introducing this matter to the Parliament on the 22nd May last, I said that the determination of the. Government to give strong and decisive encouragement to the establishment of this industry in the Commonwealth was, in our minds, separate from and independent of, the general scheme of trade diversion. Moreover, I added that in our view the time had arrived, when this great industry should be established tralia's existing protected industries. Whilst, however, the Government was then of opinion, and is still of opinion, that the local manufacture of both engines and chassis could be amply justified quite apart from the question of the general policy of diversion, the two cannot be divorced. The administration of the Already our experience witb the diversion policy has shown, as I have already said, that it will lead to much new industrial development and wider markets within the Commonwealth. But. no other item of industry in the process of diversion under the general scheme is comparable in magnitude and significance to the proposal to manufacture motor car engines and chassis in Australia. I cannot conceive of any honourable memberwho favours, or who advocates in principle, the trade diversion policy not subscribing wholeheartedly to the Government's proposal to bring about as soon as possible the local manufacture of motor car engines and chassis. Amongst all the items selected for diversion, no single item is comparable in value or national importance to Australia to the project to establish within the Commonwealth the manufacture of the internal combustion engine of the motor car type. Moreover, I doubt whether any other item which comes within the diversion soheme is likely to prove so completely satisfactory in a general way and particularly from the economic view-point. I have stressed its independence from the diversion policy, liecause the Government believes that the manufacturer of the complete motor car within the Commonwealth must, in the industrial, and, indeed, in the whole national interest, have been brought about even had the general diversion scheme not economics of this proposed advance in our been introduced.

In introducing this subject on the 22nd May, I stated this position in reply to an interjection by the honsomewhat differently, and in some measure erroneously; but the fact remains that the position is as I have now put it . Eighty per cent, of the present Australian selling price of motor cars is made up of costs and charges incurred in Australia. We have then to consider the scope which exists for an increase of the cost of manufacture in Australia of the engine and chassis without increasing the total selling price of the complete car. I shall therefore indicate the amount by which costs may be increased owing to local manufacture of engine and chassis without increased price to the local motorist. The following figures are based upon ber in the Commonwealth, for which a chassis of 15 cwt., which is the bodies are built under more favorable approximate weight of the most popular conditions.

The gross duty cars in use in Australia were being manupaid on Canadian chassis of this weight factured here, the manufacture would be is £22 8s., and that paid on chassis carried on by two or three companies of United States of America origin under mass-production conditions, and is £43 8s. be paid in each case is £30, and. prices of bodies, and, indeed, of all the anticipated saving in body-building locally-made accessories.

To some extent the building of bodies in small lots is unavoidable as local agjents cannot, without risk, place a comprehensive order covering the whole of a season's requirements until the market is tested. These uneconomic conditions apply also to all accessories supplied in small orders; but it is especially with respect to assembly, distribution, and salesmanship that we incur excessive costs.

253,,"I shall Mr McCAIX The present system isextraordinarily little known fact that already the successful manufacture of the internal combustion eugine in the Commonwealth is well established. During the year 1935, no fewer than 4,700 internal combustion engines were produced by Australian works. Of these 82 per cent, were petrol engines. Here, too, is a point of great significance. The number of Australian manufacturersoperating last year was 22, and no less than twenty types of internal combustion engines, ranging from l£ horse-power to 80 horse-power were turned out. One could not imagine anything less economic than that. I would ask the House to pay particular attention to the fact that the duty under which this industry is being carried on is British preferential, 33f per tion as to the latest types of engines, cent., plus 5 per cent, primage, or less than 39 per cent, protection as a whole. The factory cost of the motor car engines most commonly in use in Australia is less than £30. Therefore, in offering a bounty of £30 on each complete engine, the Government is providing for two years a duty equivalent to 100 per cent. This may appear high, but it will be generally admitted that a great new undertaking of this nature deserves generous treatment in its pioneering stage. Tariff Board the question of the exact The number of types on offer under Australian manufacture would certainly be heavily reduced, but the importance of this reduction is, I think, very much exaggerated. In reality an overwhelming majority of car-owners in Australia are using a very limited number of cars. Eor example 88 per cent, of the North American cars in use in Australia represent only eleven types of engines; 85 per cent, of all the cars selling on the Australian market represent only seventeen types. It is true that 84 different engines are selling in Australia to-day, but of these 67 engines make up only 15 per cent, of the total sales. Clearly, therefore, any reduction of types due to Australian manufacture would not be a material factor in the merits or demerits of the change over to Australian production. The disposition to types of only a relatively small number of buyers would be affected. There is the point too that the protection intended is not of a prohibitive nature. Even when the Australian industry is fully established those estimate as to the size of the fund that Sir Henry ChMett. who have a particular fancy for imported cars will, it is contemplated, be able to secure them just as they now import in limited numbers cars complete with bodies. On the whole, therefore, I submit that the establishment of the proposed industry within the Commonwealth can be brought about without any increase of the cost of motor cars and with more than a fair prospect of cheaper cars. It is anticipated that the Australian manufacture will be undertaken by overseas firms, or that Australian firms, if they do tbe work, will arrange to have free and constant access, as is done with so much of our manufacturing, to all the latest overseas research and development -a t least enough to give them informachassis and bodies that from time to time make an appearance on overseas markets. ""When introducing this matter on the 22nd May of this year, I stated with respect to engines, that although the Government did not hesitate to take the initiative and' offer a bounty of not less than £30 for the first year of local manufacture and £26 for the second year, it would, at an early date, submit to the bounty required. As far as the chassis, apart from the engine, was concerned, I stated that at an appropriate time the Government would refer to the Tariff Board for examination and report, the question of the Australian manufacture of its different parts. Both of these references bave now been made and indeed upon a somewhat broader basis tban I previously indicated. The Tariff Board has been asked to report upon the best means of giving effect to the Government's policy of establishing in Australia the manufacture of engines and chassis of motor vehicles. Meanwhile the Government proposes to continue its offer of a bounty of at least £30 for the first two years of manufacture in Australia upon the engine, and to continue the existing special import tax of .7d. per lb. upon chassis entering this country to provide a fund within which, bounty at the outset may be paid. will be raised?",54,Cameron Wher E Does And Under Excessive And Extremely Costly
254,Mr Hawker,"Has the Minister anysupply the honourable member with that information at a later stage. In all probability it will be found that tliere are certain vital parts of the engines which could not, at the outset, be produced in Australia upon an economic basis. This may apply ,also to parts of the chassis. The Government is not in any sense committed to an uneconomic venture, in whole or in part, and it will be quite satisfied if , at the outset, the engine imposed by the United States of America is, in the great main, manufactured in Australia and a bounty is paid upon a proportional basis, and if the local manufacture of the chassis takes place upon a progressive basis. In submitting the matter to the Tariff Board at an earlier date than was previously contemplated, the Government feek that it is taking a step which will meet the objections of all, or nearly all, of the critics of this great enterprise. In concluding my remarks upon this question I would suggest to honourable members that the four greatest national needs of the moment are: the complete restoration of normal employment followed by a safe policy of immigration; the insuring of our overseas financial position; the widening of the home market for primary and secondary products; and last and greatest of all, provision of adequate defence for the Commonwealth. With all respect, I'submit to the committee that no single step which could be taken, either in its significance'or in its magnitude, would contribute more swiftly and strongly to the attainment of these vital objectives than the decision of this committee to bring about the home production on an approved financial basis of the internal combustion engine and at the same time to take every step within our power to produce the complete motor car. This schedule covers roughly four phases of government policy. There is first the general trade diversion policy by which it is sought to protect the Australian trade balance, by diverting trade as far as possible towards countries which are good customers for our products. That is the general principle of the duties which are applied to goods which come from the United States of America. There is the second phase of the duties which more particularly affect Australia's trade with Japan. Those duties, I would remind the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Curtin), do comply with the prin1 ciple which he laid down-that every foreign country should be treated with absolute equality. They apply to all countries. Although they happen to affect the goods exported by Japan-the y do so only to the same extent that duties on wool, wine and certain other commodities of that sort, happen to have prohibitive effect on goods which Australia could export to the United States of America; and although they do, as a matter of fact, actually affect our trade with Japan, they are in a somewhat different category with regard to trade diversion from the duties which affect our trade with the United States of America. I do not class Jaj>an as a badcustomer country. the Minister directing negotiations for trade treaties does not either. The United States of America, however, has definitely been a poor customer of Australia, and in the last twenty years it has been a poor customer for the rest of the world. It has been only during the last year or two that a more liberal policy has been followed by the Roosevelt administration, but, even so, that more liberal policy has not yet enabled the rest of the world to pay its way with the United States of America and its debt obligations to that country as well. The third phase consists of the protective aids with regard to the manufacture of motor chassis and engines in Australia and, fourthly, there is the less important, but in some respects, very onerous duty on timber, which again has some effect on the trade balance. With regard to the general policy of trade diversion from poor customers to good customers, I wholeheartedly support the Government. I entirely disagree with the Leader of the Opposition that, irrespective of the treatment we get from them, we should treat all foreign countries with absolute equality. We have been following that principle for a number of years, and the effect has been",55,Cameron Wher E Does And Under Excessive And Extremely Costly

258,Mr Hawker,"And I am sure thatto destroy our trade with the countries that want to buy our products. During recent years, while our purchases from the United States of America have been growing, our purchases from France, Germany, Italy and Belgium have been falling. Between 1932-33 and 1934-35, in all those countries our purchases fell and the result was that those countries in desperate straits regarding their own trade balances, reduced their own overseas purchases, first on comfort goods. That affected Australia, first as regards meat, apples and goods of that sort until, eventually, the only market in the world where we could sell the products of orchards and intense culture was the market of the United Kingdom. That has been the effect upon Australia of the policy of buying everything that suited us from the United States of America, and letting our exports look after themselves. We have reached the stage at which, although the countries I have mentioned are in desperate need of better clothing-in a country like Germany, there is a really dire need for better woollen clothing to counteract the cold of the climate-thos e countries, in an effort to maintain tlieir own solvency have been forced to cut. down purchases of raw materials such as wool. That policy has restricted the market for all of our exports. It has been one of the things which has been making.it difficult for us to maintain our trade balance. It has been difficult to finance big purchases of comfort and luxury goods from the United States of America. The present Government of the United States of America, which I have just described as a more liberal government than its predecessors, was approached by the Commonwealth Government with, a request that it should, make some modification of its tariff policy in regard to Australian products. The reply was that the United States of America could deal only with the countries which were in a position to give it still further concessions. Witb regard to the general principle, the action taken by the Commonwealth Government was, therefore, entirely and absolutely justified, although I recognise that the details of carrying out a. trade diversion policy must create a great deal of friction. It is probable that in a Ilr. fla--!:rr. number of cases, mistaken decisions have been made, and in common with other honourable members, I should like the Minister and the Government to ensure that mistakes are rectified and unnecessarily onerous restrictions are eliminated. The restrictions are particularly onerous in tbe case of partlymanufactured material, which is the raw material for the finished product made up in Australia. It has been brought to my notice that one manufacturer has' been put at a serious disadvantage in competition with other manufacturers, because goods of probably 25 per cent. American content have been given entry to Australia through Canada, whereas goods representing 5 per cent, of the finished Australian article, which would, compete with the other article, bave been denied admission. Such anomalies are liable to arise when any innovation is made and administered by individual Ministers and officers. They can only be removed by the Government controlling the situation with sympathy, care and impartiality. Such items as tobacco, oils, and materials of that sort, constitute a straight-out diversion of big bulk lines of comfort, consumption goods from the United States of America to other countries which trade more generously with us. The anomalies occur more particularly with partially-manufactured goods which are the materials from which finished articles are produced in Australia. I was glad to hear tbe Minister's assurance to-night that the Government is doing its best to remedy such troubles. I have the greatest sympathy with the Government's aim to manufacture motor cars in Australia. I do not express any opinion on the practicability of the proposal or whether a bounty of £30 is sufficient. That is a subject for determination by experts. I take it for granted that the Government caused a thorough examination of the position to be made by the officers of the Trade and Customs Department, and also obtained expert advice from other sources, before it adopted its present policy. There is a good deal of controversy as to whether engine and chassis units can be manufactured successfully in this country. Figures have been published to indicate that a much larger bounty than £30 would be necessary for the purpose-a n altogether uneconomic bounty, in fact. I suggest that this whole subject be referred to the Tariff Board, the statutory expert body 6et up to advise the Government on such matters. The manufacture of motor cars cannot, of course, be considered entirely and absolutely on the basis of protection, but a large element of protection enters into it. For this reason, I suggest that the practicability of the proposal, and also the recomcumbent on me to make some general mendation of an adequate bounty and tariff, should be referred to the Tariff Board for investigation and report. I emphasize the enormous value to Australia for defence purposes of manufacturing at least one type of engine and chassis in this country. If private companies are not prepared to embark upon the enterprise as a commercial proposition, the Government should consider utilizing the bounty fund to enable the defence munitions department to equip an establishment for the manufacture of vehicles for defence purposes. I shall have more to say later about the timber duties. At the moment I content myself with remarking that it was a retrograde step to raise the duty so that the work of sawing logs, which was previously done in Australia, has been diverted to Canada. Timber now enters this country in sawn condition. I hope that the Government will take into consideration the effect that this has had in switching imports from Oregon, the most suitable timber for the purpose for which timber is imported, on to spruce, hemlock, and other timbers. The anomaly to which I have referred should be rectified at least to the extent that Oregon may be brought into Australia in logs so that the work of sawing may be done here. From the point of view of Australia generally at the moment, the most important consideration arising from the schedule now before us is the effect that it has had on our trade with Japan. I recognize that the Minister is under a disability in that he is practieally tonguesuccessful manner, and it happenedI tied while negotiations with the Government of Japan are proceeding, as he. put it, ""not without prospects of success"". would he most unwise and reckless of him to make a speech in this House which might give offence or commit him to some decision Avhich it would be difficult to alter in the progress of the negotiations. I commend the honourable gentleman for his moderation and restraint in this regard and wish him every success in his negotiations. I feel, however, that as a private member with a large number of wool-growers among my constituents, and with some recent acquaintance with the background, of this dispute, it is incomment, which I hope will not be unhelpful, on the principles which should govern our relations with a good neighbour and a good customer such as Japan is. I cannot, myself, justify the effort to divert such a huge proportion of trade as the new duties must affect, from a good customer country even to the Mother Country, with its unique markets for our products."" Figures have been published to show that the new tariff aimed at reducing tbe imports of Japanese textiles into Australia by something like 40 per cent. It is difficult to justify that drastic action in respect to a good customer country when the imports of motor cars from the United States of America maystill be maintained at the peak year total.. I realize, of course, that many considerations must be borne in mind. Motor cars make work in Australia, but Japanese textile goods do not do so to the same extent. I think the new duties were an unreasonably severe set-back to a country which had bought generously of our produce. I unhesitatingly agree that there is absolute necessity on the part of the Australian Government, of whatever political composition, to reach with the Government of Japan some amicable understanding upon which trade between the two countries may be carried on without any unnecessary disturbance of the economic position of either of them.. The Japanese expansion of trade has been an expansion of volume, and bas been carried on in a thorough, determined and do not say that it was deliberately aimed to do so-to disturb the trade of other countries out of all proportion to the In such circumstances, it value of the increased trade to Japan itself. The prices at which Japanese .goods were sold were undermining the commercial position of those countries. Eor instance, I cite one article which has not been the subject of controversy between Australia and Japan, but which has been before this House-cement. understand from Japanese gentlemen who .are interested in the manufacture of cement in Japan that they were able to land it at the Persian Gulf and sell it to the Persian Government for the purposes of railway construction, freight, insurance, and all other charges paid, for 24s. sterling a ton; that is equal to 30s. in Australian currency. Japanese cement at present is not competing with Australian cement in Australia; but I suggest to honourable members that, at these figures, it could have been sold in successful competition with the local product, and that before long the Commonwealth Government would have been compelled to take some steps in order to shelter our cement industry against having its standards lowered by such efficient and aggressive competition. Shipping is another instance in which Japanese commerce, backed by government subsidies, was seriously threatening Australian services. vernment, as part of its policy of unemployment relief, has been subsidizing heavily tbe rebuilding of the mercantile marine; and against the Japanese ships thus put on the trade routes of the world unsubsidized shipping was unable to hold, its own. As the honourable member for Macquarie ( Mr John Lawson) pointed out some time ago, the Australian shipping service to Japan is carrying on practically on the sufferance of the Japanese, and the notice of the termination of that sufferance had been served on Australian shipping some time before the trade diversion policy was announced. AlthoughI do not think that there is the slightest official backing for any aims of this nature, I bring before the notice of honourable members some information contained in a photograph reproduction of a map publisbed in a Japanese book. It indicates the limits to which such effiagainst tbe importation of various cient and aggressive competition might be aimed at by Japan. It also shows the objectives of a certain ambitious minority movement in Japan and how, in its opinion, the new Japan ilr. Hawker. should be constructed. Probably it is an uninfluential minority; but it certainly represents one section of Japanese thought. According to the map, the objective of this society is that I the new Japan shall include a large part of Eastern Asia and a large number of the territories of the South Pacific. Among them Australia is shaded in as an immigration area belonging to the New Japan. I do not suggest for one with moment that such an objective is shared by the Japanese Government, or by any considerable part of the Japanese people ; but it is one phase of the ultimate possibilities of unchecked, ruthless expansion and competition by Japan, which other countries have to take into consideration in their trading relations with that country. lication ? is, although it was issued before the introduction of tbe Government's trade diversion policy. Zealand? Japanese immigration. I think that the conclusion whicli arises from these facts is that the Government of the Commonwealth had no option but to seek some amicable arrangement with the Japanese Government to ensure that, while Japanese goods received a generous entry into Australia-a n entry which would incur no financial sacrifice on the part of Japan:-th p principle should be recognized by both, that each country had a prime duty to protect its own economic system against any particular drastic action on the part of the other. Because the Japanese Government declined to negotiate in regard to the effect of Japanese cotton goods in undermining our market and our goodwill in the north and north-west of England, I find that tbe Government has considerable justification for taking fairly drastic action Japanese lines.

262,The Japanese Go,"Mr HAWKER -Not as a field fortlieir population. But at the same time, we are willing enough to sell our produce to low-wage earning consumers. One of the factors that helps us to carry our high standard of living is the purchasing power which we gain by selling our produce to other countries where wage standards arc not so high as our own. Low as some of these wage standards are in comparison with the Australian standard, they do represent an improvement of conditions in those countries. So long as the trade takes place in a way which does not necessarily unsettle our economic and commercial system, the more that it can grow, the better for both countries concerned ; the better will be the chance given munity, are prepared to face risk should to the poorer country to raise its standards ; and the better our chance of maintaining, and even raising our standards. The fact that the Japanese Government would not negotiate, but took most drastic action against Australian imports when the Commonwealth Government tabled this schedule, illustrates one of our administrative deficiencies. As yet we have not created suflicient organization to make us really efficient in our relations with other countries. Other peoples, particularly the Orientals, have a psychology and mentality vastly different from our own, and it is only by an efficient Departarea. It should make allowance for the ment of External Affairs that we can expect to understand their outlook. At present we have a small Department of External Affairs, but a larger staff is reI am informed on good authority quired in order to carry out the enormous amount of work that is necessary to keep up to date with the psychology, politics, and repercussions in various countries. Only by this means can we ever hope to carry on serious and drastic modifications of om\ relations with other countries, without giving rise to serious friction. That applies to successive Commonwealth governments. One of the most disastrous acts of policy of a previous government was the setback administered by it to the little Department of External Affairs which the Bruce-Page Government had begun to establish. I highly commend the present Government for what it has done to extend the organization of this department, which, however, is still very small. Partly due to misunderstanding, and partly to the drastic manner in which the Japanese carry on their relations with other countries, they retaliated against the Australian trade diversion policy in a most extreme way. But when the dispute was thus made a national matter I , as an Australian, would not share in any attempt to weaken the hands of those who were holding the shield of our country. We know something of the difficulties associated with international relations and the maintenance of goodwill. We know also the danger of being divided in the face of drastic action by a foreign country. The wool-growers of Australia are not "" an unpatriotic crowd"" as some have said; they, like other sections of the comthe general interests of their country require it. A good deal of misunderstanding might have been avoided in the beginning had the Government taken the wool-growers into their confidence earlier, and appointed an advisory committee before it did. Although the Government should not capitulate in the face of the terrible punitive action taken by Japan as retaliation for the Australian tariff, it should be prepared to compromise in a way which indicates a realization of the real difficulties of the Japanese Government in providing for a huge population in a country of limited desperation of a people dependent to a large extent for work and livelihood on uninterrupted trade with other countries. that Australian purchases of rayon represented 14 per cent, of the total exports of rayon from Japan. Those exports provide a great deal of employment in a country where it is difficult to obtain raw material to provide work for the people. They represent also a substantial proportion of the credits by which imports of raw materials from Australia can be financed. Erom an Australian point of view there is much in placing Japan in a position to finance its purchases of raw materials from this country. The Japanese are a people whom we respect. They have proved themselves loyal allies and good commercial clients. Japanese competition helped to maintain wool prices during the depression and to build up Australia's purchasing power for British goods. I leeugnize that something had to be done to prevent that iiuge section of tlie British listened with attention to the honourable public which is represented by the textile and engineering manufacturers of Lancashire and surrounding counties from feeling that they had been completely ousted from the Australian Something had to be done, either by way of agreement or otherwise, to ensure for Australia a market in the north and north-west of England. mere idle sentimentality to urge that that market should be maintained; it is good business in the interests of Australian exporters and producers. British trade as a whole does not stand to lose by a general growth of Australia's trade with. Japan. And what is even more important is that no bitterness shall remain when the trade dispute has ended. Australia should recognize that Japan has real difficulties. I have before me another map, extracted from the publication that I have already mentioned, which shows the proportion of the world that is controlled by the white races and from which Japanese goods are, to a great extent, excluded. Showing as it does the extent of the restrictions it is a pathetic map. Whilst we should assist the Government to show all possible firmness against unreasonably punitive sures, we should expect it, to show generosity in compromise. should go more than half-way to meet Japan in connection with the fixing of a quota in respect of textiles. I believe that in the early stages of the negotiations with Japan the Australian government was prepared to show a generous spirit, but, unfortunately, tragic misunderstandings led to a. dispute. I hope that if the misunderstanding with Japan has not been removed before the duties on goods in which Japan is particularly interested come before the committee, no action of an irrevocable nature will be taken, but that the way will be left open for an amendment of the duties to be made, even if Parliament is not in session, so that the dispute may be settled at the earliest possible moment in the interests, not only of Australia but, more important still, of good feeling between two countries which can do so much for the betterment of each other. Mr Hawker. member for Wakefield ( Mr Hawker), but I find it difficult to follow his reasoning. He referred to a map in his possession which showed the ambitions of a secmarket. tion of the people of Japan, and yet he supported the policy of the Government in restricting Australia's trade with that country and the United States of It is not America. At a time like the present, when the world is in a state of turmoil, I should have thought that it was bad policy to make potential trade enemies of Nevertheless. either of those two great countries. But I was even more interested in the speech of the Minister directing negotiations for trade treaties ( Sir Henry Gullett), who spoke of the possibilities of motor car manufacture in Australia. The Minister gave to the committee no idea of the identity of the authority he quoted or any indication of the nature of any examination that had been made into the matter, and therefore, it seemed to be almost improper for him to imply that, as the result of the steps taken by the Government in regard to duties on motor cars and the creation of a fund for a bounty, it was probable that in a short time motor cars would be manufactured in Australia at a cost little greater than that of. immeaported vehicles. Let, us consider the present cost of making motor bodies in Australia. Australia We have been informed by representatives of the motor industry in Perth and Adelaide that a motor car body costing about £110 in Australia can be manufactured in England for about £30. Yet we are told that it would be possible to manufacture in Australia, at a price within the capacity of our people, motor vehicles of two types which, would meet the transport needs of this country in respect of both cars and trucks. I have been given to understand that the plant necessary to equip a factory capable of producing in Australia two models of 10 horse power and 30 horse power, added to the time which must necessarily elapse before the factory cculd be in full production, would involve a caf)ital expenditure of £4,000,000 or more. If the Minister had told us that companies in Australia were prepared to engage in the production of motor cars there might have been some support for",59,Cameron Wher E Does And Under Excessive And Extremely Costly
263,Mr Gregory (Swan) [10.28],"Ihis statements; but, lacking that support, it was most reprehensible because it conveyed an impression that it had been made after f u l l inquiry. Board is the only body which could undertake a f u l l inquiry into that subject, and had it investigated the proposal, this Parliament would have for its guidance the facts adduced in evidence before the board. I am astonished that tbe honourable member for Wakefield has not joined with me in protesting against the Minister's action in varying the tariff policy without first consulting the Tariff Board. On the statute-book there is a law which definitely states that no new or increased duties shall be imposed without previous reference to the Tariff Board. Here we have tlie extraordinary anomaly of one of the legal members of the Cabinet telling the people that the Government u? not controlled by its own laws. It would seem that, while tbe Government may do what it likes with respect to the law, others must comply with it . Tlie Leader of the Opposition delivered a lengthy address to-night on the subject of our trade relations with Japan. In dealing with imports into this country I do not think the honourable gentleman was qiiito f a i r in taking for purposes of illustration the period from 1931-32 up to 1936. I suggest that, in order to make a reasonably f a ir comparison witb the trade of to-day he might have gone back to the pre-depression period. I was pleased to notice the recognition on both honourable member that the statement that sides of the fact that, as imports increase, I had circulated such rumours is quite so does employment increase. The statisuntrue. tics from 1900 onwards reveal the extraordinary fact that, where imports into Australia have increased, unemployment has decreased, and that, conversely, unemployment has increased with a diminution of imports. Unfortunately, during the period from 1920 to 1929 imports in creased considerably by the extensive borrowing overseas, although at the time when wheat, wool and other primary products were bringing high_prices governments should have been doing everything within their power to refrain from extravagances of that sort. That remarkable feature of the relation of imports to employment shows tbe fallacy of the Scullin Government's policy e>f imposing embargoes on imports, [78] disregarding the fact that if we had no credits overseas, nobody would have been likely to send their goods to Australia. The Taritt We have heard a good deal of talk concerning the adverse trade balance, and it is rather astonishing that instead of raising the exchange rate, and so benefiting the primary producers-of whose part in creating by their exports credits overseas the Minister directing negotiations for trade treaties spoke so highly the other night -the Government has done everything to increase the cost of production in rural industries to such an extent that it is almost impossible for the export trade to be maintained. I contend that in May last not only members of this Parliament but also the people of Australia generally were disappointed, not so much by the incredibly high duties imposed under the trade diversion policy, but that the action taken by. the Government must arouse tbe deepest resentment and antagonism in Japan and contempt in the United States of America. The position was aggravated by the rumours circulated by the Minister at tlie time, one of which was that, Japan had been demanding an abrogation of the White Australia policy. Statements of that sort were not only very dangerous to Australia's interests but were also calculated to make the position very much worse than it was before. Sir HENRYGULLETT I assure the ter, in a broadcast address, said that the entire responsibility for the dispute rested with Japan. The right honourable gentleman charged Japan with attempting to l i m it our tariff-making powers. I contend that Japan did nothing more or less than was done by Belgium two years ago, when in retaliation for the embargo placed by Australia on Belgian glass. it imposed an embargo on tbe importation into that country of Australian beef and barley. When we imposed restrictions' on the importation of Japanese goods, the Japanese Government was quite within its rights in taking retaliatory action against us. Discriminatory duties against Japan",61,Cameron Wher E Does And Under Excessive And Extremely Costly
264,Mr Gregory,"The Prime Miniswere not necessary. In the Australian Industries Preservation Act special provision is made which would have enabled the Government to impose increased duties against Japanese good's, if owing to the devaluation of the yen, they were being dumped in Australia. Only recently the Minister introduced a bill to amend that act to enable the dumping provisions to be applied to goods coming into Australia as ballast. Sir tion of a dumping duty because of currency devaluation was the cause of the Canadian dispute with Japan, and such action on our part would not have avoided the present trouble. had statutory power to take action pending an inquiry by the Tariff Board. Had a Labour Government done what this Government is now doing I can well imagine the denunciation that would have been hurled at it by every member of the present Government. The Minister directing negotiations for trade treaties ( Sir Henry Gullett), speaking of the restrictions on imports imposed by the Scullin Government in 1931, said that the policy then being enforced was such as to invite retaliation from those countries which were buying our goods. Australia, he said, had received a plain and, in his opinion, a proper ultimatum, from Belgium. He addedTliere is a danger of carrying to extreme lengths this action against the United States of America, or any other country. There is only one attitude to adopt, and that is to consider the balance of trade with all countries. And now he asks us to destroy trade and friendly relations. entirely different then. that time, criticized the power by which the Minister for Trade and Customs could grant or refuse permission to import goods; yet he himself now proposes to exercise exactly the same power in regard to the importation of goods from the United States of America. In 1931, the Minister for Defence( Sir Archdale Parkhill) pointed out how unf a ir it was that one business man should be allowed to import £50,000 worth of goods, while his competitor might be refused permission to import any. No one, he said, should be placed in a position to exercise back-door influence for the purpose of gaining concessions that are denied to others. Because some members of Parliament have dared to protest against the action the Government bas taken, we have had the cry raised that they are anti-British and pro-Japanese. Tbat is a cowardly for m of attack. I oppose the action the Government has taken, although in loyalty Sometimes I am inclined to believe that there is a good deal of truth in Dr. Johnson's definition of patriotism. I deprecate this tendency on the part of Ministers to denounce any one as unpatriotic who dares to disagree with them. I have read something of the conditions which prevailed in the Lancashire cotton trade during the years from 1919 to 1921. An extraordinary boom took place at that time, cotton goods realizing up to ten times as much as before tbe war. M ill s which cost no more than £30,000 to establish were floated into companies with a capital of anything up to £500,000. It was a kind of "" .South Sea bubble "" which eventually burst. Ever since then the cotton trade of Lancashire has been, to some extent, in difficulty, and I should like to know whether we are now being asked to provide profit on the capital value at which some of those companies were floated. Sir HENRYGULLETT No , we are not. February last, published the followingSir Walter Preston informed tlie House of Commons tliat, after a detailed examination, he came to the conclusion that a re-equipped mill can sell its product in India a.t Japan's price and make a profit of at.least 10 per cent. He went on to say that the report of the Federation of Master Cotton Spinners had proved his case, though their estimate of profits at 3$ per cent, was lower than that shown by his own calculation. . . . Reliance, in too many case3, on obsolete machinery and methods is a decisive handicap to an industry whose prosperity depends on its ability to meet wellarmed and efficient competition in export markets. That is why I should like the fullest inquiry to be made before action is taken. I am not one of those who believe that a country must necessarily suffer because cheap goods are for sale.

Of course, if goods are being imported under unfair competitive conditions, inquiries can be made and appropriate action taken. It is only necessary to recall the statements made by Mr Page, of the Tariff Board of the United States of America, regarding the terrible abuses in connection with tariff making in that country to realize how careful we must be. There were able to obtain special privileges, and it was not until the f u l l light of publicity was turned upon tbe tariff that the evil was remedied. that there would have been much more opposition to tbe Government's policy had not the price of wool been so satisfactory. There is not the slightest doubt that, in ordinary circumstances, there would have been a substantial decline of prices. The only conclusion to which I can come is that in every country there is the greatest fear of an outbreak of war in the near future, and, as far as possible, steps are being taken to be f u l l y prepared for it . I believe that, but for that, the protest against the action of the Government would bave been more widespread than it has been. I wish to say a few words in regard to by the Government, and that the Minister the statements of the Minister directing dictates the manner in which it shall be negotiations for trade treaties concerning applied. the possibility of motor cars being wholly manufactured in Australia. I urge the public to take an interest in this matter. tralia, large numbers of persons are Por about twenty years, motor car bodies employed in the motor industry, and they have been made in this country.

The Ministerd id not inform honourable members of that fact to-night, nor did he indicate where the the big moneyed interests huge capital required was available, or mention the company which authorized the statement that he made. I believe that the honourable gentleman said that I am convinced 80 per cent, of the requirements for the manufacture of a motor car are now made in Australia.
