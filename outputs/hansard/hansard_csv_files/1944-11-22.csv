He was again elected at the general elections in 1925 and 1931, and retired on the expiration of his term as a senator on the 30th June, 1938. He was a member of the Select Committee on the claims of Captain J. Strasburg for War Gratuity, 1922, and of theSelect Committee on the Central Reserve Bank Bill, 1930. It was, however, as a military leader that Major-General Cox was most widely known. He had a distinguished record of service in the South African War and in the war of 1914-18. In the former campaign, as commander of the 3rd New South Wales Mounted Rifles, he rose to the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel, won the Queen's South African Medal with six clasps and the King's South African Medal with two clasps, and was created a Companion of the Bath. He joined the Australian Imperial Force was appointed to command the 6th Light Horse Regiment with the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel, later being promoted to Brigadier-General in command of the First Light Horse .Brigade.

Minister indicate whether or not the proposed acquisition of commercial airlines is to take effect immediately, or subsequent to the passage of the legislation he has foreshadowed? Is it proposed that commercial services operating within but not extending beyond the boundaries of a State, shall be acquired ? not be taken over until the legislation has been fully debated and passed by this Parliament. The matter of airlines that operate intra-state is being further examined. failure of the Acting Prime Minister to give the necessary information to the House concerning the Government's commercial air policy, are honourable members and the public to understand that this policy is the outcome of a snap caucus decision, and that the 'Government has not worked out the actual details? for the inability of the honourable member r.o understand plain English. I made a clear and unequivocal statement setting forth the policy of the Government. That policy was decided upon by a meeting of the Cabinet, and is not the result of a discussion by the parliamentary Labour party. My colleagues in the Cabinet know that what they have done is in accordance with the platform of the Labour party, and when the necessary legislation is introduced to give our fighting forces. Particularly do they effect to the policy, full details will be set before honourable members-ibu t even then, some of themwill probably not be able to understand the scheme. Prime Minister say whether the proposed acquisition by the Commonwealth of interstate airlines is to be interpreted as the first step in Labour's nationalization programme? announced represents a Cabinet decision regarding the future control of this great public utility, which is of growing importance to Australia. The Government makes no apology for having come to this decision, and I make no apology for having announced it. Acting Prime Minister tell us which union the pilots of aircraft will be forced to join after the airways are nationalized ? will not be asked to join is the Country party union. for Labour and National Service give me some idea as to the position of labour for this year's sugar target and the preparations for the 1945 crop? 3eason will not finish until the end of next month, but I am able to say that the target fixed for this season of 600,000 tons has been exceeded by from 30,000 to 40,000 tons.

The first part of the question relates to British internees. I remember, when I was in Opposition, with the consent of the then Government, visiting the internment camps, and I understood then, as I know now, that the whole arrangement was a joint one between the United Kingdom lian Government. Honourable members will recall that when war brolce out United Kingdom were ""combed out"", and many of them were sent to Australia, the understanding being that the Commonwealth Government could not release them, even if it desired to do so, without mated that approximately £6,000,000 the consent of the British Government. Negotiations are proceeding all the time. Some of those men were not, as was stated in the question, people who had not the confidence or trust pf the British Gostill outstanding will ultimately be convernment. They were hurriedly "" picked up "" on the outbreak of war. Some of them were children when they arrived in Great Britain, and others had sons fighting in the British forces. Many of them were employed in engineering works which later became munitions establishments. After they had been here for one, two or three years, the British Government itself, Prime Minister whether, as the result of after investigation, asked for them to be returned, or gave permission to the Commonwealth Government. to release them and use them in industry. Many of them have since been making machine tools and gauges, or doing other special war work in Australia. I do not know whether any Japanese were among them, but I consider that in order to provide a proper answer to such a large and very important question, I should confer with the Attorney-General and give further details to the honourable member later. and Minister for Post-war Eeconstructhe House somefiguresshowing the result of the Second Victory Loan. When the loan closed, I announced that the final number of subscribers would be approximately 410,000. The number actually recorded to date is 404,310. To this must be added group applications and service allotments numbering approximately 14,300. This will bring the total number of subscribers to 418,610. The total amount subscribed in new cash is £113,840,000. In regard to the conversion portion of the loan amounting to £47,520,000 which matured on the 15th October, the number of people who have converted is 40,544, for a total amount of £40,196,940. Eedemptions by 6,290 Government and the Austraholders amounted to £6,039,200, leaving the amount of securities outstanding £1,283,990. The redeemed securities have unnaturalized aliens in the been met from the National Debt Sinking Fund, which will also pay off such of the outstanding securities as will not be converted. When the loan was issued it was estiwould not be converted and provision was made for these redemptions to be met from the sinking fund. It is expected that a fair proportion of the securities verted. Although a great deal of work remains to be done in the registries in regard to recording subscriptions, these figures may be taken as the final result of the loan.

Not only were the representatives of the Government of New South Wales grateful for an opportunity to meet Commonwealth Ministers on this matter, but also representatives of the miners federation, and the Australian Colliery Proprietors Association, in particular, thanked the Government for the invitation to attend the conference and put their views. I believe that in a democracy the Government should be prepared to listen to the views of all sections of the people. I also believe that, arising from our conferences last Monday, there will be an increased production of coal. Prime Minister make a statement setting forth the latest details regarding coal stocks in Australia? Is it correct that reserves of coal are so small that if the miners take a fortnight's holiday at Christmas time some munitions plants, including that of the BrokenH ill Proprietary Company Limited, will probably be compelled to close down, so tha,fc many thousands of workers will be laid off, and the now of war material to the battle front interrupted ? Seeing that the Government has just -been conferring with representatives of the coal-mining industry, can the Acting Prime Minister say what plans have been formulated to avert a catastrophe? clear and frank statement regarding stocks of coal. Again, on Monday, a clear statement was made to representatives of the Government of New South Wales, the miners federation, and the Australian Colliery Proprietors Association, I shall keep in touch with the position from day to day, and further statements will be 1 made whenever it is deemed advisable. ask the Acting Prime Minister whether it ie correct, as reported, that on the last two occasions on which representatives of the miners' federation have visited Canberra cars have been provided There was to bring them to Canberra.

Can any action be taken to deal with this form of absenteeism? ledge of this subject apart from what I have read in the newspapers. 1 do not know whether there has been any absenteeiam on golf courses. If men and women, whether they be employers or employees, who are engaged on essential work neglect their duties through spendr ing too much time on golf courses, I presume that they will be dealt with in the same way as other people. recognized that if Australia is to remain a great nation, every effort must be made to increase our population, and as Australian babies are' our best asset, I ask the Acting.

I have had considerable correspondence from, honourable members, as well as personal representations, for bore casing to be made available in other States as well as in Queensland. My inquiries have revealed that the manufacturers have not any reserve stocks, the whole of the production having been utilized for Army purposes. I applied to the Army for the release of a proportion of its stocks for use in droughtstricken areas, on the understanding that they would be replaced later, and a small quantity was made-available, but I was informed that on account of urgent needs, it was impossible to promise further releases. Stewart and Lloyds Australia Proprietary Limited, the manufacturers of bore casing in Australia, have a maximum productive capacity of 50 tons a week, and 50 per cent, of this output is going to Queensland, where 1 trust it will help to relieve the position in the drought-stricken areas. has been presented to the citizens of Burnside for tbe purpose of establishing a war memorial hospital.

Will the Treasurer consider allowing all donations to be free of income tax? memorial hospital is to be a public hospital, all donations will have the benefit of a rebate under the Income Tax Act, but the Commissioner must first be satisfied that it is a public hospital. Many claims are made on behalf,of hospitals which do not fulfil this condition. What steps does the Minister for Repatriation propose to take to correct the very serious position in relation to staff revealed before a Commonwealth industrial commissioner a few days ago, when a nursing sister testified that, although I am deeply concerned the normal staff of the Lady Davidson Sanatorium, at Turramurra was 21, in fact it has only nine nurses at present, consequently the majority of the patients have to look after themselves? very seriously.

Meanwhile, in order to afford some measure ot relief, arrangements have been made for telephonists to use the phrase "" Interstate calling"" in cases where a call is being connected over a main inter-capital trunk-line. In other instances the term "" Trunk-lines calling"" will continue to be used until such time as the restrictions may lie relaxed further.

I have received from the honourable member for Darwin (Dame Enid Lyons) an intimation that she desires to move the adjournment of the House for the purpose of discussing a definite matter of urgent public importance, namely, "" The inequitable working of the method now in use for the calculation of Commonwealth grants to the smaller States "". DAME ENID LYONS (Darwin) [4.3] I move That the House do now adjourn. supported ? Five honourable members having risen in support of the motion, DAME ENID LYONS I have taken this course in order to draw attention to a matter of sufficient importance to have been the subject, within the last three weeks, of a resolution unanimously passed by both Houses of the Parliament of Tasmania. It is a question which, I believe, can find a satisfactory and permanent solution only in the summoning of a Commonwealth convention that will thoroughly overhaul the whole Constitution, because this is a matter which concerns the financial relations of the Commonwealth and tbe States. With the passing of the years, those relations have grown more and more involved, and the disabilities from which the smaller States have suffered under federation have shown no signs of diminution. remain, and pending the calling of a convention, there should not be allowed to grow up great and permanent differences in the financial status of the various States, which might eventually prove to be irremediable, as I hope to show. I shall not go very deeply into the histo Tasmania because I know it best, and tory of the establishment of the Commonwealth Grants Commission, but it is necessary for me to cover some of the ground in order to establish, and to bring clearly before the minds of honourable members, one very important and significant point. Many people, including, I fear, some honourable members of this chamber, hold the view that grants made by the Commonwealth to smaller or so called claimant States are in the nature of acts of generosity by the larger or so called standard States. As a matter of fact, they represent an attempt to compensate the recipient States for disabilities that have been created by federation. It must not be imagined that the smaller States are naturally the poorer States. Take the case of Tasmania for example. It is an island noted for its productivity, its rich agricultural lands, its enormous production of minerals, and its wealth of timber products. It is an island so favoured that I understand one honourable member of the House has been inspired with the desire to change its name to ""Honeymoon Island"", but whether he also desires to move the capital to Deloraine I cannot say. Tasmania has always been noted for the economy of its administration, a point which I ask honourable members to note particularly, for it has received official recognition in the fact that, for many years, the Commonwealth Grants Commission has recommended a special allowance in assessment of grant to it on that ground. Erom the Treasury point of view, however, it is the poorest of all the States. Recently Gray, said that Tasmania was a rich country made poor by federation. For years before Tasmania federated there was a succession of genuine surpluses in its Treasury, and the per head wealth of the community was the highest in Australia. I hope that honourable members will bear that quotation in mind as I proceed toWhile those disabilities show how many disabilities have fallen upon Tasmania through the unequal results that have flowed from Commonwealth legislation. The general reasons for Tasmania's present position probably apply to the other claimant States in varying degrees and ways. I shall refer because, during the past two or three years, I have made a special study of itsfinancial position, and because, according to Sir Nicholas Lockyer, thespecial Commonwealth Commissioner-",14,Report By Mr J K Jensen

92,"The Treasurer Of Tasmania, Mr Dwyer","who inquired into the subject, "" it is the greatest sufferer from disabilities created to offset their difficulties, and the amounts by federation "". What are the reasons that have brought about this result? They are mainly attributable to inequalities in the operamonwealth Grants Commission was tion of certain Commonwealth legislation. In 1932 the Lyons Government ordered a ful l investigation of the economic posiassessment of claims by the smaller tion of Tasmania. The committee which it appointed for this purpose and which had certain economists associated with it, established that, although Tasmania received benefits from the tariff protection legislation of the Commonwealth equivalent to approximately £4 per head of its population, it incurred, through increased prices, due to the fact that most of the protected industries were on the mainland, a disability equivalent to £6 per head, leaving it £2 per bead worse off than formerly. It was also revealed that, in 1932, the State was suffering a loss of £421,000 per annum in consequence of the operation of the Navigation Act which caused increased aoa freight charges. The Navigation Act is an admirable piece of legislation, but because Tasmania had to depend solely for its trade upon the sea carriage of goods the heavy burden that I have mentioned fell upon the State. The Sugar Agreement, which so vitally and beneficially affects Queensland, and is of great advantage to the whole Commonwealth for defence purposes, was costing Tasmania about £1,000 a day in 1932. That position has been remedied to some degree since then, by reason of concessions made to the jam-making industry, but, according to the State Treasurer, it is still a serious financial handicap to the State. Por a population not greater than that of some of the larger suburbs of Sydney and Melbourne -the population of Tasmania is, in round figures, about 250,000-the figures that I have given are colossal. The payments made to the State by the Commonwealth, therefore, should not be regarded as charity but as what they actually are, an attempt to correct inequalities from which the State is sufferto normal standard. Briefly, this means ing through the effects of federal legislathat the budgets' of all States were cortion. Prior to 1933 it had been the custom funds and the like. The budgetary for certain States to make application to the Commonwealth Treasurer for grants that were paid by the Commonwealth were more or less arbitrarily determined by the Parliament. In 1933 the Comappointed to attempt to put on a more permanent and satisfactory basis the States. In his second-reading speech in introducing the bill for the appointment of the commission the then Prime Minister saidUnfortunately it has not been found possible hitherto to formulate any definite principle or basis upon which the Commonwealth Parliament and Government could be guided in the making of such grants. He indicated that it was to be the commission's function to determine 3uch 3 principle if possible, and to make recommendations upon it, having regard always to any special circumstances arising in the various States from year to year. The principle subsequently adopted was-and here I quotethat the special grant should be equal to tbiamount of help found necessary to make ii possible for the State by a reasonable effort to function at a standard not appreciably below that of other States. The method of calculation was that what was called a ""normal budgetary standard "" was determined by methods which ] shall presently describe, and the amount necessary to bring the deficit of the claimant States up to that level was th* amount of the special grants recommended, subject to minor adjustments. The commission-and I hope that I shall not hurt the feelings of the Treasurer ( Mr Chifley) in saying this-ex amined the budgetary results of t-h*> various States, as published, corrected them to actuality according to its opinion, and then the result was brought to a per head of population figure in pounds, shillings^ and pence. That figure was then multiplied by the claimant State's population, and the resultant total became the amount considered necessary to adjust the deficit rected for special grants, windfalls of revenue, differences in accounting practice, emergency expenditure, reserve results were then brought to a figure per head of population which represented the normal budgetary standard per head. This was then applied to the population figures of the various claimant States to decide roughly the amount of grant to be recommended. Let us suppose the normal budgetary standard should be a surplus of £2 per head. Tasmania, with a population of roughly 250,000, would be entitled to a grant of £500,000. This method was a practical measurement of the relative financial position as disclosed by budgetary results, and was, at least as far as Tasmania was concerned, entirely satisfactory, although naturally criticism was sometimes advanced of certain corrections and adjustments. .In the year 1942-48, however, this measure was departed from, for a reason which is obvious and which I hope the House will note very carefully. Prior to the war, the normal budgetary position of tbe standard States had been one of deficits. By 1942-43, the results of the war expenditure of the Commonwealth Government were beginning to be felt, and tbe standard States were then showing surpluses. of course, that the State grants had also to become very much larger than they had been previously. At this point a Commonwealth Treasury submission was made which caused an alteration of the whole basis of allocation of the grants. It is interesting to note that, on the 18th September, 1940, when the war had been raging for a year, the Commonwealth Grants Commission, having some idea as to what effects Commonwealth expenditure and policy were likely to have on the budgets of the different States, reportedThe war obligations of tlie Commonwealth to £1,179,304; but their actual surpluses, arc, of coirrse, of. paramount importance, on the commission's ownfigures,allowingsince they affect the whole federation and for reserves, replacements, deferred mainits financial and economic policy. The claimant States are concerned about the tenance, &c.. amounted to £14,110,000! unequal distribution among the States of war expculiturc. 1 interpolate that, for the three years this surplus of £14,110,000 was taken as ended tlie 31st August, 1942, the total being no pounds, no shillings, and noamount expended by the Commonwealth pence! Since 1942-43 is taken as the Government on defence works in the year of comparison for the assessment various States was £59,290,707, the exof this year's grant, the loss to Tasmania penditure in the three standard States in this'year amounts to £700,000. Thathaving been £41,622,727, and in Tasis an enormous amount for a small State mania £1S4,220. Dame Enid Lyons. I have stated the position as it existed in 1940. I have no reason to believe that, relatively, it is different now. Thereport of the commission continuedI t is appropriate, therefore, that we should examine some of the possible effects of thisexpenditure on the special grants we recommend. Insofar as there is an uneven distribution of war expenditure among the States, the finances of the States will beunequally affected. It should be realized, however, that if war expenditure is largely concentrated in the smaller States the budgetary position of these States should benefit, and on our method of assessing grants the claimant States would also share iu such benefits, since we bring the budget position of those States up to the standard of the non-claimant States. Here is the kernel, of tbe whole affair, or, if you like, the milk in the coco-nut, for it is the reason for the making of the Treasury submission. The statement continued-On the other hand, ic is possible that adverse factors may affect the finances of the non-claimant States as well as those of. the claimant States, but these too would automatically be taken into account under our method of assessment. After careful consideration we believe that the correct course That meant, of action for tlie Commonwealth is to rely largely on methods that have proved effective in the past and to assess the grants on the actual budgetary results of the States, at the same time exercising a broad judgment on changing conditions. That, was the considered opinion of the commission prior to the Commonwealth Treasury submission in 1942-43. The effect of compliance with that submission was that, when the standard Stateswere in surplus, for purposes of thecalculation of States grants, actually they were deemed merely to have balanced budgets. Take 1942-43, for example. In that year the published budget surpluses of the three standard States amounted Under the new method of calculation resulting from the Treasury submission, to lose. According to calculations that: have been made by the Treasurer of Tasmania, the total loss to that 'State during the last three years has been £812,000. It may well be argued that the States have no right to exploit for their own -nnancial benefit the pressure of war .necessity upon the Commonwealth Government. With that, I agree. I have not, at any time, believed or suggested that any amount of war expenditure should be diverted to Tasmania merely for the purpose of benefiting that State. It has been and continues to be the -duty of the Commonwealth Government to use the whole of its resources for the. prosecution of the war, in the best possible place and manner. But this is different. To change the method of assessment that has been used in determining grants to the States, which are the only means of recompensing the .smaller States for inequality due to war expenditure and the like, .at a time of unprecedented Commonwealth expenditure which is permitting the larger States to budget for big surpluses, is to commit .an act of the grossest injustice, and it is that procedure to which Tasmania is now protesting. [Extension of time granted.] The general effect is that, while some other State should be arbitrarily assigned to a States arc able to set aside large reserves position in which its expenditure on social for purposes of reconstruction after the war. Tasmania has no opportunity what-ever to do so, and will therefore be left behind when the work of reconstruction begins. Surely it is not the wish of the Commonwealth Government -or Parliament that, in the difficult days that will follow the war, any State shall be left without financial reserves to develop its resources and to rehabilitate its industries and its peoples, while other legislation of the Commonwealth, is, we States have ample funds with which to carry on in those directions! It mu3t bu apparent that the States that have reserves which enable them to expand will attract population from all the smaller States.' Thus, inequalities existpresent time, that State is in the enviable ing at that time will become permanent, -and for ever must be a source of dissatisfaction and at times almost a dislocation 'in the Commonwealth structure. I remind the House, also, that while the standard States were in deficit Tasmania shared their adversity. Now that they are in surplus, I consider that Tasmania should participate equally in their prosperity, especially as that prosperity is the direct result of Commonwealth expenditure on the war, to whicli Tasmania has contributed its share. I have mentioned certain adjustments and corrections which from time to time have been challenged. I shall now mention briefly one that has caused a good deal of heart-burning, and I believe that it will administer a shock to some honourable members. One of the conditions imposed by the Commonwealth Grants Commission has been, that the standard of expenditure on social services in the three claimant States must be 8 per cent, below that of the three standard States. For the purposes of the commission, social services consist of three groups. In the first group is education. In Tasmania the standard of education is supposed to be S per cent, below that of other States. The second group embraces health, hospitals and charities. The people of Tasmania must be at least S per cent, less healthy than the people of other States. The third group covers law, order and public safety. It is intolerable that, in a federation, any services must be 8 per cent, less than that of other States. Indeed, it is open to question whether any such penalty should be imposed on expenditure of that nature, provided there is no evidence of undue extravagance. We do not ask for what is impossible or foolish. To try to impose that arbitrary difference, when already the larger States have been shown to be benefiting disproportionately from the believe, to inflict a very grave injustice indeed upon the smaller States. This matter of expenditure on social services, including education, is of particular importance to Tasmania, because, at the position of having earned the admiration of the whole of the educational world by reason of certain experiments in methods of education which it has adopted. The teachers of Tasmania are asking for an increase of salary, not on selfish grounds alone. Certainly, as a.n act of social justice, the claim should be granted. But they are asking for it also on the ground that the effect would be to raise the service to such a position that it would be able to attract men and women of the right type for the training and education of the rising generation. At the present time, many teachers in Tasmania who are 21 years of age and fully qualified, are receivStates and the Commonwealth should be ing less than the basic wage. If the State accedes to their request, not only will it have to meet the difference in the cost of salaries, but in addition it will be penalized by the adjustment of the grant which it receives from the Commonwealth. Eventually, the Commonwealth Government will have to provide subsidies for educational purposes in all the States. That, however, is another story. I plead the cause of the smaller States, but particularly that of Tasmania. Large and permanent differences in the financial status of the States should not be allowed to develop within the Commonwealth. Friday there was the announcement that a new lend-lease plan was being formulated to provide aid for Britain, to assist that country in the work of reconstruction. The statement was made that hard-headed American business men were anxious to help Great Britain, because they realized that it had been seriously weakened by its prodigious war effort. They argued that, in the long run, a quick recovery by Great Britain would be very much cheaper than a later attempt to rehabilitate the whole of the economic .structure of an impoverished British Empire. That is the realistic attitude which prevails in inter-allied relationships. It should prevail no less within our own boundaries. It is not a matter only of justice to the States; it is a matter also of sound, business that the smaller States should not be allowed to fall behind ;n the march of post-war reconstruction. In the field of international affairs it is regarded almost as an axiom that peace is indivisible. Surely, within the framework of a federation, it should be regarded as no less axiomatic that prosperity also is indivisible. honourable member for Darwin (Dame Enid Lyons) presented her case very well, and her speech indicated that she had made a careful analysis of the system by which the special grant had been made to Tasmania this year. With some of the arguments of the honourable member 1 agree, but with others I certainly do not agree. In the first place, the honourable member told us that she thought that the whole subject of the relationship of the examined by a Commonwealth convention. That might produce some result, but, on the other hand, it might be as abortive as was the Constitution Convention held in Canberra about two years ago. The purpose of that convention was defeated by the intrusion of party politics, and by the obstructionist tactics of certain members of the privileged chambers in State legislatures. I see no hope of success from the proposal put forward by the honourable member for Darwin. She had an opportunity to support the referendum proposals. DAM EENID LYONS I supported the In the press of last convention very strongly. porting the referendum proposals the honourable member, on the public platform and in other ways, set out to defeat them. achieved by the expenditure of large sums of money paid into the campaign by big business interests. Riordan) -The honourable member must confine his remarks to the motion. opposed to the proposal of the honourable member for Darwin. She was in error in her statement regarding the salaries of education officers under 2] years of age. It is true that they were in receipt of less than the basic wage, but that matter has now been adjusted. I agree with her, however, that officers of the Education Department are, on the whole, underpaid. For instance, I know of one married man with two children who, after five years' service, receives only slightly more than f 5 a week. That is a crying shame, yet if the Government of Tasmania were to raise the salary of that officer, and of others like him, the Commonwealth Grants Commission would, under the present method of assessment, penalize the State by reducing the Commonwealth grant.",15,Grants To States

98,Mr Barnard,"I am stronglyThe relationship between States and the federal authority represents a problem in all countries where there is a federal system of government. This was pointed out to me when I was in the United States of America recently, and there, as here, the larger and more prosperous States, because of the inducements which they hold out, are able to rob tbe smaller States. I have always objected to the flippant approach of many honourable members to the subject of Commonwealth grants to State governments. This Parliament frequently votes grants to in terests of various kinds, generally on the mainland, and there is no flippancy, but every year, when the report of the Commonwealth Grants Commission is under consideration, we are treated to allegedly humorous remarks about the poorer States living on the bounty of the Commonwealth. The honourable member for Darwin (.Dame Enid Lyons) referred to the history of the Commonwealth Grants Commission. That authority was established some years ago to attemipt to place upon a proper footing the making of Commonwealth grants to the States. Every year since then the commission has reported to the Government, and the Government, no matter of what political complexion, has always accepted its recommendation, and Parliament has duly adopted it . On this occasion, the commission has varied its method of assessing the amount of the grant, and this lays it open to criticism. Some time ago, I discussed w i th the Treasurer of Tasmania this year's grant, and his views on the matter, to which 1 subscribe, are embodied in the following statement:Tlie most curious, fateful and significant sentence in this remarkable compilation was this: "" It seems unnecessary to attempt to correct the budgets of the standard States"". The Treasury surpluses of New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland, which were "" the standard States"", totalled £1,971,304 ""as published"" in the year 1942-43, the year of comparison, but, as adjusted, they totalled £11,930,000. Queensland alone had reduced a huge real surplus to the relatively diminutive amount of £102.022 by the simple process of transferring £4,000.000 of its revenue of that before the war. This, too, though the total' year to the credit of its Post-war and Beconexpenditure of Tasmania from revenue per struction Fund, and a further £1.250.000 to other useful reserves for the future. The amount necessary to adjust the Tasmanian budget for that year to the average factual budgetary position of the three"" standardStates, in accordance with the principle long. sanctioned by the commission, was £1,220,000. But, according to the commission's present recommendation, the amount necessary to bring the Tasmanian deficit to what it now chose to call "" the normal budget standard"" was only £640,000, making a difference of £580.000 in the special grant for 1944-45. The commission had not corrected the budgets of the standard States, but had deemed fit to "" correct"" that of Tasmania, by disallowing £34,301 to liquidate losses in connection with soldieT settlement revaluation, and £10,917 charged to revenue in excess of tbe minimum requirements of the sinking fund provisions of the Financial Agreement. The"" sound finance"", not to say virtuous aspect of these two common-sense appropriations, had not apparently made any appeal to the com-, mission and had consequently involved the State in the indirect penalty indicated. Similar methods, involving a departure from the factual measurement of the relative financial position, had caused a loss of approximately £90.000 in last year's grant and of about £13,000 in the special grant for 1942-43. This all arose from a lamentable "" Federal Treaaury submission "" placed before the commission' in April, 1942, which resulted in a special meeting of the commission in Melbourne at the instance of the Tasmanian. Gray had very expressly declared that if the new"" principle set out in that Federal Treasury submission were accepted, ""this would removethe very basis of the methods of the commission which have so highly commended themselves to the Government of Tasmania"". What other claimant States said or did-, through their Premiers or Treasurers, wastlieir affair. The Commonwealth's differential war expenditure, however unavoidable, was having its inevitable treasury effects. Thus, for instance, during the three years ending"" 31st August, 1042, the Commonwealth had sipent £59,290,707 on defence work? alone, of whicli only £184,222 represented the Tasnianian allocatipn, while the three standard States received all the benefits of a vast fedferal expenditure ol £41.1122,727 on defence works in their areas. During the five-year pro-war period 1934-39. inclusive, the three standard States of New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland had accumulated net treasury deficits totalling£9,828.000 and Tasmania' had had to sharein their treasury adversity through diminished grants. But as a net result of ihe five-year war period ending on 30th June, 1944, their treasury position had improved by £12,527,000. even on the figures ""as published"", whilethe Tasmanian aggregate deficit for the war period was £257,000, or £34,000 iu excess oi its aggregate net deficit for the five years head of the population was, and long had' been, easily the lowest in Australia with, occasionally., the single exception of Victoria, which notoriously starved its social services. Thus, adding railway expenditure in Tasmania in that year, for the purjiose of making the-",19,Grants To States
99,Government. At That Meeting Mr Dwyer,".figures correctly comparable, the Tasmanian expenditure from revenue in 1943-44 was only £18 9s. per head of its population, against £28 12s. in Western Australia (highest), £27 19s. in Queensland, £25 9s. in New South Wales, £25 5s. in South Australia and £17 1.2s. in always penurious Victoria (lowest). There was only one way to compensate Tasmania for the grave incidental wrong inflicted upon it by tbe Commonwealth's unavoidably differential war expenditure, and that was through the special grant system. But this the Grants Commission had refused to do up to date, and its abandonment of tlie factual measurement of the relative financial position in budgetary results was the particular means of depriving Tasmania nf its just recompense in these respects. Vet, assuredly, since Tasmania had been compelled to share in the pre-war budgetary adversity of the standard States, it was morally entitled t> share in their Commonwealth-created war prosperity, and should not be denied an opportunity of building up at least some small reserves for post-war use during a period when the treasuries of the standard States were -piliri.tr up huge reserves, in millions, for post-war use. as a direct result of federal policy. [Extension of time granted.'] There we have the cause of Tasmania's complaint, made, T think, with some justification, against the altered method of determining the grant. It is natural that the State is concerned that it not only has not shared with, the mainland States the buoyant revenues brought about by Commonwealth war expenditure, but also has been penalized because of its increased activity in some forms of social service. I shall not support the motion. ciently urgent public importance. My concern for the StateI assist to represent is as great as that of the honourable member for Darwin, and that I have satisfied my constituents is proved iby the fact that at every election I have been returned with an increased majority. Until we have a system under which all States are treated more or less equally and none is penalized by being compelled to lteep its social services below a certain level there will always be complaint. Having said what I wanted to say, I rest content. Sitting suspended from £.53 to 8.0 p.m. support the motion moved by the honourable member for Darwin (Dame Enid Lyons), and I cSngratulate her upon the clear and able case she has placed before honourable members. I am somewhat amazed at the statement of the honourable member for Bass( Mr Barnard) that he will not support the motion, even as a protest against the present inequitable method of assessing State grants. The Commonwealth Grants Commission was established by the Lyons Government in 1933. At a very early stage in its history it evolved a just and equitable formula for assessing the disabilities of the claimant States, and the compensation payable in respect of those disabilities: and that formula gave general satisfaction. Indeed, the commission itself was universally approved, as a means of dispensing a measure of justice to claimant States. It evolved a formula which enabled it to measure factually the relative financial positions of the .States under federation, and to give to the claimant States equitable financial compensation for disabilities inflicted upon them by federation. The Treasurer of Tasmania, when delivering his budget in the Tasmanian Parliament a few days ago, saidFor the first eight years of the Commission's working, Tasmania was placed in a position in which it could achieve at least something like a relative approximation to the same financial results as the largest States, provided it made the same effort in revenue and maintained a comparable level of expenditure. The normal standard was a deficit, and thus the special grant payable was limited to the amount sufficient to enoible Tasmania to achieve a comparable position. But since 1940-41 (as the year of comparison), when the three largest States all had surpluses, the Commission has adopted a balanced budget as the normal standard instead of the average of the per bead surpluses in the standard States. This alteration affected the amounts of the Special Grants for 1942-43. Thus, whilst Tasmania has shared in the adversity of the standard States when they were in deficit, Tasmania has not been allowed to share in their prosperity when they have enjoyed large surpluses. As the result of departing from the long-established principle on which the commission originally assessed these grants, Tasmania in 1942-43 suffered a loss of £13,000, which rose to £99,000 in 1943-44, whilst this year it has risen to £700,000. Thus, within the last three years, because of thealteration of the . method of assessing grants, Tasmania has suffered a total loss of £812,000. The",20,Grants To States

102,Mr Gut (Wilmot) [8.0],"I heartilyprevious method of assessing grants gave general satisfaction. Why has that method been altered? The change was made as the result of a submission by -Commonweal th Treasury officials to the commission in April, 1942. The responsibility for this unjust alteration, which, within the last three years, has robbed Tasmania of £812,000, rests upon this Government, because the Treasurer ( Mr Chifley) suggested the alteration, and ho has stated that lip approves of the new method. It is his duty to reconsider this matter, and to take steps to remedy the grave injustice done to Tasmania as the result of savours of altering the terms of a contract after the document has been -signed, scaled and delivered. Tasmania is the only State which showed a deficit for the year 1942-43. In that year the other States.showed surpluses as follows. :XIMV South Wales. £1,115,000; Victoria, 1:754,000; Queensland, £102,000; South Australia, £223,000, and Western Australia, £24,000, whilst Tasmania had a deficit of £.109,000, and its (istimatcd deficit for the present financial year is £21S,000. It cannot be claimed that Tasmania's expenditure i= extravagant, because it amounts to only £1.4 per capita, compared with the p.vjpenditure per capita of the Commonwealth and the other States, as follows: Commonwealth, £40; New South Wales, £25; Victoria, £18; Queensland, £28; South Australia, £24; Western Australia, £27. Thus, Tasmania's rate of expenditurewas approximately one-half of the average of the Commonwealth and the other five States. Tasmania has suffered considerably in the allocation of Commonwealth expenditure during the war. The island State does not derive anything like the same benefit from the Commonwealth's war expenditure as do the other States; and this discrimination in war expenditure has caused not only a serious loss of population by migration to the mainland, but also a serious loss of revenue. The people of Tasmania are just as heavily taxed as are the people services. It is wrong for this, or any of the other States, and the State cannot stand the drain upon its population resulting from the greater opportunities offering on the mainland. Only the Commonwealth could have checked that drift by giving to Tasmania its duo proportion of the work associated with the nation's war effort,. Unfortunately, that was not done. Whilst the other States enjoy much prosperity as the result of war work, Tasmania is forced to observe the most rigid economy. The honorahle member for Darwin has pointed out that of an amount of £59.000,000 expended by the Commonwealth during a period of three years, only £184,000 was allocated for work performed in Tasmania, whilst £41,500,000 was expended in 'lie three standard States, which, of that submission. His action course, enjoyed all the benefits arising from that expenditure. Is it any wonder that Tasmania had a deficit of £109,000 in the financial year 1942-43? Buoyant revenues have enabled the three standard States to set aside substantial special reserves for deferred maintenance and general post-war expenditure, as follows: Now South Wales, £4,000,000; Victoria, £2,200,000, and Queensland, £5,250,000. Those reserves are in addition to the large surpluses shown in the budgets of those States. Under the present method of assessing State grants, the three standard States have been enabled to accumulate £12,000,000 out of their revenues for reserves and post-war work, whilst, Tasmania has been denied all opportunity to establish I'ven the most modest reserves. [Extension of time granted.] I cannot understand why this supposedly Labour Government, whicli always claims that it looks after the interests of those on the lower rung of the economic ladder, a claim which, of course, it cannot substantiate, can penalize any State in respect of its expenditure on social services. In effect, Tasmania has been fined by the Commonwealth Grants Commission, roughly S per cent., or £50,000 of its grant, and that treatment of Tasmania by the commission is approved by this Government; and of that sum £20,000 is expenditure directly incurred by Tasmania in improving social other government, to'penalize a State to that degree because of the latter's effort to improve its social services. I repeat what I said on the second reading of the States Grants Bill, namely, that Australians should enjoy the same amenities of life irrespective of the part of the Commonwealth in which they live. An Australian citizen should not be at a disadvantage simply because he or jhe lives in a small State. The nnancial relationship between the Commonwealth and the .States 'cannot be satisfactory unless the Commonwealth frankly takes into consideration the economic position of the respective States and provides for a periodical systematic review of the functions performed by the respective State governments. I heartily support the motion moved by the honourable member for Darwin. and Minister for Post-war Reconstruction) [8.12] I am afraid that some of the newer members of this House may be convinced by what has been said by the honourable member for Darwin (Dame Enid Lyons) and the honourable member for Wilmot( Mr Guy), and may conclude that some grave injustice has been done to Tasmania by the Commonwealth. For the benefit of those honourable members who have not studied this matter closely, I shall traverse what has happended in respect of State grants. Prior to 1933 various bodies attempted to -assess the disabilities of the less populous determining the grants which would be States, until the Commonwealth fixed tbe grants at an arbitrary figure. In 1933 tbe Government in office in this Parliament, which was politically akin to honourable members opposite, set up the -Commonwealth Grants Commission, and it appointed to that body a very experienced ex-Minister holding the same political philosophy as that held by honourable members opposite, although at various times he belonged to different political parties. brought a great deal of knowledge to his task as a member of the commission. I do not reflect upon his ability in any way whatever, because I have had opportunities in respect of other matters to appreciate his ability. -Originally, the commission took the view, which it has since strictly adhered to, that it should meet only the absolute needs -of tbe claimant States. Certain changes which have occurred during the last three years have resulted in an alteration of the method of examining the requests of the claimant States. All of the reports of the commission have been adopted by this Parliament-in almost every instance without dissent. The Premiers of Western Australia and South Australia have warmly praised the standard of its work, and its impartiality. Two of the members of the commission were originally appointed by a previous government, and were re-appointed by this Government. In other words, the majority of the commission were appointed by the parties now in Opposition. alter the method of assessing grants? that matter. Since 1940-41 the three non-claimant States have had surpluses each year. Until three years ago, the commission's method of determining a reasonable budgetary standard for the claimant States was to take the average budgetary position of the non-claimsnt States, and the budgetary position of each of the claimant States; and in averaging the deficits and surpluses of the budget* of the non-claimant States, the commision worked out what might be termed a reasonable budget for the purpose of made to the claimant States. But some time ago, all the non-claimant States achieved a budgetary position in which they had surpluses, so the principle previously adopted of averaging the surpluses and deficits of the non-claimant States was changed. If the commission had continued to observe that principle, it would have been providing for the claimant States a grant on the basis of the surpluses which were being achieved by the non-claimant States. Who would have paid that grant if it had been computed in that way? The Commonwealth Government would have had to pay it. Now, the Commonwealth Government has always taken the view, quite properly, that payments made from Commonwealth funds ought not to be more than are necessary to meet absolute needs. Although the Commonwealth Treasury has exercised its undoubted right to appear before the commission and state its views, it exerts no influence on the",21,Grants To States

So do the States, and on those submissions, this semi-judicial body makes its decision. As I stated previously, the majority of the members of this commission were not originally appointed by this Government. Surely it cannot be said that this Government has acted unjustifiably! Is it suggested that any submissions by the claimant States should be accepted ex parte, and that the Commonwealth should not be entitled to say, "" ""We think that you should survey certain features of this position, because the situation has changed "" ? The position was that some of the non-claimant States had surpluses and some had deficits, and the commission generally was trying to strike an average for the claimant States. But the time came when the other States had surpluses, and the suggestion' was then made that the Commonwealth should make a grant, having regard to the budgetary position of the non-claimant States that provided surpluses. I desire to make it clear to honourable members that nothing which this Government has done in this matter is either unfair or unjustified, or has had anything to do with the mechanism governing the functioning of the commission. The Commonwealth Treasury is entitled to place its views before the commission. The States have a similar right, and the commission, as an impartial body, makes its report on those submissions. No one can say that members of the commission in the past had affiliations with the political party represented on this side of the chamber. Tasmanian, too. was a Western Australian and a former Minister of the Crown. The third [71] member, who is the chairman, could not The commission acts under be said by any stretch of the imagination to have any political affiliations. A good deal has been said in this debate about social services. The position is that at one time the commission decided that the effort required for claimancy should be assessed on the basis of 8 per cent, of the States' expenditure on social services. But that has since been varied. Dame EN ID LYONS -A t one stage, adjustable expenditure had to be reduced by 10 per cent. was a Labour government in office at that time? Dame ENID LYONS I did not accuse this Government at all. that the honourable member did so; I am merely stating the position. I do not know whether honourable members who have participated in this debate have read fully the last report of the Commonwealth Grants Commission. Until some one raised this hornets' nest, I had not read it very closely, but I direct attention to the following passage on page 93:We decided this year that the effort required for claimancy should be 1 per cent, of adjustable expenditure, and accordingly obtained the following figures. . . . Those are not my words; they appear in the report. The commission has adopted the figure of 1 per cent. It is perfectly true that if a claimant State was not prepared to apply the same severity of taxation as a non-claimant State which was providing social services by imposing heavier taxation it could not expect to get a special grant from the Commonwealth. Every one will admit that if such a grant were to be made, it would have to come from the Commonwealth, and the taxpayers in a non-claimant State with a severity of taxation greater than that of the claimant State would be obliged to pay this bonus to the claimant State. If the them is a claimant State had increased the severity of its taxation, it would have been able to get from that source an income per capita equivalent to that received by the non-claimant State.",23,Grants To States

A former Minister for Labour and National Service, Mr Holt, introduced child endowment, which was one of the finest social benefits given to the people of this country. I do not wish to deprive the honourable member of any credit for doing that. Other factors also entered into consideration, but the result was well justified. That social service applied to Tasmania as well as to other States. any more than it benefited other States. benefit which operated in that State. that. Widows' pensions, which were introduced by this Government, also had a general application. I have no hesitation in saying that the Tasmanian budget indirectly derived a great benefit, or considerable relief from the provision of those social services. By the provision of child endowment and widows' pensions, all the States whicli did not have them previously obtained some budgetary benefit, because prior to the introduction of those social benefits, they had various welfare services that they had to meet. Since 1940-41, all the States which had a surplus have been in a somewhat changed position. Let us examine the great ""hardship"" that has been done to Tasmania specifically. Examining the. history of grants made by Commonwealth governments, we find that in 1936-37 the payment to Tasmania was £600,000. Thereafter the grants declined; but in 1943-44 and in 1944-45. the payments to Tasmania have been the highest that have ever been made to that State. Tasmania might also have been higher. I said that the Commonwealth Grants Commission adhered to the principle of always making grants in relation to all the needs of a State. If the needs were greater, the grant was increased. Last £720,000. This year it will be £742,000. The previous biggest payment was £600,000, which was made in 1936-37. admit that a portion of the money paid this year had been held from last year. goes into the coffers of the State, and not an amount which some one promises to the State Treasurer. I am speaking of things that Tasmania will get. Admittedly, certain difiiculties are associated with assessing the needs of a State, having regard to the equal severity of taxation. Prior to the introduction of uniform income tax, the matter of the severity of taxation applied was taken into consideration in an examination of the budgetary position of the claimant States and the non-claimant States. Since the introduction of uniform income tax, that investigation can apply only to taxes other than income tax, which form a very small proportion of total tax collections. Very great difiiculties confront the commission when it has to ascertain whether an equal severity of taxation is being applied in a claimant State and a non-claimant State. I now come to the matter of Commonwealth expenditure. What has the Commonwealth done? The position is that tbe Commonwealth on the advice of those most competent to know has expended the money for the defence of this country in places where it was wisest in the interests of the nation to expend itI t is true that, as the result of those selections, some States have built up very substantial surpluses. But no one will deny that Tasmania, disregarding for the moment its budgetary position, has not substantially improved its economic position. Undoubtedly the economic position of its residents has improved. I shall not weary the House with the figures, but if honourable members will turn to statistics prepared by the Commonwealth Grants Commission and to data obtained from other sources, they will find that all the economic aspects of Tasmanian life improved as the result of the war, though not to the same degree as those of the non-claimant States.",24,Grants To States

But Tasmania has shared in the general prosperity arising from war expenditurej though not to the same degree as have some of the other States. It is said that those States will have built up reserves, and that is not denied, but stirely it is not suggested that when the Commonwealth Grants Commission t-xamincs this subject after the war, taking into consideration the budgetary position of the non-claimant States and the fact that they have reserves to spend, it will not give consideration to the claimant States accordingly. That has always been done before, the needs of the States have been met, and on every occasion the Government has accepted, as previous governments did, the verdict of the commission. There may be some things requiring consideration in relation toseverity of taxation as between the States, which is a very difficult problem. The Leader of the Opposition paid in this House the highest possible tribute that could be paid to that very informative document, the Commonwealth Grants Commission's report. It would be an education to honourable members who have not done so to read that report from year to year, and note how thoroughly all these matters have been investigated and explained. Honourable members at least on this side of the House should not be misled into thinking that the Treasury has done something unfair in putting before the commission subjects which it ought to examine, and aspects which it ought to regard, but let me tell them that that has always been the practice of the Treasury no matter what government has been in office. It is entitled to do so under the act, and it has done in that regard no more than it had a right to do. Finally, Tasmania received more last year by way of grant than in any previous year, although the economic position of its residents was belter than it ever was previously. honourable member for Darwin (Dame Enid Lyons) has initiated a useful disfrom it, but most of the contributors get cussionon the war-time financial experiences of the Australian States. The first three speakers to the motion dealt with the special problems of Tasmaniait is true that they all represented Tasmanian electorates-and the Treasurer not unnaturally has devoted most of his time in reply to the position of that State,although he also mentioned some"" of the general principles of the Commonwealth grants system. It would be unfortunate if the consideration of the motion by the House were to be confined to any one State. The honourable member for Darwin made the valuable suggestion that as soon as practicable after the war a suitable bodyI think she suggested an elective -convention-shoul d review the war-time experiences of the States in order to ascertain to what extent, some redress might be desirable in particular directions. We should, I think, all agree that during the war the States have had rather different experiences, some more fortunate than others, as to the degree of government expenditure for war purposes in their territories, and the extent to which their civilians have been called upon to bear the discomforts and hardships of the war itself. Tasmania through the first three speakers in this debate has made out a case to-night, and has indicated something of its own special problems, but those of us who do not perhaps see the problems of Tasmania as painfully as the Tasmanians themselves do,, see something of our own States' contributions to the Tasmanian scene, and are influenced by considerations which do not normally enter into the calculations of investigators such as we have known in recent times. For example, Tasmania -benefits from two well-established institutions to which contributions are made in rather large measure by the mainland States. It benefits from an extensive tourist trade, which no doubt is reduced to a very considerable degree in War-time, but is highly developed in times of peace. The Tattersall's lottery isanother well-known Australian institution through which the people on the mainlandcontribute extensively to Tasmania's finances. return.",25,Grants To States

It is true to say that during the war years the people of Tasmania have experienced less of the war-time deprivations in terms of consumer goods than have the people of most of the other States, and that a (better standard of living can be maintained in Tasmania and at a lower cost than in most of the other States of the Commonwealth. I merely mention those factors without enlarging upon them, in order to show that these other considerations exist. experiences which will also need to be reviewed at the conclusion of the war. Queensland has felt the war-time restrictions more severely than have any of the other States, but it has had a much greater proportion of expenditure on government works, such as defence projects, than they have. In fact, the Allied alone I am told has spent £38,000,000 in Queensland, and many of the projects carried out by it will have a permanent peace-time value. Port and harbour facilities, strategic roads, aerodromes, hospitals and the like are all assets which represent some war-time advantage to Queensland. South Australia has had the benefit of the development of the vast munitions industry. Australia on the other hand may not have had its proportionate share of war-time industrial development or expenditure upon defence projects, but by contrast its citizens have suffered less deprivation of ordinary consumer goods than have some of the other States. So one could go on enumerating advantages and disadvantages, but I wish to lay special emphasis upon a point raised by the Treasurer ( Mr Chifley) as to the effect of uniform taxation. Sere again obviously there is a call for a post-war review of the wartime experiences of the States. The present income taxation operates is limited to the period of the war, but I suppose most of us now anticipate as inevitable the continuation after the war of a permanent form of Commonwealth income taxation on a uniform basis. If that is to he brought about, there must clearly be a review of what has happened during the war years, because some of the States have had unfortunate and Mr Bolt. indeed inequitable experiences in this regard. On a per capita basis, according to the figures which were made available when the scheme came into operationand I should imagine that, broadly, the same ratios apply to-day-Queenslan d was to contribute to the Commonwealth revenue, after the apportionment of revenue to the States had been made, £10 6s. 8d. a head, and was to receive £5 14s. a head in return; in the case of New South Wales the figures were Other States have had £14 7s. 3d. and £5 15s. respectively, and Victoria £16 5s. 3d. and £3 10s. Id. respectively. In other words, Queensland was to receive a little more than half of what it contributed, New South Wales a little more than one-third, and Victoria only a little more than one-fifth. That has been going on through the war years, and quite clearly at an opportune time a Works Council organization review of the experiences of the States in that regard should be made. It is difficult in the time available to us in this discussion to carry these illustrations beyond the point of stating them and letting honourable members form their own conclusions from them, but I think it should be clear to us all that there has been during the war years a variety of experiences in the case of the different States, whether Western they be claimant or contributory. Some have benefited to a large degree. For example-I concede that Victoria, whilst it made a perhaps unduly large contribution to the Commonwealth revenue by comparison with the revenue returned to the States, has undoubtedly benefited by the great industrial expansion that has taken place within its borders as the result of the development of war-time industries. Some properly constituted body can make a fair and impartial review, uninfluenced by State or political considerations, of what the war-time experience of that and other States has been, and to that extent I act under which uniform entirely endorse the proposals made by the honourable member for Darwin. motion is a futile beating of'the air. I believe that it is merely an attempt to gain political prestige for the movement that has been growing in Tasmania to regard that State as having suffered as the result of federation. If any disinterested person cared to look at the figures contained in",26,Grants To States
127,Mr Burke (Perth) [8.43],"Thisthe report issued this year by tbe Commonwealth Grants Commission, he would find it clearly demonstrated that Tasmania has not suffered by becoming a memher of the federation. This debate could easily degenerate into a vulgar scramble for State rights, or an attempt by various States to secure a bigger expenditure from Commonwealth revenue. The speech of the honourable member for Darwin (Dame Enid Lyons) was most illogical and inconsistent. She claimed in effect that Tasmania should have had greater consideration in the grant made by the Commonwealth, but at the same time she definitely asserted that we shall not diminish by a single penny the amount which Australia must spend in prosecuting the war relentlessly until the enemy was defeated and peace once again restored. Her approach to the problem was therefore completely inconsistent, and demonstrated a mere desire to make political capital out of the movement to which I have referred as now developing in Tasmania. It has been said that Tasmania is a rich .State, made poor, as the Treasurer of Tasmania remarked, by federation. It has also been stated that Tasmania has made by far the greater contribution I presume that means per capita-to education and social services. I do not desire to go at length into the question of what social services have been established, or education facilities provided in Tasmania, or what the financial needs of the various States are, but I think that it is necessary, following on the three speeches that have been made about Tasmania, to give some comparative facts regarding the relative positions of the claimant States. Western Australia is a large State from the point of view of size, but a tiny one from the population point of view. Tasmania certainly has a small population, and also a very limited area, so that it is rather difficult to say which should be called small States and which should be called large ones. If any State had suffered from federation to a greater degree than any other, it has been Western Australia. It is far from my intention on this occasion to suggest that Western Australia should receive greater consideration than the Commonwealth Grants Commission has extended to it, but I shall at the appropriate time demand that Western Australian development be pushed on, and that its economic possibilities be taken full advantage of. Developmental work in Western Australia must be undertaken in the interests of the safety of this nation, and the welfare of its people. To secure the defence of this land, the vast coastline and uninhabited areas of Western Australia must be given the fullest consideration when huge post-war expenditure is being contemplated. Let us examine the amounts which the various States claimed, compared with the actual grants recommended by the commission. According to the commission's tenth report Tasmania claimed £1,000,000, and the final figure decided: upon by the commission was £720,000, or a reduction of £280,000. Basing its estimates on the very real disabilities which it suffers Western Australia claimed £1,500,000, but the commission recommended only £680,000, or a reduction of £820,000. Western Australia has not set up a hue and cry claiming that it has been badly done by, yet clearly it has been more heavilypenalized than Tasmania or any other State. claim may have been more justified than that of Western Australia. facts will prove that that is not so. Compare, for instance, Western Australia's financial commitments with those of. Tasmania, in regard to social services generally, or educational facilities in country areas. Also Western Australia has a vast agricultural production, the machinery for which has to be imported from the eastern States, and has to bear the impact of the high tariff imposed to assist secondary industries in those States. The unequal incidences of the tariff was one of the strongest reasons for Western Australia's claim for a grant of £1,500,000. It has been admitted throughout the years that the development of Western Australia has been greatly impeded, because that State came late into the field, and because a high tariff has been imposed to protect Australian secondary industries, established mainly in the more populous States. Western Australia based its claim secondly upon the disabilities caused by the impact of federal policy generally",27,Grants To States

Some honourable members opposite have spoken of Tasmania's educational standards and of the large sums of money expended in that State on this work. Actually Western Australia has spent more per head of the population than has Tasmania, but because of the vast areas and many remote communities which must be provided for in Western Australia, the cost of education in that State is far higher than it is in a small State like Tasmania. The report of the Commonwealth Grants Commission shows that expenditure on education in Western Australia amounted to 38s. lOd. per head of the population, and in Tasmania, 35s. l i d . These figures demonstrate, if any further proof be needed, that in this respect at least Western Australia, because of its vast area, its limited monwealth, no longer could have evaded «esources, and its scattered population, has to carry a more onerous burden than does Tasmania. The same is true of expenditure on health, hospitals, and charities. Under that heading Western Australia expended 26s. 7d. per head of the population, whereas Tasmania expended 25s. 4d. My object in speaking in this debate is to emphasize that despite the arguments that have been advanced by Tasmanian members for increased financial assistance to that State, it is vitally necessary that at a time such as this we should avoid making further huge demands upon the Treasury to meet purely State needs. able member will not say that when a request is made for £30,000,000 for social services. than that with social services, the results of; which cannot be measured by the amount of money expended, but by the benefits conferred upon the people of Australia. I emphasize that although Tasmania may have suffered serious disabilities under federation, a heavier burden still has been borne by Western Australia. To move a motion of this kind is futile. The honourable member for Darwin suggested that a convention should be held to discuss this matter, but I point out that such a convention was held not so very long ago to deal with proposals to confer additional powers upon the Commonwealth, and to charge the Commonwealth Parliament with the full responsibility for dealing with major national matters. That convention, although not an elective body in the true sense of the word, was attended by the elected political leaders in the various State Parliaments, and the Commonwealth Parliament. A decision, was reached in regard to the handing over by the .States of the powers required, but honourable members opposite ranged up and down the country during the ensuing referendum campaign, urging the people to vote against the proposals. The Commonwealth Parliament was willing and anxious to assume the additional responsibilities, and the carrying of the referendum would, have meant that governments, State and Comtheir obligations by claiming either that they did not have the power, or that they did not have the resources to deal with vital matters. able member's time has expired. [8.52} -It is time that we got away from the flavour of red herring party politics, and returned to the motion now under discussion. The mover of the motion suggests that a convention be held. The motion is not concerned with arguments for or against increased grants to Tasmania or any other State. When the motion was moved, the case of Tasmania was cited only by way of illustration, for the simple reason that the mover knew the conditions that prevailed in that State better than those obtaining in any other State.. The main thing is to get down to a method formula by which r the States should be compensated for disabilitiessuffered under the federal system. So long as we have a federal system, we shall have States which will be unable to balance their budgets because of federal policy, and other States which will gain from federal policy, and consequently will have substantial financial surpluses.

That is a state of affairs which may require a little explanation to the less fortunate States. If federal policy on the one hand is penalizing certain States, and that penalty is to be compensated by grants, it is equally logical that cognizance should be taken of a state of affairs which enables certain States to build up large surpluses. Take, for instance, one matter which has been referred to by the honourable member for Fawkner( Mr this: Western Australia has some Holt), namely, the Commonwealth uniform income tax law. Under that legislation New South Wales is in a position to receive from the Commonwealth large sums of money to which it has a legal right, but not a moral right. I am sure that honourable members opposite will find their party loyalty and allegiance severely strained if they be called upon to support the retention of that legislation in the future. This is a matter which must be attended to in the interests of more than one State. Queensland is in an exceedingly fortunate position under federation. No doubt some honourable members will point out that much Commonwealth money has been expended in Queensland for war purposes; but it does not follow that because a lot of money has been expended in a particular State for war purposes prosperity will continue in that State after the war is over. say that particularly in regard to South territory of the Commonwealth and New Australia, where a considerable amount South Wales has 40 per cent, of the popuof war money has been expended. The lation, 45 per cent, of the wealth, and South Australian Government will have should be one of the greatest coal-producan acre of headaches when it attempts ing States, but is not.

Perhaps the Minister, fortunately for himself, may have gone to a quieter and calmer life before this state of affairs arises, hut the problem is one that will have to be faced by his unfortunate successors. The time has come for a better method of assessing the disabilities of the less fortunate States to be devised. It must be a fair and just method, and one which will be adaptable, and to a certain degree, elastic. Any attempt to form a cast-iron mould will not assist the development of the smaller States. To the honourable member for Perth( Mr Burke) I say advantages which none of the other States enjoy. For instance, it has the great gold-mining industry. Also, in regard to cold storage it is better off than the other States, for the time being at least. The greatest disadvantage suffered by Western Australia is the fact that it is impossible to administer 1,000,000 square miles of territory from one centre in the south-west corner of the State.

The first is that, for the first time for many years, we are actually confronted by a possible shortage of, for example, wheat in Australia for domestic consumption. that statement is true. the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture agrees with me that it is quite possible that at some stage before the next harvest comes in we shall be in some stress in regard to that matter. receive that assurance, but the two Minismanner. The effect of that is that the ters must settle their difference of opinion between them. difficulty. in mind, and I still think that I am right in what I said. For the first time in many years, we may find ourselves confronted with actual difficulties with regard to our domestic wheat supply in the various parts of Australia before the next crop is harvested. If th.it be so, that is a very good reason for the Minister doing what he has done, and saying, "" This assistance is being given as part of an endeavour to keep this industry in production. It is to be given to those who continue farming."" There is a second reason for my statement, and that is that the maintenance of wheat production in Australia is now seen very clearly to have a direct association with the world food position. ""We have had an excellent illustration of that in the last week or two by the discussions in this House regarding the Unrra and food and agriculture agreements. Australia finds itself, in connection with wheat propropose to move an amendment to subduction, dealing, not only with its own domestic problem, in the light of a drought, but also with wheat in the light of the world demand for it for a few singularly blind to the food demands of the world, after the war finishes, and indeed before it concludes, who did not realize that the wheat industry in Australia has a first-class international task to perform. I do not say that by way of criticism of the bill. On the contrary, I say it in order to emphasize what .1 find in tlie Minister's speech, and that is, first, that here is a case that warrants Commonwealth intervention, and, secondly, that the assistance to be given ought to be in the direction of maintaining wheat production for the future. I notice, in clause 5 of the bill, that any sum granted and paid to a State under this measure is to be paid to it on condition that it is to be applied by that State in a manner approved by the Minister for the purpose of alleviation of hardship and so on, and that the equal amount which is to be made available by the State is also to be applied in the same £1,500,000 provided by the Commonwealth is to be expended undeT the control of the Commonwealth Minister, and that the £1,500,000 to be privided by a State is also to be expended under the control of that Minister. I am quite sure that this has only to be pointed out to the Minister for him to realize that it is asking a little too much of the States. If they are to provide one-half of the money, it is clear that the State governments ought to have a voice as to the manner in which the money is to be distributed, and that they should have an important voice, because they live very close to the industries with which we are now dealing. opportunity. There will be distinct cooperation between the States and the Commonwealth. anything to the contrary, but, as the bill stands, the whole matter is under the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth Minister.

That would ensure that the control of this money would be a matter of agreement-as I am sure it w ill be in the practical result-betwee n the Commonwealth and the States, and not a matter for single direction on the part of the Commonwealth Minister. That is all I desire to say upon the actual contents of the bill, but before resuming my seat I shall refer to the broader problem with which this bill is associated. Every honourable member will sympathize, and sympathize profoundly, with those who have suffered from the disaster of drought this year. Fortunately, we have not witnessed anything comparable with it for many years, and I trust that we shall not again see anything comparable with it for many years; but it has hit with exceptional severity the growers of cereal crops, and, in particular, it has h it with devastating severity the growers of wheat. No honourable member w ill quarrel with what is proposed in the bill, but at least \v(must recognize that a measure of this kind is in. its nature a palliative. This bill does not solve problems. It , in effect, says that, for one year there is a problem that cannot be solved except by a grant. Why is it that the wheat industry is unable, without special assistance, to sustain the shock of drought? The answer, unfortunately, is all too clear. The industry has lived precariously for many years, and has not been able to build up reserves in that time. I am not discussing this matter in terms of criticism. I am not criticizing this or any other government. I dare .say that all of us who have had some association with policies for years past are wide open to criticism on this matter. I do not believe that we shall ever have the wheat industry in a position to withstand the damaging effect of a similar disaster unti l we have tackled the problem of giving real stability to the grower. the wheat-grower w ill involve, not only and most desirably, in my opinion, to some stabilization of prices, but also plan their development over a period of the giving of some reserves to the in years. I do not say that the position of dustry upon which it may call in a time the manufacturing industries and the of stress. able gentleman refer to financial reserves ? system, of stabilization for a great primary industry must be one that enables appropriate financial reserves to be brought into use by that industry at times when bud seasons have involved it in losses. nature of drought insurance? tion, but not the suggestion that I had in mind. I was thinking rather in terms of price stabilization, and of a plan under which, with an adequate measure of assistance by the people who consume the wheat at home, some attempt would be made to equalize prices over periods of high and low prices. I know that that matter has been in the mind of the honourable member for Wimmera( Mr. Wilson). Until we have some long-term system of stabilization for wheat, I believe that the industry will continue to live precariously, and be the subject of political action every now and then. It will continue to be forced into the position, at times of droughts, low yields or abnormally low prices, of appealing to the Government for help. The perfect way is to pool all our intellects, so that the industry may be put in a position to help itself. In the manufacturing industries in Australia we have long since adopted what I may describe as long-term policies. We considered the manufacturing industries in terms of tariffs. We established the Tariff Board, which, over a period of years, established a very high position of authority in Australia. It was i m partial and skilful , and when it made a report it was almost unanimously thought in Australia that the matter had been carefully considered, and that the recommendation of the board was right. The people trusted that body, and the result has been that the manufacturing R e a l stability for industries have been able very properly, position of the primary industries are",33,Scully

He may produce 80,000,000 bushels for export or he may have to try to find a market for 140,000,000 bushels. But the positions of the manufacturer and the primary producer are analogous to this degree, that, if these matters are to be freed from constant chopping and changing by political action, we must strive to produce continuity and a long range policy in relation to the rural industries. I have a strong feeling that, if wheat is to be stabilized, the right time to set about it is not during a time of depressed prices, but when the demand, so far as it can be anticipated, is likely to be good, without the practical knowledge of the and prices are likely to be remunerative. For exactly the same kind of reason that I have always thought that the right time to introduce unemployment insurance is when employment is high; no great scheme of stabilization ought to begin in the Bankruptcy Court. It ought to begin at a time, if possible, when there are all the possibilities of establishing reserves. Therefore, I believe that the right time for us to tackle wheat stabilization is upon us. We should not merely say to ourselves on this occasion, ""We have provided this money. will grant drought relief, and that is that"", and, so to speak, wash our hands of it for another season. We should say to ourselves, in view of the whole of the international and production prospects, "" This is the time to see whether this Parliament cannot develop a stabilization scheme which will straighten the sharp curves in the wheat industry, and enable this matter to pass to a substantial degree out of current political hands"". It is right that I should offer a word of comment on what is called the "" Scully plan"", although I have heard it asserted that it was actually somebody else's; but whether it was the Scully plan or the Roberton plan, I feel that I must express some criticism of it. I give credit to the Minister for Commerce, and Agriculture for having made an earnest attempt to solve the problem of the wheat industry, but I cannot see in the plan any prospect of achieving a peritr. Menzies. manent stabilization of the industry. At .present, the growers who produce more than 3,000 bushels a year constitute only 30 per cent, of the total number of growers, but they produce 70 per cent, of the total quantity of wheat. Thus, the industry has been stabilized on the basis of 4s. a bushel for the benefit of 70 per cent, of the growers, who, however, produce only 30 per cent, of the wheat; while the remaining 30 per cent, of the growers, who produce 70 per cent, of the wheat, must accept an average price, not of 4s. a bushel but of 3s. 6d. or 3s., or even 2s. 6d., according to world's parity price, for what they produce in excess of 3,000 bushels. ber's figures are incorrect. honourable member, but I know that when the world parity price is well below 4s. the man who produces 6,000 bushels receives a lower average price than 4s., while the man who produces 3,000 bushels or less will receive 4s. for every bushel. Thus, the bulk of the wheat, even though it be produced by a comparatively small percentage of growers, has to be sold at world parity prices. Of course, there is no trouble when the price goes up to 5s. or 6s. a bushel. No stabilization plan is looked for then. The matter becomes imThis portant only when the price is low. If we imagine that we are stabilizing the industry by exposing the bulk of its production to the world parity price when that price is low then, to borrow an expression from our allies, we have another guess coming. 80 per cent, of the wheat produced in the last two seasons has been quota wheat. Minister to say that even the 30 per cent, of the growers who produce 70 per cent, of the wheat have a proportion of their crop taken as quota wheat, and paid for as such. I point out, however, that the man who produces 8,000 or 10,000 bushels does not assess his results by saying that he gets 4s. for 3,000 bushels, and something less for the rest. He works out the average return for the whole crop, and this average may work out at 3s. 3d. He may then find that 3s. 3d. a bushel is an unpayable price, whereas 4s. would be a payable price.

From time to time, Australia has suffered from droughts, but, unfortunately, when good seasons have returned the lessons of the drought have been forgotten. 1 agree with the Leader of the Opposition that a stabilization policy is necessary, because the things that I have ment-cned are fundamental to the success of prirhary industries in this country. Millions of tons of valuable water run into the sea every year. That water should be conserved. I shall not be satisfied until something practical is done to conserve water and topreserve our forests. The primary producers will not be fully compensated for their losses even if they be handed a cheque for £20,000,000. Commonwealth and State Governments -should take steps to deal with the causes of such losses. The alleviation of distress caused by droughts and erosion is only tinkering with these problems. At a more appropriate time. I shall deal more fully with -the 'subject of soil erosion. I hope that the lessons of recent weeks will Mr Smith. not pass unheeded, and that Australia During recent months, will not continue to convert good farming land into dust bowls. I am entirely in accord with the object of this bill which seeks to provide grantsto producers who have lost their year's income. Where soils are suitable, primary producers would be well advised to grow other crops besides wheat, so that in the event of a failure of the wheat harvest they will not be without some income. The primary producers of Australia have been urged to grow more wheat in the interests not only of this country but also of other nations whom we desire to help in their time of need, but, unfortunately, the drought has so denuded of valuable timber; affected the harvest that help in the measure that was expected will not be possible. It would be a calamity indeed if we were to experience another drought Recently, Ausfralian next year. In order to encourage greater production, stabilization of the wheat industry is essential. The farmer should not have to carry the whole financial burden associated with surplus production; that burden should fall on the nation. As I understand that there is to be a conference next month on problems affecting the wheat industry, I suggest that no State should be subject to restrictions in regard to the production of any .primary product required by its own people. A policy of. restriction now applies to Queensland. The nation is losing money by paying to Queensland wheat-growers the guaranteed price for only the first 3,000 bushels of wheat from each farm, because every bushel of wheat that is imported into Queensland costs about is. 6d. in addition to the guaranteed price. It must not be forgotten that the granting of a licence will not of itself produce wheat. The Minister for Commerce and Agriculture ( Mr Scully) may authorize growers in Queensland to sow up to 20,000 acres with wheat, but if the price be not satisfactory the wheat will not be sown. The Premier of Queensland disagrees with the policy of the Commonwealth Government in regard to Wheat. He urges, as I have repeatedly urged> that there should be no restriction in regard to either production or price of Wheat in",36,Scully

179,Mr Fuller (Hilrne) [10.4],"In supregarded as the best of the safe country of Australia have been devastated. Nothing remains of some crops ibut a few withering leaves, and farmers are battling against conditions almost, unprecedented in our history. Ereguent though drought is in Australia, the uncertainty of its incidence is frightening to men who have been through bad seasons. But with backbone and a belief in the country they are farming, these men carry on. The people of Australia do not know what the farmer has to endure. They know little or nothing of. the trials and bitter disappointments of the man on the land. And yet, our whole country carries on its day to day activities against a background of rural endeavour, with men sweating in the dust and heat, and sometimes cursing the country they love so much. But there comes a time when the fear that a drought instils in the farmer is reflected among the city people. They visualize some of the hideous things that drought brings in its wake. They see the swirling red dust clouds over their cities, they glimpse the copper disc of the setting sun and for a a few minutes perhaps think of the ravages that the drought is causing out west. The Minister, in an excellent speech, presented a living picture of the drought and the conditions of the farmers suffering under it. He spoke with sober sincerity, neither over-stating nor. understating the position. He, as a former wheat-farmer, realizes the way the farmers look at this terror, their philosophy in the face of bad seasons, and their willingness to produce all they can from the soil. But breaks men and ruins properties. Men producing in a small way have in the past, left the land they had loved and tilled for a score of years because they could not face another year of crushing burdens. Drought and the finance companies had won. But this Government's attitude towards the wheat industry differs from that of most of its predecessors. It believes that the men must be assisted, in good years and bad. It has introduced a stabilized pooling scheme and provided good prices. It has given wheat-growers economic security which they have not had for many years. Now it is seeing them through the drought. This Government will not let the farmers down. It intends to keep them on the land, secure in the knowledge that they will salvage something from the wreck. It will help them to continue with the hope, a hope we all share, that the land will once more yield fields of golden grain. The failure of wheat, oats and barley crops affects every section of the community. Food is viral in both war and peace. Already, the drought has threatened our export wheat trade, and every Australian breakfast table, and, incidently, our beer production. Those are the immediate results; but many more complications arise as a result of the importance of our agriculture generally. But even the immediate results provide a lesson for all Australians. This year, the Commonwealth set out to increase our grain production. It made representations to Great Britain and the United States of America for increased allocations of superphosphate. The Japanese, by occupying Nauru and Ocean Islands, struck a blow at the heart of Australian agriculture. Japan, apparently, planned to rob the Allies of vital raw materials. It captured 90 per cent, of the world's sources of rubber and a large proportion of the oil, tin, and quinine production centres, as well as the world's richest deposits of superphosphate. Before the war we used more than 1,000,000 tons of superphosphate a year. Last year, because of the loss of these equatorial deposits, our imports decreased to 475,000 tons. At the same time, we were establishing new industries which required superphosphate. We expanded our vegetable drought production; and our increased production of food generally, in order to meet our commitments to the allied nations, increased our requirements of superphosphate. Thus, these representations to the British Government were vital to the wheat industry; and the assurance that 800,000 tons would be made available put new heart into the farmers. There is no doubt that the shortage of superphosphate has been the main, if not the only valid, explanation for the reduced area sown, with wheat. However, despite the prospect of increased supplies of superphosphate, the plantings of wheat were disappointing. Whereas the area sown in 1943-44 was 8,603,000 acres,",38,Scully
180,Mr Fuller,"official returns show that farmers intended to plant 9,153,000 for the 1944-45 harvest. However, the land could not be prepared in many districts. Elsewhere, it was tilled and dressed with fertilizer, but not planted whilst in other areas, the grain was planted, but failed to germinate. Therefore, the Government's plans for increased wheat sowings for the 1944-45 harvest came to nought. The Commonwealth, after consultation with the States through the Australian Agricultural Council, decided to guarantee the producers a good price for oats and barley as part of a general plan to stimulate the growing of coarse grains for feeding stock. These grains were to be sold as stock feed at a price subsidized by the Government so that cheap feed would be available to the dairying, pig and poultry industries. Drought has destroyed the crops. It has wrecked what would have proved a wonderful scheme for the farmers. Let us hope that that scheme will meet with success next year. Let me now examine the effect of this disaster to the wheat industry. It is estipriority industries, the inter-dependence mated that the next wheat crop will be between 50,000,000 and 55,000,000 bushels of which about 40,000,000 bushels will be delivered to the No. 8 pool. carry-over from the cereal year ending on the 30th of this month will be approximately 75,000,000 bushels. In all, therefore, total stocks, including the new harvest, should be about 115,000,000 bushels. Fortunately, our carry-over is many times greater than our usual peacetime carry-over, and our available supplies will thus be greater than last year's harvest of 109,559,000 bushels. Our wheat commitments in 1944-45 appear to be: local flour 35,000,000 bushels, services and directed to issue licences for areas in exports 15,000,000 bushels, and stock feed 40,000,000 bushels; or a total of 90,000,000 bushels, leaving a margin of 25,000,000 bushels. As the Minister has so aptly said, a drought like the present comes once in a generation. We can look forward to a better season next year, not with certainty, but with the optimism and experience that agriculture has ingrained in our producers. Thus, we can hope that our exports of wheat may be 25,000,000 bushels. The Minister, in a recent statement, contemplated that, despite the drought, we might be able to maintain our exports to Great Britain, although we would not be able to export wheat to other countries. That is a bright spot in an otherwise depressing picture I realize, of course, that we shall not be able to grist for large overseas orders for flour. In 1943-44 we exported 3^,658,000 -bushels of wheat and 590,544 tons of flour. The Commonwealth sought a British contract for flour, knowing that the bran and pollard produced by the mills on a threeshift basis, would provide large supplies of fodder for the pig, dairying and poultry industries. As a result of the drought, production of those valuable supplementary commodities will be reduced. Therefore, we must look to the farmers whose crops have failed this year to supply sufficient wheat next year for the supply of offals and hay to those industries. Without sufficient stock feed the pig, poultry and dairying industries will have a hard time. Our food programme might be severely affected; but if 40,000,000 bushels of stock feed wheat can be made available to the of primary production will be preserved until the next crop is cut. Since we must look to the farmers whose crops have failed for our new supplies of wheat next It is expected that the year it is important that relief be given to them as soon as possible. I agree with the Minister, that if possible, this relief should be made available by January. The bill provides a valuable measure of relief financially; and the recent decision of the Minister with respect to wheat plantings next year constitutes another form of relief to growers. He has announced that growers whose crops have failed will be allowed to double up next year, and that the Wheat Stabilization Board is to be addition to those already licensed. This will constitute a great form of relief to fanners, since it will give to them a practical way in which, with the finance provided by this bill, to grow more wheat next year and to increase their returns <above what .they could expect from their normal areas. The Minister has also announced that temporary licences will be granted next season to any person who wishes to grow wheat next year. temporary measure as an expedient but it must be watched. Minister will do nothing that wall jeopardize the future of the 70,000 growers in the industry. I am glad to have the opportunity behalf electorate, measure. and relief must be given to assist the men and their families who have suffered from it. I hope that the day is not far distant when the Government able to tell honourable members about the land itself, about measures for water conservation on a huge scale, about national measures against soil erosion, and about plans to build large national fodder .reserves to cushion the industries against' another disaster like this. These are problems which become prominent only when a drought The wretched spectacle of hundreds of thousands of tons of our good earth being swept into the air and hlown across the Tasman sea to New Zealand should make us bestir ourselves. the land. We must not contemplate our top-soil until the country becomes a dust bowl. We must plan to protect the land, as the Government has planned by this measure to afford drought relief. My belief is that we should plan now, while drought threatens our war effort on the food front and the future farming of this country. opponents did nothing, although they are the people who now criticize the Labour party failed ments had carried out the works which should have been undertaken, have been devastated to the extent that it is to-day. with the job, and will continue to do so.
