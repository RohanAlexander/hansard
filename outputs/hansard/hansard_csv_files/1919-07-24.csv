What action does he propose to take to avoid a repetition of trouble of this kind? 1. The troopship Somali had .reported by wireless that there had been a succession of cases of mild influenza and allied disorders. It was, therefore, necessary, in accordance with commodation for sailor men, and that the forethc procedure at that time in force, that the vessel and all troops should be quarantined, and an announcement was accordingly properly made to that effect by the Chief Quarantine Officer. Negotiations' were, however, in progress with the State Government with the object of agreeing upon a mutually acceptable policy permitting of modifications in the quarantine restrictions. reached with the State Government subsequent to the announcement above referred to, it became possible to allow the Somali troops to land and proceed to their homes instead of spending seven days in quarantine. inconvenience caused by this change in arrangements was more than offset by the advantage to the troops and the economy to the Commonwealth. As the changes made apply to all subsequent troopships, no recurrence of the conditions is likely. 2 and 3. See answer to No. 1. for Trade and Customs, upon notice. 1.

I am now in a position to give the particulars. The first programme of ship construction in Australia consists of six vessels of the three island or well deck type. These; vessels are 331 feet by 48 feet by 26' feet and are being constructed at the following dockyards:Dromana' and Dumosa, Commonwealth Dockyard, Williamstown. Delungra, Dinoga, and Dilga,, Government Dockyard, Walsh Island, Newcastle. Dundula, Commonwealth Dockyard, Cockatoo Island, Sydney. These vessels are about 5,500 tons dead weight on 21-ft. 9^-in. draught, and are -fitted with single screw eugine and Babcock and Wilcox boilers-with an i.h.p.. of about 2,200. capable of driving a vessel at a .speed of 10$ knots at-sea. The cubic capacity of the vessels is about 282,000 feet The Delungra was launched on 25th March, 1919, and is now fitting out. The Dromana was launched from the W i lliamstown yard on 11th April. Engines and boilers and all auxiliary machinery have been installed, and :the vessel is practically complete, and will probably be proceeding on trial in the early part of next week. The Dundula, at the'Cockatoo Island yard, was successfully launched on. 9th July, and the work of fitting out is proceeding. No. 4 ship, the Dinoga, is practically ready for launching at Walsh Island, and No. 2 ship, Dumosa, at Williamstown, would have been launched at the .end of this month, had delay not .occurred owing to. the seamen's strike and. the coal and -power restrictions. No. '5 ship, 'the Dilga, at Walsh Island, is completely framed out. The plating of the hull bias be^n commenced, ) d the bujkai",28,Britainand Germany Resumption Op Trade

A. second programme, consisting of fourteen steel ships, has' been commenced. These will be built in the following 1 yards:2 at Oommonwealth Dockyard, Williamstown. 3 at Government Dockyard,. Walsh Island. 1 at' Cockatoo Island. 4at Walkers-Limited, Maryborough, Queensland. 4 at Poole' and Steel's, Adelaide, South Australia. These vessels'will be'of the'shelter-deck type, and will be 331 feet B.P., 48 feet' in breadth, by 31 f t . 7 in. depth moulded to shelter deck: They will carry about 6,000 1 tons dead-weight on 23' ft. 8$ in. draught. The to tall capacity will be about 338,000 : cubic feet. The machinery driving the 1 vessels will be the same as for the vessels building under the first programme. Arrangements will be made for the carriage of oil fuel, and the boilers will be suitable for burning either oil or coal, as may be considered desirable. Steel plate material for these latter ves7,300 horse-power, with, a speed of 15 sels building at Walsh Island, Cockatoo Island, and Williamstown has been ordered from England, and about 2,500 to 3,000 tons have already beeu delivered into theabove yards. A portion of steel sectional material has also beendelivered from the BrokenH ill Company. Work, has actually commenced on three of the last-mentioned ships. . These vessels will, cost, approximately, £155,000 each. This shows a considerable reduction per dead-weight ton, which is due to the fact that the steel plates and bars were purchased at a lower figure than for the first six ships It is anticipated that six of these vessels wilbbe completed ineighteen months, another six. in two vears, and. the balance in two and a half years. ""Two wooden fife-mastedauxiliary schooners are under' construction by Messrs. Kidman'and Mayoh. The dimensions'are 250 feet x 45' feet and. 24""ft. 5 in. The-dead-weight will be about 2,600 tons on a load draught of about 19 f t 10 in. One vessel is framed out and partly planked, and the second vessel is partly framed. The timbers used in the construction are Australian hardwoods. The propelling machinery consists of two sets of semi-Diesel Bolinder engines, developing about 240 BHP., at about 240 revolutions per minute, and it is estimated will drive the vessel at 7 knots. The contract' price for these vessels is £26 per Commonwealth Dockyard, dead-weight ton. Negotiations have been, completed for the construction of four larger vessels, with the option of two more;, the dimensions being-52 0 feet over-alllength; breadth, 62 f t . 3 in . ; depth, moulding, 45 feet. These vessels are of the shelter deck type; with a long bridge and fore^ castle above the shelter deck, and three complete decks laid. It is estimated that they will, carry about 12,800tons deadweight on a load draught of 30 feet. Twin-screw quadrupleengines, with cylinders 23$ inches,. 34 inches, 4S inches,, and . 73 inches, and ' stroke 51 inches, will be fitted, and steamwill be generated by an ample installation of water-tube or .Scotch boilers. The machinery will develop knots, under trial conditions, the. speed at sea over a long voyage being 13 knotsj fully loaded. About 250,000 cubic feet of insulated space for thecarriage of frozen meat or chilled produce will be provided."" The total cubic capacity of the vessels, including, insulated spaces, will be about 700,000 cubic feet. Liberal accommodation will be provided for officers and crew. The cargo arrangements will be of the most modern and up-to-date description, and will enable rapid handling of cargo. Arrangements will also be made in these' vessels for the carriage of oil fuel, and the boilers will be suitable for burning either oil or coal. The cost of these larger vessels will be £423,000 per vessel, or for the four £1,692*000.

The question of extending the W i l liamstown Dockyard, so that vessels of the larger size and type can be built there, is at present having consideration. In addition to the foregoing, a contract has been signed with Vickers, in Great Britain, for the building of three vessels of 12j000 tons dead-weight, 900,000 cubic feet, of which 370,000 is to be insulated. The length of these vessels w ill be 520 feet by 68 feet beam. The vessels are to be built to burn oil fuel or alternatively coal fuel as required. The speed is to be 15 knots. The vessels are due for delivery in January, June, and October, 1921, respectively. A similar contract has also been entered into with Beardmore's to build two steamers similar iu all respects to those being built by Vickers, referred to above.

It is impossible .to say with any degree of certainty that these expectations will be realized. I am sorry to say that the wooden boats built in America are not turning out satisfactory; but that is not the faul t of the Government. yards were taken over by the United States Government, which, apparently, could not supervise them. We have had the best legal opinion obtainable in regard to the orders. sentative over there to look after. the interests of the Commonwealth? What is he doing ? he is doing. He has been there for some time, and yet ships of which he was in charge were delivered months ago. It is all very well to be wise after the event. When this contract was made the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) was cheered for having the courage to do something to meet our great necessities at the time. As to the local ships under my control, I have cancelled their building as f a r as possible, with the exception of the two mentioned, and that exception was because a quantity of timber was l e f t over. Last week, in answer to a question, I showed that the cost of cancelling contracts for those ships was about £ 5 per ton, whereas in the case of 370-odd ships, the contracts for which were cancelled by the American Government, the cost was from £ 1 3 to £ 1 4 per ton, although the vessels were at similar stages of construction, and none of them completed within 50 per cent. Under the circumstances, I think we have to congratulate ourselves on being relieved from these contracts for wooden ships-although , as I say, there were cheers when I .announced that they had been made. carried out my promise to present a f u l l statement to the Housei n connection with the shipbuilding programme. statement just read there should be added the cost paid for the cancellation of the contracts for wooden ships in Australia, so that the statement may appear complete in Hansard. statement in regard to these wooden ships here; but, in any case, *the facts have already appeared in Hansard.

In their works many men were employed, and the wages earned by them were a valuable asset to the small towns close to which they were established. These industries, however, have all been stopped. In one case of which' I know, three generations of a family have carried on the onebusiness of skin buying and dealing. They have had their own stores, waggons, and agents, but for the last five years they have had practically to give up their business. In view of the fact that there is plenty of wool to enable the contract with the British Government to be carried out, and that great quantities of raw material are no longer required for the purposes of the war, I ask the Acting Attorney-General to make to the Central Wool Committee the most earnest representations possible as to the importance of giving the class of men to whom I have referred a chance to resume their business during the coming wool ""season. to support the plea advanced by the hongers). The position taken up by the Government is that this Bill can be applied only' to contracts that were entered into . during the war period, and that it cannot be extended, as many' of us would like it to be, so as to permit of a greater measure of governmental control in directions of much importance to tbe people, who are complaining of the high cost of living. the houorable member for Wannon has pointed out, to do something for those country business people who have w ill ingly given up their industry during the war. The Central Wool Committee have shown much capacity, and their operations have been of almost immeasurable worth to the community; but their disastrous policy of centralization has caused much suffering on the part of country wool, merchants and their agents. The sooner we get back to normal conditions in this regard the sooner we shall do a measure of justice to these people, and give our rural towns an opportunity to advance. Country representatives do not ask the Government to do anything calculated to endanger the validity of a B ill of this kind, but we certainly think that this measure of justice should be done to men, who, in consequence of the war, have lost their means of livelihood. If that cannot be done under existing arrangements, then the sooner we wind up the governmental activities covered by this B ill the better for all concerned. That is my view, notwithstanding that I am prepared to support a system of Government interference in connection with the marketing of our produce and the fixation of prices. We shall have to make a most emphatic protest against-any extension of the period to be covered by this B ill , unless we can secure for the country wool and skin merchants the measure of justice for which we ask. According to the legal authorities quoted by the Acting Attorney General( Mr Groom) in introducing this B ill , it is competent for this Parliament to pass a measure of this kind in relation to contracts made during the currency of the war provided it I rise be passed prior to the date of the exchange of ratifications. All thinking men iriust agree with the Prime Minister( Mr. Hughes) that the settlement of the difficulties to which the war has given rise will call for the exercise of more genius than even the successful prosecution""' of the war demanded. It seems to me that many years will elapse before we shall return to normal conditions, and that being eo, we should extend the operation of this B ill beyond It should be possible, however, as 30th June next unless in the meantime we can obtain an amendment of the Constitution vesting wider powers in this Parliament. As an illustration of the way in which legal opinions differ I would point to the case which the Premier of the Privy Council. In the first instance, Mr Justice Cooper, of the Queensland Supreme Court, gave a decision against the State Government in an action brought by local pastoralists in regard to the Government acquisition of cattle stations. The Government appealed to the StateF u l l Court, and obtained a judgment in its favour. The pastoralists then went to the High Court, which decided against the State, but the Privy Council, on appeal, reversed the decision. Four different tribunals gave alternative decisions on the same set of particulars.",34,Commerci Al Activitiesbill

In view of the possibility of the measure being challenged, and seeing that we may not, through apathy, seek from the people the powers the Commonwealth should possess to deal with these matters, it is as well for us to extend the operations .of protect the pockets of the people, that the measure for another ten years, so that we may make our position doubly secure. There may be a good deal in the claim that throughout the country districts the operations of the Wool Committee have deprived many agents of their means of livelihood; but I contend that, if the operations of that Committee are not continued by an extension of this Bill, the people of the Commonwealth may be mulct in very heavy charges for wool after the 30th June, 1920. The operations of the .Wool Committee have had some little restraint on those who sell wool. A t the recent wool sales in London wool has sold as high as lOOd. per lb. The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN ( Mr Atkinson) -Does the honourable member propose to connect his remarks with the amendment? extend the powers given by the Bill for another ten years, provided we have the constitutional authority to enact such a measure, which I doubt, a great injustice may be done to the people of the Commonwealth. sold at lOOd. per lb. in London, can be bought by Australian woollen manufacturers locally at something like 42d. per lb.; but if we abolish the restrictions at and it is to be hoped that now conditions present existing under the contract relating to wool and the operations of the Wool Committee, the local price of wool may rise to a considerable extent. Thus the woollen manufacturers may be called upon to pay double the present price, and those who desire to clothe themselves in woollen goods may be obliged to pay very heavy prices for them.

The honourable member, as a lawyer, knows that no such guarantee could be given. side. he expressed a sort of doubting opinion that the Bill is within the competence of this Parliament. He is inclined to agree with counsel on that point, although he disagrees with the judgment of the majority of the High Courti n the case of Burvett v. Farey. The honourable member asks me for an authority on this question. How could I cite to him the judgment of the High Court upon the interpretation of the Constitution regarding a question that"" has never arisen ? The honourable member knows that no such direct authority could be given. son that I say the certificate of compe-tence carries us nowhere. It is valueless, although it is not valueless as a declaration of law so f a r as it goes. knows that in 1903, when the H i g h Court was established, we had a written Constitution. It was known that that Constitution would have to become a living organism expressive of the life of the people, and that of necessity there would be conflicts between the Commonwealth and the State""!. High Court for the express purpose of deciding the issues that were likely to arise. No one at that time could give a guarantee as to how the Court would in terpret the Constitution, but students of constitutional law, who understood the principles upon which the Constitution was laid down, and who had studied the decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States,, were able to predict in certain cases, with a f a i r amount of accuracy, how the decision might go. so far as State rights are concerned. They did not expect that the States would be superior to the Commonwealth. opinions that were given. If the honourable member looked at the advice given by t h e ' Commonwealth law authorities during the early stages of the development of the Constitution, he would find that they were able to give very competent advice which proved correct on a great many of the leading problems affecting the Constitution. Opinions given by the Attorneys-General of the. United States of America have been published, giving their advice as to how they -believed the Constitution would be in terpreted. No one ever suggested that they could give a guarantee. But , in the light of the judicial interpretation of the Constitution, these couusel were competent to give to Parliament what was. their opinion as to what could have been secured. I take f u l l responsibility for the legislation which has been introduced, and I advised honourable members that I believe this inatter to be within It is just for that reathe competence of Parliament. Last night I briefly indicated some of the reasons which had led me to that conclusion. An honourable member, by in terjection, seemed to think that I had based my position on the fact that the Commonwealth had entered into contracts. That was not the only ground. Where the Commonwealth has entered into contracts which extended beyond the termination of the war, I hold that we are competent to deal with such matters. Suppose that we took the interpretation to be that the defence power was one We constituted the which could only be exercised during the period of war. What an extraordinarily limited power that would be. We, in Australia, are exercising, w it h in our jurisdiction, on behalf of the Empire, the complete power of defence, not only forourselves, but for the Empire. We have had relations with the different parts of the Empirei n the despatch of our troons from Australia, in handing over our Pleet to the Imperial authorities, in our financial undertakings and obligations, and in providing food and equipment necessary for the conduct .of the war. If we took the stand that defence is a power to be exercised only during the period of actual war, we would not be able even to get ready for warfare. .

It is obvious that it must' bee included: Constitutions' this would' be if we knew that there were large forces about to' attack us and that, because the Empire had not technically and legally declared war, wei were impotent to exercise a single power of defence, until the enemy had.landed.upon our shores,-and we were in. a: state of confusion. It is generally admitted that included ih the power of defence is the power to prepare in anticipation of attack.. Leti ua now consider, the: other side ofi the case'. Can we exercise preparatory/ powers: and full war-time powers;' amd; then,, immediately upon the'cessation of warfare, can we go no further ? That would lead to an absurd position. In regard, to all; our obligations we would be able to do nothing. With respect to OUT troops overseas we might have somelimited power; but, as for our administrative actions, immediately upon the cessation of war we would become powerless. with the clause under discussion? courteously, to answer a proposition, stated by an honourable member on the Opposition benches. upon the conclusion of the war, all the administrative activities which we had created and. organized in order to give effect to obligations entered into, and which were essential for the carrying on of the war, were to cease, then all Federal control would be absolutely ended. gested that. stances, obviously, the power of defence must continue.

What an extraordinary The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN ( Mr Atkinson) -Order! The Minister; is replying to a point raised by the honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan). 1 must' be implied in the Constitution a power of defence which, in certain circumstances, must last beyond' the actual declaration of Peace. I pointed out last night, in connection with the activities within' the' scope of the Bill, that there were circumstances which justified the making of contracts, and which contracts were essential in the interests of the Empire. It was urgently necessary that certain of our resources should be organized' and placed at the disposal of the Empire;, and, to do that effectively,, we had to take up a control which would extend over a certain prolonged and definite period. Por the security of the United Kingdom itself,' the Imperial Government desired these resources, in order that it might be able effectively and successfully to carry on the war. My opinion is that, as regards these particular activities, and in the circumstances which existed during the war, and still continue, the' ParliaI f , immediatelyment, is competent to pass this legislation in order to-.wind up these activities in. the manner set forth. There are also other circumstances, in connection with the moratorium whicli justify Parliament in legislating beyond the period actually concerned. But to contend, that if we have this power we therefore possess unlimited has sugpower to fix prices generally is not reasonable. When warfare ceases the ordinary working of our constitutional provisions will be reverted to; and then the power of price-fixing within a State will naturally devolve upon the State. ing made inquiries to-day, I was inand I record my regret that I have*",40,Commerci Al Activitiesbill

It was a statement due to this Committee, and was, I think, too long delayed. Owing to the unprecedented circumstances in which the Bill was introduced, it was incumbent upon the Minister to present his view of the constitutional position.' Something .more was due to honourable members than the words of a bare certificatea certificate provided, as I have more than once stated, iby an irresponsible body, however eminent those.gentlemen may be outside of Parliament. ' The Acting Attorney-General has logically pointed out, as members of the High Court Bench have 'also done, that since we have .a general power of defence .given under the Constitution, it , follows that that involves matters preparatory to defence. man argued from that that it must necessarily include power to continue even what might bo called remote defence operations after the war was over. suggest, however, that the real test appearing from the decided cases upon' this question is the extent of the nation's danger or embarrassment arising from the war itself, and that there is, therefore, a vast difference between operations preparatory to war and operations carried on after danger has passed. As these operations under tlie various contracts are clearly to be carried on in time of peace, when the international crisis has, in fact, passed away, I suggest that they will ..probducers the advantage of the world's marably be found, when tested, to be outside the competence of the Commonwealth Parliament.

But .any proposal that the Government should exercise, a regulating influence on prices of commodities, produced at a date subsequent to that period would not find acceptance with the producers. The interests concerned in this measure are too big and important to be trifled with. We regret that prices had tp be fixed at all. Buti t was necessary to establish 'these Pools and Committees, and to enter into these contracts, in order that we might qarry on in time of war. Such a condition of affairs was inevitable, and we are prepared to see the business through so far as those contracts are concerned.

It ,is a -monstrous proposition that .that condition of things should be prolonged for a. moment longer than is necessary. Honourable members opposite, always speaking from the point of view of the .consumer, ask for a lowering of prices, but I point out to them -that the only -way to reduce the cost of living is to encourage production, and the only way to encourage production is to give the prokets. The primary producers have droughts and other natural adverse conditions to contend against, and if we add to those natural difficulties the valuation of their products by the Government, the result must be fatal to the interests of the producer, and, consequently, to the interests of the consumer and of the Commonwealth as a whole. valuations are made by men whose only idea is to keep prices down.

In view of the mistake which he made on that occasion, he ought to restrain honourable members behind him from any line of aetion which would have similar evil effects upon Australian industries to-day. The honourable member for Batman( Mr he has been in this House. Brennan) has suggested that the operations dealt with under the Bill can be carried on for a considerable period after the present time. It is clear that for some time after the contracts are finished a considerable staff must be continued in employment to wind up the whole of the Pool business. In 'connection with wool, for instance, one of the conditions incidental to the contract is that the wool producers are to receive 50 per cent, of any profits made (by the British Government upon the re-sale of the wopl to manufacturers in England. matter which cannot be finally settled for a considerable time after the contracts are closed, and until it is settled there cannot be a winding up of the whole scheme.

I will have to complain later on, as I propose to do now, of the operations of the Pool regarding certain aspects of the wool industry. The big prices I have quoted as obtaining in Great' Britain are participated in by the Australian wool producers to the extent of 50 per cent, of the excess above the fixed Fool price, but there are certain sections controlled by the Wool Committee which do not participate in that enhanced price. Take the case of the fellmongers. Who gave the Wool Committee the autocratic power to determine that some sections of the wool trade shall participate in those enhanced values and that others, such as the fellmongers', shall not? That is what the Committee has done, and other complaints can be made against it. A t the same time, for the protection of the Australian users of Australian wool, it is advisable to extend the period of control for another ten years.

There is also the possibility indicated by the honourable member for Robertson ( Mr Fleming) and the honourable member for Echuca( Mr Palmer) that, if the amendment is carried and the operations of the Pool are extended for ten years, the Australian-wool producer will receive for his wool only the price that may be fixed by the Wool Committee for ten years. should say that would be fairly safe, iu view of the present composition of the Wool Committee, because the majority of its members are interested in wool production. That being so, the wool producer's interests are well catered for. If , however, we remove that restriction, and our wools are submitted to public competition, without any restraint by the Wool Pool or by Parliament, who is to say that the Australian manufacturers of woollens will not have to pay up to 5s. and 6s. a lb. for their wool, or even more, against the competition of eager buyers from other countries ?

We decided that the people should get their sugar for 3^d. per lb., plus the cost of delivery to the retailer. The sugar industry is one in which there must be some £12,000,000 invested to-day, and there are many thousands of people engaged. The efforts of the Commonwealth authorities to establish the sugar industry have been most successful. We have a Tariff which protects the Australian producer, and now we dpsire a Federal control which will protect the workers and at the same time allow the general public to secure sugar at a reasonable price. We have succeeded in that direction for a certain term ; and all that is now proposed is to extend the term to ten years. The sugar-growers of Queensland prefer Federal control to any other. They will not get it under this Bill. fer it. The Queensland Government have assisted the Federal Government; but some day, when another Commonwealth Government asks for ful l powers, we shall probably have complete Federal control of the industry. It is very diffihas stated that no one ever knows what cult to solve the problems which confront us to-day. There is much unrest, and all kinds of schemes have been proposed to deal with production and the distribution of wealth. The Colonial Sugar Refining Company has nearly the whole of the business in its hands to-day; its ramifications cover nearly all the continent; Prior to the war one or two men sitting in their offices decided what should be the price of sugar. the most perfectly organized industry in Australia from that view-point. [408]2 Mr Knox, who is, perhaps, the most experienced and capable man connected with the sugar industry in Australia, probably has most influence in fixing the price of sugar. For the reasons which I have stated the sugar industry ' is one which is most easily controlled by the Government. After the deliberate and wholesale abandonment of the individualistic principles which have been professed by honourable members opposite for so long, I should think there would be no objection on that side to permitting the Government to control this industry for the term I have mentioned. The Acting Minister for the Navy( Mr Poynton) told us this afternoon that the Government are going in for a wholesale programme of shipbuilding. I believe it was Sir William Harcourt who said, some time ago, speaking, of parties in Great Britain, "" We are all Socialists now,"" and doubtless the Melbourne Argus, in view of the statement of the Acting Minister for the Navy this afternoon, will to-morrow sing the same refrain in its leading columns, and "" Ithuriel"" will adopt it for his notes at the close of the week. My amendment should commend itself to the Tories on the other, side who are willing to support a wholesale programme of Government shipbuilding, and who, along with the Bolsheviks, are to bo fought by the Prime Minister( Mr got it.

He may yet see? a coalition of the two forces, and what would he say then ? The Prime Minister may happen in politics.

Subsequently, through the influence of the honourable member for Wide Bay( Mr Corser),' the Government were prevented from ' making a littl e profit out of the sugar industry, which I thought was justifiable, to enable us to carry on the war. The honourable member and the party opposite made up the money which I would have taken from that industry by taxing the little children on the 3d. tickets of admission to picture shows. I hope that honourable members opposite will continue on the narrow way t h a t leads to righteousness, and will adopt our proposal to federalize the sugar industry by extending the operation of this measure for another ten years. Sitting clause has afforded members of the Opposition an opportunity to propose, under various headings, the prolongation of a temporary organization that was improvized during .the war period as a sort of compromisebetween pre-war conditions and post-war conditions. Those producers whose commodities alone are being dealt with in this B ill , were quite willing, in view of the greater needs of the State, to .give up for the time their individual rights in order that the State, for its preservation, might set up a form, of control for the war period; which may be described as the pooling period. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Tudor), no doubt out of his oft-expressed anxiety for the dairy farmers, has shown a desire .that the pooling period shall be extended, but the dairy farmers throughout Australia know what his interest is in their great industry, and are not likely to be hoodI am reminded by the winked by his efforts. "" Then the honorton) desires that the control should be extended also in the case of wool, but all that that honourable member knows about wool, either in its raw or its manufactured state, as expressed by him in this chamber, could be writteni n a very short volume, and his solicitude for the producers may be easily passed over. The honourable member for Capricornia ( Mr. Higgs) is always worth listening to, bu t I do not think that he has ever been more interesting than he was this afternoon when he moved an amendment in connection with the sugar industry. Of course, hailing as he does from Queensland, he can be expected to have no other desire than the welfare of the sugar producers there. But what struck me as unique in the speech of an avowed apostle of the doctrine of Socialism was the great tribute he paid to the genius of 1 private enterprise in his State. In the whole of Australia he singled out Mr. Knox as the man who knows more about sugar than any other person in the country; as the man whose genius, the honourable member told us, is responsible for the organization of the industry on the most highly scientific basis. Mr. Knox, by his own will, and because suspended from 6.28 to 7.£5 p.m. of the desire of his company that all should be well with the sugar -industry of Queensland, was lent to the Commonwealth during this trying period -in order that the standard of excellence in the organization might be maintained. During the whole of his address, to which I was very careful to listen, the honourable member for Capricornia ( Mr Higgs) never dealt with the merits of the industry as an argument in favour of the prolongation of the pooling system, nor with the power of the State to cail for t h a high effort in the production of more cane or a more refined sugar. This is the only period I can .remember in the history of Australia when black and coloured, and piebald sugar has had to be' accepted for A l quality, and it is the most unfortunate period that' the honourable member could have selected for the purposes of his case, for it is the time when all our f r u it growers of Australia have been clamouring",54,Paibs

265,Able Member For Maribyrnong ( Mr Fen,"for sugar. The honourable member and his associates from Queensland were much concerned in holding up the industry until they got a special award laying down conditions unheard of in the country before; and to. that end, while Mr Knox and others should have been able to carry on without interruption, the honourable member's friends paralyzed the sugar industry. The honourable member for Capricornia has not advanced one argument to show that we should grant an extension of ten years to the pooling system, nor has the honourable member for Maribyrnong ( Mr Fenton), the honourable member for Yarra( Mr Tudor), or any other honourable member, attempted to show that the advance of the nation would be in any way furthered by the prolongation they propose. All they are concerned in showing is that, under the machinery of the B ill j there might be some kin d of hybrid price fixing. scanned it carefully w ill recognise that sugar is about the only commodity that the Government have had to hedge round with all kinds of conditions; and altogether it is the most unfortunate commodity that the honourable member for Capricornia could have selected for the purposes of his argument. sale price and the retail price are fixed, and importation and exportation-excep t by the Government-prohibited , and no margin is allowed as a reward for in creased production. ' Sugar is the only commodity in regard to which the community has been denied the right to call for what it wants, and has been obliged to take that which is offered. I must say that during this period of the temporary pooling of Australia's raw products the producers have never winced. The arguments from the. Opposition side to-day have shown such a lack of uniformity-hav e been so piebald and so mixed-that they cannot but prevent the party from exerting its f u l l weight in support of its proposals. The honourable member for Maribyrnong first attempted to show that the producers were not getting their all, and when we on this side expressed our satisfaction with the sentiment, he said the consumers were not getting that to which they were entitled. However, I shall not traverse those arguments further, but merely say that this ""has been a period during which collective bargaining in the primary products of Australia has taken the place of the right of individual contract on the part of the producers. As I said before', the producers have not winced, but have been prepared to deliver over to the State the whole of their products at a price to be fixed by the State. In spite of the fact that for wool, wheat, and dairy produce fabulous prices have been recorded on the other side of the world, they have never asked the Government to explain how the fixed prices were arrived at, but have been quite content to believe that the Government was acting, not only in their best interests, but in the interests of the country as a whole. WhatI am anxious to show-and this has not been recognised by the Opposition, Those who have though it has weighed with the primary producers-is that we could not in any spirit of fairness ask that our products might be treated as if they were the products of a neutral country. We in Australia were at war .as much as B rita in or the Empire was at war, and the primary producers, feeling that it would not be The wholein keeping with the spirit of the race, have never taken a "" stand-and-deliver"" attitude, or demanded that they should retain their produce and deal with it on a strictly commercial basis. They have never attempted to obtain those higher prices that a neutral country might have got; and, consequently, when the honourable member for Capricornia asks for a continuance of the Pool, it is not in the interests of the men who were content to 'accept the conditions of the war period in order that their less fortunate cousins in the Old Country-o n whose shoulders the burden of the war mainly rested-migh t get commodities at reasonable prices. I hope that the support to perpetuating the pooling system given by representatives of primary producers on the Government side will not be taken as an indication that the producers have suddenly embraced the Socialistic idea of collective bargaining. building ?'",55,Paibs

MrM c WILLIAMS said that the duty imposed upon preserves is of very little use. Thef r u it producers and jam manufacturers would gladly see that duty removed if they could have, free of duty, tlie sugar used in their industry. Why cannot, that be done? Nearly every year we have to import a large quantity of sugar, and a great lack of foresight was. shown in that regard during the present year. months ago, that we would have to i m port a considerable quantity of sugar. buy foreign sugar to-day ? MrM c WILLIAMS of last year, when I brought this matter under the notice of the Government, we could have bought sugar in Java at £ 7 10s. per ton. We have had to import about 100,000 tons of sugar this year, and it was not good business to defer the purchase until the price rose to £ 2 0 per to n . Having regard .to the fact that for every 1 lb. of f r u it used in preserves a similar weight of sugar is used, surely the Government can devise some scheme by which the jam manufacturer can get sugar free of duty. Several HONOBABLE is the price of jam ? MrM c WILLIAMS member who will make an offer for a considerable quantity of jam will be supplied very cheaply to-day, I am sorry to say. The Government at present allow a small rebate to the jam manufacturers, and they could, without prejudice to the sugar industry.,-make a further rebate. In New Zealand, where sugar is not grown, the price is £ 6 less than it is in Australia, where sugar is produced. must take into consideration the fact that New Zealand is becoming a big competitor with Victoria and Tasmania as a producer of small f r u it preserves. I assure those who are interested in the production of sugar that they cannot expect to continue for all time the present exceedingly heavy levy on the jam industry, which is just as important to some States as sugar production is to Queensland.

In these circumstances, what reason have the jam manufacturers of the Commonwealth to Domplain? The Government have also been attacked by the honourable member for their failure to provide a sufficient supply of sugar to meet all requirements up to the beginning of next season. I would remind the Committee that it is little more than twelve months since the Federal Grovernment were faced with an actual sugar surplus. When they entered into the last contract with the Queensland Government for the purchase of sugar for a period of two years, they had a six months' surplus in hand, and were doubtful as to whether or not they should enter into that further contract over so long a period without imposing stringent con' ditions. By reason, however, of severe frosts, followed by cyclones, and, later on, by drought, a great part of the crop that' should have been harvested and manufactured into sugar, was completely lost. Against such visitations no Government could have provided; and it is to those causes that the shortage, which has been ascertained only of recent date, may be attributed. not have taken action earlier than they have done to meet the situation, and the jam manufacturers are obtaining all the sugar they require at the present time at as low a price as they could expect to secure it. It is absolutely absurd for the honourable member to say that sugar could have been obtained from abroad at £7 10s. per ton during the last twelve months or two years. No one has been able during that period to land it here for £15 per ton duty paid When a deputation of jam manufacturers told the Minister for Trade and Customs some little time since that they could import sugar at something like that price, his answer was, "" I am prepared to take 50,000 tons, if you can supply it at anything less than £15 per ton."" I think that was the price named. true that these men could have landed it here for £7 10s. per ton, why did they not accept the Minister's Mr Corser. . offer ? These attempts to mislead the publio-and such statements are intended only to mislead-ar e quite beside the mark The facts can be easily ascertained. If any honourable member has a doubt on the subject, he has only to apply to the Minister for Trade and Customs for a statement in writing as to the actual position. Sugar from overseas cannot be landed here to-day. under £51 per ton. And at no time during the war have jam manufacturers in the United States of America or Great Britain been able to obtain sugar, except at double the price ruling here. in regard to Java sugar? sible to introduce Java sugar; but, e/en if it could be brought in now, the price would be double tliat which -the jam manufacturers of Australia have to pay the Federal Government. No industry in Australia is better protected than the fruit and jam industry. Although denies my statement that, prior to Federation, there was a duty ef something like £6 per ton on sugar entering Tasmania, the Hobart press did not deny it when, in the course of an interview, I The Government could made the statement, and gave my authority for it. I had large dealings with Tasmania before 'Federation, and I know that, under the Tasmanian Tariff, the duty .on sugar at that time was from £5 to £6 per ton. Another consideration which should not be overlooked is that, although there is a duty of £6 per ton on sugar,' jam manufacturers are receiving their sugar at about £3 7s. 6d. less than the retailer can obtain it. Their exports compete with jams the manufacturers of which pay twice as much for their sugar; so that, if there is any complaint to be made, it is that the local jam manufacturers have been treated too leniently by the present Commonwealth' Government. There is another misapprehension on the part of some honourable members that I should like removed, and that is as to the If it is treatment received by the Commonwealth Government in its dealings with the Colonial Sugar Refining Company.

In that capacity it receives £1 per ton on the sugar produced by it, and out of that amount has to provide for loss of interest, insurance, depreciation, and other charges. Some honourable members appear to think that a man who huys a ton of sugar, on, perhaps, three months'' terms, should be granted the same advantage that is extended to a firm which buys a large quantity involving an outlay of, say, £5,000. In the case of the larger transaction, prompt cash is paid, so that the Commonwealth avoids any loss of interest upon that amount, and a good deal of handling is also avoided by it. Those who take delivery of these large quantities are granted an allowance of 6 per cent, and of that they have to pass on to the retail purchaser from 2^ to 3 per cent. Thus they do not get a return of more than from 3 to 3 i per cent, for handling these larger quantities, paying cash, and providing for cartage and storage, insurance and interest, as well as incurring the risks involved. carry on a big business with the grocers of Australia without running the risk of loss, since small business men often get into financial difficulties through no fault of their own, and in such circumstances their creditors have to take less than 20s. in the £1. Under the system now in operation, the Federal Government take no risk. I thought it only right, since I knew all the circumstances, that I should make these facts clear to honourable members. reluctant to interpose in the debate between representatives of Tasmania and Queensland, but, as a representative of Yictoria, where we also have large jam manufactories, I should like to offer a few observations. The fruit-growing industry in Tasmania is undoubtedly an important one, but large quantities of frui t are also produced in this State, and we have a. number of extensive jam factories. Some very interesting information on this question appears in an article written by Mr affect the price. Pritchard, secretary of the Australian Sugar Producers Association,' and published recently in the Sugar Journal in reply to an article which' appeared in the Argus. A conference of various industries interested in the sugar question suggested that the duty should be removed. I am confident that the increase in the price of sugar, like that of many other commodities produced in Australia, is not' equal to the increase in the prices of imported articles. In support of that view, I would invite honourable members to read the reports of the Inter-State Commission, and particularly the report dealing with rents, in which it is shown that, although the prices of bricks, tiles, hardwood, and other locally-produced building commodities, have increased, the increase is nothing like as great as in the case of galvanized iron. The fruit-growers and jam-manufacturers of Australia have reason to be thankful to the sugar industry of the Commonwealth. If we had had to depend upon outside sources for our supplies, then householders, instead of having to pay 3s. 6d. per dozen pounds for sugar, as they do to-day, would probably have to No one is able to pay the prices that have been ruling in Great Britain and the United States of America during the war. of sugar in New Zealand? Zealandis practically taking the whole of the sugar output of F i j i . .labour, liament, in 1901, decided for the policy of a White Australia, and in order to secure it we have to pay a duty on sugar. Jam manufacturers here, however, have obtained their sugar cheaper than manufacturers in any other part of the world. war period. honourable member was right in saying that the duty of 2d. per lb. on jam is of uo value to the local manufacturer. I should be prepared to impose a duty of something like ls. per lb. I do not think it would jams to-day import nothing but high-class",59,Membebs Wha T Australian Manufacturer Will Not Be Able

In making that statement, I should have said it was rumoured at the time that that was the reason. repeat a rumour of that kind unless there were some reasonable ground upon which you believed it to be true is quite right; and I shall give the reason for my assumption. His homily affords me an opportunity of saying that I will support my impression by documentary evidence. The firm of F. W. Hughes Limited was originally a woolscouring fellmongering company. Then it occurred to Mr F. W. Hughes that it would be a good idea to manufacture wool tops. He' issued a. prospectus to -the.general public headed "" The development of industries in Australiaa bonus of £50,000."" That was the bounty which he had induced members of the Federal Parliament to grant his oompany by saying that he was going to' establish an industry which would give a great deal of employment to skilled labour. I or about 1908. Members of this Parliament, anxious to establish a local industry, granted him a bounty. He was not satisfied, however. After enjoying the bounty for some five years he approached the Inter-State Commission with a request that the Federal Parliament should renew the bounty for an unlimited number of years and make the amount £20,000 per annum. The Inter-State Commission decided that there was no reason for granting the bounty under the circumstances; that this gentleman had deceived the Commonwealth Parliament when he had said he was going to give employment to skilled labour; that the skilled labour employed, on account of the automatic machinery installed, was very limited; that 80 per cent, of the work was done by the woolscourers and the fellmongers. However, by the use of the prospectus, in which he said the profits would be £50,000 per anI have previously stated in num, hefloatedthe new company, F. W. Hughes Limited; and he was making wool tops, not for anybody in the British Empire, but for Japanese manufacturers, who were competing with the manufacturers of Bradford. That was one of the reasons why the. Inter-State Commission recommended to this Parliament that the bounty should no longer be paid. It was considered that the bounty enabled P. W. Hughes Limited to give an advantage to the manufacturers in Japan as against those in Britain. , The honourable member for Illawarra ( Mr Hector Lamond) has, by way of interjection, on several occasions endeavoured to show that I am not acting rightly in attacking this company.

It is evidently desirable that in any future similar agreements, or in any regulations governing the agreements under review, provision should be made for such cpntrol by the Auditor-General as would enable the Treasurer and the Auditor-General to obtain all the information that may be desired.

In his last report the Auditor General asked that his officers should have special powers to audit the transactions under this agreement.

I hope that the Government will insert a. clause to provide that the accounts of all the Pools shall he audited by the staff of the Auditor-General. -The Committee should act carefully in this matter. These various Committees were appointed during a time of war, following the precedent of the Old Country, where a patriotic appeal was made to the merchant princes to give their services for the benefit of the country. They did that; I do not say that they did not make money at the same time. The principle has always been recognised by this Parliament that we ought not to pass legislation of a Paul Pry character. We have no right to probe into the private business affairs of any person or company. The Auditor-General is appointed to supervise the expenditure of the various public Departments, because the money for them , to a guarantee that the votes are expended in a regular manner. If the amendment is agreed to, we shall give to somebody a right to pry into .people's private affairs. not probing into private affairs than I know the chief purpose of the amendment is to give power to inquire into the affairs of F. W. Hughes and Company. The operations in connection with the manufacture of wool tops are of so technical a character that fewv-persons are able to understand them, but there is a general impression abroad that however much the Government may have gained by that mixed-up transaction, Hughes and Company have certainly not lost. But assuming, for the sake of argument, that the Commonwealth has made a loss on that contract, it is better that we should bear that loss than that we should depart from the principle of not prying into people's private affairs. If there has been amy scandal in connection with this or any other transaction, Parliament can order a judicial inquiry by a properly constituted Commission. I shall support the Government in; resisting the amendment. We must be careful not to trench upon the principle of individual freedom unless we are confident that it is necessary to do so in the public interests. We have gone far enough im> that direction, and we should cry a halt. Under the pretence of doing something in the interests of the people we ought not to claim the right to poke our noses into the private affairs of any company or individual.. Certain powers of inquiry are given to the Grovernment in connection with the collection of revenue, but all such investigations are governed by a pledge of. secrecy. There is to be no secrecy about the inquiry proposed by the amendment; anything disclosed by the audit may be published throughout the country.

W. Hughes Limited, and I think that it is far better that we should adhere to the old principle of that we should sanction any inquisitorial departure such as the amendment proposes. I regret that this amendment has been framed to deal with one individual case, but I should certainly support it if it would bring the whole of the transactions of these Pools under the supervision of the Auditor-General. This is not a proposal to pry into the business of private individuals. Having regard to what is appearing in the daily press relative to the operations of the Wheat Pool in New South Wales, and to rumours on every hand as to the Metal Exchange, will any one say that it is unreasonable to urge that the accounts of .all these Pools should be subject to the scrutiny of the Auditor General?

Under war conditions much has been done, not only by Governments in Australia, but in Great Britain, the United States of America, and, on the Continent, which, in ordinary circumstances, would not have been sanctioned by any Parliament. For the successful prosecution of the war it was necessary that the Government should be given power under the War Precautions Act to engage in various operations, and members of Parliament on every hand jettisoned tlieir tenets of political economy to sanction much which they would not otherwise have permitted. Under this system there have grown up in Australia a number of Trusts, Pools, and Combines, with which this Parliament will have to deal in the near future. The whole of the transactions of the Pools which have been created by the Government should be subject to the scrutiny of the Auditor-General. In the Auditor General we have one of the most trustworthy public servants in the Commonwealth, and I do not know why these Pools should object to their accounts being scrutinized iby him. to a Commonwealth audit? that the Wool Pool objects. officers that the 'accounts of both the Central Wool Committee and the State Wool Committees are subject to a continuous audit by the Commonwealth Auditor General. tracts ? entered into by these people should also be open to examination by the Auditor General.

Can the Minister tell me now that the same provision applies to the Metal Exchange? ferent basis. some provision that the whole of the contracts and pools shall be subject to the examination of the Auditor-General, we shall wake up to find that abuses have crept in, and that great scandals have occurred. are indebted to the honourable member for Capricornia ( Mr Higgs) for putting forward this amendment. Asthe honourable member for Dampier( Mr Gregory) has pointed out, the Government are financially interested in these concerns. Seeing that the taxpayers' money is, involved, surely there can be no objection on the part of the Government to the amendment I heard the honourable member for Capricornia pointing out .that it was the desire of the Auditor-General to audit the accounts of the transactions in regard to wool tops, but honourable members did not seem to understand this clearly. Auditor-General, whose reports ought to be our guide in financial matters, has furnished a report 'upon this matter. If we are not to take notice of his reports, he might just as well be out of existence, and the cost of printing the reports avoided. On page 229 of the Treasurer's Statement of Receipts and Expenditure during the year ended 30th June, 1918, the Auditor-General says64. On the 1st-March, 1917, agreements were entered into between the Commonwealth Government and Whiddon Brothers Limited, Sydney, and the Colonial Combing, Spinning and Weaving Company Limited, of Sydney, respectively, under which these companies were authorized to purchase wool for the purpose of manufacturing wool tops. that all the books, vouchers, and documents in the possession or under the control of thc respective companies relating to the purchase, manufacture or sale of the -sheepskins, wool, and wool tops referred to in the agreements should be produced to an auditor nominated by the Commonwealth Government for that purpose; and . it was also provided that any nomination or other communication by the Commonwealth Government to the companies should be deemed to be duly given if signed on behalf of the Commonwealth Government by the chairman of the Central Wool Committee. In pursuance of this provision, the Central Wool Committee appointed a Fellow of the Australasian Corporation of Public Accountants to conduct the audits. Subsequently the Right Honourable the Treasurer submitted his opinion that these audits should be conducted under the control of the Auditor-General for the Commonwealth, and suggested that the auditor appointed by thc Central Wool Committee should act under an appointment made by the Auditor-General-unde r the provisions of section 11 of the Audit Act-shoul d the Auditor-General be willing to make such appointment. I was quite prepared to do this; but upon the matter coming under the notice of the chairman of the Committee, he declared that such an arrangement would not be as satisfactory as the then procedure. Upon receiving the balance-sheets of the auditor appointed, the Treasurer asked for further information w it h respect thereto, but it was pointed out by the auditor that his reports were final, and that if further information w it h respect to accounts was required, this should be obtained from the companies direct. that auditor? The mittee; but when the Treasurer of the day (Lord Porrest) asked for further information, like the man playing cricket, the umpire gave him "" out""; and he was out. He was told that the report submitted was final, and that if he required further information he must seek it from the company. Although the Commonwealth Government are partners in the matter, they can go a certain distance, but no further. They are up against a stone wall. It seems to me that some further supervision is required in regard to-the wool tops contracts. The honourable member for South Sydney( Mr Riley), who is interested in the industry because it isestablished in his electorate, and the honourable member for Capricornia, who has a close knowledge of it, are quite satisfied It was provided that some control other than that which we have now should be established over it. We shall not be doing our duty to the 'taxpayers if we do not properly safeguard the Commonwealth activities which have been called into operation during the war.

416,Mr Yates,"The Central Wool Comagenient of the Pool;, but this matter of wool tops manufacture is a transaction in which the Commonwealth Government are associated with people who are making f a i r l y substantial profits. The honourable member for Capricornia, backed up by the honourable member for Dampieri n very temperate but convincing language, has made out a good case for the Commonwealth Government exercising more control over these contracts, and if we are to do our duty to the taxpayers, we. should agree to the amendment. [10.18] -The proposition of the honourable member for Capricornia ( Mr Higgs) is not as innocent as it might appear to be on the face of it. Whether the Wool Committee was right or wrong in making the agreement with these wool-top manufacturers, and in inserting in it certain provisions for auditing, Parliament would be entirely wrong, the -agreement having been made,' in legislating with the object of breaking it . It is singular that from the time when the Hon. J. C Watson became a member of the board of directors of this company it has been subjected to a constant and relentless fire from the' Opposition in this chamber. Time after time the most serious charges have been made against the persons responsible for the management of the comagreement? pany, only to be refuted in the most solemn way a few days afterwards, and have taken half the profits. From what then to be followed by equally grave other industry in the country have they charges, equally unfounded. had another instance of this to-night. to take half the profits of this firm, and The honourable member for Capricornia a not of any other? few days ago came down with a statement regarding the reasons for the comcontract? pany being reformed. He was met by the sworn affidavit of the oflicial liquidathe contract was forced upon them by the tor of the company, which refuted his refusal of the Central Wool .Committee statement at every point. To-night he to allow them to carry on their business comes along w i th an explanation of the unless they agreed to it .

In the course of his f u l l y performed to the satisfaction of the statement to the Committee, he saidJapanese firms concerned. seen the original letters from those members who have been supporting the firms in Japan, expressing the utmost satisfaction with the. way in which the contracts have been carried out; yet the honourable member would have us believe that people who had to pay more than twice as much for their wool are still satisfied to deal with the person who worked that swindle on them. I know nothing of the circumstances beyond what is in the affidavit, and I know little about the internal management of P. W. HughesL t d . But what I reseut about the whole business-and in this I am in accord with the objection to some of the methods .of the chairman of the Central Wool Committee-is that the firm has been singled out for treatment that has not been attempted towards any other firm in the Commonwealth. I am not here to j u s t if y the profits made by this concern; but if the Government are prepared to take the profits made by the firm during war time, because they are excessive, their duty is"" to take the profits of every other firm in the Commonwealth made in similar circumstances.
